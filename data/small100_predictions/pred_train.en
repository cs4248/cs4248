28-year-old chef found dead in a store in San Francisco
A 28-year-old chef who just moved to San Francisco recently was found dead in the stairs of a local store this week.
But the victim's brother said he didn't know who would want to hurt him and said "It's finally going well.
The San Francisco Body Inspection Office said the body found on Wednesday morning at the West Side Shopping Center was confirmed by a 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia.
The police officer of San Francisco said the death case was sentenced to kill him and is under investigation.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told the U.S. radio station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously served as a streamline chef in Boston, found an ideal job for a streamline chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman at Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were “very shocked” over Frank’s death.
“We are a small group of people who live together like a family without intimate, and we will deeply miss him.
In this painful moment, we express our deep condolences and condolences to Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank was living in the hostel at the beginning, but recently “Everything has finally gone well.”
Louis Galicia told KGO: “Frank found an apartment while talking with a girl.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine who would want to hurt his brother.
Frank has a good heart and a wide heart.
Louis Galicia says: “Frank often cooked dinner for his family.
He never wanted to argue with his family.
He is a person who follows the opinions of everyone.
Louis Galicia said: “Everything in the world may be wrong, but Frank is known to be an out-of-the-art show that shines every day.”

Primary doctor strike: call for new labor action
Primary doctors' representatives have called on the Alliance to approve its new labor action against new contractual disputes.
The British Medical Association’s primary doctor’s committee will ask all its members to start supporting more labor operations since early September.
The primary doctor’s committee said the ministers did not resolve concerns about the contract.
Early doctors and medical students voted in July against a contract with the British Medical Association.
Of the members who participated in the vote, 58% were opposed to the deal.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Primary Medical Committee, said in a letter to membership on Twitter on Thursday night that the government has “always remain silent on issues that led to the contract’s resistance.”
“Given this, the Executive Committee of the Primary Doctor’s Committee has voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and call for a new formal consultation on all concerns.
With regard to the government's silence, the Executive Committee of the Primary Doctors has today officially requested the Council of the British Medical Association to hold a special meeting to approve a long-term plan of upgrading labor operations from early September.
The dispute has led primary doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the first full strike in the history of the British national healthcare system.
Dr. Johann Malawana, senior doctor leader of the British Medical Association, resigned after the provisions of the contract protocol recommended by the British Medical Association were voted against.
In a meeting before 54,000 primary doctors and medical students voted, he told members of the British Medical Association that the transaction was good and therefore should be accepted.
After the vote, health minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be compulsory to be implemented by British healthcare personnel.
Russia and Turkey: Do not join the alliance?
One step ends a crisis.
Russia met Turkish leaders on Tuesday, holding hands and announcing a formal end of an eight-month oral war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin welcomed the President of Turkey in a magnificent hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I had a strong feeling: this reconciliation was what Ankara wanted to see.
Yes, both sides are really holding hands.
However, even in accordance with Mr. Putin’s standard, Putin was just a smiling smile, and almost no intention of enthusiasm.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been referring to Putin five times as a “good friend”.
I do not remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia will return to the level before the crisis, even higher.
The next day, a newspapir wrote that Mr. Erdogan appears as if nothing had happened.
But I think his enthusiasm suggests something opposite.
However, Mr. Putin’s continued cooler attitude suggests he has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in the opening ceremony was the reason for the crisis: Turkey dropped a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction was strong.
Mr. Putin attacked the incident, accusing Ankara of hiding behind Moscow.
Attacks from so-called friends are more unacceptable.
It is difficult, and it is impossible to rebuild true trust.
Since November, the opinion of the Russian people has also been reversed.
For months, government-controlled media have made a shocking full-force attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
The worst of them is the accusations from senior officials: Mr. Erdogan’s family profited from illegal oil transactions in a so-called Islamic State-controlled Syria area.
He has firmly denied that claim.
However, news from St. Petersburg show that it is time to look forward.
After all, the prerequisite for the meeting was to be accepted by Putin's apologies from President Erdogan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.
First of all, Erdogan was resigned after the failed coup last month, so he needed the support of all his friends.
The continued terrorist attacks obviously have caused a great impact on him.
There are also economic motivations.
Russia’s sanctions have great impact on Turkey, especially forbidden packaging services that can ship millions of Russian tourists annually to the Turkish coast.
This figure has dropped dramatically by almost 90%.
As flight returns, Russian travel agencies and packaging companies will have to relax.
They will meet the Mediterranean tourism streams at the end of the season.
National TV even predicted this week that the prices of fruits and vegetables will fall once Turkey’s imports of agricultural products are re-lipped.
Moscow newspaper Vedemosti said: “Tourists have gone, tomatoes have returned.
For Moscow, the visit has an additional political value.
Ankara is angry about the weak reaction of the western world to the intentions to take over.
Furthermore, Ankara is not satisfied with the slow progress in EU accession negotiations and the long-term involvement of Putin, and Putin is enthusiastic about using political freedom and weakening Turkey's relations with the western world.
Due to the support of elected authorities after the coup failed, the Russian leaders will receive an increase in Ankara.
Note that this is a donation to Moscow, which has always been deeply rooted in fear of the regime.
Therefore, the meeting held at this glorious shore palace made Russia and Turkey allies of the two countries rejected and abused by the western world, an analyst described it as "GGG not into the alliance".
However, despite public reconciliation, there are still significant differences between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors: Moscow has recently played a role as an agent in Syria, while Russia and Turkey support the opposite group.
It is predictable that after almost three hours of preliminary talks, the two presidents said at the conference that they had not discussed the topic yet.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided the issue of two-way differences, while Putin stressed.
The two parties have not reached a clear consensus on how to seek co-existence in Syria.
With the possibility of the months of open hostility and major disasters brought by Turkey by the member states of the North Atlantic Convention, re-establishing dialogue between the two countries is definitely a good thing.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland
According to the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank will be simplified into a logistics department.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Ross McJean told the British Broadcasting Company Scotland branch that the Scottish Royal Bank brand was once committed to its global ambition.
But eight years ago, the threat was closed, and he had to accept rescue since then abandoned this pursuit.
At that time, brand strategists used ‘RBS’ to protect other consumer financial brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds to sponsor international sporting events, such as Olympic Six National Games and Wimbledon Tennis Championship Andy Murray.
But now, the right practice is to bring more national brands to the top.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but will not respond to the same.
In England and Wales, all exchanges in the headquarters and securities will be changed to the National Symphony Bank.
The Alster Bank brand has been used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and the Autonomous District of Northern Ireland.
There are also some other more prominent smaller private bank brands, such as Consultancy Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McJean had been interviewed during a visit to clients and employees from Venice County.
He told the Scottish branch of British Broadcasting Corporation, “The Scottish Royal Bank brand will eventually become our investors brand and also one of the employees employed brands, as we now have become a bank with many brands.
As the bank itself became an international brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now, I mean, we are no longer focused on the world, we have turned our eyes to our homeland.
Each brand represents different industries and our employees serve customers through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has stated that it won’t continue to sponsor six countries tournaments, and at the same time has been trying to enhance the image of various brands sponsoring at sports events.
The CEO said: “It’s time to become a multi-brand bank because we’ve been looking for how to become a bank that’s better service to customers.
If three years ago we wanted to become a big bank with many brands, it would be ridiculous.
We are currently focusing on customer needs and I believe you have noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands, and now is the right time.
Deuteronomy has achieved a career 3,000 wins in New York City with Predilection
New York City's two victories helped Daughters get a career 3,000 victories, after he celebrated champagne.
On Friday, professional horse rider Frankie Dettori won his 3,000 victory in Newmarket.
He planned the Predilection, handed by John Gosden's horse trainer, winning two victories that night, also achieving a career of 3,000 victories.
This 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional horse rider to reach this mileage in the field of Pineapple.
The top five are: Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Earlier winning three championships at Ghayyar, Doy Turi said: “It’s special.
I am excited because my family is there.
I am pleased with my achievement in New York City because I started here 30 years ago.
It was not a massive race, nor the Royal Ascot, which was just a regular Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I am pleased and humble too.
Deuteronomy brought the Predilection after the victory, which caused the whole joy.
In the field of obstacle racing, two riders achieved this achievement, respectively, the champion ridder Richard Johnson and the now resigned 20 champion Sir Anthony McCoy, of which Sir McCoy won more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Berger was the ninth German champion in his career and won 4,493 victories in the Czech Republic.
Deuteronomy was one of the greatest ridders of contemporary times, so it was not surprising that he achieved this milestone achievement, and there were few people who achieved that achievement before him.
He was fashionable and well-known, but it was his tactical reason to make him stand out in the heavens.
He is an excellent ambassador of horse art, and over the years his enthusiasm and charm has attracted a lot of fans to the sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Daughters at Epsom that if he was not just a weekend rider, he would have already been able to win 6000 victories!
Indeed, it is too important to say that DeToury is the best winner of the British horse art in the past thirty years.
His character is vibrant, which is good for the British horse race, but in addition, he is an incredible rider.
DeToury celebrates this milestone with its symbolic jumping under the horse.
From the jumping line to the jumping down the horse, for twenty years, Daughters have been a typical representative of the British racing field.
His career was like a car in general.
He won several competition champions, including the famous "seven winners" at the British Royal Escocia Championship in 1996, but he also suffered crashes and was also banned for use of drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned to the field after the end of a six-month prohibition period, he had been very excited. However, he showed amazing character advantages and finally returned to the peak, giving those who have doubts.
He may not have been able to do it too long — Daughters had said before he hoped he could at least be able to play until he was 50 years old.
Russian President Putin resigned from office director Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed as director of the President’s Office of Sergei Ivanov.
For years, Mr. Ivanov has been a part of the core group in which Mr. Putin is deeply confident.
Ivanov, 63 years old, has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin’s statement said Mr. Putin had “annunciated the release of Ivanov’s office director of the Russian President’s Office,” but did not give a reason.
Anton Vaino, who started working as Mr. Ivanov’s vice president in 2012, was appointed his receiver.
He is 44 years old and is a former diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow National Academy of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he managed the President’s draft and government staff, the Kremlin website (using Russian) as said.
After he was appointed, he said to Mr. Putin: “Thank you for your trust.
I think the most important task of this government is to support the heads of state drawing laws and implementation of control directives.
Mr. Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov himself requested his resignation and recommended Mr. Vino to take his office.
Is such a smile convincing?
Moscow is misunderstood about this.
Sergey Ivanov has long been one of Putin's most intimate assistants and, like Putin, has also worked in the Soviet Security Agency (KGB).
As office director, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcasted by the State Television, both said that the head of the office had requested his resignation.
Despite the smile in front of the film, almost no one was convinced – especially before the parliamentary election.
So, did this lead to a failure in some power struggle?
Not yet known.
However, the official statement — an election of a president candidate — suddenly choosing Russia’s environmental policy — raised many doubts.
The Kremlin website cited Mr. Ivanov’s conversation with Mr. Putin, saying: “Yes, in the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me this difficult job, even a difficult job, a four-year term.”
“The result is that I have been the President’s Office Director for four years and eight months.”
Mr. Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that he served as Vice Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council, as well as Mr. Putin, and a former member of the National Security Agency.
At the end of the 1990s, when Mr. Putin was appointed director of the Federal Security Agency (FSB, formerly the National Security Agency), Mr. Ivanov was appointed as his vice president.
After Mr. Putin took office, he also appointed Mr. Ivanov as one of his five most trusted people.
The outside world once thought Ivanov could be president of Russia after the end of Putin’s second term, because it was violating the constitution.
But this post eventually belongs to another close assistant of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
After three and a half years, Mr. Putin served as Prime Minister of Russia.
Mysterious Fish Surprise Banff A Garden
Banff’s resident found a fish shocked in his garden and asked for help.
Kevin Bain believes that these 75 fish may be a sandwashed by sea dragons.
Mr. Bain lives around 500 meters from the sea, and he posted a video of this strange scene on Periscope hoping someone could explain why these two-inch fish appear to him.
Queens Ferry Bridge is now opened to FAF.
The project worth £13.5 billion was completed in May 2017.
The engineers have linked the north side of the Queensferry Crossing and the high-end bridge, that is, the bridge has now passed to Faff.
The “bridge winding machine” located near the three bridges of each bridge is now close to completion, and the project is the first bridge of the bridge.
This bridge starts at Faff, which was 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It used 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 rods.
The project worth £135 million was scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and became one of the first people to climb the bridge.
He said, “This is a historical moment in the construction process of the Queensbury Bridge.”
We all have witnessed the engineering work on such a massive project that the construction of the bridge used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel.
Despite the size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the dragon between the high-range bridge and the bridge surface requires careful operation and a very accurate installation.
Overall, almost 79% of the total bridges are now installed and the last concrete bridges on the bridges are put on Rosyth today, that is, all bridges are ready for positioning.
Michael Martin, Project Manager of Queensbury Bridge Construction Company, said: “No matter which bridge project, the first dragon is a major milepæl.”
For the great project, this joint showcases the advanced civil engineering technology.
After installing the last road panel and connecting it to the expanded North Bridge Road panel, it is necessary to complete the remaining gap on the north side or near one side of the land.
To complete the operation, it was necessary to move 700 millimeters from the north to the south of the bridge.
This is a large-scale task, and at the same time a very accurate task.
Saying that it is huge, because the high bridge is 222 meters, weighing about 6,000 tons, requires to pull a inclination of approximately 3%.
To say it is accurate, because the engineering team needs to ensure that the deviation is very small, with only a few millimeters each side.
The pleasant thing is that everything went well.
Simon Bayles picked up female gymnastice champion
Forget the pressure.
Forget to cook.
Simone Biles is not affected by all of this.
Dynamic when jumping.
The balance of the tree is too much.
Free exercise is amazing.
The overall performance is excellent.
Now he finally became an Olympic champion.
This 19-year-old American gym athlete picked up the All-Power Championship on Thursday, fully showing her talent to lead the world in bodybuilding at the Olympic field.
She won a total score of 62,198 over silver medals, the final five teamman Ali Raisman and the bronze winner of the Russian player Aliya Mustafina.
Simon-Biles from the United States held a balanced tree performance at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Bayers helped the American team to accomplish four rounds in women’s Olympics, and she personally won five medals at the Olympic Games, further proofing that she is this generation, and possibly the best bodybuilder ever.
When she saw her total division, Bayers couldn’t stand in tears, and she finally ended this long journey.
Bayers is therefore in the series of "Decades of Athletes" like Michael Phelps, who raised sports projects in their fields to a new height:
Bayles has been named the champion in the past three years and won 15 World Championship medals, including ten gold medals. She is trying to train every day to higher accuracy. 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said: "Bayles is the best bodybuilders I've ever seen.
There is a final match in Brazil, but the match with it is said to be a competition between Bayers and other gymnastics, rather than the difference between her herself and the huge expectations pressure.
If Bayers didn’t get a gold medal back to her home in Spring, Texas, everyone would be very disappointed.
Simon Bayles (left) and Lesman, from the United States, won gold and silver medals respectively at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August.
Bayers won the first gold medal on Tuesday, giving a surprise to the rejoicing national team coach Martha Karolyi.
Although Bayers insisted that he had not planned the future during the year-round occupation of the Championship throne, the fact is not exactly the case.
A part of Bayles’ free gymnastics—including her symbolic swing line—combined with Latin music, which she often heard in her home just one street away from the Rio Olympic Stadium.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by grandparents during a childhood and found by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman during a field exploration trip in the gym, has now grown into a mid-power.
Since the summer of 2013, Bayers has not been losing in all-power competition, and she is sure to win if she wants to win.
Just a little ahead of Mustafa after two rounds is just an illusion.
Balancing tree and free gymnastiks two projects Coronation World Champion Bale is waiting to be buried.
Her balance tree score 15.433, free gym score 15.933.
As he was waiting for the final comparison, Lesman slightly swallowed by Bayers. When Bayers learned that he had achieved his dream, he left tears.
Lesman's performance was a bit like revenge for four years ago, when she was third, but lost to Mustafa in the final.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, named by the American drama, is far ahead.
She kissed the crowd after the end of free gymnastics and announced her return, but this return sometimes seemed to be questionable before.
Byrz is only 19 years old.Since this week, her news has been virally spread on Twitter.For Byrz, her life has been given a whole new meaning.
6-year-old Mahaj Brown survived a fire attack in Philadelphia
Police said a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, which is also the second six-year-old child shooting in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child who was shot was Mahaj Brown.
They said brown’s abdomen, legs, arms and abdomen were wounded, but the child was awake during the medical journey.
“He has been guilty and a small body is shot by a bullet,” his grandmother Delores Melendez told TV.
I just don’t dare to believe.
The boy is in the hospital and has been operated several times.
His family told the television that the child was hoping to recover.
He was going to start a secondary school at a local primary school.
Brown was one of the four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Two of the other three who were shot were 29 years old and one 32 years old.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims is in crisis; two other victims are stable.
Television said the child and the 29-year-old victim were found on the front seat.
Two other victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether there were a sniper among the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like several shooters were shooting.
A large number of offensive weapons were found on the site, which suggests that they used different offensive weapons.
Therefore, it is unquestionably a continuous war.
On both sides of the street there are balloon shells.
“Therefore, we can see how many armed people were in extreme warfare at the time,” Philadelphia police chief Anthony Ginaldi told TV.
Many houses and vehicles were damaged in the area.
There is no arrest yet, and police are allegedly watching surveillance videos.
On Tuesday, a six-year-old boy (a girl) was shot in his arms while playing at the door of his home in the West Oak Lane community.
She is currently recovering and police are still pursuing the suspects.
Why we need Simon, Gabriel and Laurie?
This is how I evaluate the women’s Olympic team this year for more than one reason.
First, since 1984, I have been at every summer Olympics, but the United States has never occupied such a dominant position.
Second, the team has three outstanding bodybuilders – Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Laura Laurie Hernandez – who have always inspired a lot of colorful girls.
The composition of the team made everyone proud, because it included the Jewish Ali Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
The team finally looks like the American team.
It also consolidated the top position of black and Latin women in the movement.
Over the past four years, the leading female bodybuilders have been Afro-Americans.
Last year, Simon and Gabriel ranked the first and second place.
This is too strong.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabriel Douglas was “surprisingly” an Olympic champion, which delighted the United States.
Today, the world’s three world champions Simon Bayles, Douglas and Laurie Ernades are able to see the wonderful performance of Yellen.
On Thursday, Simon helped the U.S. team to accomplish four rounds on women’s personal all-power project.
Her team friend Ali Lessman won a silver medal.
We reached the peak of this sport, but it was not the case in all American gymnastics classes.
Simon, Gabriel and Laurie were the same way to enter the Olympic team as Ali and Madison.
They are the Final Five, as the next Olympic gym will be composed of four bodybuilders, which is Marta Karolyi’s last year trained.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly exercise, and athletes train mainly in private gym clubs, where their parents need to pay for training, facilities, trips, clothing, competitions and hotel fees (including related fees for coaches and gym athletes and families), and the cost list is growing.
Most fitness clubs are located in the rich suburbs that can support the industry.
All training for fitness athletes is completed in these clubs, which is a long-term expensive cost for the family of fitness athletes.
Bayers’ coach Aimee Boorman and Ernads’ coach Maggie Haney have been trained them since these two gymnastics began to practice.
We need to bring more affordable, more affordable gymnastics to countless young girls who are deeply affected by Simon, Gabriel and Laurie.
20 years ago, I founded my own bodybuilding foundation.
In my organization, we offer free and cheap gymnastics to more than 15,000 city youths (mostly black and Spanish Americans) in the Black Residential Area and train national and world champions.
In September, we will expand the Ultimate Truth (my homeland) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this opportunity to learn and benefit from this wonderful Olympic sport.
Exercise helps develop the body’s strength, flexibility and coordination, and also helps develop the spirit, autonomy and determination of persistence.
These can bring lifelong benefits to a person’s health, academic and work success.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sports is important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting moment.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabriele, and Madison for the “Girl’s Power” which have been greatly demonstrated in winning the Olympic team’s gold medal, as well as for encouraging young girls from so many backgrounds to open the path to health, strong and success.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, primary doctors plan to start further strike
Ministers initially wanted to end the dispute caused by the change by accepting a contract that was modified by the British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58% of the 37,000 primary doctors who participated in the vote were opposed to the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract, saying the UK National Health Service System (NHS) is currently in a “vacuum zone” and a little delay would harm the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract first mentioned changes to primary doctors’ work practices overnight and weekends to improve care conditions for abnormal working hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Primary Doctors Committee, said in a statement: “The primary doctors are still serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially concerned that it would aggravate the current labour crisis and failure to treat all doctors equally.
It’s only eight weeks from the first doctors signing the new contract and we need to make progress, less time.
BMA strives to resolve disputes through negotiations, but everyone is not willing to participate, and sometimes the government responds silently.
Nevertheless, the last month we still received a promise from Jeremy Hunt, saying his doors are always open.
“Jeremy Hunt now needs to take action, abolishing forced execution and solve the worries of primary doctors.”
If he did not do that, the primary doctors clearly said they were ready to take further labor action.
The last strike occurred at the end of April, resulting in delayed almost 13,000 regular surgeries and 100,000 scheduled cases as nurses and clinics covered the doctors on the check line.
Ministers initially wanted to end this change-provoked dispute by accepting the BMA-modified contract.
BMA hopes to seek better weekend wages for 54,000 primary doctors involved in the contract.
NHS Employers Chief Executive Officer Daniel Mortimer urged primary doctors to do no strike again.
Mr. Mortimer said: “The labor operations are less effective, but instead will create pressure on the teams and services that have already been focused on, causing concerns, concerns and confusion of patients, nursing staff and their families.
Over the past two months, we have been continuously negotiating with the Committee of Primary Doctors and actively responding with the Ministry of Health and other departments to their concerns about the role of guardian and reporting.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics such as deployment, flexibility in training, other training, training costs for those who go back after a career break, common awareness of programmes, repairs and gender wages differences in healthcare fields, which indicate the importance of employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health on the agreements concluded with BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
The relevant officials recommended that a drug of £2 per day should be promoted to more patients and to extend the time of taking the drug, and then thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from the drug.
Anticagrelor can reduce the risk of recurring heart disease in patients with heart disease.
The drug is taken for 12 months after a heart attack, which can reduce the risk of stroke or heart attack again.
The National Institute of Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE) of the UK’s National Health Service System (NHS) regulatory authority recommends patients to continue taking the drug for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
But now, the NHS regulator NICE recommends patients to continue taking the drug for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
In England, approximately 140,000 people have heart disease each year, and one-quarter of them continues to experience heart disease recurrence or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by fatty substances forming spots in the arterial walls.
If the spots are broken, it will cause blood clots, thereby blocking blood flow to the heart, leading to a heart attack.
If the bloodstream moves, it enters the bloodstream, blocking blood flow to the brain, leading to stroke.
Patients who have experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of a heart attack again.
It is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca, for sale under the brand name Brilique, which can reduce the risk of disease by reducing the formation of blood clots.
Today, the NICE Guidelines draft recommends patients taking 90 mg of CAGRA for 12 months, and taking 60 mg of CAGRA and two times daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite effective secondary preventive therapy, up to one-quarter of patients who have had a history of heart attack will have a recurrence or stroke, which usually lead to severe consequences.
Fear of recurrence can have a great negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence suggests that taking a substitute with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of recurrence of heart disease and stroke in patients who have experienced a heart attack.
The temporary recommendation for Kagray will provide more treatment options for thousands of beneficiaries, and we are deeply delighted.
Due to limited information on the effectiveness and safety of Kagra after three years, especially the risk of bleeding, the draft guidelines does not recommend continuing treatment after that period.
Computer culture makes “election fraud” spread in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was chastised for corruption last year, encouraging the publication of a government report.
The culture of “political correctness” has ignored the widespread election fraud of the Muslim community, a deadly government report reveals today.
Former Cabinet Secretary Sir Eric Pickles accused police, election regulators and municipalities of ignoring evidence of abuse of elections for “excessive sensitivity to ethnic division and religious issues”.
The former Community Affairs Minister, the current anti-corruption leader, said the practice of intimidating voters from religious positions would have been badly affected, and the police should be allowed to set up a warning line outside the vote stations to protect the wicked voters.
He advised the voters to carry their identity when they vote to confirm their identity.
Currently, voters have to give their names and address.
The report even suggests painting unwashable ink on the fingers of the voters to prevent anyone from voting for a second time.
Sir Eric said the protection of reporters should be increased.
He urged the media to increase understanding of the conference documents and decisions taken by the non-official committees or working groups.
“This is not just to prevent election fraud, but to protect local governments from a wide variety of corruption culture and the poison of financial fraud that is closely linked to it,” he said.
The report was published after the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London, which was requested by Donning Street.
Last year, a special election court ruled that there were a series of corruption and illegal acts in the Mayor Rahman, which should be rebuilt.
The court found that Rahman “very ridiculously abused” of the religious emotions of the Muslim community and spoke to his sword indicating his allegations of racial discrimination and Islamic terrorism.
Rahman was said to declare his vote during his election as a religious duty of faithful Muslims.
Up to 300 votes are suspicious, and the voters may be deceiving others to vote.
Sir Eric said there is evidence that there is election fraud in the country.
He was especially warned by mailing election fraud and allegedly pressing senior members of the Muslim community on the voters to force these voters to vote for the candidates they designated.
Sir Eric (pictured) gave several suggestions about cleaning voting mechanisms, including carrying good identity documents to confirm his identity.
“The evidence shows that senior members, especially senior members of the background communities in Pakistan and Bangladesh, put pressure on vulnerable groups of ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote according to their own will.
Because they are too sensitive to ethnic division and religious 'political correctness', they are concerned that national institutions will ignore such behavior.
Sir Eric proposed 50 proposals to clean up election mechanisms, including a strict prohibition for political activists to handle mailing voting documents to block “vote collection”.
The report also requires strict registration information to prevent voter lists from being used in immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa May also considers the report.
These recommendations include asking voters to present their identity documents before voting.
After voting, paint unwashable ink on the fingers of the voters to prevent anyone from voting for a second time.
Systematic verification of the nationality of voters to ensure voting qualification.
The validity of an automatic mailed vote request is limited to three years.
It is prohibited by political activists and radicalists from handling completed mail votes and mail votes.
Authorized police to establish a alarm line around the vote stations.
Amendments to the legal provisions make it easier to accuse concerned of threatening persons under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Photographing at the vote stations is illegal.
The provisions are available in English only (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff strictly implement the provisions of "Votors go to the vote hall alone".
Sir Eric rejected the Metropolitan Police, saying they did not submit any criminal charges after the Tower Hamlets incident, which was "shocking."
"Rahman and his election director have been there a lot of corruption and illegal acts, and therefore have been sentenced by the Election Court's revocation," he said.
According to the criteria of criminal proof, he is undoubtedly guilty in many ways.
He also criticized the municipality’s election registration department as well as the existing “selection box inspection”.
Sir Eric said: “The last year’s judgment against Tower Hamlets made the alarm clock to everyone.
Our country has a glorious tradition of the “mother of the parliament,” but some institutions have confidently touched election fraud and the consequences of this good reputation, which also threatened.

CBC Olympic Explainers Apologizes For Chinese Swimming Athletes “Slow Like a Pig”
On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald annoyed audiences watching Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) live broadcasting on the Olympic Live Live on the 14-year-old General Eve, including women’s 4x200m free swimming competition.
A Canadian Broadcasting Company CBC an interpreter said the 14-year-old Chinese swimming boy would "swim faster than smell when they depart," but finally "as slow as a pig," after CBC was forced to apologize for it.
Speaker Byron McDonalds published some of his opinions at the end of the female 4x200m free swimming competition finals when he thought his microphone was turned off.
The audience heard the CBC explanation team, Byron, who commented on the player, said: “The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake.
Because of being too excited, they swim faster than smell differs when they start off, but later as slow as the pigs.
It is very thanks to her.
This year's 14-year-old Chinese swimming player, Eve, was the second tournament, taking 1 minute 57 seconds 79 – behind Canadian Taylor Ruck 1.61 seconds, which caused the Canadian team to shorten the gap with China.
The entire Canadian audience was surprised by the speaker’s voice and words, and they quickly responded on the web.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “The CBC-interpretator says a 14-year-old Chinese swimming athlete ‘slowly like a pig’?”
The fool did not realize it was broadcasting.
A Chinese general, who participated in women’s 4x200m free swimming competition, was described as this: “The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake.
Twitter's criticism of Byron McDonalds quickly came over on Twitter, and many have asked him to withdraw from his explanation.
When Twitter users heard that Byron McDonalds was delayed in response to this, they didn’t stop about it.
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: “Wow #Bayern McDonalds.
You represent CBC and Canada, and your behavior makes us all sound like a group of racists.
Shortly later, CBC’s chairman Scott Russel apologized for Byron’s speech in live broadcasting, saying: “We apologize for comments on live swimming players’ performance.
“We apologize for such an inappropriate statement.
CBC apologises 90 times to Twitter users who responded to the statement.
Scott Russel also apologized for Byron.
CBC then replicated their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who protested by Byron
The channel also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We are very sorry for saying this and broadcasting it out.
Last night we took action quickly to apologize to our audience watching our live broadcasts and to our audience on social media.
It is necessary to explain that Byron's explanation was aimed at the performance of the swimmer, but not on her person.
That is, the word is not correct, and Byron is deeply sorry for it.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized in a live broadcast saying his words don’t mean half a human attack and tried to escape his speech.
“I would like to take some time to apologize for myself last night after the end of the women’s competition,” he said on the CBC Olympics.
“I just comment on the performance of the swimmers, not on their own.
“Of course, I don’t mean disrespect, I’m sorry.
Primark’s customers express their anger on a woman who tried underwear without shame at the center of the store.
A woman tested the underwear at the center of a Primark store, and the customers in the store didn’t know where to look.
Worse, she also tried how she looked after dressing herself, and then pulled out the underwear and put it back to the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelf and finally tried four underwear in the shop in Bouverie Place in Folkestone.
The woman constantly tried underwear in this Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, and then returned the shelf.
Jenny Davidson (the mother of two children) in the store said that after trying to wear the underwear, the mysterious woman “wrapped the clothes again and then went out of the store and didn’t buy anything.”
She said, “No one can believe what they see.
She stood in the middle of the store, took the next underwear from the shelf, removed her clothes and underwear, and then dressed it.
"She didn't try to find a hidden place to try it - she just stood there, and it was shameful.
“When she pulled out the underwear again, everyone was surprised. obviously she was still unhappy because she drove the underwear back to the shelf.
After that, she tried three things, and finally found that they didn’t like her, and then dressed up again and went out of the store.
She does not seem to care about anyone looking at her - or never thought who would eventually buy the underwear she tried to wear.
Lady Davidson, 33-year-old, living in Kent, said: “It’s annoying to think someone would buy the underwear that others wear and have not been cleaned.
This happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: “After she left, the shopper obviously had to deal with these underwear.
“I hate buying a new underwear home, but I found that another woman tried it and didn’t have been cleaned.
Primark’s spokesman said: “Primark already knew what happened in our Folkestone store on August 9th.
All products with problems have been discounted.
How to use magic to protect yourself in a gun attack
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com may bring you a bit of security.
We ask Rhon Mizrachi, Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, to learn how to deal with murderers in close proximity.
Whether he is in front or behind you, the video will teach you how to turn to win.
Mizrachi said that if the sniper approaches you from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and “clean the fire line.”
Then stick the gun with the front arm and shoulders, and then hit the face of the attacker with your shoulders.
Then, with his knees on top of his abdomen, and when the attacker bends his body because of pain, turning his gun in his hand, hit his face with a pipeline and back gun group, holding the gun always against him.
If the sniper approaches from the front, a similar technique is also used – keep your body from within the range of fire lines, take the gun and turn the gun so that the sniper cannot fire.
At the same time, press the weight on the gun and hit the attacker's chest, and turn the gun from his tight hand, and then turn the gun towards him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video and see what Mizrachi really does.
But remember that if you are not a magical master, the safest way to get rid of the robbery is to give money.
A prostitute family destroyed a rented apartment in Saltash, Conworth, before being deported
A prostitute family, who was deported by intimidating neighbors, destroyed their rentals before leaving, resulting in losses of £50,000.
After a long series of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were deported from a rented apartment in Saltash, Conworth.
After being forced to be deported from the home, Housing Association officials were surprised to find that it was seriously damaged.
There were holes everywhere on the walls, the floor was broken, the trash was thrown filled with all, the walls were painted.
After being deported, the family continued to move and is allegedly living in a private housing.
Donna McEvoy, Housing Manager of Conville County Housing Association, said she was worried that the house could not be rescued.
She said, “It’s a nightmare for people living here and I don’t think people can live this way.
There is a lot of things to be balanced now, because this house is likely to be a poor element in Conval County.
The family is famous and their names are as famous.
The couple had three sons and they would live here from time to time. Police said the terrorists of the family included the use of baseball bands on the streets, threatening neighborhoods, drug use, drug trafficking, screaming, struggle and curse.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant named Skeldon received an anti-social behavior resolution.
In this house that could have been demolished, many of the rooms have been stored for a long time of garbage.
In the room that once traded drugs, the floor was lifted up.
Neighbors say they often saw them fighting on the streets, and they often told the police.
After giving them a 11-week extension to voluntarily relocate, the Conval County Housing Association forced her and her husband to leave her home this week.
The neighbors who are finally relaxed, are not pleased with this, and they say that the previous lives were just human hell.
A neighbor said, “They don’t care about anyone.
We have been in their neighborhood for 20 years and have been so bad.
We have seen the police coming into the door many times.
“This morning we can’t sleep.
We got up early because it was too quiet – we’re not accustomed to it yet!
They have finally gone, it’s nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of Conville County Housing Company District, said the family was not able to work well with the local government.
The family has lived in this house for 20 years and the police frequently visited.
Garbage and old toys were thrown on the side of the cheap rented grass jungle.
He added: “Unfortunately, the tenant has no responsibility for her behavior to his family, and expulsion is the ultimate practice considered by the Conville County Housing Association.
This is a very difficult case, because their behavior is very extreme, and what they do must make their neighbors feel terrible.
I would like to thank my team for the work, and also thank the police of Devin County and Conval County, as well as the community members who were courageous to provide us with information.
I hope that this action will bring some comfort to neighbors and communicate the message that we do not tolerate anti-social behavior.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said their three sons lived in the house at different times, but also said they were all over 20 years old.
After they were deported, one of the bedrooms was thrown a dirty pillow on the floor.
Housing Association Workers will quickly clean up the house into a bunch of garbage.
In 2014, police investigated the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, and also found tablespoons, drug addicts and £1,700 in cash.
After acknowledgement, Skeldon was sentenced for possession of Class B drugs and the intention of trafficking drugs.
She claims that the money was used to buy a cemetery for Lee Skeldon's son who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is known that after being homeless, Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of the rooms of the house are filled with paintings.
Police said they would deport tenants who violated the rule of tenants.
Angela Crow, from Dewan County and Conval County Police Office, said the deportation was a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rule of tenants.
“This warning is aimed at those who believe their behavior will not be blamed, as well as those who have been destroyed by this behavior,” she said.
Dewan County and Conval County Police will never tolerate crime and anti-social behavior, and they will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Reed: Hillary will nominate Garland to the Supreme Court if president is elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said he was convinced that if the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was elected as president, she would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have been blocking the confirmation of the Grand since Barack Obama appointed President in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said that the next president will be elected to replace the dead Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reed said at a telephone meeting on Thursday he predicted Hillary would choose a "some reliable" Garland.
A spokeswoman of Reed later said that Reed didn’t mean whether he would nominate Garland to speak directly with Hillary, and said he was just guessing.
He appreciated the Grand Gaga and said Hillary's team would not want to "make up" because of the new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge of the Federal District of Columbia Appeal Court.
Reed said the Republicans who blocked the nomination of Garland were the “pets” and “accomplishers” of the Republican president candidate Donald Trump.
He says Trump is not suitable to be president.
Treats: Naked Calendar "Men and Women Love"
The Treats magazine will collaborate with photographer David Bellemere to photograph a set of inspirations from the 2017 Calendar of Pirelli in the 1970s.

Women will be happy to participate in this film because it is a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit photo recruitment online, and they can also personally recruitment to public recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.

French court reject petition to dismantle shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court rejected the petition of the Gale government intends to dismantle dozens of shops and restaurants temporarily built in the “Jungle” refugee camp.
In a court hearing this week, the Government of Gale claimed that the French government should have the right to dismantle a total of 72 temporally built shops in the refugee camp. People sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, hairstyle services, and sell tea at a price of 50 cents (40 pents) or basic foods at a price of several euros in these shops in the refugee camp.
The Cabinet of Gale said these places should be dismantled because they are a non-tax-paid parallel economies, and there are also fire and sanitation threats.
But humanitarian groups have said these shops and restaurants are extremely important to the court because free food provided by state-supported associations and other groups is not at all able to meet the growing needs of refugees in the refugee camp.
These temporarily built shops and restaurants often provide shelters and free food for those in need.
A court ruled that there was no legal basis for expulsing the operators of the 72 temporary stores, but said Gale's concerns were "entirely comprehensible".
Judge Jean François Molla said these food stores, cafés and restaurants are far more than simply providing food to refugees who live in “extremely dangerous conditions”.
He said these places were a peaceful bonding point between refugees and volunteers.
One of the threats to dismantle is the Jungle Book Kids café in the refugee camp, which provides 200 food courses daily, English and French lessons, as well as counseling for hundreds of vulnerable minors in the refugee camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the cafe.
In a letter to Guardian, the closing of the cafe “will be a great disaster for these children (many of the children are only eight years old).
Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, two charitable organizations forecast on Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle refugee camps has reached 9000, which is the highest level since the number of refugees increased in summer.

For example, in 2015, Jiangsu Province's land development rate was up to 21%, the highest in the national provinces and autonomous regions.
Therefore, the problems of high pollution, high energy and multi-occupation have not yet been solved in a fundamental way from the transformation of productive lifestyle.
On the one hand, the creation of various ecological environments at all levels of Jiangsu province is ranked first in the country with absolute advantage; on the other hand, the resource environment carries great pressure.
Strictly promote ecological environmental protection and governance, it is necessary to promote the transformation of the production lifestyle from fundamentally to promote the transformation of human beings to the construction of ecological civilization.

Qingdao is the 12th city in the country and the first city of Qingdao province for payable use and trading pollution.

“Refunding the right to emitting pollutants is not equivalent to obtaining the right to illegally emitting pollutants.
Han Red Yuan, deputy director of the Qingdao City Environment Agency, stated that it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises to avoid penalties by purchasing waste rights if illegal pollution and supermarket pollution are still sanctioned in accordance with the relevant regulations.
That is, through legal means to strictly combat environmental illegal actions, to severely punish corporate supermarket pollution behavior, thus protect the environment and safeguard public health.
Now, for their own interests, the companies have increased pollution activity, appreciated limited pollution rights and reduced emissions of pollutants.
Drived by economic interests, reducing emissions of pollutants turns from government compulsory behavior to corporate conscious market behavior, thus truly achieving the purpose of protecting the environment, protecting nature and ensuring public health.
Emission rights are also referred to as “emission rights”, which refers to the right of emitting pollutants to the environment, in the extent distributed by the government, to the right of emitting pollutants to the environment.
This right is essentially the right of the pollutants to possess, use and profit of environmental capacity resources.
The next step is that, provided that the total emissions of pollutants do not exceed the permitted emissions, interconnective emissions between different sources of pollution within the way of exchange of currency.
Since introduced by American economist Dallas in 1968, the United States began to apply it to the management of the sources of pollution in the atmosphere and river in the 1970s.

On March 15, the Russian main military forces in Syria began to evacuate, but Russia pledged to continue to retain the air base in Hermim and the naval base in Tartus.

The two institutions have two accounts, unlike each other, to prevent village employees from participating in the collective asset operations of corruption phenomenon.
Jiangsu Province’s Deputy Director of Agriculture Commission, Zhejiang Pong, announced that Jiangsu’s next step will continue to promote community shares cooperation reform, encourage the joint development of farmers and establish a mechanism to operate democratic power at rural level.
To further advance reforms, to make community shares cooperation, to quantify assets to employees, to fix the farmers, to form clear ownership.
Through Internet+, implementing his rights to information, participation in decision-making and supervision of democratic governance, three rights implemented to the farmers, actually transforming it into the operating mechanism of normalized share cooperation.
Currently, the new collective economy of Sunan rural mainly forms four development models of asset rental, enterprise shares, agricultural development and joint development.

Xiamen Girl: “Hand-style beautiful” starts a shooting path career with “reverse”
A few days ago, Shenzhen Red, in the East Village of Xiamen, replaced his home’s 29 inch old TV with a 65 inch large TV.
The daughter of the ordinary farmer, Wang Yi, who won a silver medal in the 50m shooting three-way final for the Olympic Olympic Women in Rio on the 11th evening.
On the night of the 11th, just in front of this new TV, the couple and dozens of close friends, witnessed the daughter's way to go straight to a magical process that was eliminated from almost pre-match to almost a reversal.
In the same day’s game, Zhanggang went down to the ranking once and seemed far from the final.
But parents and family friends did not give up, continuously pressing the text live, seeing as the other players ended the game, Zhang Zhang's name was raised and finally locked the final seats, and his house broke out from a moment of joy.
In the final, Zhang Yong again was ranked back once, the last few shots were more stable and won a silver card with only 0.2 runs behind the champion.
This year, Zhang, who is 27 years old, has almost been wiped with this unlikely silver card several times during his 16 years of shooting career.
Her mother, Zhang, told reporters that just when they hesitate, Zhang Zhang had found a few “romantic guests” from the village.
These “romaners” were the village children who were also recommended to attend the training at the same time, including Zhang’s cousin.
Just after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Zhang again began to go back to the school of Xiamen for reasons such as family difficulties.
But after his illumination coach Zhang Azge repeatedly performed his work, Zhang Zhang returned to Xiamen team.
After entering the province, Zhang Zhang returned home once again because he couldn’t enter the national team late, and once again because he didn’t see hope.
This time, not only the coach Zhang, the leadership and coach of the Qingdao shooting sport center and the Fujitsu province came home and ultimately encouraged Zhang Zhang to return to the province.
Just like yesterday's game, the Yuan girl made a turn on the way of shooting with insistence.
“Every coach chooses a team different way, and when I saw Mr. Jing’s head was pretty, I immediately picked up Mr. Jing’s head.
Shenzhen Red also recalled that during the training test, the daughter won't get the best, but the number of rounds was stable, which is also an important reason for attracting the coach.
The most impressive in the training process of Zhang-Jong was the contribution of the farmer’s girl.
He recalled that Zhanggang entered the Shimon shooting team more than a year later, the team had a long-term shooting training, requiring the team not to move for a half hour.
Zhang Dong told reporters that the daughter has always been a quiet and intelligent child, who has loved painting and self-made toys since childhood.
“I’m going to make clothes at home, make clothes and make clothes supplements, and Mr. Jang will pick up some sides of colours to make a doll himself.
She said that her daughter often made her own handmade toys, along with her skill in painting, from doll's five offices to clothes, she can always look like a living.
As an athlete, Zhang and his family gathered less, and only on holidays they can get home, usually contacted by telephone.
Parents say, whether to meet or call, Zhang Zhang rarely talks about his own hardness, more than talking about fun things with his parents.
They usually do not see the daughters, and parents carefully stored in their home the paintings of their children's childhood and the honour of the past years.
Zhang Song showed her daughter’s animated comics to reporters: “If she wasn’t a shooting athlete, she should continue to paint.”
In the second floor of Zhang’s house there was a cabinet filled with medals, medals and certificates she received.
Chongdong Red placed the medals and medals complete, and the certificate unified in the folder stored, “these are all the honour of Gong's heart exchange for decades, we all appreciate Gong's heart.

According to Hong Kong’s East Journal on August 12, domestic diamond sales are currently referred to as three major issues, including the highest sales price of false diamonds, the weight of false diamonds, and no after-sales guarantees.
While Antwerp is one of the world’s largest diamond trading centers, the name of local craftsmen’s diamond cutting technique is full of heaven, the diamonds sold are strictly identified and are deeply welcomed by domestic lady.
“A small bag, holding in his heart, a small sculpture worth almost a million dollars,” Liu’s grandmother who participated in the sale of diamonds, described her experience in Antwerp in June this year to the domestic media.
She referred to herself in hiding diamonds in her underwear, having a toilet, a shower for several days in a row, and sleeping is very nervous.
She said the diamonds purchased in Antwerp were purchased at a price of about $55,000 per crat, and the same quality diamonds were sold at Xiamen at a retail price of $11,000.
She sold all of the diamonds that she purchased at the price of two percent earlier, making $20,000 in the same time.
According to the domestic customs regulations, diamonds are not passengers on the journey goods or essential goods, so belonging to the goods category, which must be declared when entering or otherwise listed as trafficking, the situation may be severely sentenced to imprisonment.
On 10th local time, the British Prime Minister, Donning Street, announced that British Prime Minister Theresa May would spend summer holidays to Switzerland, but no specific vacation location was revealed.
According to media, after the Brexit referendum, the new British prime minister chose to go to a "neutral country" Switzerland vacation on the mainland of Europe, with some policy symbolism.
The British Guardian commented that the symbolism represented by the neutral country of Switzerland played a role in the choice of the British Prime Minister's first holiday.
The British Daily Telegraph commented that Theresa May chose to go on vacation in Switzerland, the first time after Ms. Suther had a British prime minister to go on vacation in Switzerland.
The choice of two female prime ministers and two male prime ministers, Blair and Cameron, have formed a difference in the choices of holidays to the hotest places.
Britain’s new Prime Minister Theresa May will return to London on August 24 after waiting for her a series of important work and activities.
The British parliament will be reassembled on September 5 to discuss the second Brexit referendum online requested.

China’s Mars plan is coming.
Our Mars exploration mission is to be carried out at once, landing and navigation, such a form has never been abroad.
The aim of our Mars detection launch is to think about a step around, landing and navigation, and this mission is quite difficult.
Because Mars’s detection takes 26 months to meet a time window, experts are strictly developing engineering plans to launch our first Mars detector in this window in 2020.
Although our aircraft has already entered the deep sky, the completion of the Mars detection mission is still essential, and the detection of Mars means China in real sense enter the deep space detection era.
Every two or three years, there is only a chance for Mars to be the closest distance from Earth to launch a Mars detector at this time, which is the most energy-saving for the carrier of the rocket.
“Given the quality of the Mars detector, the launch mission will be completed by China’s long-range 5 missile.
Our country’s Mars detection mission is to be carried out once, landing and navigation, such a form that has never been abroad, have been carried out once abroad and have been carried out once, but landing failed.
There is a lot of technical fields involved in Mars detection, and the particular thing is that although Mars is a space detector, it also has clear characteristics compared to a general space detector.
That is, Mars detectors must have the ability to identify routes of travel and detect dangerous obstacles.
Chinese Space and Technology Group’s five-column researchers, Pong Xiao, said that human beings are so interested in exploring Mars because the exploration of Mars is important in science, technology, and even related to the future of human beings.
At present, Mars has become the highest level of human research outside the Earth, and the history of human use of space detectors to explore Mars across almost the entire human space history.
Therefore, mankind wishes one day to build a residential base on Mars and eventually immigrate to Mars, making it the second home of mankind.
A large number of signs also indicate that Mars was likely to be like the Earth's present, only after billions of years of evolution to become atmospheric subtle, lower temperatures, and exhaustion of water sources.
Therefore, the detection or human landing of Mars could suggest a preliminary proposal to prevent Earth from becoming a second Mars that is difficult to survive.
As of June 2016, a total of 114 moon observations have been conducted worldwide and 43 Mars observations.
However, since the 1990s, humans have performed 18 observations on Mars, while only 14 observations on the moon.
There are currently five Mars orbits and two Mars routers in operation, but only one Moon orbits and one Moon orbits are working.
The world’s space powers have developed a plan for detection aimed at the Mars system, which makes it clear that today’s detection is hoter than the detection of the moon.
On November 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars detector "Mangarian", becoming the first country in Asia to successfully explore Mars.
The “Mangarian” is used to study Mars’ surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics to find out whether there are signs of methane and life on Mars.
The hardest place for this mission is that the detector has only one chance to move into Mars’s atmosphere and reduce the speed of the parasol.
According to Sun Zeiya, general designer of Mars detector at China Space Technology Group’s 5th House General Department, the Mars detection mission is facing many technical challenges.
Mars’s atmospheric pressure is low and only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on Earth’s surface has high uncertainty.
Factors such as its changes and characteristics during storm, scientists do not yet have a comprehensive understanding.
Mars often forms dust similar to Earth’s dust weather in summer, which will lead to a sharp decrease in solar energy received by Mars cars and must be designed for the Mars cars a “sleep” mode, allowing them to wait patiently for the dust past.
At the same time, Mars’s atmosphere also has a reduction in the sunlight, which makes it difficult to supply energy for Mars’s detection.
This requires a larger area of the solar wings of the detector and needs to constantly adjust toward the direction of the sun.
Moreover, Mars’ surface gravity is only 38% of Earth’s surface, but is greater than the surface of the moon, so the detector needs greater power.
“The most core and hardest place for this Mars detection mission is the process of the detector entering the atmosphere after the atmosphere of Mars and slowing down the precipitation of the air, and there is only one chance to be sure to succeed.
SunZia said the whole process cannot be controlled in real-time by Earth because the distance from Mars is far from Earth, so it must be carried out independently by the detector.
Because there are not so many promotors to compensate for such high speed, when landing on Mars, the reduction depends on the role of the Mars atmosphere, but it is hard to simulate the Mars atmosphere on the ground.
In general, the way to detect Mars is similar to the way to detect the moon, it is also “round, fall, round, back” and ultimately achieving the goal of human landing on Mars.
Because Mars is far away from Earth than the Moon, detecting Mars requires a range of more complex technical difficulties.
According to Taiwanese media, the “Executive Director” Linchum announced yesterday morning “the political parties and its associated organizations are unworthy to obtain property processing regulations” into force today.
Vice-President of the National Party Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean-Jean
He stressed that if political parties, associated organizations or trusted administrators violate the provisions for the prohibition of sanctions, the Commission will investigate and punish “legally” in accordance with its competence.
Lin Hussein also declared an inappropriate election of the Vice-Chairman of the Party Production Committee, which will be served by the “Vice-Chairman of the Leopolitical Agency” Humbeggen.
He said he was not elected by the Chief Board of Directors of the Unfair Party Production Committee, and using the experience of Humbeggen’s past investigating major cases, it would serve as the basis for the Commission to investigate the relevant unfair Party Production cases.
He believes that today, as long as there is partisanity, no one will give you social donations, and if partisanity is fully removed, the National Party can just ask for social support and sponsorship, “there is really no chance to go today.”
He also stressed that even after the party productivity regulations are not fully filled and confiscated, the rest will still donate according to promises, allowing the party productivity to zero, and the party wants everything to start from zero.
Original title: "The Corridor Doctor" Range Up to the Central Vision Head of King Zhi An Honour violation of the right of the Court of Appeal
The Chief Executive Officer of the Legal Times, Wang Zhangyan, published a speech against the incident of the "coridor doctor" on the new wave microbot, and Lanking Peak appealed Wang Zhang and Beijing Microbot Technology Technology Co., Ltd. to the court.
Yesterday afternoon, the High Court ruled the case and ruled that Wangjiang and Micromo Company did not constitute an infringement, and rejected all the lawsuit requests from Langweather Peak.
In early 2014, the investigation of the CCTV reporter, Wang Zhang, found that despite sitting in the hospital corridor for over 600 days in the middle of the hospital, the media shaped as a sad hero of institutional oppression, these reports had a lot of false information.
On March 29, 2014, the program “The Corridor Doctor” produced by the Central Vision Press Survey was broadcasted.
The various so-called excessive medical information to the media has no evidence supported.
King Zhang also described in a real-name certified microbot, “The reason to take this step is a personality making, it has a clear paranoid personality, etc.”
Languages asked King Zhang to remove the microblog, apologize to him and compensate for mental damage for $100,000.
During the judgment, the two sides argued against whether King Zhanghyan violated the honorary rights of the Lantern Peak.
Day 12: The Chinese team is busy with four bicycles looking for breakthrough.
The bicycle is expected to accomplish the Olympic gold medal "zero breakthrough", while the female football girl will challenge the German team to win the world championship two times, waiting for a cold blow to the fourth.

Zhang Jin is considered to be a big late player who regret not getting a ticket for the last Olympic Games in London, but now stands proudly on the highest prize for the Olympic Games in Rio.
She won a gold medal in a female shooting match held at the Yosanna Avenue Stadium, Brazil, with a total score of 6-2 defeating German Lisa Onru.
She shot for the first time in the fourth grade of primary school, until she was 27 years old and won the first personal gold medal at the World Cup in 2014, as a later famous player.
Xi Jinping recalled: “There was no level before high school that I could not participate in competitions across the country.
Xi Jinping won only fourth place in the London Olympic Championships four years ago and lost an Olympic entry ticket and only seated to see his colleagues and friends to win two gold medals.
Xi Jinping talked about his own gold sensation after the end of the women shooting personally competition, “til the end of the shooting one shot as much as possible, it may have brought good results and heart satisfaction.”
The 28-year-old Korean shooter “One Sister” and the London Olympic shooter personally won the gold medal, Chihuahua, won a copper medal.
Chihuahua defeated Xi Jinping in the semi-finals and played a copper card against Mexican player Alejandro Valentina.
Chihuahua is well known in ensuring the tears after the copper medal, where silently suffered gold burden is imaginable.
First, the coach group has accumulated rich experience in continuous research, and then the methods of science training, which all need a long-term accumulation.
The shooters use military exercises, cross the cemetery at night, and help the team concentrate and maintain normal mind.
Although it has not been confirmed yet, many sources say Apple’s autumn 2016 release will be held in September and the iPhone 7 is coming.
While Apple did not respond, the new iPhone’s features and configurations have been continuously released, and even the iPhone 7’s real-time model images are available online.
The new generation of iPhones can be called “the people’s eye,” hot, fast, money-free... If you want to buy the original product for the first time, you need to choose a good channel, for example, Sunny.
This increases people’s disappointment with the new phones, “It’s extended but can’t project full-scale images at all!
Like any other iPhone, the iPhone 7 has been accompanied by numerous secrets before birth.
Additionally, several sources claim that the new generation of iPhone will cancel the 3.5mm headset interface, instead using Bluetooth connections and charging interface, which will provide space for Apple’s second speaker.
Another evidence to confirm this is that Apple already allowed headset manufacturers to produce headset products connected via a charging interface in 2014.
These messages, whether true or false, can be revealed until Apple’s autumn 2016 release.
But this doesn’t prevent the industry from seeing the prospects of the iPhone 7 – many believe that the iPhone 7 is likely to be the last significant upgrade of Apple to the iPhone series.
Although, according to data published by the market research agency IDC, the market share of iPhone has dropped.
Googlingins Apple’s shares in a “buy” rating, while BMO’s analysts believed that the iPhone 7 would have recorded a historical sales score.
Bottom line CEO Hock Tan also said Apple’s future revenue growth is likely to be more than 20 percent, which is entirely due to the launch of the iPhone 7.
7 percent of respondents said they intended to buy the iPhone 7, while only 4 percent of people planning to buy the iPhone 6 two years ago.
It is known that 20% of users currently holding iPhone 6 or 6Plus plans to buy iPhone 7, which is a fairly high proportion.
Second, there is an expert analysis that most of the fruit powder likes to replace their iPhone phones in generations.
Approximately 26% of all iPhone users have not replaced their phone for two years, that is, 1.2 million users have used the iPhone for two years.
According to media, Taiwan has suffered several earthquakes during iPhone7 production, “the damaged capacity of Taipei’s electricity production facilities is beyond imagination, and it is likely to have an impact on the initial iPhone7 supply.”
Supply contradictions will affect the average user, and it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low price comes to the original iPhone 7.
According to information, Sunny senior has recently frequently met Apple with the purpose of preparing adequate supplies.
The operator has already negotiated with Sunny, and it is predictable that with the deep cooperation of the two sides, it will bring lower prices and more pleasant services to the users.
“The lowest price, consumers could buy iPhone 7 for just $7 a day”
With sufficient supplies and a variety of offers, buying iPhone 7 is no longer “stressful,” while Sunny’s logistics will turn this beauty into a more intuitive experience.
Maybe you’ll get a call at midnight, “Hello, Sunny easy to buy, your iPhone 7 is coming to Yandex.
The organizers wish to give local people a greater understanding of historical Chinese culture through the exhibition of artefacts, thus enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

Recently, the Hobo Garden in Jiangsu Province of Jiangsu, Jiangsu Province, Jiangsu Province, is officially opened for villagers and visitors.
The park consists of more than 100 round swimming pools, planting about 300 varieties of observational flower, linen, etc.
The rural woods industry is observational, recreational and economic efficiency, becoming a highlight of local new rural development.
According to foreign media, because the water of the swimming pool becomes green from blue, the Rio Olympic “Green Pool” event has recently been attracted by the outside world’s attention.
However, in the morning of the 10th, the water in the water pool near the jumping pool also became green.
After the Australian waterball team, he said his eyes felt painful and wanted to flow tears.
Earlier, Rio Olympic officials confirmed the greenness of the pool and said the coloring of the pool was caused by alkali weakening and would not affect the health of athletes.
But the Australian athlete said he felt pain after winning a match with the Japanese team at the water pool.
Early after the sprinkle pool became green, the competition organizers addressed the problem of sprinkle pool on the night of the 9th, but the color of the pool also changed rapidly in the morning of the 10th.
During the competition with the Australian team, the environmental conditions of the pool were gradually worsened, but officially stressed they would restore the water quality of the two pools to their original color on 11th.
Rio Olympic spokesman Mario Andrada said: “Yesterday afternoon, the levels of alkaline water in the pool were weakened first.
“We have known a number of reasons that could cause swimming pool water changes, as well as hydrogen content.
The Water Sports Centre conducted a series of water quality tests, with hundreds of swimmers and swimmers used the swimming pool to determine the water quality conditions reached the standard.
“These days we have been doing normal procedures, but we may ignore the athletes the more likely to have an impact on water quality.
“But the changes in water color have no effect on physical health, especially athletes.
“This independent team confirmed our evaluation and confirmed the measures we have taken to restore the swimming pool’s normal color and normal chemical condition.
“We wanted the swimming pool to return to normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by the rainfall.

Urumizi regulates tourism distribution market operating order travel agencies must sign contracts with tourists
Currently, Xinjiang has entered the tourism spring season, to regulate the operating order of tourism spread markets, Urumuzzi City Tourism Law Enforcement Division Joint City Operations Office law enforcement Division yesterday on the presence of tourism vehicles not regulated, travel agencies signed a low contract rate with tourists investigation issues.
Yesterday at 8am, about 10 large buses were stopped around the Cape Town Hotel, most of them were a day-to-day trip to the pool.
“Hello, I am from the Urmuzzi City Tourism Agency, have you signed a contract with this travel agency?”
Officer of the law enforcement department of the Urmuzzi City Operations Office said: “Tourist vehicles and trail vehicles operate tourist passenger transport projects in the Urmuzzi market, no professional qualification.
“Over-scale operating for this fine of three to hundred thousand, and the driver does not have a qualifying certificate is a fine of 2,000 yen.
It is known that the tourism law enforcement department of the city of Urumuzzi has previously inspected the areas of tourism centers, such as West Park, Red Mountain.
Comprehensive two inspection cases, the Deputy Captain of the Tourism Enforcement Division of Urumuzzi said: "The first is safe, the second is the regulation, the tourist vehicles are not small, once the problem comes, all the injured people died.
“We’re joint with the operator continuous market inspections, regulating travel social vehicle behavior ensuring the safety of tourists.
On the morning of August 12, the State Press Office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016.
A spokesman of the National Statistics Office, National Economic Comprehensive Statistics Department, Nanjing Liang, said in July, the growth rate of the National Economic Section was slowed, but still operating within a reasonable area.
Data published by the National Statistics Office showed a decline in data like growth in fixed assets investment and total imports in July.
About the operation of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow the phrase that the Prime Minister once said, “The shape is fluctuating, the trend is in good direction,” which could better summarize the characteristics of the economic operation of July.
He explains that “formal volatility” means that some of the economic indicators in July were actually falling down.
Since the domestic and foreign economies in July are still under profound adjustment, the international situation is complex, and the recovery of the world economy is less expected, export pressure is still greater.
From domestic circumstances, the whole economy is still at a critical stage of adjustment, the adjustment pain is releasing, the economy is facing a small down pressure, so some indicators are some fluctuating.
She noted that there was a special situation in July, where the flood disasters were more severe, and the high-warm cold weather had some impact on production operations in some regions.
According to the recent publication of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people in the country have been affected with direct economic losses of more than 20 billion.
In terms of industrial, investment and transport-related indicators, these areas are affected differently.
The weekly freight of freight shipping in July dropped 3.6 percent points compared to last month, with flooding disasters have some impact on traffic in these areas.
Based on these factors, volatilities in part of July indicators are also normal and expected.
He said, “Most in good direction” refers to the fact that although economic growth has fallen, the economy operates generally smoothly, stable in-way, stable in-way, stable in-way, stable in-way.
CPI grew 1.8 percent in July, round ratio 0.2%; CPI grew 2.1 percent in July 1st, so the price situation is generally stable.
According to the Chongqing City Meteorological Office Gateway Network for the high-temperature weather statistics in various districts, except Chongqing, the rest of our city can receive different levels of high-temperature charges.
At present, at least 28 provinces in the country have cleared the standards for the issuance of charges, but the standards issued by each province differ, while Hong Kong is receiving high-temperature charges in accordance with high-temperature working day charges.
Under 35°C above 37°C is not less than $10 per person daily standard issued; above 37°C is not less than $15 per person daily standard issued.
High-temperature workers above 40°C can receive a monthly fee of up to $20/day (except for workers who have already enjoying high-temperature job fee lawfully).
According to this standard, the highest number of weather days in the past month, the lowest number of days in the city is 80 yuan, while the highest temperature of the Sun, so there is no high-temperature allowance.
Several units in the past would be charged with high-temperature charges for cold drinks, and the City Safety Authority said that this behavior is not in accordance with the current approach.
Because of high-temperature weather stopped working or shortened working hours, a person's units should not be deducted or reduced workers' wages.
The City Council said that employees who faced high-temperature jobs but did not receive high-temperature subsidies, can seek legal rights through the labor dispute mediation agency in which the company is located, or call 12333 complaints.
If the beneficiary unit refuses to issue high-temperature subsidies, the workers may complain to the Human Resources Social Security Authority above the council level where the employer is located.
At the same time, since high-temperature subsidies are part of wages, not benefits, it is necessary to include the total wages and a tax deduction.
Therefore, high-temperature subsidies are not within the scope of minimum wage and must be issued in cash and cannot be replaced by substances such as drinks.

Grecia is a famous female giant mouthbird, whilst spread the breath of tropical rainforests.
In the Central American state of Costa Rica, the giant mouthbird Grecia and its stories have long been known.
At a press conference on August 10, the post-surgical recovery Grecia finally appeared, showing to people its brand new 3D printed plastic birds.
This big bird, which was broken down and breathtaking one year and half ago, has finally been born again.
The day not only announces it’s 100% healthier, but also the day that it moved to a luxurious birdhouse and met with human friends care about it.
Grecia, the first new home, becomes a bit wicked, but rarely becomes vibrant, rolling in the pot, and eating grapes with new wheels.
To remind people of the damage it once suffered, the technicians did not give it a new colour, but kept the original white 3D printing material.
Outside of the bird is a thin layer of cornered bird, inside, there are only a few subtle bone supports.
Although there is such an internal solidification component, the clay of the big mouth is fragile and will be broken when injured.
Animal rescue centers, birdologists and an American 3D printing company collaborated to create a number of “testing slides” for Greece and finally create the “perfect slides” for it.
Today, Greece has been able to use the new potatoes to drink water, eat, and even grow small grains.
“The final finished product design took about 2 months, printed only 4 or 5 hours.
“3D printing is not a future technology, it has actually come into your life in my life, said Thomas Lang, CEO of SG3D printing company in an interview with New York International Reporter.
In January 2015, a farm in the Greece province of Araguaela, central Costa Rica, was discovered as a bloody gigantic mouthbird Grecia.
At that time, her head was brutally broken by a group of young people, she was completely unable to eat and life was in danger.
After the disaster situation in Greece has been by the media, there is a striking opposition to abuse of animals in Costa Rica and beyond.
It is called for stricter animal protection laws and increased punishment against abuseers.
People came spontaneously to make their best to help Greece recover their lives before being injured as much as possible.
Even the inventor of 3D printing technology, Chuck Hell, was also involved in the design of the Greece.
“The situation in Greece is special, the remainder of its upper square is less than 1 cm, so it brought a lot of difficulties to install the new square.
“We first scaned the Gracia, then designed and manufactured an extended hypothesis a little longer than the remaining part of it, fixed on the top of it with glue.
“This could reduce further invasive injuries to Greece, Mr. Jang Lang told New York International reporters.
Before installing the hypothesis, staff should clean the clay for Greece every day to prevent infection.
A thousand miles away, the story of the Giant Mouth Bird Gracia fascinates the famous documentary director Julia Eredia and explored news channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded the point-drop drops in Greece's new shell installation process and recorded a documentary, The Kingdom of the Giant Mouths, which was broadcast on the Animal Planet channel this month.
The documentary “The Kingdom of the Big Mouth” shows people how a small big mouthbird made a country change, and how people participate in the fight against animal abuse.
Core Tip: Japanese oil companies are especially warning about the emergence of a small independent China refinery known as the “tea cup”.
Japan’s largest oil company JX Energy believes that “the expansion of China’s exports is one of the reasons for the degradation of the situation.”
Japanese oil companies have been especially warning about the emergence of a small independent Chinese refinery known as the “tea cup”.
The quality of China’s oil products is gradually approaching Japan’s oil products due to China’s government’s strong environmental regulations.
Before obtaining a license to import raw oil, the Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea-Tea
Produced oil products have high sulfur content, poor oil products, and become one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining the import license of raw oil, the Tea Coffee Refinery was able to import low sulfur content of Oman raw oil and Russian raw oil, and the quality of its oil products was also improved.
East Fire General Oil Company said, “As the quality standards of oil products in China continually improve, the capacity of refining equipment has also been improved.”
As a result, the quality of China’s oil products exported to foreign countries gradually reached the same level as Japan (the world’s highest quality).
JX Energy said, “After the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia,” and forming competition with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Although “Japanese high-quality oil” is facing a crisis, the response strategy adopted by Japanese oil companies is only to “export to favourable regions while focusing on market conditions.”
Due to the huge influence of China’s oil products on the Asian market, the attention of the tea refineries is also increasing.
The 2016 Yanzo Night Journal’s Solar Assistance Operation started on May 26, after two months of registration, the total number of poor scholars who applied for scholarship reached more than 800.

The financing scope of the event is the high-qualificed undergraduate admission of new students, free of charge of education; education and superiority, family poverty.
The Statistics Office said New Zealand’s population growth has exceeded 2 percent in the period of birth to “baby flow” in 1974, and in the 1950s and early 1960s.
As of June this year, the net flow of immigrants in New Zealand was 6,91,000 over 12 months, which became the main driver of New Zealand's population growth in recent years.
In addition, New Zealand’s population has naturally grown by 2,82 million during the same period of time.
The data shows that the annual net flow of immigrants in New Zealand has been 2.18,000 in the past ten years, with a natural growth of 3,23,000 in the year.
From a population structure, massive migration flow means a gradual increase in the proportion of the “working age population” aged 15 to 39.
During the 12 months of June 2016, New Zealand’s working age population increased by 3.6% to 15.8 million.
At the same time, the population of older than 65 years has also increased by 3.6% to 700,000 people.
Yesterday, at 10 a.m., the X9003 international freight line departed from the new construction station of Xi'an to Aramuto, Kazakhstan.
The launch of the train marks the number of vehicles successfully exceeded 10,000 cars since the launch of the Central Asia International Freight Line in 2013.
It is known that the freight class transported in this class includes six categories of industrial raw materials, mechanical equipment, industrial parts, construction materials, food, lightweight products, a total of 206 varieties.
As of 11 August this year, the new construction station has launched 221 trains and 1,09 vehicles, with a total of 33.8,000 tons of export goods, of which 84 trains were launched in 2016, an increase of 47% compared to the same.
It is known that the first cargo transported in Central Arabia was all “Made in Zhang”, and today it has attracted a large number of foreign freight sources to be actively listed.
By the end of July, Central Abane containers reached the capacity of 64,000 containers, an increase of 8 percent compared to the same period in 2015.
With the launch of Central Abane’s cryptography, the shipping volume of the new station built by the Xiang Railway Office increases annually.
In 2015, the new construction station had 247.7,000 tons of cargo consumption throughout the year, and as of August 10, 2016, the freight shipping volume had reached 153.1,000 tons, an increase of 6.7% compared to the same period last year.
In order to meet future development needs, the construction plan of the new construction railway complex logistics center, located in the center of the new construction station, has been launched, fully constructing a modern new construction railway complex logistics park.
India’s uncle was shocked by a plane landing last week at the Dubai International Airport and received a $1 million big prize this week at the same airport.
A long-lived Indian in Dubai, Mohammed Bachil Abdul Hadal had the habit of buying lottery every time he returns to his country.

“The escape from the air strike was God gave me a second life and gave me the money to do good,” he said.
Although it's already falling, the power of the "Tiger" seems to be a little worse than in summer.
UV rays not only makes your colleagues’ skin black, but also hurt the skin, how can the skin pass military exercises smoothly, without being injured?
Sunscreen packaging is usually marked with SPF and PA, SPF is indicative sunlight index, is intended for UVB UV, our common SPF index has 15, 30, 50 etc.
The product marked with PA is intended for UVA, so sunproof plays a more effective role, usually the intensity of PA + indicates more than one + indicates an extension of effective protection time.
Oily skin should choose waterproofs with stronger penetration, and sunproof spray is also a good choice.
Dry skin should choose cream-shaped sun protection; neutral skin generally does not have strict regulations, sensitive skin rushing any maintenance is a burden, it is recommended to choose pure physical sun protection products.
Remember for a half hour in advance, as the sunproof product takes time to fully penetrate the skin.
Military training days have a longer period of time, a sunny cream wash once every two hours to have a lasting effect, do not be lazy.
Because of the skin was just exposed to sunlight irritation, military training returned not to use white products immediately.
After the military exercises, if conditionally packed with a towel with ice to the ice town with burned skin to reduce local dry heat.
The farmers who purchased farmers during the exhibition continue to implement aggregate subsidies policy, and the farmers who purchased farmers can receive a maximum of 40 percent subsidies.
The exhibition is aimed at presenting global entrepreneurship, in particular, increased invitation to “One Belt and One Way” coast countries and target market countries.
This exhibition strives to complete 60 contract contract projects, introduce $220 billion in funds, signing more than 160 trade contracts, contract amount of $32 billion.
According to the report, “Shibo Association” has falled down for seven consecutive years, due to the strong manufacturing industry base in the province of Luhan, the industry development has been a long history.
As the host of the “Shift Expo”, it has established trademarks with more than 90 countries around the world.
“China Expo” becomes an important platform for local cultivation of specialty industry development and promoting specialty industry to go out of the country.
At some nights, the ion layer is filled with free electrons, which means that the radio signals can go far.
According to the U.S. Daily Journal on August 11, the U.S. Air Force is interested in replicating the effect.
While the ion layers with a stable amount of free electron can help people listen to this radio at the edge of broadcasting range of a university radio station, this may not be the interest of the U.S. Air Force.
The electron-filled ion layer means that the radio used by the military has a greater broadcast range, and it may provide some protection to the Global Positioning System (GPS) signals to keep it safe from the effects of sun storms.
The ultimate goal might be to build a series of square satellites according to the need, which can strengthen the ion layers when needed.
But first of all, these teams signing contracts with the Air Force must prove that the relevant scientific principles work.
Industry data show that the total coal production capacity in 2015 is close to 6 billion tons, and the national coal production capacity is over 1.8 billion tons.
Over the past decade, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a total of five notifications of elimination of excess and retardation of production capacity.
Although the first four were not targeted by the coal industry, the target sector was directly related to the coal industry.
From last November to January this year, the price of the 5500 car powered coal in Qingdao was long-range at a low level of 370 yen/ton, and 90% of the coal enterprises suffered losses.
And since February, the coal prices have gradually risen, and the recent coal prices of Qingdao's powered coal rise continuously four years, rise to the highest point of 16 months, once rise to $436 per ton, up almost $70 compared to the beginning of the year.
As prices rise, the world is concerned about the following: Will a small group of coal mines re-produced?
In this regard, Mr. Zhang Ming, chairman of the Economics Institute for Reform Development of China (Haiwan) conducted an analysis and interpretation.
The production capacity has caused high attention from all parties, and today published the score of the coal industry’s production capacity also makes people feel more concerned.
These three superficial factors also reflect the reason why our way of growth in the past has been relatively late, because the way of growth dominated by the government has not yet been substantially changed.
Second, this is also directly related to the advancement of local governments, and in the process of deduction of production, funds and corresponding arrangements must be available, and in this regard, the differences between different regions are actually much larger.
Thirdly, some provinces that are currently more slowly progressing, are likely to face a greater risk if they are moving forward in the second half.
In this case, relying on central remuneration funds to advance the process of deduction of capacity may have certain negative consequences.
First of all, output capacity is not simply conducting a total control.
Our goal is to promote the optimization of the structure by eliminating behind-the-coal production capacity, to reconstruct the whole new approach of the coal industry.
In the process of deploying to production capacity, local governments must combine the transformative upgrades of the production capacity and the coal industry to strongly develop the related services sector.
Second, in order to complete this year’s output mission, we still need to fully use the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision.
Finally, we need to strengthen the fundamental role of social security.
Because the market is directly involved in employment issues, we want to strengthen employment skills training for employees and employees.
“The reason for the decline in rankings is the worsening of foreign investment expectations for Brazil’s GDP in the middle-term.
In 2015, Brazil’s participation in global direct investment was 3.7% lower than 5.7% in 2014.
The International Investment Attraction Index includes four sub-indices: infrastructure, economic prospects, business environment and direct investment.
Brazil’s direct international investment was $646 billion in 2015, less than $73.3 billion in 2014.
Last year, the “green area investment” in Brazil (the investment model for overseas investments) dropped by $179.9 billion, compared to 2.1 percent.
“There are 288 ‘green’ projects in Brazil, with an average of 314 between 2003 and 2014.
However, in the first half of 2016, direct international investment in Brazil reached $33.8 billion, an increase of almost 10% compared to the same period last year.
Canadian police kill ISIS supporters: self-made bomb bomb bombing cities ready to work
The taxi company said the taxi was sent to Driver’s house before the police arrived.
The Canadian police said on Wednesday’s press conference that the police received information included a “morthodox video” provided by the U.S. Federal Investigation about the young man was going to carry out the attack.
According to the German voice, a man wearing a black black barracraft hat is reading the Qur’an, mentioning crimes against Muslims, and swearing to launch an attack on a Canadian city soon.
He said in the video that the attack would take place within 72 hours and at the peak time.
The incident was the first time since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office last year when police killed a terrorist suspect before the incident.
After the upgrade of the renovation of the Kyongyang Canal Branch Line, Ovan Fukushima, North Fukushima and North Fukushima, passenger fees are charged from September 1st.
The two flow routes adopted social funding methods for reconstruction, and the fee has been approved by the relevant department of the province.
The Old-Wan-Fukha ferry runs through the Kings Village, Fish Station, through the South-Yang Lake entered the main ferry route of the Kyiv Grand Canal, a total length of 32.5 km.
According to the transportation requirements, the Old Fukushka ferry adopted maintenance reform method, the local water depth was deepened, the local fast bending performed straight bending, etc., the transportation conditions were improved.
The trailway runs through the Kyongang Canal Main Trail through the South Yang Lake, a total length of 19 kilometers.
Construction of the two routes began in February 2011, and in January 2015 completed the transaction processing, the investment construction and operating entity is located in Zinging City’s Safety Channel Logistics Service Center.
In accordance with the principle of “Lending Construction, Payment Refund Loan”, Zinging City’s Anping Channel Logistics Service Centre charged routes passage fees based on the payment standards approved by the Guangzhou Pricing Authority.
Among them, the basic passage fee is calculated by 1.75 yen/load ton, and the mile passage fee is calculated by 0.05 yen/km load ton.
Passenger fees are charged from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019.
Reporters from the Zing City Port Authority learned that there are currently four charter routes in Zing province, respectively, the Zing River Trailway, the White River Trailway, the North Dakota Trailway, and the Old Fukushka Trailway.
The four routes are the fluid routes of the Kyongyang Canal, all undertaken social funding methods to be updated.
The upgrade of the river routes is the first model of the “Government+ Market” for projects for the construction of the river port infrastructure in the province of Guangzhou, the government takes subjective investments, and social funding supplement funding deficit.
The branch routes of the White Ma River, the Old Fukushima River, the North Dakota River, etc. take a purely marketed way of operation.
The funds allocated by the state budget cannot meet the need for engineering construction, limiting the progress of navigation upgrading.
The construction of social funds for public infrastructure in accordance with national policy requirements and also became a way to break down the bottle of funds.
Ningxia’s performance in the 100m free swimming semi-finals has left many Chinese spectators discontinued.
Just in a 50m free swimming race, Ningxia once again refreshed the people's "bottom line".
In fact, 50m free swimming is not the main theme of Ninja, his performance and best performance at the Kazan Tournament, also determined the possibility of he’s not a breakthrough in the project.
Of course, Hong Kong’s official media, the bigger news, revealed that Ningxia’s biggest cause to lose was that he had lost his interest in swimming.
Many factors outside the field may have a great impact on his ideas about the future, and he may now be more interested in the intrusive entertainment sector.
After the Kazan World Championship, Ningxia became Red in the moment with its super high colour and good results.
Therefore, the names such as “the nation’s husband,” “the little meat,” “the beautiful man” have not necessarily become the labels of him.
A variety of business activities find out to the door, a beautiful way of money, becoming a golden lighting street.
In this case, even if Ningxia chose to resign from the service at this time, it was not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable way.
After all, he was only 23 years old and was able to perform one or two television shows with his popularity.
But I need to see whether he has sufficient qualifications compared to his predecessors?
At the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, 21-year-old Leo has come to the end of his athlete career.
Liu's beautiful appearance made her quickly remembered by people, and also set the foundation for her future military entertainment circle.
After his resignation, Lee performed in several television shows and founded his own studio in 2013.
Takashi participated in two Olympic games for single-double ten meters and won 2 gold and 2 silver.
But after the 2004 Olympic single-metre competition losing his team friend Ho Chi Minh in a single-metre game, the competition status of Taha was decreased and exploded by the jumping squad.
And he and his daughter participated in a series such as “Where’s Dad Go” and made him a lot of points.
One of the former gymnastics golden generations Yankee, Lee Chiang Mai and Chen-Ice both were highly qualified to participate in various art programmes.
It is worth noting that Yangwei Lee Chongqong then led China to win the 2008 Olympic Team Championship, and Yangwei also won a personal all-powered gold medal twice, known as the all-powered King.
While Chen-Ice led China to win the 2012 Olympic Group Championship, he also became a hanging king.
And after misjudging the golden medal at the Olympic Games in London, Chen’s intense action also made him countless dust.
But the main energy of these athletes is still in the competition field, and for the art show, it is just like a bit of water – they go down.
But whether it’s retired or active athletes, able to get the favourite of the entertainment circuit requires a guarantee of achieved achievement.
After all, entering a new field of athletes, both ability and human beings, is an empty state.
Even for years of disturbing entertainment such as Tanja and Liu's "olders", the ordinary audience raised them, more than thinking about their performance at the Olympic Games.
And the new people of Yangwei, Lee Zhang, as well as the introduction when the art show appears, are no exception "Olympic champions".
Compared to the few of the above, the title of a Swimming World Championship champion is still slightly simple.
Moreover, compared to the performance of Taha, Liu, Yangwei and others, Ningxia, if at the age of 23, he suffered a little disappointment in his sports career, the negative impact on his image is probably unpredictable.
After all, referring to the athletes, people’s demands are “not asking for a hundred victory, but asking for no worries,” and Ningxia is still a lot worse from this.
Ten thousand steps back said, Ningxia looks good and can fully depend on color values to obtain the support of thousands of brain residues.
Not a little power, just by the appearance, wanting to be mixed in the entertainment circle, it is not difficult than well trained to find a response situation.
The way of life is chosen in accordance with the personal will, but how to choose, Ninjuku should have a number in mind.
Surface, social platforms have expanded the communication circuit and reduced people’s feelings of loneliness.
The power scope of social networking is widespread, not only gradually replacing traditional telephone contacts, but even infiltrating the real life circles under the line, quietly changing the social life of today’s people.
The benefits of online social networking are obvious, for example, convenient and fast, so it is especially vulnerable to the preferences of young people.
A survey on college students’ social habits showed that 57% of college students use their mobile phone for more than five hours a day and their daily lives are basically “non-handed”.
“Social networks have low cost, fast transmission speed, multi-personal simultaneous communication, etc. characteristics, which meets the needs of contemporary students.
Expanding the circle of relationships, more equal dialogue, and avoiding social concerns are the main reason for our deeper love online chat.
Newcomers just entered the company love to communicate with colleagues on line, “because the entering unit everyone is not very familiar with the comments through social platforms, the relationship is much closer than before.”
Loving friends also often communicate online: "Before they didn't have contact with friends for a while because of some mistakes, then in a large group first talk a few words.
The IT engineer, Wu, is a profound social network enthusiast, and most of his social life takes place online and network contacts are several times more than the number of online friends.
Mr. Wu said it is more “like fish getting water” on the internet.
“You can answer friends whenever you want, because there is a lot of time to speak words and express more clearly.
“Hidden under your ID you came to me to avoid face-to-face confrontations, not only having space to spin, but also giving each other more time and space to talk.
“People with different identities have the same right and efficiency to speak, all kinds of social concerns in real life, and in the web space seems to be eliminated.
However, Mr. Yu’s friend, Mr. Xia, thought that Mr. Yu’s word in life was a “very boring home man.”
Zhang and Yu-Jong got acquainted in a large crowd, because they were both positive speakers and soon became acquainted.
Xiao Qiang felt Wu's and the web judgment of two people, the words are boring, not initially commented, repeatedly covered with a few words: "Oh, okay, yes," or "This I'll check on the web."
The police has now interferred in the investigation, and the transport sector will also strengthen the repair of illegal vehicles.
“August 4, the conflict police has not yet investigated results, and on August 11, at zero time, two other taxi drivers were broken in their homes.
“More of three wheels now operate illegally at night, hopefully the authorities will increase their repairs.
The South Sea Network reporter learned from the National Security Office of the Autonomous District of Leningrad that the police have already received reports of the two cases, and the cause of the two cases, who did it, whether the association is involved, etc. are under further investigation.
Mr. Wang Wang Yi, head of the Traffic Management Station, said the Ministry of Transportation began repair three-wheel vehicles for illegal passengers at the beginning of this year, with a total of 613-wheel vehicles for illegal passengers.
Next step, the transport sector will request the County Government to strengthen the repair of three-wheel vehicles, motorcycles, black vehicles and other illegal operating vehicles throughout the County.

On August 11, when a reporter's telephone interview returned to Zhou Irine in the house of Quraisy, she said: "The situation was too urgent at that time, I only thought in my mind was to save people!"
Yulin is a student of the 2015 grade of the Central Southern Leningrado Landscape Garden College.
Zhu Ilin, who studied city countryside planning, wanted to visit the city of Kentucky to study local architectural design, so as a family travel.
On August 8, around 10 p.m., Yulin's father rested in the hotel, and both mothers went out and prepared for a tour of the old city.
Just went not far away, suddenly I saw a group of people crying out, and walked up for curiosity.
Looking at “the little boy was missing traces, the little girl swallowed hard in the water, only exposed her little head on the sea, sometimes dropping down,” Yulin, who learned to swim as a child, quickly jumped to the rescue.
After the water, the 165 cm high Yalein found it could not get to the bottom!
Before it was a quiet surface of the water, but under the bottom it was a fluid!
But she still walked to the little girl.
Zheylin said that the water was wicked and wicked, less than five meters away, spent almost all of her energy.
She made her best to push the little girl to the river, “The river is especially sliding, I feared that I didn’t have the power to sink.
So, Yin asked for help from his mother, hearing his daughter's call, and the waterless Miss Yin prepared for water rescue and arrested by the next visitors.
On August 10, after the rescue of the people's case was spread, Ms. Yong received a lot of confessions and praise from relatives, and was also "guided" by many relatives.
“Now I remember it is really terrible! telling the truth, when the child couldn’t fast stand on the river, and asking for help, my heart quickly broke.
Mrs. Yin was very confident to say, though it was dangerous, but if she put in such a scene again, she would still support her daughter's choice, and she was proud of her daughter!
Because of being forced, Yulin rarely dropped water again after learning to swim, “I didn’t think that skill was still used.”
According to the chief executive of Yulin Ban, Yulin is recognized as a “learning master,” and is pleased to help.

The North East Tigers are currently listed on the Red List of Endangered Species (EN) by the World Nature Conservation Union (IUCN).
According to the Gillin Province’s Forestry Office, data from joint monitoring by Central America and Russia in 1998 showed that the Gillin province had only four to six wild north-east tigers and three to five north-east tigers.
According to the Gillin Province’s Forestry Protection Office in Long Spring, Gillin Province has been increasing protection against wildlife in recent years, the number of species in North East Tigers and North East Tigers in China is growing significantly, and the distribution area is constantly expanding.
The latest surveillance data from 2015 showed that only in the province of Gilin, there were 27 wild-eastern tigers and 42 wild-eastern tigers.
As a world wildlife protection flagship species distributed in the Central-Russian cross-border area, cooperation between the two countries is crucial for the restoration and reproduction of wild north-eastern tigers and rabbits.

After the case occurred, after several media reports, it became a focus case, and the social impact was very bad.
After the case occurred, the police department of Haik City Security Office led high attention and immediately organized a large group of high-quality police forces to start investigation.
Police immediately executed the suspect’s online evacuation, took various measures to monitor and investigate the landfall of a king by contacting foreign police.
Due to the suspect’s theft, which has been repeatedly attacked by police authorities, has stronger anti-detection capabilities, along with his long-term drug use, frequent attacks when questioning intoxication, the investigation work is very difficult.
Greenland sharks are also referred to as small sleeping sharks and are widely distributed in the North Atlantic waters around Greenland and Iceland, which reaches 4 to 5 meters in adulthood.
But their growth rate is extremely slow, sometimes only about 1 cm in a year, suggesting that Greenland sharks may have an extremely long life.
Traditional age measurement methods usually use animal calcium tissue, which can be used in some sharks, but this calcium tissue is rare in Greenland sharks.
A new study led by Julius Nielsen at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, turned into radioactive carbon measurements using Greenland sharks’ eye crystals.
This method has previously been used to measure the age of whales, but it is the first time used to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis showed that the largest shark’s life is estimated to be 392 years, with an error of 120 years.
This means that the sharks are at least 272 years old and the maximum is likely to reach 512 years old.
Furthermore, female Greenland sharks are alleged to be sexually mature when they reach about 4 meters in height, in exchange for age to be at least 156 years old.
The researchers therefore wrote in the paper that Greenland sharks are the most known and longest vertebral animals on Earth, exceeding the previous long-lived champion rope whale (211 years old).

According to China’s News Evening Summit, in late August, Japan’s Prime Minister Abe will go to Kenya to attend the sixth African Development Conference.
The Africa Development Conference is headed by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, and therefore it will be the first move to Africa.
Officials of the Japanese Foreign Ministry said that a meeting in Africa has helped attract Africa and Europe's attention to Japan.
In order to accompany this visit, the Japanese People's Party will send a parliamentary group to the countries concerned.
Japan’s “common” path began in the early 1990s, and the African Development Conference initiated by Japan also began in 1993, it was not a coincidence!
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations, and is an important United Nations ticket warehouse, and how does Japan want to “normal” to abandon Africa?
It will also exchange views with stakeholders of countries on the action against extremist organizations Islamic State and terrorism.
The Western Group will visit seven countries including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.
Japan's Foreign Minister Teda Wuhan has recently also expressed intentions in the United Nations Security Council on the African Development Conference.
Abe has announced that it will provide 100 billion yen (approximately 61 billion yuan) in five years for the stability of the Sahara countries in the desert of Africa.
Observators are generally believed that Japan’s generosity towards Africa has two main objectives: the one is to increase Japan’s presence in Africa; the second is to struggle to win the support of the African countries on the issue of accession.
Japan’s question expert Yang Zhang said: “In the political perspective, Africa is relatively slow in development, but the number of countries is much more, so Japan has always seen it as the so-called ‘big ticket field’.
In the future, Japan will not give up, and the work for Africa will not end, and will continue to strengthen.
Economically, because Japan’s production capacity is relatively strong, domestic markets are relatively limited, especially in the context of young children’s ageing, domestic demand is relatively low.
However, from the small source of Pine-Yano 10 years ago, to the An-Double 10 years later, in the meantime, Japan has repeatedly launched a regular "shock", but it is all-in-lawed.
Japan’s question expert Yang Jingang believes that Japan’s intention is obvious, but the way to go to the ordinary would be difficult to be heavy.
To its objectives, Japan must first have good relations with neighboring countries, where, whether in geopolitical disputes or in ethnic disputes and historical knowledge, Japan needs to have the right attitude.

There is also such a group of star coaches on the Chinese body: they have been unlimited in the age of athletes, earning countless honors for the country; they have been taught for years after resignation to later, and educated to win the championship.
As the first world champion in Chinese men’s gymnastics, Zhu Yuan chose to take a trail after resignation.
From the female team coach to the male team coach, then to the general coach, Yung Yungqing built a "Olympic Gold" group, and the team achieved the mythical achievement of 9 gold 1 silver 4 copper at the Beijing Olympics.
Since then, Taha has been continuously advertising speech, and has played an important role in recent years, such as "Kowloon", "Rayman".
Many NBA players have demonstrated their strengths, but some progress falls.
Whether because of age increases or the time of play is limited, there are some players who have performed a retreat every season.
Of course, some “receiving” may be just a scratch of data, and the strength of these players may not have been reduced.
Even though Wade is still one of the best points defenders in the League, his buff performance should not have a hot fire as well.
He and Ronaldo's back-field shootings are limited, with a third-party score of only 32.8%, which makes the next season's attack a lot.
When it comes to Wind City, the Flashman will have to give more ball rights to Butler and Lund, and they are likely to choose to play in regular competitions.
Octavia’s situation was more embarrassed, as the first choice for 76 people last season, he had to compete with Simons and Enbid in the new season.
The competition may not come soon, Simons also need to adapt to the NBA field, and Enbid will be fully recovered from injuries as soon as possible, but whether Ocafort can have a position in the 76 senior team is still a problem.
Last season, 32% of Octavia's score was from low-level attacks, higher than Coachins, Wushevik and Brook Lopez, while his use was also high in front of the Alliance's 40th.
As Simons has demonstrated an excellent leadership potential, Enbid also has the body that is more suitable for the NBA match, and Octavia’s position may be hard to be so stable.
During the past two seasons, Thompson's use has been stable at the front of the League 20, which is also the two of his greatest seasons.
But the problem is that with Durant’s arrival, Thompson’s use will surely decrease, which will surely affect his performance.
This impact will not only affect the number of times, but Tom's holding attacks will surely be significantly reduced next season, which will also reduce the opponent's defence against him in some ways.
Durant’s arrival will surely make the Warriors’ team’s players shrinking data, but the most severe shrinking of this is probably Thompson.
But this does not mean Tom's level retreat, it's more like he sacrifice for the whole team.
Park performed better than the data reflected last season, not only because his basket efficiency reached the highest in his lifetime, but he and Aldridge's chemical reactions also benefited the team.
Duncan resigned, Gineapolis declared a war again for a year, and GDP’s combination finally ended, as one of the youngest of the three, there was not much oil in the fuel tank of the French racing cars.
After getting the third total champion ring, only Jabal, Jordan and Russellby James won more regular MVP, while Jordan was the only FMVP than James.
Oh well, James just brought Cleveland’s first professional sports championship in 52 years.
To come to the 14th season of his career, James needs a better guarantee of physical strength to prepare for the post-season.
Therefore, in regular matches, James's data is likely to fall further down and he would pay more burden to Owen, but he would still easily be the League's top three player.
“It is necessary to develop the talent learned from the country in Russia.”
On 12th local time, the President of the Russian Federation of the Chinese Federation of Moscow Yuan Yuan spoke excitedly when he saw the Chinese New Network reporter.

The British team won a silver medal in seven-person football games, and the Fiji won a gold medal.
In the seven-person football finals on Thursday night, the British team failed to continue in front of the Fiji, defeated by the Fiji with 43 against 7 at Rio de Janeiro Stadium.
The Fiji team won the golden medal with its imminent performance in control, robbery, avoiding, co-operation, running and strength, which is the first Olympic medal in the country’s history.
The silver medal was also a little comfort for the defeated British team, the third silver medal received by the British delegation on the same day, which was enough to make the British Olympic teams proud: they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa in the first seven-person Olympic games.
Earlier that day, the British team defeated South Africa with 7 against 5, which could have affected their status in the final.
But anyway, the Fiji team now is enough to defeat a spirit-filled team of 15 people.
Tomorrow, at least one British will wear a gold medal, which may be a consolation for the British team, but it may not be. This British is the Fiji head coach Ben Ryan from Wimbledon, who once served as the head coach of the British team.
It is not easy for the British team to accomplish today’s achievement.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's practice, they didn't win at the Adelaide International Seven-People Football Games.
Now they are just a step away from the champion.
Although they were hit, they also made a tremendous progress.
Fiji starts on occupying the advantage, making the British team unattackable.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like hit a series of buses running.When Ossi Coliniso entered the corner flag, the World Series Championship team was already far ahead with a ratio of 5 to 0.
The game took just four minutes, and Jerry Touwe finished the score on the right side.
12-0, the British team has hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell's strength of blocking left the giant general Lion Carava not a third score, but this just slowed down the speed of Fiji's score.
At 7 minutes, Asa Wale Lemaru touched the ground in the right corner. 17 against 0, the British team snowed.
The Caravana won another point, while the first half of the game... remains one minute.
Then, Wattmo Lavow broke the defence of the British team and reached the point line.
At the middle of the rest, the ratio was already 29 against 0.
The Fijians were born to play seven-person football, while the British team was still the first to play.
This is the situation.
The British team made a huge change in the second half and hit the Fiji's defence line in all four minutes, and it was good for the first half, but later the Fiji's team made a great match, scoring again by Joshua Tuesova.
Dan Norton gave a chance to score for the British team when he touched the left corner, changing the ratio to 36 to 7, but the game has long been under the control of the South Sea, with fans sing loudly, bending flags and dance on the stations.
The great performance of the Fiji team was required to shoot fast.
Matthew Williams stopped the Fiji's uncommon attack at the last minute.
The finals sounded, the Fijians embraced together, and the finished British team only regret returning.
Earlier that day, the Fiji defeated Japan by 20 against 5 in the semi-finals, while the UK ran against South Africa in an intense semi-finals match.
In the first half, Kyle Brown helped South Africa to lead, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with excellent footprints.
After that, Anthony's brother Marcus Watson made sure the team's victory, and eventually the British won a silver card.
Helen Graff and Heather Stanin, inspired by Cancer Coach, won a race boat gold medal
No exaggeration, this is the most impressive piece of gold.
From the first scratch until now, Helen Graff and Heather Staning have undergone 220 punishment trains, and the gold medal they won at Estacio da Lagoa has more extraordinary significance.
Although only the two of them were buried, the voice of one on the boat — coach Robin Williams — was always accompanied by them to shock the second consecutive female double Olympic gold medal, which was the UK’s first race boat female group to reach that height.
They haveined 39 unfailed records and have an absolute advantage.
What we see is that these two genius athletes move elegantly on the surface of the water, but that’s not all of the victory.
There are a lot of volunteers who are behind each box of gold medals, just their constant dedication created a difference, which helped most than 30 months ago knowing that he had cancer and not knowing whether he could see the coach of the day alive.
As he said, death can come at any time.
I had bladder cancer and they had surgery for me.
Without surgery, the cancer cells will spread throughout the body.
Thus, the situation will be much worse.
This will change your opinion slightly.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he started treatment in early 2014 and would reduce the impact to the minimum, although it may not be appropriate to say in this case.
I need to get a salary, so I need to get better quickly.
This is a motivation for me.
I lived in the hospital, although they said a few steps were enough, I still walked around the hospital room 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet every time.
This is the beginning of everything.
The race itself is a journey, which makes the journey a little longer.
At the moment they picked up the money, they first thought of Williams. This morning, Williams talked a little bit more than usual, to overcome his anxiety.
She said, “I’m in bad mood this week, maybe a bit extreme, but the real meaning of this gold medal is extraordinary.
It repeatedly tells me how important it is for me, how much effort I, Helen and Robin have made.
That’s Helen, Robin and I’ve been working for three years.
Without Robin, we were just an unknown graduate and thank him very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I can’t find a better coach and coach than him.
Helen Graff and Heather Stanin have failed for five years.
The severity of punishment set on the combination is uncomparable to their opponents.
Even at the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Denmark began approaching, Stanin and Graff still have a large amount of physical energy reserves.
It was terrible at that time.
Helen said, “Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm.”
It is really important not being affected by the opponents.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn’t expect anything amazing to do.
We didn’t think about today’s glory, we just thought to arrange each match and win this game, and we did it.
It took the combination a year to decide its future.
Graph will be married next month with television explorer Steve Bakshall.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the present.
I don’t want to say this is my last game.
This would put too much pressure on me.
In London, I took about six months to realize I was an Olympic champion.
This is an entirely new experience and I feel very nervous.
About four minutes have passed now.
She said, “I feel better.

Snapchat’s “anime” effect is intended to ironic Asian people.
Snapchat said the inspiration for this filter was animated, but some observers believed it had racial colors.
Snapchat’s 1.5 billion daily users can change reality through its filter tools and make images funny and funny.
You can turn yourself into the role of a caterpillar, a dog, or a Roy Liechtenstein painting.
These mirrors have a fluorizing and curved effect, producing more than 30 million self-revisioned photos every day.
Any mistake will be immediately noticed by the public.
Snapchat Mirror has been criticized for the app being encouraged to play black or to be beautiful with white skin.
Therefore, when the app provides a filter for some users this week that can create eyelashes, eyelashes, and eyelashes effects, some commentators call it a racial irony to Asian “Yellow People”.
They even thought whether these repeated issues mean that the company had a larger problem in diversity.
After Snapchat said it had removed the feature, the report from The Verge and Motherboard sparked anger on Wednesday.
The company’s explanation was that the filter was to respect the animated roles, not to ironize the Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of a damaging impression in reality.
Others also strongly opposed these animated images.
A Korean-American artist who tweeted and widely shared on these photos said in an email that the filters were "at least annoying and uncomfortable."
She also said: “It is hard to distinguish extreme wicked Asian ironic images from the effects of the filter.
Although the filter is not only the yellow species, the yellow species is extremely reduced.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches these cultures.
From the corporate board to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusion.
Snapchat’s huge young group may be very sensitive because they focus more on ethnic diversity than their elderly lives.
When a Snapchat filter produced an image of offending users, 25-year-old Juki (translator) said in an interview on Thursday: “These things are more difficult to escape the eyes of people than before.
On Thursday, Mrs. Joe, a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do so.
In an article written for Medium and a telephone interview, she said she believed that ethnic disputes reflect Snapchat’s lack of ethnic diversity in the recruitment process.
Mrs. Joe criticized the company's employees mostly white, the leadership is all men and added a tag at the end of the article: #DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese-American, Ms. Ji said: “Either their employees have no different races in color so that they can make such a decision, or there are some color races in their employees, but their positions can’t let them say what they want.
Other observers shared complaints that she did not respond by Snapchat.
The company did not publish data about the diversity of employees and declared itself a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of its employees on Thursday, but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter dedicated to focusing on the lower internal population and promoting internal inclusion.
Mrs. Joe said she would shut her Snapchat account: “I want to know if they need more users like us against this behavior.
Parliamentary Group says military officials distorted ISIS intelligence
A congress group said in a report published on Thursday that officials of the U.S. Central Command changed the intelligence report to describe the situation of war in Iraq and Syria against Islamic State more optimistic than the actual situation.
The middle-term report comes from a dedicated working group formed by the President of the Republican Parliament's Military Committee, Intelligence Committee and the House of Representatives' Funding Committee of Defence Subcommittee.The Central Command's intelligence analysts have been “widespread dissatisfaction” and the analysts said the topists are changing their assessment of the war between the United States and the Islamic State.
The Central Command, located in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for regulating US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news about the report, “intelligence reviewed by senior leaders of the Central Command is more optimistic about the descriptions of the U.S. anti-terrorism operations than the real situation and is always more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies.”
Republican representatives of California said: “The actions of the Central Command are not acceptable. On the one hand, our warriors suffer from war, on the other hand, the senior policy makers receive an error analysis.
The leadership issues of the Central Command have been extended to the highest level of the agency.
The report details the long-standing issues of the Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing the U.S. training Iraqi forces.
While there is no certainty evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration ordered to modify these reports, according to the report described, the analysts felt themselves under pressure from the head of the Central Command, forcing them to express more optimistic views on the threats of the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
“In the first half of 2015, many Central Command’s press releases, statements and congress testimony were more optimistic than the real situation.
For example, officials in a central command openly stated that a large military operation could be taken back to Mosul in April or May 2015.
Iraq’s second largest city Mosul is still under Islamic State control.
Kansas Republican representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement: “The results have been very obvious after months of investigation.
From mid 2014 to mid 2015, majority of the U.S. Central Command's senior intelligence officers have manipulated the Command's intelligence products, hiding the threats of Islamic State in Iraq.
The Republican established a special working group after analysts learned about Islamic State intelligence was manipulated.
As the investigation continues, there will be more findings after the report published on Thursday.
The Prosecutor General of the Defense Department also conducted a long-term investigation in the Central Command.
Members of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee of the Democratic Party published their investigation on Thursday, in accordance with partial conclusions of the Republican Specialized Working Group.
A representative of the Democratic Party leader of the Committee said in a statement that between 2014 and 2015, the Central Command has conducted an excessively narrow process on the intelligence assessment of the Islamic State and the Iraqi forces.
Mr. Xianda said the process “hindered the publication of intelligence,” reduced analyst’s personality and “incapacitated to accept different opinions.”
But Mr. Sheanda and Democrats also said they did not find any evidence that the palace attempts to put pressure on the analysts of the Central Command, so that their conclusions were in accordance with “predictions or political narratives”.
The Veterinary Journal the preliminary results of Congress’s investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times that the Prosecutor General of the Pentagon began an investigation after receiving complaints from the Central Command Section Analysts.
The Pentagon spokesman of the Navy Colonel Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Department of Defense did not comment on the report of the Congress until the investigation of the Prosecutor General was completed.
But he said, “Experts sometimes discourage about the interpretation of complex data, while intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense encourage a healthy dialogue on these important national security issues.”
The impact of the investigation has exceeded the question of whether the US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria have succeeded (a number of defense officials claimed).
But last year, these claims questioned the public to how much President Obama could trust the Central Command’s assessment of military actions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of Islamic State intelligence reminds the controversy over a decade ago, when the Central Command Intelligence Analyst Gregory Hook wrote a study article in which pointed out that George Bush’s government, despite the opposition of many analysts, insisted on sending small troops to Iraq and almost did not consider the situation after the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hook played a key role in the protest against Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr. Hook’s team concluded that air attacks on Islamic State refineries did not significantly cut terrorist organizations’ economic revenues as the terrorist group built a temporary refinery to continue to sell oil on the black market, which is in a big difference with the announced statement.
According to a September report by Time Weekly, the Central Command did not publish the findings outside.
After several lawyers reviewed the Senate testimony about the excessive optimism of the war, Central Command Commander Lloyd Austin III was criticized last year.
General Austen resigned from office in April and is currently replaced by Joseph Water for his position in the Central Command.
The U.S. wins four rows in women’s hockey games and will be a final victory against the UK.
The only three-dollar, Katy Bum, who won Japan's 6 against 1 match, played the second lead for the American women's hockey team on Thursday, helping the American team defeat the Indian team by 3 against 0.
The two matches were five-goals, but 27-year-old Bam said she didn't know what she performed so great.
She said, “I don’t know anything about it.
I’m not the type of people who remembered myself in a few balls.
What she knew is that the American team has achieved four wins in the Olympics and will fight the team first with the British team who had failed after defeating Japan by 2-0 on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States met in the first round of the last match on Saturday.
Both teams are in the promotion quarter-finals, which will determine who will appear as the first team.
The team who reaches the first group will avoid meeting strong Dutch teams and thus be able to go further. The Dutch team starts as the first of the other group.
During Saturday’s match, the American team made miracles with amazing performance. to know, at the London Olympics four years ago, the American team dropped the bottom of 12 teams.
Bob was also in the team at that time.
Bamb grew up in Brooklyn, Pennsylvania, taking a basketball stake for the first time at the age of 3 (her twin sister participated in the sport in Drakexell) and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest national team member so far.
Because of failing to enter the final list, she missed the 2008 Olympic Games.
In 2012, she and her team members were not taken care of.
In the second year, the British Craig Panam served as the main coach, and everything began to change.
“This is a cultural, mental and substantial change.
We have not reached the current level in London.
We came to a complete turning.
On Thursday night, Bam lifted his head in the first half with a note close-up anti-man shot door.
India has not had any success in the game yet, but the team showed amazing hardness and kept the ratio of 1 to 0 until the end of the third season, when the bum broke out.
She walked the ball along the left side of the field, then cut into the middleway, shot into the net, the United States team 2 to 0.
Melissa Gonzalez shot the final ball in the middle of the fourth episode.
The United States set Jackie Briggs zero opponents for the first time in this game, each of the first three victories.
This time she was a superb play.
Bamboo is too.
Panam said, “We are in good condition now,” but how good it will depend on the result of the Saturday match.
Cold food during the period of depression.
In March 1933, just elected President Franklin Draano Roosevelt sat in the presidential office to enjoy lunch.
As a cooker, President Roosevelt liked the Fifth Avenue cuisine, such as chicken sauce and maryland waterfish.
On that day, his menu was very simple: tomato sauce, potato chicken, and a delicious fruit butter.
Jean Zygman said: “It’s in order to have food with those who are suffering.
Her husband, Andrew Co, added: “This also reflects the way Americans eat.
The couple living in Brooklyn Highlands are food historians.
Mr. Coco’s previous book, “Collaps” was about American cuisine, and Ms. Sigman told the story of life of tenants in poverty in her book “97 Fruit Garden” through food.
The new book they jointly wrote, “The Great Food” will be published by Harper Publishing on Tuesday, which describes the history of food in the United States during the Great Depression.
After showing some common opinions about food, they met a journalist in the sandwich store in Eisenborg, which is a simple lunch cabinet in the Kashmir area has been operating since the economic collapse in 1929.
54-year-old Miss Sigman put a cream cheese with a broken olive sandwich, while 57-year-old Coe put a chicken, potato and vegetable plate.
The reporter wrote a bulletin of meat that the couples thought these dishes were suitable for discussing a diet during the period of depression.
Mrs. Zigman said: “The bread was very popular at the time.
There were flower bread, liver bread, and soy bread.
They are all made from one raw material and one that can be poured in the raw material.
Imagine your dinner is a flower.
Mr. Ko was a monster.
He said, “They are like a pencil in your stomach.
In the years before the Great Depression, Americans were self-helped, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cooked meals for male farm workers, and breakfast, lunch and dinner had a fresh cake.
During the First War, the Americans delivered food to hungry Europeans.The Rich Food records how the country suddenly no longer became a rich country.
Mr. Co explains why he and his wife wanted to write this book: “At that time, food became the main topic that made Americans feel uncomfortable.
Another unpleasant topic is new foods for cold-acid: “Farm foods” such as bread and peanuts have become the main dishes, and peanuts are “the best way to cook the rest,” Ms. Sigman says, it’s because chefs can use the cream in sauce to hide unpleasant foods.
Fresh fruits are replaced by cheap dry fruits.
Meat that has been the main character at American dining table for years has become a rare luxury item.
Strange, big cakes only consider calories, compared to taste, and even basic cooking common sense, and people first consider nutrition.
During the study of the book, including various recipes, Ms. Zigman made a baked oatmeal filled with flower oil.
Mr. Ko said, “This is not common on the dining table.
Ms. Zygman said, “This is too strange.”
Flower oil and peanut beans are not compatible at all.
This is a characteristic of many household foods.
Family economists have influenced the country’s eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as the chef of the Federal Family Economics Office between 1923 and 1943, and this is not the only thing in history.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to "fine calculations" and dare to turn cream Italian with bad foods like corn into dishes.
The rich food is a rich “historic taste”.
Particularly fun is the government’s response to hungry people, such as the attitude of President Herbert Hoover, “I can’t take care of anyone else.”
Although he openly praised the simple Iowa farm in his childhood, his diet was so delicious as a millionaire generally.
Mr. Ko said: “He liked to eat European Western dishes, such as fish and garlic sauce.”
He was dressed in a night dress and was eating in a gold-wrapped restaurant.
He obviously disappeared from the people.
If not his wife Elino encouraged him to set an example on the diet, President Roosevelt might make the same mistake.
As the book says, Mr. Roosevelt hired managers are not interested in taste, so “food in the White House is not only the hardest food in Washington, but also the worst food to cook.”
When the United States returned to formally, many of the cooking methods during the Great Depression were abandoned.
Ms. Sigman said what remains is our concern about calories and nutrition, as well as the application of science to cooking.
This told the couple when they wrote the book, they learned more about Miss Sigman's mother's eating habits, such as how she didn't waste food.
Mr. Ko said, “She was very afraid of wasting food.
Ms. Zigman recalled: “She actually caused many lives to sickness.
For example, there was a “Creme Bubble” incident.
After removing the dishes, she and Mr. Ko took a dessert that they had prepared at home: this was the fruit buttine that President Roosevelt eaten at lunch.
Ms. Zygman said, “This is called the cream of the fruit, and adds that a new trend for a ordinary dish is the name of “usual cakes”.
In this dessert, there is no crème, only fruit, a bit of flour, sugar, water and coconut.
Everyone is hard to put it into a deep-glass brown shape.
Unfortunately, this dessert is good.
Mr. Coe ate the second and the third cup again.
He thought it was an acceptable dessert and told his wife: “Adding a bit of broken nuts would be better to eat it.”
Unfortunately, OPEC’s latest monthly report shows that oil production continues to increase in July, while Saudi’s production is more high.
The report does not ban the markets to question the reputation of OPEC, and the road to oil price recovery is fearful to remain filled with cracks.
On Monday, OPEC’s Round Chairman and Qatar’s Energy Minister Sadra said OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
OPEC’s monthly report on Wednesday showed that the entire OPEC organization including Gabon’s production increased in July to 33.11 million barrels per day.
OPEC also said in the monthly report that low prices of crude oil have driven global refiners to produce more refined oil, thus aggravating the level of market supply excess.
Affected by this report, along with U.S. increased oil production expectations and unexpected increase in raw oil reserves, international oil prices fell for two consecutive days.
By Wednesday, the price of light-quality crude oil futures for the New York Stock Exchange delivered in September dropped 2.48%, and the price of London Brent crude oil futures for the last October dropped 2.07%.
Reuters believes that the proposed oil producer countries meeting was not likely to make supply stronger, and the data published by the U.S. Energy Information Agency also pressed the market’s popularity.
Iranian official news agency Fars quoted a speech in Iran’s oil minister Zhangang on Wednesday saying Iran’s highest oil production is 38.5 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
Russia’s energy minister Novak said there is no need for a new round of freezing negotiations at the current oil prices.
The last meeting of oil producers was already in April and OPEC member states failed to reach an agreement on any measures.
BMIResearch Oil and Gas Analyst Emma Richards said markets and media may be overreacted to the OPEC meeting.
Helima Croft, head of the Royal Bank of Canada’s Commodity Strategy, said OPEC has changed market feelings by releasing signals that they would promote the deal.
This tool is like smoke and mirrors that trigger the eye (deliberately give people the wrong impression).
Eugen Weinberg, Director of Goods Research in the German Commercial Bank, said there is a low chance of OPEC attempting to stabilize the market through the September meeting.
This is likely to further ruin the market's trust in the OPEC, after all, the organization performed once "Wolf came".

According to the media, due to the previous massive flow of capital into internet medicine, the current problem of homogeneity of products is serious, the investment hide has slowed down and the capital has entered the period of observation.
According to the Hong Kong Elliptical Hospital Management Research Center, Internet medical companies have massive deaths in the start-up year, and about 20 percent of the start-up Internet medical have no longer existed.
However, when most internet health companies are struggling on the way of financing for round A or round B, a number of leading companies in the segment are still able to gain capital.

Ali is currently divided into three departments in the field of healthcare, namely Ali Health, Qat Pharmacy and PayBay Future Hospital.
King Zhang said that healthcare entrepreneurship will be harder than other industries: “It’s not only a matter of how much money it has, but also to steep down the heart, stand alone and slowly do it.
Watching Olympics at night can hurt your heart.
The Olympic Games in Brazil are going like fire, even if the game is broadcast at midnight in the country, many citizens will watch it at night.
In this regard, doctors especially reminded that there are health issues at night watching events that may lead to cardiovascular diseases.
If sleeping for a long time, the hormone is still greatly excreted, the human body will remain in a state of tension, cannot obtain normal recovery, easily cause vascular contractions, high blood pressure, thus cause cardiovascular diseases.
Korean speaking reminds that groups with high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood fat, smoking habits, family history of diseases such as cardiovascular hazardous factors are more likely to cause cardiovascular diseases if they sleep at night.
If long sleeping, not only the cardiovascular function is affected, but the gastrointestinal function, the immune system, the intracellular secretory system is affected, and even increases the risk of developing tumors.
For older friends, Korean recommends not to spend the night to watch the Olympics as much as possible, especially for groups with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last World Cup football match, Korean had long been diagnosed with a patient over 60 years of age with a heart attack or associated with a night standing competition.
Since this year, its department has been diagnosed with a number of patients around 25 years of heart attack or stroke, which is largely caused by a long-night lifestyle.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union delivered missiles to Cuba, almost leading to a nuclear war in the USSR.
The incident is seen as the peak of the Cold War, historically referred to as the "Cuban missile crisis".
But it is little known that the same time during the Cold War, a strong sun storm had also increased the risk of leading the US to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, which was first announced by researchers outside the country until August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a strong sun storm strongly interfered with the radar and radio communications of the U.S. army in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the U.S. ballistic missile alarm system, used to monitor Soviet missiles.
The paper, completed by researchers from University of Colorado, interviewed U.S. military personnel involved in predictions and analysis of solar activity and examined non-secret literature.
The paper writes that in the 1960s, to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly launching a nuclear war, the U.S. Air Force always had a part of a fighter aircraft carrying a nuclear bomb head flying in the sky.
The U.S. military commander did not know the culpable of the interference was the sun storm and not the Soviet Union, and ordered the fighter planes to enter the battle preparation.
Fortunately, the US military’s solar activity since the end of the 1950s and its research on Earth’s electromagnetic interference finally stopped this potential military conflict.
Later he summarized the information provided by the U.S. Air Force Aviation Agency and submitted a detailed report.
The direct consequence of this solar storm was that the U.S. army has since seen space weather as a battle worries and established a stronger space weather forecast system.

Complementary public sports facilities shortboard
The black coal field warehouses turn into a "green grass like a rainbow" soccer field; the factory at the top of the red brick, turn into a modern gym.
On the People’s Fitness Day, the South Lagoon Sports Culture Park, outside of Hangzhou, has revealed mysterious faces.
This was once a coal field, which was closed over a decade ago, leaving a lot of illegal buildings and living waste.
After repair, it became a sports culture park and will be officially opened outside in November, providing free sports spaces for citizens, and without doubt an entirely new landscape for all people’s sports.
This is not a reminder of Hangzhou’s Chengdu Chengdu’s body school, the Chinese swimming pool’s “Jongdu’s Military School” flooded several world champions.
The swimming pool’s name continuously produces its source, vibrantly interpreting the relationship between sport and all-popular sport—a rich mass basis provides good conditions for the selection of professional players.
The level of sports is closely related to the basis of all people’s sports, sports depends in a certain sense on all people’s sports, while all people’s sports also depends on the conditions of the site.
As of 2015, the area of our sports stadium per capita was 150 times higher than when New China was established, but it is still far behind the power of the sport.
In June this year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs published the All-People Fitness Programme (2016-2020), which will focus on developing mass sports as a focus.
To supplement this shortboard, on the one hand, the relevant department should take into account the layout of the stadium when carried out in urban planning.
On the other hand, public athletes that have been built, including athletes in units such as schools, should extend the open spaces as much as possible and improve the efficiency of use.
The Rio Olympics, which are currently running like fire, inspired people’s movement enthusiasm and awakened everyone’s awareness of participation.
Gillid receives a lawyer fee in a patent dispute with Merck's hepatitis C
According to the judgment of the U.S. district judges, Gilled Scientific Company has the right to obtain a legal fee arising from a patent proceedings against the pharmaceutical company Merck Group.
In June, after U.S. judges discovered Merck’s existence of illegal acts, including false proofs and other immoral acts, Gilled was free from paying $200 million in compensation due to Giled’s best-selling drug Sophie Bowie and Havoni infringing two of Merck’s patents.
During Thursday’s trial, U.S. district judge Bass Lamboson Freeman said Gilled had no need to bear the costs arising from defence.
Merck is trying to pursue Gilled to dominate the new generation of hepatitis C drug market. Gilled’s drugs can cure more than 90% of hepatitis patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilid and Merck accused each other, both claiming themselves to be an active ingredient of Gilid drug — the owners of Sophie Bowie’s laboratory.
US-backed forces have announced they have taken Manhattan back from Islamic State.
Forces spokesman said on Friday that all of the remaining Islamic State soldiers in the city had gone and the US-backed forces had fully controlled the northern city of Manhattan near the Turkish border.
After the disappearance of the terrorists in the city, the Syrian Democratic Force (SDF) is now scattering the entire city.

The Clinton couple made $10.7 million in 2015 in income, paying 34.2% of federal taxes.
Hillary Clinton released her 2105-year tax declaration on Friday, which showed that the Democratic president candidate and her husband in 2015 revenue of $10.7 million and paid 34.2% federal taxes.
In 2015, the Clinton couple’s charitable donations amounted to $1 million, most of which were donated to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton’s speech costs reached $5.3 million, and the former Secretary of State received $3 million in income from publishers Simon and Schuster using a book about her during her office in the state.
Clinton’s campaign partner – Virginia’s Senator Tim Keane and his wife, Anne Holton, have published a 10-year tax declaration.
The two paid 20.3% federal taxes in 2015.
Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmiere said in a statement that Hillary Clinton and Tim Cane will continue to be the markers of financial transparency.
A clear contrast to this is that Donald Trump has hidden for false reasons and has returned his previous commitment to publication of the tax declarations.
Although the law is not required, according to the practice, U.S. president candidates should open their tax declaration forms.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyers viewed the U.S. Tax Administration’s audit as a reason for refusing to publish the tax declarations.
Clinton’s campaign assistant Ian Sams said you are mastered on Twitter and attached to a single link to the tax declaration of the Democratic candidates.
On Thursday, Trump’s special legal advisor, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish a tax declaration before the audit is completed.
Those who criticize Trump, including the 2012 Republican president candidate Mit Romney and other Republicans, said Trump’s refusal to publish a tax declaration order that raises question about his net capital, charitable donations, commercial transactions and various other relationships, including relationships with Russia.
Clinton’s capture was strongly attacked by a online video on Friday that highlighted Democrats urged Trump to disclose his tax payments.
She presented this issue on Thursday in a Michigan Economic Policy Speech.
"For decades he has refused to publish his tax declaration, like other presidential candidates.
According to Political News Network, Trump had not paid a penny tax for two years in the 1990s, and the writers of the New York Times’s business column quoted several tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, both saying the situation may still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a major issue in the presidential election.
Clinton named the name of a billionaire investor, Warren Buffett, a provision that guarantees people with an annual income of more than $1 million pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire Hazaway company is based, where Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said he was also undergoing IRS audits and Trump was “afraid” not the tax authorities, but the voters.
The first tax declaration published by the Clinton campaign group was in 2007.
The average federal tax rate for Clinton couples who currently live in New York Chabac was about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and a total tax rate of about 40%.
The 2015 Clinton Couples’ Tax Statement Report showed that, unlike most Americans, their wages are just $100.
Their main investment was the low-cost index joint fund, and the Clinton couple's dividends and interest revenue was $109,000.

Jewish film producers criticize Berlin hotel removing Israeli telephone code in accordance with 'request' by Arab customers — Reuters News
A Jewish French filmmaker revealed to media that the Berlin’s Cabinsky Hotel did not list Israel’s phone code, and the hotel staff said it was in accordance with the “requirements” of Arab customers, which triggered a turmoil to the public.
The author of the Jewish massacre documentary "The Rainbow" Claude Ranzman expressed his disappointment in the Cabinsky Hotel and published an open letter in the German Frankfurt Report.
During his recent stay, Ranzman wanted to find Israel on the list of telephone codes offered by the hotel.
But Israel is not in the list of countries where guests can call directly from the room.
Israel disappeared in Germany’s capital Berlin in 2016.
Ransman wrote.
Instead, guests can call Israel via the call center of the Cabinsky Hotel.
To seek an explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel’s front office.
Ranzman said in a letter that the response he received on the front side “shocked him.”
The hotel staff said it was “a deliberate decision made by the Cabinsky Hotel Management.”
This makes the film producer angry.
Ranzman quotes the original statement of the employee: Most of our guests were Arabs, they asked to remove Israel’s code.
According to the Sunday Times, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hades Hendersman, called the case “a strange shame.”
We were surprised to hear this incident.
This in itself is a huge shame.
It is even more embarrassed that happening in Germany and the chain of hotels.
No explanation needed for this.
“We hope the hotel can get the right conclusion,” the official said.
The incident triggered hot news on the internet, and everyone thought it was a scandal.
Some believe that the Cape Town Hotel was simply “humble knees” to meet the demands of Arab customers.
Another post just referred to the hotel “Really don’t face,” and pointed out that the street located in the famous Qudam Street is near a Jewish church.
According to the Mirror Weekly, the hotel quickly clarified all the allegations, claiming everything was "ignorable" and apologized to Ranzman.
The Southern Daily quoted the statement of the representative of Kapinsky: “We have never received a direct order to remove Israel from the rapid call list.”
The newspaper also said the Israeli code has been added to the list.
Brazilian students use tear gas and rubber bombs to deport protesters
On Thursday, in São Paulo, Brazil, students were in conflict with the police during the protest of government’s public education reform.
Police used tear gas and rubber bombs to drive protesters.
The incident was caused by law enforcement officials trying to displace students, so the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in the demonstration and expressed their dissatisfaction with these programs.
To save money, Governor of St. Paul Oakmin plans to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students will turn to school.
Some of the students who participated in the protest expressed their dissatisfaction with the temporary president Michel Themer through the walls.
Just days before the recent protests, the protesters collectively walked to the streets in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who was buried by the National Senate.
Scottish cyclist Carl Skinner returned after winning a bicycle gold medal
Scottish cyclist Karm Skinner helped the British three team to defend the Olympic gold medal after the 2012 London Olympic Games.
This 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist replaced his Scottish counterpart Sir Chris Hoey, and became the middle of the team. When the young Skinner defeated the new Zealand team and returned to honor, even the legendary cyclist was proud of him.
Four years ago, the British team was surprised and Hoey won the fifth of the six Olympic gold medal.
The British team was ranked only sixth in the World Bicycle Field Tournament in March in London, and Hoi resigned from office since then.
During the Beijing Olympic Games to London, the British team's problem was to replace the "first round expert" Jamie Staff.
The team did this only when Cinders appeared.
Hoey's resignation also left an empty, and both Jean Imady and Matt Clampton wanted to fill this empty.
After seeing Skinner’s potential, the British team coach insisted on making him elected to the national team, and Skinner eventually was not popular.
Skinner’s partner was Cinds and Kenny who won gold medals four years ago with Hoey. Three of them renewed the Olympic records in the qualifying race, but this score was overcome by the New Zealand team in the first round.
The three British bicycles finally defeated the opponents and won a gold medal.
While Cinders was a bit behind, Kenny took the leadership for the team, and Skinner kept the leadership advantage until the end.
Change in strategy was the key to this turn, and Cinders chose larger flight and therefore slower speed, which allowed Kenny, especially Skinner, to keep the speed.
Hoey watched the contest as a BBC commentator.Skinna, Kenny and Cinders saw him as he ascended to the stage.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist Skinner said: “This is a surprise for me.
I just do what I can to make myself glorify.
We made an Olympic record in the final and defeated the world champions.
This is too incredible.
Nothing is better than this victory.
After winning a gold medal with Kenny and Hoey at the 2012 London Olympic Games, Cindes acknowledged that he deliberately fell on the track when he starts badly.
He later withdrawed the comment, and the opponents of the British team could not complain.
This victory has no such problem.
Cinders said, “It’s like in London, with a British flag on the stations.
We were just team three months ago.
We’ve lost a lot of world champions, so it’s so amazing to be able to defend the Olympic Championships.
This is just a match, a gold medal for British teams who won seven of the 10 squares of the field bike competition at the Beijing Olympic Games and London Olympic Games.
If this symbolizes the progress we have made in the past five months, we will continue to succeed in the bicycle for the next five days.
According to Kenny’s status, he was not likely to re-reveal the achievement of Hoey’s three gold medals at one Olympic Games.
If so, Kenny, born on March 23 (this day seems to be a holy day for the British sport, whereas Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister also were born on that day) would have six gold medals and one silver.
This score is equal to Hooke.
Kenny is going to start a three-day race that starts today.
The 28-year-old Bolton said: “I will focus temporarily on this game.
Team competition is always the best.
You can win the competition with your team friends.
Honestly, a man wins a bit lonely.
Cinders said, “If he could win another two gold medals, he would have been awarded the Jazz Cockpit.
It was the only match that produced medals on the day, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wickings, Ed Crancy, Steven Burke and Owen Dull promoted the four-mile group race with the fastest score.
Their score was 351,943.
The 2012 London Olympic Gold Medal winners world record was 351,659.
The first round and final (10:42 pm) will be held on the second day of the game today, and Vikings will undoubtedly be the focus of the crowd.
Yesterday he had a dispute with competition officials before the qualification race, when competition officials allowed him to measure height.
In the female team competition that will end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rothschild, Elino Bark and Kate Achebold from Melbourne have promoted a new world record of 413,260.
The British team rely on its strong local bicycle team to occupy initiative and wins several medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
After demonstrating their absolute dominance at the Olympic Games in Beijing and London, the British bike team was slightly disappointed in the process of traveling to Rio.
Several waves have occurred during the period, including April Tech Director Sean Saton resigned for allegations of gender discrimination and harassment, and the resignation of legendary characters such as Hoey and Victoria Benton.
But the first bicycle game night is enough to prove the legend that the British team will play again at the crucial moment at the top.
After the little life comes to this world, parents and mothers will be responsible for this life, which is responsible not only for the physical health of the child, but also for the mental development, that is education.
If you fail in your child’s education, even a career success can not compensate for life’s shortcomings, family’s failure.

So parents need to give a good example in front of the child, regulate their behavior, cultivate themselves excellent qualities, which can indirectly help the child shape a good mentality and make him better.
Amy is a smart and beautiful girl.
Her personality is outwardly vibrant, able to live well with friends, and good adaptability to the environment.
But Amy has a small secret in her mind: she can’t focus on learning and work for a long time.
This secret has been accompanied by Emmy for a long time.
Even studying and working through decentralized, modulated time, she is basically able to complete tasks and good results.
But when the task is heavy and time is tight, Emmy feels very pain and torture.
The individual’s resistance to self-exposure and their emotional experiences is not to threaten the individual’s self-conception and self-esteem.
Some behavioral psychologists also view resistance as disobedience of individuals to their behavior correction.
I tried to make Emmy an exercise that allows her to calm herself through a relaxed breathing way to feel that pain.
And once she left the situation that was obsessed, she felt relaxed and gained freedom again.

The head of the Department of Industry Coordination of the National Development Reform Committee said that the overcapacity of steel production is a global issue.
In recent years, our production capacity use has been higher than the global average and is higher than in countries and regions such as the US.
Our country has taken decisively effective measures to eliminate excess production capacity, and the results are progressively demonstrating.
The head noted that this global issue of the excess of steel production capacity is highly appreciated by the Central Government of the Party.
The departments and regions are actively implementing the implementation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, seriously conducting work, this year to reduce the production capacity of rough steel approximately 45 million tons.
Starting from our state, our country does not encourage the export of steel, on the contrary, it also takes a series of effective measures to control the export of steel.
The head emphasized that the international trade of steel products is in essence market behavior, which is independent choice after importing countries’ demand, consumer’s comprehensive consideration of product price ratio.
Implementation of trade protection measures does not contribute to fundamentally solving the development of the global steel industry, rather, only to further impact the international trade order.
When it comes to debt, the head emphasized that debt dissolving is an important issue that needs to be properly addressed in the process of dissolving excess production.
Because the assets of steel enterprises are large and involve large, the debt relationships of some enterprises are complex, and it is likely to cause regional risks if they are wrongly treated.
According to the head, in recent years, with the economic down pressure increased, the total social demand gradually declined, the use of production capacity in part of the industry decreased, and the difficulties of enterprise production operations have increased.
Some companies do not adapt to the changes in the market environment, and production operations are hard to think of even falling down, but are restricted by some institutional mechanical factors, more obstacles to retire in a marketing way, becoming a "zombie enterprise".
The presence of such enterprises, distorting market signals, reducing the efficiency of element resource use, increasing social management costs and obstructing the establishment of a fair competitive market environment.
The main causes of losses are similar to the difficulties facing the world’s steel industry – market demand is volatile and low production capacity use.
Our country mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic means and rule of law, and the government is mainly committed to employment and social stability, ensuring fair and fair market order.
The head emphasized that the next step is to be firmly continued to keep working on production capacity, ensuring the completion of the five-year goal of dissolving crude steel production capacity of 100 million to 150 million tons.
On 10 pm, the Chinese tourist police at the Red Square in Moscow immediately attracted the attention of the people, and Chinese tourists with surprise greeted their hands, and local and foreign tourists were banned from visiting.
On that day, a member of China’s first professional tourist police team, the tourist police department of the Trias City Security Office, Hainan province, arrived in the Red Square of Moscow to exchange a study with local tourist police.
Moscow tourist police was divided into three groups in the Red Square, Nikolsky Walking Street, Kummer Shops, and so on, and the Chinese tourist police study with Jang, the entire process lasted for more than an hour.
The police officer Liu Hinne, who is more than 20 years old, speaking English and Spanish, has just joined the tourist police team last year.
He observed the words of his Russian fellow in a row on the way, and did not communicate with her from time to time.
When I met Spanish tourists who came to consult, Moscow tourist police gave patience to each other in fluid Spanish, which left a great impression on King Ice.
“Everyone of the tourist police in Moscow knows foreign languages, some will have more than two, which touches us very much.
“Hainan as an international tourism island, is gradually focusing on attracting international tourists, and we want to improve our capacity to match the status of the international tourism island.
The Chinese tourist police also came to Moscow city tourist police group to exchange with their Russian counterparts.
“I’m often working with Chinese tourists and I’m very pleased to see them come to Russia.
The question they often ask for help is: how the road goes, where a monument is located, how to rent, how to return to the hotel.
Head of the Moscow City Tourism Police Team, Rezakov, said the city environment and tourism atmosphere in Moscow have been improving in recent years and increasingly attractive to foreign tourists.
In order to adapt to the needs of tourism development, a tourist police team was established in July 2014 responsible for the protection, assistance and guidance of tourists at major sites.
At present, all Moscow tourist police are skilled in English, and partly Spanish and German.
The police team divided them into nine groups according to the level of foreign language, two lessons a week, studying self-defense calls, legal regulations and foreign languages.
“Two tourist police are now starting to learn Chinese and we have spoken well and we will continue to improve their level of Chinese,” Rezakov said.
Rezakov told reporters that the Moscow Tourism Police has accumulated some experience since its establishment and hopes to be inspired by the three-Asian counterparts.
He believes the cooperation of the two Russian-Chinese police departments will enhance the sense of safety for their citizens to travel to other countries.
“The recruitment of the Moscow Tourism Police personnel, police models, equipment, and good interaction with visitors have brought us a lot of inspiration,” Chen Qing said.
The report found that at least nine provinces such as Hanoi, Qingdao, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Qingdao, Hainan, Guangzhou, Fujitsu, Beijing have issued residence permit implementation rules.
For the conditions for the application of a residence permit, the above areas are generally proposed to have a residence requirement for more than six months, meet one of the conditions for legal stable employment, legal stable address, and continuous reading.
The Chinese newspapers noted that in terms of treatment provided by residence permit, the "money content" all over the world differs, and the range of public services and facilities offered in some regions was expanded compared to the provisions of the national version.
These areas have increased the facility for children to attend high school at the local level where appropriate conditions are met.
In addition, many places such as Beijing have also expressly demanded to gradually expand the range of public services and facilities, and regularly publish to the public.
For example, FDA proposes to publish public services and facilities for the holders of a residence certificate at least once every three years to the society.
The provisional Residence Certificate Regulation provides that the police authorities must produce a residence certificate issued within 15 days from the date of receipt.

As the first round 12 show in 2014, Saric will officially enter the NBA next season and join the 76 team of Philadelphia.
Saric is a young European player and many fans don’t know him very well, but through the Olympic Games, he believed that Saric’s performance left a deep impression on people.
In the last match Croatia won Spain, Saric succeeded in closing Paul-Gasol's attempt to pull the match into the bottom basket of the time.
Recently, 76 team captain Brett-Brown gave a high rating to Saric, who believes he saw the shadow of Manou-Ginnobilly when he was young in Saric.
It is obvious that Saric has already demonstrated his talent and has made 76 people look forward to him.
In the first two games in the Olympic Games, Croatia won 24 points, 17 basketball and 12 supports.
In the first half, Saric demonstrated his ability to pull space on the field and, after a break with his team fellow, he put a basketball in the outer line of power.
While the 76 people currently have a lot of talented young players, they don’t have Saric’s outline capabilities.
From the gatehead to the launch of a long-term broadcast attack and complete the aid, the number of inside-line players can do this at the NBA field today.
Since the beginning of the Olympic Games, Saric has earned 13 points, 8 basketball and 5 supports in all three matches.
Since he decided to return to the Knight Team in the summer of 2014, James has signed two 1+1 contracts on a continuous basis.
As the NBA’s current employment agreement is coming into the last year, James will be at the forefront of negotiating employment agreement as the vice president of the NBA Football Staff Association.
Given the massive increase in alliance revenue, which must be due to the new TV broadcast agreement, as well as the struggle between bosses and players about how to handle the money, the outside world fears the NBA will fall in a stop next summer.
But for James, he doesn’t have to worry about being a free player next summer because he has already renewed a three-year contract with the Knights Team.
No matter when the season 2017-18 officially starts, James is under contract.

The future of Portland mining plant is full of uncertainty due to the cancellation of power supply contracts.
As an electricity company revealed that a plant owner would terminate a supply contract, which would put all supply contracts into force, the Portland aluminum mining plant in Victoria and hundreds of workers are now facing an uncertain future.
The initiative took place after the Victoria government decided not to continue to issue subsidies to guarantee the operation of the plant.
This 20-year fixed subsidy will end in November.
2,000 workers at Portland’s factory are likely to face unemployment.
Once the factory is closed, up to 2,000 people may be unemployed directly or indirectly.
And since the plant’s electricity consumption accounts for about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity output, the chain reaction is likely to occur.
In 2014, American Aluminum Company closed the Henley Corner Mining Plant, which led to the closure of Anglesy Island's power plant last year.
American Aluminium Company Portland Mining Plant is currently undergoing losses and risks of closure.
This initiative was made after factory's forecast for the next few years, initially due to the stronger growth of the Australian dollar, and recently due to the price of the factory products.
AGL provides electricity to this large aluminum mining plant through the Old Eyan Power Plant in Latrop Valley. The company predicts three other factories will also terminate its deal.
The largest shareholders of the factory are a joint venture of American Aluminum Company and American Aluminum Oxide Company, while China's Cisco Group and Japan's Tiro Red Corporation also hold small shares.
The joint company said: “AGL expects Portland’s factory to continue operating, that is, the mining plant will continue to generate electricity demand.
AGL said these contracts were “contracts that were supposed to enter into force since November 2016.
The contract expires for 12 months, so they will end in 2017.
The company said, “Therefore, AGL still predicts these contracts will continue to generate revenue for the fiscal year 2017.
Any potential income impact on AGL since the fiscal year 2018 is currently optimized by the futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said the company had reduced the contractual value of $1.87 billion in the “expiration expectation”.
The decision to terminate these contracts "not affect the ability of the Aluminum Company to operate the mining plant or to ensure the power supply of the mining plant."
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with Old Ian in 2010, which was expected to enter into force in November this year, but the company did not explain why it withdraw from the contract.
Analysts were cautious about whether Portland mining plant in Victoria and Tomago plant near Newcastle would be closed due to the poor economic situation of the industry.
With regard to the comments published earlier this week by analysts, AGL Operations Manager Stephen Mickelson said Portland’s annual electricity consumption reaches about 600 megawatt and Tomago’s factory reaches about 900 megawatt.
If both factories are closed, demand in the electricity market would be significantly reduced.
“As an electricity company, this is not a good news for us.”
Community Law Center rejects 160,000 people every year
Every year, more than 160,000 most vulnerable groups are rejected by community law centers. The funding for the service has been taken off and is now facing further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of five people were rejected in search of free legal advice and agent services, most of whom are elderly, immigrants, weak workers, victims of violence, and those without resources to combat unfair deportation.
The lack of funding for community legal services has already exceeded the limits and is now facing further funding cuts.
As of June next, the federal government’s funds for these legal centers will be reduced by another 30 percent.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Center, said, according to the latest report of the National Community Association Law Center, thousands of people are rejected every year.
Mr. Farrell said the situation would only be worse if the federal government does not change the existing decision.
He said, “The community legal center in Queensland is in a long-term situation of insufficient funding, meaning thousands of people will not be able to access the important services they need.
People in need of people away from violence, people with huge debts that cannot be repaired, families faced with disintegration, and oppressed workers are all facing legal issues, and the report shows they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut another 30 percent funding from June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We urge Justice Minister and Queensland Parliamentary George Brands to immediately withdraw the decision of these cuts to allow people to get the assistance they need to face legal issues.
Last year, the state government pledged to raise legal aid funds to the national average.
Now it is necessary to focus on the community’s legal center and its responsibility to the needs of the community, and the White Loki government must also be involved in this important work.
Donald Trump’s campaign team was accused of shooting staff
New York: Trump’s campaign team was charged with his Northern California Asia head for not working with a staff when he drove a jeep car in February.
Former software trainer Vincent Bodini, the state’s campaign team, described the incident at a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bodini said he had previously hoped that this could be solved internally, but after months of waiting he realized that it was impossible to happen.
According to Bodini’s description, the head of the man named El Phillip “wrapped out a gun, putting his right hand’s finger on the board, and putting the gun on Vincent’s knees.
After complaining to the leadership of local and regional campaign teams, Bodini learned from the bullet that at least four people have experienced the same thing.
Bodini said in the complaint: “No shooting does not mean that it will not hurt him.
Just two days before the case occurred, the Republican presidential candidate in North Carolina told the crowd that if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and chosen the judge her favorite, then “who supports the second amendment,” that is, someone who supported the gun and gun lovers could take action, which spoke anger.
Trump’s campaign team said the media corrected his speech and he didn’t advocate violence.
In his complaint, Bodini asked the campaign team for compensation for his negligence, while also asked Phillip for compensation for his attacks, strikes and mental injuries.
Trump spokesman Hop Hicks did not immediately respond to the message.
I can’t contact Philip.
According to a local news agency WCCB in Charlotte, Philip recently left the campaign team.
His consulting company Innovative Consulting Services did not respond immediately.
The Republican candidate Donald Trump’s campaign team is controversial.
Both sides of the case were the courts of Bodini and Trump's Presidential Campaign Company, 16-CS-14300, McLarenburg County (Charlotte) High Court.
Britain must translate the Olympic spirit and expand the Heathrow Airport
Heathrow will also bring vibration and prosperity to our communities, London and the whole country.
For me, it’s the place where Heathrow’s charm is, and we do our best to ensure that our countries and regions can benefit from these games as well as during the 2012 London Olympics.
The Olympics have made Strathford and the Eastern region a great benefit.
And we will re-prove the region by creating opportunities for local people and near Heathrow.
For our local community alone, we will create 10,000 new students jobs, 40,000 new jobs and let young people around the airport get rid of unemployment.
Just like before the 2012 London Olympics, some think Heathrow’s expansion is too huge.
I was told that Britain would not be able to prepare for the Olympic Games and we would be ashamed in front of the world.
Questions about the 2012 Olympic Games are wrong, and their doubts about the Hitchcock project will also be wrong.
While there are always obstacles that need to be overcome, Heathrow is solving every problem he faces.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project implemented for the majority and not for the minority.
Expansion engineering will create up to 180,000 new jobs, bringing £211 billion economic growth, leaving a wealth of technology and employment around the airports and across the UK.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team. The team has completed £10 billion in infrastructure investment projects on time and within the budget range, including the T5 Terminal, which has been elected to the world’s best airport terminal for five consecutive years, and the T2 Terminal between the two of the world’s most busy runways.
Now they are preparing to build a third runway with a private investment of £16 billion.
The UK has successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympic Games and I believe the expansion project of the Heathrow Airport will also be a huge success.
It’s a good time for us to transmit the spirit of the Olympic and expand Heathrow Airport so that we can guide our future and create a wealth of technology and employment that will make the UK proud.
Sir Paul Dayton is the President of the Board of Directors of Heathrow Airport and former British Finance Ministry.
A woman committed suicide on a Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
The woman who attempted to commit suicide was arrested by several cars on the highway on Thursday morning. Police are currently looking for witnesses.
The incident occurred on the A1 Highway near Moore, Woo on Thursday morning.
Police said a woman was lying “desperately” on the road in the late night and caught by several cars.
The victim was a 49-year-old Switzerland woman whose behavior was obviously committed to suicide. She was driven by several cars, including a truck.
The woman died at the time.
Police revealed that several drivers involved have been investigated, but some of the drivers have not yet been confirmed. Police are currently calling them and the accident witnesses to come to investigate.
The lawyer Gillers Hofstadt told the Geneva Forum Journal that criminal investigations are currently underway, which is a regular procedure for such incidents.
However, it is not yet known whether a driver will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collision?
Hof Stater said: “This will be determined by the prosecutor.”
According to the results of two other similar cases in the past five years, the driver will not be responsible.
Both cases were caused by someone who walked on the highway in the late night, according to the report, and the final judgment was that the driver couldn’t expect someone to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was accused of being killed in negligence, allegedly in August 2014, she hit a man on the A1 highway near Pyeum and killed him.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking.
After the investigation, the judge said the woman’s conduct was completely legal, and the man appeared on the road “entirely unexpected and unpredictable,” and the woman called an emergency.
Anyone who can provide information about the incident near Morning on Thursday should call 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 to contact the police.
NASA's climate model: Venus has been suitable for humans
According to NASA’s new climate model forecast, Venus has been suitable for humans.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Institute developed a model that could explore the past of Venus, the tools and algorithms used are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether the surface of the high-temperature, water-free and atmosphere-filled with carbon dioxide Venus ever had an environment similar to the Earth.
Scientists previously believed that Venus rotates slower because of its thickest atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus might have a thinner, similar to Earth atmosphere and rotates as slowly at the time.
The model can also show the early landscape of Venus.
The dry areas of Venus may be more than the Earth, but there have been enough water and geographic changes to fertilize life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early, the brightness of the sun on Venus was 30 percent darker than the Earth.
Anthony del Genio, a scientist at Goddard Space Institute, explained in a press conference: “In a model simulation at Goddard Space Institute, the slow rotation of Venus made its side of the day to two months.
This warms the surface and produces rainwater that can form a thick cloud layer, thick cloud layer blocking most of the sun’s heat from the ground like a umbrella.
The result of the simulation is that the average climate temperature of Venus is actually a few degrees lower than the Earth is now.
The evolution of Venus simulated by the model is so close to what previous planetary scientists have guessed.
Although life may have existed on Venus, Venus has been exposed to excessive temperatures and UV rays over the course of billions of years.
The ocean is evaporated on the planet, and the water vapor is also burned by ultraviolet rays.
With the flux of hydrogen, only the thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and the deadly greenhouse gas effect remains, forming the Venus we know today.
Researchers published a simulation of the new Venus climate model in the Journal of Earth Physics Research Communication.
Patrick Roy resigns as snowfall chief.
Patrick Roy resigned as chief coach and vice president of the Colorado snowfall team on Thursday, saying he has no right to speak on the team's decision-making level.
Colorado Executive Vice President Joe Sachs confirmed the report and said the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
In a statement, the 50-year-old Roy said: “In the past three years I have been able to fulfill the duties of the Colorado Snow Crash Head Coach and Vice President with vigorousness, passion and determination.
I have been seriously thinking throughout the summer about how to improve the team and give it a higher level of strength.
To do this, the goals of the main coach and vice president must be in line with the club's goals.
He also needs to have the right to speak in decisions that affect the team’s performance.
However, these conditions are not yet met.
Sachs hired Roy on May 23, 2013 and thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sage said, “Patrick told me today his decision.
We thank him for his contribution to the club and hope he will be successful in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Best Coach of the Jack Adams Prize League during his first season of snowboarding in 2013-14.
He helped the club obtain 112 points, ranking the middle area first, but Colorado was eliminated by the Minnesota team in the first round of the post-season, having lost their arms with the post-season in the last two years.
The 2015-16 season, the snowfall team scoreed 39 wins 39 and 4 negative, eventually losing the second extra card qualification in the Western Grand League area with a loss of 5 points.
As a Celebrity Hall keeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups and won two seats each for the Montreal Canadian team and the snowfall team.
North Sea Oil Farm Workers Stop Strike and Continue Negotiations
The chief negotiating representative said workers in the North Sea oil field have stopped the wages strike, and the parties in the dispute began a new round of negotiations.
Several strikes have occurred on the North Sea oil platform operated by Royal Dutch Shell against the oil field service company Wood Group.
According to a joint statement, “Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the current dispute resolution process.
We will start earlier next week and hold several full-day meetings in the next few weeks to review these issues.
The trade unions said its recent action was to protest the highest possible 30% reduction in wages, which was the first time in 25 years.
Wood Group reduced remunerations for North Sea contractors by about 9 percent this year due to market pressure.
Before the reduction of wages, the company reduced the wages of maritime contractors by 10% in 2014.
The company said repairs will help the company overcome market depression.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries because the company needs to simplify its business after its merger with the British Energy Company, British Gas Group.
Energy companies are facing pressure from crude oil prices and the UK’s decision to leave the EU in June.
Scottish parliamentary member Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss the largest labour conflict in the North Sea generation.
He said the North Sea is crucial for the regional economy.
Dave said in a statement: “In the North Sea and the whole country, we need an economy of service to the majority, not to the minority.
In 2016, the expenditure for the new project in the North Sea is expected to not exceed $1.4 billion, while the average project expenditure for the past five years was approximately $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of the Asteroid stars
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete rotation speed of the Asteroid.
New data is helping astronomers understand why the stars in the constellation have different rotating speed and the rotating cycle connections to the composition of the planet.
Luca Rebel, research scientist at the Research Center for Infrared Processing Analysis of the University of Pasadina, California, said at a press conference: “We want to learn more about the relationship between the quality, age, and even their history of the solar system by comparing our results with other constellations.
The Asteroid is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the constellation were born about 1.2 billion years ago and are now just in adulthood.
They reached the highest speed of their lifetime.
At the highest speed of rotation, these mature stars emit a large number of star winds.
When these star winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
As the stars age, their rotation speed starts to slow down.
Kepler measured the rotation speed of each stars by tracking the time of the appearance of recognizable star black (such as the Sun black).
The latest rotating speed data set indicates that the rotating speed of larger stars is slower than smaller stars.
Rebel compared the stars to a dancer, and the larger dancer is rotating faster than the smaller dancer.
Rebel said: “In the Ballet Show of the Aung Sanctuary, we found stars with slow rotating speed often higher in quality, while stars with fastest rotating speed often are the lightest stars.
Because the Asteroid is closer to the distance, it can be an ideal space laboratory for comparing star mass and rotation speed.
Rebel said: “The Asteroid has placed the basis for the two-way rotating theory model of young and older stars.
We still have a lot of knowledge about how, when and why the stars slow their rotation speed and “take up their own dance shoes,” we need to know.
Rebel and her colleagues described their latest analysis of the rotation speed of the Asteroid in three new papers. These three papers will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.

Civil rights groups send travel warnings to Missouri
Due to Missouri's discriminatory policies and racist attacks, the US Colour Race Promotion Association (NAACP) issued travel warnings to colour masses preparing to travel to Missouri.
“In the NAACP Missouri Travel Consultation, which entered into force on August 28, 2017, calls on a series of suspicious ethnic events in Missouri that all Afro-American travelers, tourists and Missouri people should be special attention and extremely cautious when traveling to Missouri,” the group said in a statement.
The NAACP notes that a recently passed Missouri law makes it harder for people to win discrimination trials, the state law enforcement is also to some extent targeting minorities, which pushed the organization to issue travel warnings.
Violations of civil rights are happening on people.
They were questioned, bumped or killed because of their skin color,” the Missouri NAACP chairman Rod Chapel told The Kansas City Star.
“We have received a lot of complaints, numerous unprecedented.
This is the first such warning that the organization has issued against a state in the United States.
The organization cited the ethnic murder of the University of Missouri on black students and the death of a 28-year-old black man in Tennessee, Tolly Sanders.
Earlier this year, Sanders died in suspicious cases. He was exhausted with fuel during his trip to Missouri and was detained by the police of Missouri without accusation of crime.
The consultation also stated that a recent report of the Missouri Prosecutor’s Office revealed that “there is 75% more likely to be checked by black drivers in the state than white people.”
Chabell said: “The consultation was to raise people’s awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri.
“People need to be prepared, whether to carry the guarantees to Missouri or let their relatives know they are traveling within the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI’s Hate Crime Report Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; the state ranks 16th in the country according to the number of crimes.
Travel warnings are also a response to the new law in Missouri, which will make it harder to prosecute housing or employment discrimination for.
Earlier, the U.S. states have passed immigration law enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement offices to arrest immigration violators, and the US Citizen Freedom Alliance (ACLU) said the event would increase the number of racial trials and have released travel advice against Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually published by the U.S. government against other countries, but recently, advisory groups have taken this way to respond to certain laws and trends in the U.S. territory.

BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city: making old people feel “live in a new age”
On January 18, the British media said Beijing may have a 3000-year history, but it also has rapidly transformed into a modern attractive city of today.
This Chinese capital, with incredibly high-speed internet, high-end technologies such as human face recognition software, has huge investments in artificial intelligence and has uncommon internationalized energy, is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners who are rich in the spirit of exploration.
According to the British Broadcasting website on January 16, German citizen Clemens Seychi said: “If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere later he quoted the song of the singer Frank Sinatra to sing New York City.”
Sheh, Creative Director at Travel Archives Magazine, said: “If Sinatra lives to this day, he would probably sing in a city like Beijing, and living in this city will make you feel “live in a new age” and always follow the trends.”
Simon Norton, who is located in England, but recently lived in Beijing, published an article on his personal blog site 4Corners7Seas, saying: “People generally have a sense of being in the center of some great things, which is hard to explain, but it allows many foreigners to stay there for a long time.
The city’s high-speed internet and a technology-friendly environment made everyday life easier than ever before.
Andy Penya Fuerte, who is currently vice-director for Beijing Children’s website in Manila, said: “Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cash-free society, where the Internet integrates traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for anyone to make many transactions.
But smartphone is just the beginning of Beijing’s technological ambition, face recognition software has been very popular and many mobile applications use this technology to perform bank transfers and payments, allow people to enter apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of the driver.
Beijing also recently announced plans to invest RM138 billion to build Human Intelligence Technology Park, where more than 400 will be located after its construction, focusing on developing various artificial intelligence technologies from biological measurement to self-driving cars.
Food is also the core of many major festivals in China over the years, taking part in these celebrations is appreciated by foreigners, and Spring is one of the most important social and economic festivals and also one of the most easily participated festivals for foreigners.
Sheh said: “I recommend helping Chinese friends prepare for the past year, cleaning the apartment as well as writing the new year’s blessings on the home’s bookmark is equally important, on the day afternoon, all members of the family gather together for a rich meal, and then keep life to midnight, to celebrate the New Year with a bright flame. For foreigners, to spend this evening with friends and family is indeed an integrating opportunity.
The number of foreigners in Beijing is numerous and is growing, but Chinese language barriers and facilitating communication between foreigners are easily an excuse for their not fully integrated into local culture.
“Some foreigners have lived in China for years, but they have almost no experience with their host country. If the first attempt to contact the Chinese is not successful, then you’ll easily have a feeling that it’s easier to be with other foreigners.”
In these so-called "old outer bubbles" (the "old outer bubbles" refers to foreigners only mixed among foreigners, without contact with local people and local culture - translators notes), foreigners are gathered in their communities, eating in Western restaurants, and only foreigners in friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a bit of ordinary words—that’s easier than people might imagine.
Sheh said: “One or two hours of private Chinese lessons a week or a broadcast study in entry level should be suitable for everyone’s busy schedule.
Even learning a few classic short sentences can be helpful when shopping, ordering meals in a restaurant or talking in a taxi.
Persistent air pollution is also a fact in everyday life, but government efforts in recent years have reduced some problems.
Inhabitants emphasize that it is important to go outdoors during warm months with often mild pollution, to take those blue sunshine days as an opportunity to explore the popular day park.
“Beijing is a Chinese city where you can find most things under the surface, and you can find great art and music activities, passionate nightlife, historical miracles, super-modern business district and ancient Ho Chi Minh City.

From a visualized map, the attitude of Eastern countries towards Bitcoin is more conservative than the West, and the countries that occupy global entities are still observing the legality of digital currencies, representing a large risk of black wing.

With the regulatory storms of major Bitcoin markets such as China, Korea and the EU, the global digital currencies led by Bitcoin have been drastically washed since this week, the bitcoin price dropped on Tuesday down to $10,000 psychically, making the highest single-day decline in three years.
In addition to the natural-induced price reversals of speculative properties, this round of digital currencies also has to do with a long-standing “host” – regulated risks.
At this important gateway, the visualization big data website HowMuch.net has produced a diagram showing the status of Bitcoin’s legality and regulation in countries around the world.
As shown below, green represents the legal market of Bitcoin; orange yellow represents the neutral market, although not publicly legalized the status of Bitcoin, but there is no major use restrictions; light pink represents the limited markets, that is, local governments attempting to method the use of digital currencies through the red line policies or regulations; deep pink represents Bitcoin being defined as illegal countries; grey is the country that has not yet been commented.

The article notes that the distribution of African green blocks in the map can be seen that the attitude of Eastern countries towards Bitcoin in traditional sense is more conservative than the West.
Russia is the largest country currently defining Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries that have not yet commented on Bitcoin and have not introduced relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are the highest levels of acceptance for Bitcoin, which is more concentrated on the distribution of green blocks.
The views of countries in the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are markedly differentiated, and the distribution of color blocks in the above regions is more confused.
Of which Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are all the legal Bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and so on have some restrictions on its trading and use, and more Latin American countries have not yet spoken about Bitcoin.
Of the statistical 246 countries around the world, 99 countries (or 40%) have no restrictions on Bitcoin’s transactions and use, the green and orange yellow areas.
There are seven countries (or 3%) that are limited markets (fresh pink), there are 10 countries (or 4%) that defined Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and there are 130 countries (or 53%) that do not treat digital currency information (grey).
This indicates that countries with global entities (53%, more than half) are still observing the legality of Bitcoin-led digital currencies in their territory, and represents Bitcoin's "black-wine risk" remains high, as some of those countries may eventually make legislative decisions to restrict digital currencies.
The article says the global regulatory authorities have not yet fully understood this emerging category of digital currencies, and the main reason most countries have not yet made statements.
Although Bitcoin’s “popularity” has been increasing in index levels since last year, not represent all countries’ interest, some countries may be worried that local currencies are threatened, or more concerned that digital currencies are used by criminal organizations.
Wall Street’s report summarizes in detail international regulatory news against Bitcoin since last week, including China’s beginning to hit off-field trading concentrated services online platforms and mobile apps, South Korea is still considering closing the digital currency exchanges, the EU says Bitcoin has not yet been widely accepted and warned investors about the risk of “compensation of blood-free” etc.
“2018: Global Central Mother’s New Year of Digital Currency?” said that 2018 will be the New Year of Digital Currency from any perspective of regulation, acceptance, criticism, and adoption.
Great powers such as Russia criticize the practice of Bitcoin’s legality, in fact, also to give the way to official issuing digital currencies.

Coutinho passed a medical examination in Barcelona that morning and signed a contract with Barça’s President Batomeu that would end in the summer of 2023.
He later appeared as a Barcelona player in front of almost 7,000 fans at Noccamp.
According to Spanish media, Cutinio’s total transfer fee, or up to €1.6 million ($7.77 million), is the first price in the history of Barcelona Club and Western Shield.
Since Coutinho is still injured, he takes almost 20 days to attend his exhibition in the basketball shirt.
What is another sacred thing?
Trump's White House is now targeting the statue of freedom.
The most certain sign of a regime change was when they started attacking the statue.
The Americans agree with this as anyone else. Therefore, Saddam Hussein in Baghdad’s Paradise Square in 2003 was thoroughly planned down.
Stephen Miller, as one of the key smartwatches of the Trump administration, is sure what was going to happen when he discussed with Jim Acosta from the U.S. Cable TV News Network (CNN) about the President’s proposal to restrict legal immigration strictly, he’s sure what’s going to happen to him to cut a symbolic shaft on the statue of the Freedom.
To be honest, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did this, then a group of ship owners and liberalistic followers would surely swallow him to life.
But he actually attacked the meaning of the statue, especially in 1903 when the famous poetry of Lazarus was written on the foundation (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller condemned Akosta, “I don’t want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Freedom is a symbol of America’s freedom to illuminate the world.”
The poem that you refer to was later added to it, not part of the original freedom statue.
In fact, Miller was right, but as he himself said, it wasn’t really about history.
This involves the modern reaction of Lazarus’ stunning words, the only country seems not only to invite any old immigrants, but also to invite the poorest of the poor: “Your tiredness, your poverty, or your crowded people desire to breathe freely, / the suffering people refuse your crowded beaches.
There is no “suffering people refuse” in the moment that our screen becomes more visible.
Miller had not been involved in literary commentary work, and he clearly indicated that these people would not be welcome in the United States of Trump’s time.
This conflict about the meaning of sculpture is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is actually in conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, as well as her friends in the event that took place after her death recording her poems on the base, was clear that the actions they were involved were highly politically.
The purpose of the sculpture was to express the connection between French and American Republicism through an ancient classic parable of female incarnated as a free goddess.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poetry, the image of a woman is no longer abstract, she would speak.
She gave herself a very different name: the Mother of the Exile.
The combination of the poem with the painting was a successful feminism coup and a devastating attack on American nativeism.
Just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers always wanted to change it back to its original purpose.
The great speaker Rush Limbaugh, a baptist at Trump's arrival, believed in 2010 that liberalism is not inviting anyone, but he is now an early new conservative who brings the fire of wisdom of America to the world of stupidness: "The goddess of freedom is unprecedented."
She intended to bring the flames of freedom from the United States to anywhere else in the world.
The fire is not lighting the American roads.
Unusually, Limbo is actually driven by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the perceptive perspective.
Lazarus's most imaginative practice is to be able to see it. When tired, poor but hopeful people can see it on the board of the boat after a long and often terrifying journey.
Surface, this involves the point of view of the world for those who seek asylum and have opportunities to improve their lives.
Her statues communicate to them and need the intention of hope and welcoming they heard.
Of course, this is not the point of view that Miller and Trump wanted to recognize.
They flame not for lighting the streets, but for lighting the hatred of their only source of power.
In 2006, he joined Global Records with a unique musical style, and became the first Chinese to sign a contract with the Global UK headquarters.
2017 World Cup: Neil Black highly praises Scottish team in the British national team
Ilidh Doyle recalled that the British national team had only two Scots.
Neil Blake, executive director of the British Field Association, said the team of 16 strong Scots in the World Championship team will make “enormous contribution to the national team.”
The number of Scotland athletes selected to attend the 2017 London World Tournament, which opened on Friday, reached the highest in history.
Blake believes that “Scotland is achieving unusual developments,” and British field athletes must learn from it.
“We accept and succeed in understanding this, and we will persist until we succeed,” Blake said.
“I’m looking for a conversation with people at the Scottish Academy of Sports and they think that it was related to their actions.
Scottish field athletes believe that this is related to their actions.
The British Field Association believes that this is related to their work.
Even the street people think so.
In any case, it’s a magnificent look.
Several Scottish athletes have been medals winners, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be 5,000 meters lower than Mo Farah, while Elidh Doyle was elected to be the captain of the group.
“Iris was a bit humble.
Her captain’s speech was incredible,” Blake said.
“Many athletes, whether they are for Scots, or wherever they live or train, get out of the room with pride, and get out of the room.
Alice’s passion and real feelings are very good.
The British Federal Silver Card winner, who will participate in his fifth World Tournament, said there are 16 Scots in the British national team, which is "incredible".
Previously, the maximum number of Scotland athletes attending the World Cup was seven, which is the number of participants in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-runner Muel is the leader of the army. She has created five British records and two European records over the past year.
She will participate in 1500 meters and 5000 meters project competitions.
Chris O'Hall, who participated in the 1500m project contest, is another notable Scotland player, before she has achieved good results in the season, winning the UK national pre-selection and Olympic anniversary.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first World Championship, when the only other Scottish in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was deeply proud that so many of her peoples not only joined the team, but also, in some cases, would challenge the medals to go to the final.
“The special thing to be a national team captain is that it is chosen by the other team members of the national team. Therefore, knowing your team team members have chosen you to struggle for extremely unusual achievements, anyway, it is a great honour for me,” she added.
“Of course, I’m very proud of all the Scottish teams.
It just shows how far we have gone.
And they are all the old basketball players here, the field athletes who are coming forward to the goal of the Grand Prix.
How did my captain speak?
Well, I think it is great.
I just refer to the fact that in this case we are very lucky because we have held the World Cup at the home.
That’s why it’s really important that we get great with the support of the hosts, as well as with the return to the Olympic Stadium.
I will have a second chance to participate in the competition, and the atmosphere there will be incredible.

Protect critics on Facebook: If you can't tolerate voters' blame, don't campaign for public functions
Our father understands the style of bad media.
Americans love Washington, but soon after all, the major newspapers began to violently criticize him all, from domestic policy to political principles, and no one gave up.
He was angry about these criticisms, no doubt.
But he didn’t bother these critics.
In 1783, Washington said, “The freedom of speech is deprived – we will be killed in silence and stupidness like a sheep.”
This reminds me of Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who needed to study from Washington.
Hogan’s employees blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people as they posted their views on his official Facebook page.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Alliance launched a trial against him earlier this week.
The governor’s officials thought the trial was very straightforward, and online reports were filled with their strong rebellion: “Who cares?”
Many people say, “This is just Facebook.
But that is important.
This is especially important because they are facing people like Hogan.
It was a Republican who served as governor in a democratic most state, and he was also surprisingly popular.
Of the 50 governors of the country, he was ranked second.
Hogan is not a reactive panicist.
He governs the state of Maryland and strictly adheres to the rules.
He is also very good in using Facebook as the main way to communicate emotions with voters, dramatically showing his head after chemotherapy for the first time on the homepage.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the Governor’s homepage comments is absolutely not necessary and ultimately very dangerous. This homepage is a public forum, an official administrative platform that is labeled by public taxpayers.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Sass, defending the governor's behavior, said she thought to block their comments was just a wanting to stop them a little bit.
But they excessively describe it as the flooding beast or angry cynicist of the cycling networks.
The Washington Post has talked to people who were protected by Hogan.
They are just a leader dialogue with their chosen people: their identity is a teacher, small entrepreneur, and a pastor, not a flooding beast.
They repeatedly expressed their comments are profound, respectful and not flowing down.
The pastor quoted the word of the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Boy's lawyer, Rachemy Salma Ramani, in Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked questions about hate crimes.
She wrote in the Washington Post’s News Story Commentary section: “I am kindly commented that I was disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also don’t like a group of people comment on the same topic, because these people are directly ignored by some who think they are so-called from the psychology, rather than viewing them as a group of worried people.
Governor’s officials called “intensive waste information bombings” may seem to be “resistant claims” by others.
The age of Facebook makes it easy to modify a message, it only requires to block a critic or remove a negative comment.
Also, cleaning is far more clean than in the past, to do the same effect in the past decades requires sending employees out to collect and burn newspapers with criticism or to arrest or scream protesters.
But that’s what’s happening now, but on a digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of speeching others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being accused by Twitter users because he has protected them on Twitter.
Last week, a milestone decision came in Virginia on such issues.
According to Jackson City District Judge James C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C.

C. C. C. C. C. C. C
Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bewin (R) was also admired by the American Citizen Liberty Alliance for its use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn’t be so difficult.
In Washington’s times, affordable postal fees and the internet had a similar impact.
The number of newspapers doubled fourth between 1776 and 1800, and some wrote anonymous letters strongly criticized his leadership.
And even at that time, Washington also had an anonymous flooding beast against him.
People use fake names, such as Yuricia, Valerius, Belize, and Portrait to the newspaper to criticize Washington’s decision.
According to historical records collected by the George Washington Journal online project, his office was flooded by petition and criticized his attitude on the King's Majesty Treaty with the United States of America's Friendship, Trade and Shipping Agreement with the United Kingdom.
But he did not shout them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of speech are the foundation of this country.
Real leaders need to accept that.
A lot of wind blowing in the market attracts people’s sensitive nerves.
Limitation of purchases is a hard drive for many urban real estate control policies.
In May 2017, Jinan established that undergraduate students pay a six-month subsidiary insurance continuously, to enjoy the same purchase policy of apartment in residents with local permanent residence account;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that requires graduate students to pass with graduation certificates and employment certificates within three years of graduation.
The policy is subsequently coded, the official said, “University students can buy houses at a price below 20% of the market price.”
In July, Qingdao was established that young people of foreign universities undergraduate and higher academic qualifications can apply for a graduation certificate.
In addition, there are also cities or regions such as Qingdao, Shanghai Phuang has also introduced a "introduction of talent" policy to reduce the threshold for talent buyers.
Xi Jinping believes that it is actually a struggle of large cities for the population, especially for the talent, keeping the population, especially for the talent, the city is competitive, and that is the most important meaning of these real estate policies.
Some even believe that this means the time to cancel the “limited purchases” of the building market has arrived.

The English Iris is looking forward to the first defensive crown, although in his 32-year career he has won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour at the same time.
The athlete at Shawpot said: “It’s really very special.
I don’t have a coronation of Estra Madura Open, because in the second year I won the game was canceled.
It feels magical to come to this place.
Golf is great here.
Once the memories of last year emerged, the last year’s victory was special for us, for me and my wife, Sharon.
It was a very special memory that we will always remember.
Return to home competition was Gary Ol, who was just 50 years old earlier this year, and then participated in the European Tour.
This was the first time he participated in the Scottish Golf Open in 2013.
Hellenburg, Ol, said: “The home competition is always more meaningful.
You want to do it; but you can feel that extra pressure.
I really to be able to play again and I’ve been playing golf.
I am satisfied with the current situation.
The three members of the team were the former Masters winner Ian Wusnan and the Young Championship champion Paul Broadhest, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark Manuttie.

A new set of water samples was just collected, and Liu and his colleagues immediately got busy.
At the same time with daily monitoring.
This year they are working on smart management issues of rural wastewater.
How to manage it well is actually a very serious challenge.
Zhejiang Zhejiang Zhejiang Triangle Institute for Ecological Environment is located in the source of the spirit of the Red Ship.
Nothing from a decade ago, until today.
Zhejiang Zhejiang Triangle Institute has developed into three national-level focus innovation platforms, the regional innovation group force of four hundred overseas students in Zhejiang.
The Red Ship Spirit is a force we need to follow and understand, and innovation is actually very difficult.
Every innovation is here.
It feels impossible to resolve the level, at which stage you have to persist, you are constantly walking.
People went up to the door, and now they went up to the bottom.
Do something for the people.

Courage to fight

They deep into the basic mass art galleries, local parliaments and some high schools in the interior of Mongolia, Chongdong, Guangzhou, and so on, and the new cultural mission for the nineteenth major spiritual Chinese artists.
I’m deeply proud and happy, and I’m willing to sink again, and write more about the fate of the little person of the great age.
There are some good suggestions in this field of literature development.
Now public literature is very exciting, and there is a lot of popularity.
It is constantly introduced to the excellence of the time.
It should be rooted with the base layers, deep in life, and then do works with a certain cultural thickness, positively upward, and at the same time with a permanent artistic charm.
It has already reached eighty-five and two hundred million hectares, of which 11 million hectares have been completed.
82% of the second round household contract land area, and the Seven provinces of Quraishi and Quraishi have been based on the report to the Central Government of the Party.

The first star of our space science satellite series, as well as the world's first dark matter particles to detect the satellite in the sky.
Over the past two years, the entire sky was scaned four times, detected more than 3,5 billion high-energy particles and obtained the most accurate in the world.
The results were published in the International Academic Journal Nature.
In space, we observe such a new one that has not previously been observed, which cannot be explained and explained by the already existing theory.

Looking for a toilet through the nose, it is the last century that many people remember about Chinese toilets.
It also incorporates more and more humanized designs.
It makes a lot of visitors feel impressed, the toilet constantly ventilated, no smell.
You don’t need to go to the toilet with your nose.
Not only changes the hardware, the software also follow it.
Tourism department requires that the area toilet should be equipped with toilet paper, hand washing liquid
But in some areas.
Does this civil service have been stopped due to the uncivilized behavior of individuals?
Managers from all over the world make choices.
On the one hand, saving is promoted through civilization suggestions, and on the other hand, technological innovation is also implemented.
Public toilets in Jiangsu Nanjing, Ho Chi Minh City etc.
Wash your face for three seconds, you can get a toilet paper for free, but to get a double, it takes more than ten minutes to wait.
Avoid abuse of public resources
It’s a habit that some visitors might actually think about getting the paper back, but on the other hand, we should also think about it.
Is there no paper in the next toilet that our visitors are going to enter, so this is also a special emphasis on our new three-year plan.
This imbalance is not sufficient to solve.
To push the toilet revolution deeper is to think more about what the crowds think.
There must be a third toilet that allows the family to accompany the elderly and children to the toilet.
We brought the baby to the toilet and we were not happy to go.
The girl's toilet kids are so small as if they understand a little embarrassed, that board is especially comfortable and it is convenient for us to take the kids.
People feel civilization and become the builders of civilization at the same time. In the village, the villagers of the Guangzhou Bay are building a new water bathroom in their homes.
It has already been significant, actively promoting the toilet revolution will not only help people away from illness, but also drive economic development to reduce regional development gap.
This toilet issue is a programming issue, a hub of development of social issues.
It is a national civilization engineering that leads to layout from the perspective of the state, and then solves small social issues from different levels of participation.
This adds all of our shortcomings.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia
Badentina Dage doesn’t need a oven when cooking.
She rarely uses potatoes.
Her house is located in Enaratali, the capital of Panaya province, Indonesia, where the housewife usually just puts a potato – the local people call it “nota” – directly into the fire.
A half hour later, the burning potato was taken out by a pair of unwashed hands, and the wolf swallowed and eaten.
Dajr was sitting on the wooden floor — she had no furniture, and there was also her place to do everyday household work, such as washing clothes, washing clothes, and the water was wasted, all taken from the nearby mountains.
In a room with no roof, there is an outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of the four wives of her husband, so she was not divided into the field to care.
The phenomenon of a couple is common here.
Of course, work until the evening is dangerous: most of the people in the village have no work, and many are drunk like the linen, plus a lot of soldiers here.
She said, “No one dare to walk in the village after 5 p.m.
This is a rare look at the everyday life of the Papua Highways, once a Dutch colony, joined Indonesia after a referendum in 1969, but it was also controversial when only 1026 elderly were forced to vote in front of the occupying armies.
Currently strongly demanding independence and against Dutch ruling movements will soon turn against the government of Jakarta, as the government exercises a high-pressure ruling over the region, isolating foreign journalists and defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into Papua and Siberia, while Papua New Guinea independently controls the east of the island.
Enarotali is a distant location, smoke-free; to get here you need to take a 90 minute flight from the province of Chaipra to Nabilire, then rental a car for 5 hours and go through the sea in the stomach.
There is no public transport here.
In this city of about 19,000 people, wooden houses are surrounded by bamboo bars, and roofed iron roofs are a variety of yellow-brown coverings made of iron stainless steel.
Few Indonesians come here, not to say journalists, and almost no foreigners.
Before the Christian preachers arrived, Mee Pago Papuans trusted a god named Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here too.
“We don’t wear these clothes, she refers to her colored bright handwashes, dark shirt and bright half-shirt.”
“We only covered our bodies with leaves.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live under the poverty line and the lowest rate of infant mortality in Asia.
This is also Indonesia’s Venice.
The area is approximately the same as New Jersey, with 153,000 people.The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine Glasburg is just 60 miles away, owned by the Philipp McMoland Copper Company, headquartered in Phoenix.
Only in 2015, Philips mined gold and copper mines worth about $3.3 billion here.
In addition, Papua’s wooden resources are highly rich, estimated to be $780 billion.
However, these rich resources are also the source of the tragedy of the Papua people, and so Indonesian powerful military forces have been able to constantly suppress them.
A 2005 report by the New York Times showed that Phillip paid $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004 and up to $150,000 per single official.
The Papuans’ demands for independence are increasingly strong, which threatened the gold owner and so suffered cruelty treatment.
Since 1969, more than 500,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by Indonesian armies.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass massacre in the papua tribes in the 1970s rose to genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report “We’ll lose everything” by the Catholic Church of Brisbane, embraced evidence of the previous year’s evil actions, such as illegal execution, torture – another report called rape and electricity especially common – and the cruel repression of peaceful protests.
Indonesian researcher Andreas Halson, Human Rights Observatory, said: “Violence is happening every day, so it’s hard to count the number of victims.
Papua’s resources brought a large number of immigrants outside Indonesia, and the oppression began.
83% of the population of the province’s 3.5 million are Christians, but the population has changed since Muslim economic migrants from the densely populated Naywa Island, Galimanda Island, Sumen-Greece and Sulawisi Island.
Noah’s snack store sells a mixture of chickens and vegetables, prepared with flower sauce.
Local people are trying to protest.
The 24-year-old Paniye local Apos Yue moved to the province of Chaipra to find work, explaining that “these immigrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papua people.”
This has caused local Papua people – mama-mama – to lose their markets.
Indonesian President Zoko Widodo (often referred to as Zokovi) has sworn to address the inequality and abuse of power in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The road to the President’s House of Jakarta has been supported by 27 regions of all 29 regions, including Panaya.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and today the local people feel being betrayed.
“We’ve been broken, we voted for Zokovi in 2014, hoping he will fulfill our wishes and restore justice.
In fact, just two months after Zokovi took office in October, Paniye faced the worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 Enarotali children sang Christmas prayer before the fire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly jumped on a motorcycle.
The surprised children told them to open the headlamps.
According to local pastor Ayet Tebay, one of the soldiers was not satisfied with their voice and then returned with four soldiers.
The victims and witnesses said these drunk soldiers were using their rifles to pursue the children.
Then one of the soldiers shot the children.
The 16-year-old Julian Jemine was hit seriously and comedy.
A few hours later, the nearby government agencies' election committee building was burned by the Bear Bear Fire, and the event increased the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football court in front of the local police offices and military command center for justice.
They jumped in the waita dance of the Babae Mee Pago tribe with a ceremonial hunt, running around the circle and imitating the flock of birds.
Some of the protesters began to throw stones to the military frequently.
According to an official document record seen by the Time Magazine, when the emotions continued to intensify, the soldiers received orders via internal radio: “If the crowd resisted more than three times, shoot immediately but the document was not published to local media.”
The 56-year-old Jeremias Kayoum, who was the leader of the district of Enarotali Kego Koto, felt that the danger was coming, calling on the crowd to calm up and asking them to return home.
But no one has the mood to listen to him.
He stood at the door of his colourful wooden house and told Time Magazine, “When I came back, my left arm suddenly shooted.
Kaumou still doesn’t know who was the gun, but he said the bullets came from the soldiers gathered.
He said, “There was a lot of shooting.
According to the local brother of Orpheus Yul, he was witnessing a shooting and saw three shooting in the body of Orpheus Yul.
Johannes told Time magazine, “I ran out to check his body to see if he was.
I found he was dead... I kissed him.
Bobby Police Governor Eugene Mendes told reporters that his subjects were just “protecting” the police station because the police station was attacked.
In 2015, the police spokesman and police chief Pujio Sulistio said “We must defend ourselves when someone is threatening to kill us.
It’s a matter of life.
According to Human Rights Observatory, five young protesters were killed and more were wounded.
The next day, the news of the murder was only slowly spread in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi made a speech in Chaapra, expressing his deep condolences to the victim's family and vowing to address the abuse of powers in the historical remains of Papua.
He said, “I hope this case can be resolved as soon as possible so that it won’t happen again in the future.
In October 2016, security minister Vilando said he would establish a non-justicial mechanism to address the historical heritage of human rights violations.
But the excuse for the release was almost sounding.
He said, “Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The focus is that we have been committed to solving these violations, but it also requires a process.
Then on June 5, in Jakarta, Virandon went out in a conversation with Time magazine, saying he did not plan to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
He said, “Everything will be resolved by law.
The United Nations have already been charged with Viranda over 1,000 deaths in the bloody independence vote of East Timor in 1999, but said 11 human rights violations in the region of Papua have been resolved, including Panai.
Families of the victims of Panayai's victims have spoken about this.
“In the past three years I have received four interviews, but things have not progressed at all.
Years later, he said, “I’m tired.
He still lives in fear now.
He said, “I’m afraid of it.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, afraid of being shot.
His brother, Yukabus also believed that the people of Panaya were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was hit by the army after helping to buri four victims.
He said, “After the body was buried, the army came to me.
The shooting has not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the district of Daiya near Panayai.
A building company manager refused to help transport a comedy man to the hospital, where a conflict occurred on both sides, one died and another 17 were injured, including children.
A 24-year-old man Lavianus Dowa drowned while fishing on the nearby river and died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company’s local office.
Police said the villagers were thrown stones to the police, so the police were shooting warning.
But the anti-violence forces (Indonesia counter-military police) started shooting the crowd and one was killed.
The 29-year-old Dominion Valley Badi told Time Magazine, “We were all paniced at the time and now feared they would replace him who lived near the hospital when he saw the wounded being urgently sent to the hospital.”
“I’ve been hiding at home for two days.
The Dae's parliament has called for the law to put the police involved and to remove anti-violence forces from the region.
Panaya has always been a place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development caused the dissatisfaction of the people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which were dispersed in the central heights of Pan-Eye.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebellion army claiming to protect the rights of the Papua people by dispersing attacks and kidnapping Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the senior leaders of the Liberal Papaya Movement were born in Panaya, including Tadius Eugene and Daniel Yudas Kogia.
Therefore, thousands of Panaians have been arrested and deliberately detained by the army for “protecting state sovereignty” in recent years.
Some people have not appeared again.
In the eyes of the Babaians, Panaya is a “place of forgotten tragedy.”
Poverty increased insatisfaction.
Rice sold in Enarotali is less poor, and the locals can't buy it at all.
Bread is far away.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly potatoes and some fruits and leaf vegetables.
Growing is a woman’s job, and every woman can take care of four or five pieces of potatoes.
They usually use most of the harvest for writing, and the rest is sold to the local market.
Ten pieces of potatoes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rubles (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has been drawn among local Papua and new immigrants, and the number of these immigrants has increased dramatically since the opening of new routes to the Nabilire Airport.
A small number of existing jobs usually fall into the hands of better educated and richer immigrants.
The Papuans rarely have the funds or the necessary skills to operate competitive companies.
John Gobe, President of Panayi Tribal Council, said “Young people don’t want to stay in this village... because there is no work or money.”
Babu is isolated from the world.
In addition, the restrictions on international media reports remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escoudie and Basel Lunchen were deported from Papua because they were “not working with the relevant agencies” even though they rarely received a shooting license.
According to Vice Director of Human Rights Observatory Asia, Flem Keane, Zokovi’s report withdrawal restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“If foreign journalists attempt to report unhappy Indonesian most eastern provinces of Papua and Siberia, they are at a new risk: a refusal of visa and a blacklist.”
Without media surveillance means international pressure on the Indonesian government is basically limited to neighboring Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries — Togo, Tulu, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands — called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “a variety of common human rights violations,” including the Panay shooting.
These countries also supported the Liberal Movement of Papua.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Armanata Nasil, who was not fully concerned about the allegations of the group, told Jakarta reporters, “Indonesia is still implementing a democratic system and freedom of the media, so evidence of human rights violations is hard to be hidden.
Local people want more foreign governments.
On May 4, when the Dutch Human Rights Ambassador Case Van Bal led a delegation of officials visiting Chapa, the local people broke the silence, crying: “We want him freely attended the meeting, but requested anonymously.”
Indonesia’s next presidential election will be held in 2019, but the Papua people said they are unlikely to vote for Zhukovi again.
Chairman of the Tribal Council Mr. Gobe said “Zokovi’s intentions were good, but everyone around him was involved in the Paniye shooting.
He wanted to let Zokovi know that the people of Panaya are not only living under the threat of a greedy army, but also nothing, that the region has little education and lack of public healthcare services.
Mr. Gobe said the Panias people, like the other Pabians, thought their vote to Zokovi was a debt he had to pay.
“They don’t need money, they need justice.
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Panay shooting still make their last symbolic rebellion: buriing a victim's body in the opposite of that military police station.
They know justice may never come, but at least they will not let those guilty forget their crimes.
Yukabus said, “My family was killed.
What else can we do?”

Reuters said Samsung Electronics on Tuesday released the first self-driving vehicle components developed in collaboration with Harman International, as well as information entertainment solutions, which are an important initiative for the company to enter the vehicle electronics market.
Samsung Electronic purchased Haman International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Exhibition (CES) held this week in Las Vegas, Samsung launched car cameras with collision warning, road removal warning and cruise control, which were developed in cooperation with Hamman.
Samsung plans to launch this camera system this year, built on technologies such as machine learning and augmented reality.
Samsung also showed the “digital cockpit” that even if the driver is not the driver, it can make the vehicle more personalized, as the system allows users to download the driver’s information from mobile devices and clouds.

The fire again swallowed in Dubai’s “Fire Tower”
One of the world’s highest residential buildings in Dubai burned on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to escape the 337 meters high, 79 floors.
It was the second big fire in just two years, and it happened in a mountain tower known as the “fires”.
The building has been evacuated, no person is injured, and no reason for the fire is yet found.
“We were asleep and then we were awakened by the fire, and people began to scream.
We run down the stairs and run from the 50th floor for about 10 minutes,” a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said fire forces have destroyed the fire around 4 p.m. local time (Greenwich Standard Time 0000) and are undergoing heating treatment for the building.
The government has said it is trying to provide shelter for the affected people.
The incident could again trigger concerns around the world about the safety of the use of external wall materials in high-end buildings.
A survey conducted by the “Fire” Mountains Building Administration after its 2015 fire found that most of the damaged objects were covered outside wall panels for decoration and isolation.
British police have said they believe the problem with the insulation and panels in London’s Greenfield building may cause the rapid spread of the fire in June, which caused about 80 people to die.
The Williams team also suggests that Massa is likely to return, although he has already announced his resignation.
Only a month from the opening of the Olympic Winter Olympics in Korea on January 9, with the transfer of preheating and preparatory work from south to north, the winter Olympic atmosphere in Korea is increasingly intense.
The Korean public is looking forward to this long-standing Korean conversation to bring a "colored egg" for a month when the Pyongyang Winter Olympics are recalled.
On November 1st, Pyongyang Winter Olympic St. Fire arrived in Korea.
The warmth of the Holy Fire is directly reflected in the sale of tickets for the Winter Olympic Games.
Just more than two months ago, the ticket sales rate for the Winter Olympics remained only 32%, the ticket sales rate for the Winter Olympics was only 4.3%, and the low ticket sales rate once made the outside world worried about the popularity of the Winter Olympics.
But as Pyongyang Winter Olympics Committee chairman Li Yuan Lang recently predicted to reporters, “As the Winter Olympic Fire is transmitted across Korea, the warmth of the Winter Olympics is increasingly rising, and I believe the ticket sales will soon improve.”
According to Korean media, since January 3, Pyongyang Winter Olympic ticket sales have reached 64%, and the Winter Olympic ticket sales rate has also crossed 50%.
In order to encourage foreigners to visit Korea, the South Korean Law Department also announced on the 8th day that it will extend their stay in Korea for foreigners to visit Korea to the Pyongyang Winter Olympics, with a maximum of 120 days.
Survey found that more than one fifth American travelers carry illegal items on board.
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20 percent of passengers deliberately or unintentionally packed illegal items on board through the U.S. Transport Safety Authority inspection station, and at least 6 percent of passengers deliberately carried illegal knives or other arms.
Less than 1% of the passengers said they had discovered the mistake of the trip with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people conducted by the packaging company Stratos Jet Charters Inc. and found that young travelers are more likely to openly ignore regulations.
Of the respondents who had intentionally attempted to carry TSA illegal items on board, 19.7% were for the millennium generation, compared to less than 15% of the X generation population.
The most common items intentionally overtaken by TSA Safety Inspectors are food and drinks.
More than 3% of respondents acknowledged that they had intentionally carried with a bracelet, while 2.2% of women and 3.7% of male respondents also said they had intentionally carried illegal drugs on board.
The company said the investigation of national travelers was aimed at knowing the number of people accidentally carried and deliberately carried embarrassment through the aircraft.
It’s not surprising that those who are most likely to carry customs inspections — deliberately or unintentionally — are those who fly the most frequently.
However, the company notes that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and difficult to understand.
People are usually uncertain what kind of liquids they can carry.
Therefore, it’s not surprising that TSA’s most paid is just a non-prohibited liquid.
It was once believed that TSA could also use books as a embargo.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry them.
U.S. Environmental Agency Director Prut Changes Idea About Obama's Emission Reduction Regulations
A day after being charged by 15 states, the Environmental Protection Director Scott Prut changed his earlier decision to postpone implementation of Obama's time regulations to reduce the emissions of smoke air pollutants.
Prut proposed this change as the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond faster to the needs of the environmental regulatory state agencies compared to previous governments.
He did not mention the legal challenges of the Federal Court of Appeal against his previous post.
The controversy focuses on setting a deadline for states to begin implementing the ground ozone standard for 2015 on October 1.
In June, Prut announced he would delay for about a year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid “interfering with local decision-making or hindering economic growth.”
Before being appointed by President Donald Trump, Prut was the Prosecutor General of Oklahoma, who has long been opposed to stricting environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Prut has repeatedly turned to block or delay regulations against the chemical and fossil fuels industry.
The sudden turn on Wednesday was one of the latest legal barriers to the Prut regulatory return agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled the Director of Environmental Protection, attempting to delay the implementation of the Obama administration requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Prut suggested a big turn of his attitude towards ozone standards, saying it would strengthen the Environmental Protection Agency's commitment to cooperate with states to implement complex procedures to reach new standards.
“Under the previous government’s administration, the Environment Agency usually does not reach the specified deadline, and then wait for the prosecution of radical groups and other people, and agreed by agreement to establish a specified schedule for him to initiate a decade of prosecution against the Environment Agency in his previous work.”
“We don’t believe in regulations conducted through the trial and we take the deadline seriously.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously.
However, a statement of the Environment Agency said Prut could again use his "delayed license and all other legally available licenses" to ensure that the provisions comply with "good policies and best available information".
Republicans in the Congress are promoting a massive reform of the ozone layer regulations.
The House of Representatives approved last month aimed at delaying 2015 rules for at least eight years.
This measure has not been voted in the Senate yet.
New York State Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman led the coalition of states this week to accuse the U.S. Environment Agency, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said, “The reversion of the U.S. Environment Agency – after we filed the trial – was a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with the communities of more than 1.15 billion Americans directly affected by smoke emissions.
California, Connecticut, Tel Aviv, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia have joined the members of the state of New York to participate in the case.
Ground ozone is common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, refineries, chemical factories and other sources in reactions under sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause severe breathing problems in the sensitive population, causing thousands of premature deaths every year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists are pleased with the surprising transformation in Prut.
Laurie Ann Bird, from the Centre for Biodiversity, said: “It is alarmed that this common sense measure is under the massive pressure of the department responsible for protecting the air we need to breathe.
“We must struggle with the Trump administration against pollutants and special interest groups.

On July 13 morning, the US Somaltus Company filed a lawsuit to the East Texas District Court, accused Apple of violating a battery technology patent that it applied in 2010.
The company has previously accused Huawei, Sony, Samsung, and Tokyo with the same patents.
The case said the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices have infringed the US patent No. 7,657,386, which is called the Integrated Battery Service System.
The applicant wishes to receive cash compensation, or a patent fee on the infringement equipment after the sentence was announced.
According to the prosecutor’s judgment, the prosecutor appears to believe the iPhone’s fast charging function infringed the company’s patent.
The fast charging iPhone will quickly charge up to 80% of the power, and then it will be charged again.
Somaltus is actually a so-called “patent wicked” because the company does not offer obvious products and services, and it is hard to find relevant information online.
However, they have successfully reached out of court reconciliation on the patent with automotive manufacturers such as Ford and Nissan.
The conference believes that accelerating the development of information, promoting the interconnected integration of resources, efficient use, raising the level of industrial digitalization, intelligency, promoting “China Manufacturing 2025” and mass entrepreneurship, all people innovation, cultivating new energy, improving the quality of life of masses.

Leaked telephone records show that Trump had pressed Mexico to pay for the construction of a border wall.
The Washington Post reveals records of the calls between President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On January 27, in a call to Mexican President Enrique Penna Neto, Trump urged him to stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the construction of the border wall.
The U.S. president was not satisfied with his public attack on the Isolation Wall, and Putin allegedly told him: “Don’t tell the media.
Trump pledged to build an isolation wall on the southern border of the United States during his election campaign and announced that he would pay Mexico for the project.
The record of his calls between Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also published, which showed tensions between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the transaction with the U.S. to send refugees to Australia was “absurd,” “odiac” and “fool,” he had suggested the United States to ban refugees reinstaller, and now insist on the transaction under the Obama administration’s rotation, which would make him look like a “fool.”

Mor Beach catastrophe: Activists rebuild racial private penalty and extend justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car passed through a group of observers in the small town of Menro, Georgia, towards the small Moore Beach Bridge.
There were four black passengers and a white driver on the car, and a group of white men with guns walked forward and blocked the way forward before the car arrived on the bridge.
The head of this band, a middle-aged man wearing thin tracks, breathed a cigarette deeply and looked into the windshield.
The passengers in the car were full of fear.
“We want – Roger!” he cried.
Take him out of the car!”
A young black man was pulled down on the passenger seat of the former, screaming broke down the silence.
Fortunately, this terrible scene on July 22 was just a repeat.
But when Roger’s neck was covered, almost all the surrounding audience gave real breath.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Mor Beach Bridge, replaying the scene on the night that two black couples – Roger and Dorsey Marcon and George and Merry Dorsey – were hanged in private prison in 1946.
Nobody has never been accused of murder.
“While we know who they are, even though we’ve seen them in the community, no one has been arrested in these years, it’s incredible,” said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the replay.
“It’s the dirt of history, it’s the burden of our souls.
Brookes, 71, is a former parliamentary member of Georgia and a lifetime defensive activist.
For him, the repeat was a remarkable call call, which every year reminds people of the Menro community that injustice has never been corrected.
“We want to prosecute, we want to arrange a case, we want to cure, we want reconciliation, but we must first get justice,” he said.
Unless we get justice, we will not get healing and reconciliation.
On July 27, 1946, the body inspector covered a bed sheet on the bodies of a private prison victim in Mor Beach.
According to the Federal Investigation Bureau’s archives obtained by the National Broadcasting Company News, more than 50 men from Menro and surrounding counties are suspected of participating in private convictions.
But none of them was accused.
While the number of suspects has been out of law for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivation for the implementation of private sentences is well known throughout the city: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the first election later in the summer of that year.
According to the Federal Investigation Bureau, about at the same time, the black farmer Roger Malcolm murdered the white landlord Barnet Hester in a struggle - it looked like it was for a woman.
Brookes said the city's rumors were that Hester was sleeping with Malcolm's wife Dorsey, and her baby was not her husband.
The Federal Investigation Authority said on July 25, 1946, the prominent white landlord Roy Harrison spent $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
Dorsey and his brothers Mary and George Dorsey accompanied him to prison.
But when they came back from prison, near to Mor Beach Bridge, a group of private prisoners surrounded the car.
“It turns out that it was Harrison’s organization and ordered to execute the murder,” a FBI report concluded.
“It is obvious that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement agencies that not only participated in murder, destroyed evidence, but also hidden the identity of witnesses.
Bruce is very simple.
He said, “This is a voting case.
“They were murdered and the murderer sent a message to the black people in the community: ‘If you register and vote, you will face the same end.’”
For almost a decade, Cassandra Green has been responsible for the annual repeat of the Mor Beach Bridge’s private crash.
Her expression tactics are clear, attractive and has a deep racist background. Many people want this racism to no longer exist in the United States.
It looks hard, not harder, but Green says that’s the key.
“We don’t want to talk about private punishment, because private punishment makes us face the ugly side of everyone,” she said.
“But if you don’t listen to me talking, or you don’t hear me tell me about my own experience, I can’t establish a relationship with you.
This year’s performance began in June and on the first day, almost 30 actors – dozens of white and the rest of black – were wrapped in a house, listening to Green’s performing overview.
Weed Malbo serves as Green’s co-director.
He has been playing the role of the 3K party for years, but he said it was never easy.
“I feel dirty because I am not such a person,” Malbo said.
“But I think it’s important to keep this history vibrant, because we don’t want to return to that time again.
In the room, actors by Roger Malcolm and Barnet Hest, Darious Bradshow and Nick Rasconna perform their vocabulary.
At the beginning of the show, Malcolm cried out and pushed Hester, angry on his sleeping wife Dorsey.
“I said, go out of my ground!”
Rashford returns.
Then they kicked up.
Then everyone (at least all black actors) exploded laughter.
Green laughed the hardest.
“What’s happening?” asked Rascona.
He was paniced and confused.
Have I played too much?
“No,” said Green laughing.
“I just think white people don’t say ‘Oh’ when they react.
“Yes,” another black actor spoke.
“Your voice must be strong.
So the energy in the room changed; the feeling of friendship disappeared from discomfort.
Everyone is trying to do this, not only to perform the show, but also to commemorate the four victims.
The site starts again.
This time, Rascona said that “Oh” word, his voice was sharp and strong.
No one laughed.
The repetition ended quickly and strongly.
A shooting, a shooting, and then a silence.
A woman in a funeral black dress stood next to the body of the actor, singing Billy Hallowe's compliment "Strange Fruits".
Her voice pressed other words.
A hundred meters away, about 40 viewers were constantly washing sweat and tears.
Black and white represent almost half of the audience.
A couple visited the show from New York City Isaac, and many of them live near the streets.
Brookes took them to Malcolm and Dorsey's cemetery, about eight hours away, and all suffered the unpleasant humidity of Georgia.
Until that time, the murderer was still a fan, but now, standing on the same land in private prison, anxiety flooded in the air.
When the last sign of the song disappears, Green asked people to close some of the bodies that the actors played.
The children climbed down their head, looked at false blood and bodies, stealing each other’s private language.
“They aren’t really dead,” a little boy cried out, as if he reminded himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and then the performance ended.
The actor laid off the private punishment string and washed tears.
Brad Shaw embraces a dressed man for the purpose of playing the 3K party leader Malbo.
Nick Rasconna hugged his two colleagues, crying in their arms; the emotions in the performance eventually infected him.
“No matter,” one of the women spoke lowly.
“We know that your heart is not that.
You do this for a reason.
After that, the audience sat down to dinner with the actor.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta talked intimately with a black couple they just met, talking about things that were repeated.
Dennis Duplinsky was hard to find words to describe her feel after watching.
“It’s hard to imagine those terrible words and acts... what people like you say and do because they look like you,” she said.
“This for me really makes me think the private sentence is still going,” she added, “now this thing is only called a police shooting.
In the room, Tyron Brooks sitting at the table, tasting and re-tasteing citizenship rights.
He said he had started planning his performance next year.
“Repetition is an inspiring way as it describes the horror we have experienced, but it is also very educational,” he said.
If you don’t learn from it, it may happen again.
Those who do not study or understand their history are determined to repeat the story.
The importance of the reform in the “pipe-net independence” for the gas marketing reform is unclear, but resistance and controversy are also larger.

Scientists from China's Air Force Engineering University research laser satellites for cleaning space waste
Chinese scientists have proposed a bold innovative proposal to use large laser to clean Earth’s orbit, destroy old satellites and their sky waste.
According to the U.S. Press Weekly website on January 15, researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University have written a paper entitled “Small-scale space fragments displacement model study” which describes how space fragments can be radiated by laser into smaller and less harmful fragments.
For years, space waste has always been an issue of interest by the International Space Agency, and the U.S. Space Agency has considered a range of options for tracking, detection and removal of artificial fragments.
The methods of cleaning large-scale space fragments include huge networks used to clean up and collect waste, as well as magnets that can be used to absorb them out of orbits. Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies to find the following conclusion that this would be an effective way to clean the Earth's orbits.
The paper summarizes: “(simulation research) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of the laser-cleaning space fragments technology of the sky-based platform.
A 2014 study by American defence giant Lockheed-Martin found that there are about 200 threats every day to satellites running along the orbit.
High-speed fragments along the Earth's orbit are seen as a serious threat to future space missions, described by experts of the European Space Agency as a "fatal series of threats".
According to the U.S. Mass Machinery’s monthly website on January 17, the space is essentially empty, but the space on Earth is increasingly overwhelming.Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another fragment running around the Earth, and these fragments will accumulate over time.
The more fragments are, the higher the chances of a satellite that still operates normally will be hit by the fragments, which will damage or destroy an investment worth millions of dollars.
All space agencies have prepared plans to clean space waste in the future.
NASA is considering to reduce the speed of fragments using spraying gas to get them out of orbit, Europe is considering launching a satellite with a large network, catching the fragments and bringing back to Earth, and Japan’s idea is to catch the fragments with an electric chain.
China has also proposed a way to solve space waste by using a large laser to cut floating space waste into small pieces less harmful.
According to a paper published in the German Monthly Journal of Optics, a group of researchers from the Chinese Air Force Engineering University, installing such a laser on a satellite would clean space efficiently enough, at least according to the simulation results.
The only way to confirm its validity is to conduct tests and there is no arrangement for such tasks yet, but maybe early later someone will install a laser on the satellite and then send it into space.
Once we do it, we can finally start eliminating the problem of space waste once and for all.

Growth Repeat 3,000 Jobs to Reduce Shares to Restore Business
The British Education Group cultivation group said on Friday it would repair 3,000 jobs and significantly cut mid-term shares by 72 percent because it has started another restructuring project to address business pressure.
Chief Executive John Falen said the majority of the cuts will take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, with a reduction of 4,000 jobs in the previous restructuring.
In May, the Pharmaceutical Group announced it plans to cut another £3 billion in its third cost reduction project to revive business impacted by rapidly developing digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its shares in the Penguins Laden library to its partner Bethasman, and published a report that its basic sales rose 1% in the first half to £205 billion, but said the outlook was unchanged this year.
A few days ago, China Tango Group seriously issued a warning, rigorously replacing the run phenomenon, and prepared to impose a lifetime prohibition for the infringement.
Kabul suicide bombing killed NATO soldiers
According to official reports, a military team undergone a suicide bombing attack in Afghanistan’s capital Kabul, which killed a NATO soldier and wounded several people.
NATO said five soldiers and a translator were wounded.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident that occurred in the city’s carabakh area.
This is the latest violent attack faced in Afghanistan – Tuesday’s Herat Mosque bombing killed more than 30 people.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.

The latest results of the Swedish refugee age assessment test
Swedish refugees tested using the latest methods to medically evaluate their age, and the latest results showed that more than 80% of respondents were judged to be over 18 years of age, but not everyone believed in their accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Legal Medicine (R?ttsmedicinalverket) started the test earlier this year.
After the lack of accurate assessment of the age of refugees claiming minor, the Swedish Migrationsverket designed these tests to make a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Immigration Office has sent 6880 tests, and the Center for Legal Medicine has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
80% (2002 people) were judged to be over 18 years of age or older, but in another 25 tests, the Swedish National Legal Medical Center also judged the subjects "put be over 18 years of age or older."
In 432 trials, the result was that the person was “per under 18 years of age.”
Testing is only for people with age questionable.
According to John Granson from the Center for Legal Medicine, the results were in line with the results of the previous months.
He told The Local, “These data are not very different from the previous months, and the figures are very consistent.
The higher percentage of cases who were judged to reach the age of 18 or older does not necessarily mean these refugees lying about their age.
In May, the center published 581 tests and stated that 442 cases "indicate that the subjects were over 18 years of age or older."
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of 581 published tests and found that 243 of them had publicly stated that they would be 18 years old this year.
X-ray examination of the intestinal teeth, nuclear-magnetic resonance scan of the joints, and then analysis of the results by dentists and radiologists, this method of medical assessment is also questioned in some areas.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus at Caroline College, whose work includes assessing people’s biological maturity to determine whether they experience adolescence earlier or later than normal age.
He told Metro: “I have a reason to think so, and I think the measurement method used should not be that.”
It is not accurate to determine physical age in this way.
If we can’t guarantee accuracy, we should not pretend that we’re doing it.
However, Granson from the Center for Legal Medicine advocates the accuracy of these tests: “It can generally be said that a child is low in the risk of uncertainty for adults.
The highest risk is that the person is under the age of 18, which is about 10%.

What is the impact of football regulations on Neymar’s transfer to Paris?
The rules aimed at preventing the unlimited spending of European luxury football clubs will not prevent Neymar from transferring from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris Saint-Germain Football Club (PSG) at record prices.
The consequences of this was that the European Football Association (UEFA) implemented further decrease on the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club. The European Football Association (UEFA) is the administrative body of European football matches and has the right to ban teams from participating in the widespread European Champions League.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules (FFP) launched by the FIFA in 2011 means the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club finally must prove that Neymar's transfer has received funding without causing huge losses.
The club has already paid €2.22 billion ($2.62 billion), just to pay the Brazilian player’s discontinuation fees, while Neymar’s wages will reach tens of millions of dollars annually.
Here are some of the financial impacts of Neymar’s transfer to France.
Given the team’s funds coming from a rigorous Qatar ruling family, the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club could, of course, sign Neymar with cash and incorporate him into the other star-cloud battle teams.
Clubs can spend huge money to buy players, but they must use legitimate sources of income to compensate the huge money they spent, allowing them to a profit balance on football related business.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules is an idea proposed by Michel Platini after he was elected as president of the European Union in 2007.
The former French player believes that for the clubs who have built the debt to pursue success, if the banks or everyone withdraw support funds, they actually deceive and put the club in the risk of destruction.
In 2011, the Rules’ focus was switched from the club’s debt issue to the club’s losses monitoring.
This change meant that Roman Abramovich used when he acquired Chelsea Club in 2003 to buy a potential club, then spend huge money on improving the team and building a global brand, which is now facing a more difficult situation.
During the three-year Rules evaluation period of 2018, the club could lose €30 million.
Despite the degradation of Abu by the interim president in 2015, the UEFA successor Alexander Ceferin remains committed to preventing excessive expenditure.
“Of course, the Rule has not been in force yet, and we will strengthen the regulations of the future,” Andrea Traverso, responsible for the Rule issues, told the U.S. Union last week.
Although the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club will pay the Neymar's purchase terms once, it may also allocate amounts within the contract term based on accounting purposes.
Neymar has already signed a five-year agreement, so transfer fees may be displayed at € 44.4 million in the next five-year annual accounts.
The first wave of “Rules” sanctions implemented in 2014 led to the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and the Abu Dhabi-based Manchester City Club to the severe sanctions.
The Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was sentenced to a fine of €60 million ($82 million at the time exchange rate), later reduced to €20 million, and demanded the team to reduce players to 21 in the Champions League season 2014-15 instead of normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking at the clubs who try to increase revenue by linking to the club owners and cheating financial regulators.
While Qatar’s companies can sponsor the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, the EU will not consider it a legitimate income if the amount of sponsorship is considered exceeding the standard market price.
This was what happened in 2014, when the UEFA ruled that the Qatar Tourism Agency sponsored the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was exaggerated.
It is that a part of Neymar’s revenue at Paris Saint-Germain Football Club may come from payments from Qatar’s 2022 World Cup team committee.
However, both the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and the team committee denied Neymar to serve as the World Cup ambassador, and it was easy to take such initiatives for the EU regulatory authorities.
The recent sanctions imposed on the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club mean the UEFA will be more vigilant in any attempt to overcome the rules.
News officials said on Thursday that the UEFA did not have a preliminary discussion with the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club on the transfer of Neymar.
These people have only been in contact with the United Nations in an anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the situation of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
Last published accounts showed that the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club’s operating revenue was EUR 5.424 billion in 2015-16 with a profit of more than EUR 10 million.
The accounts for the previous accounting year have not been published.
The Paris Saint-Germain Football Club expects Neymar’s membership to bring the gospel to sponsorship, licensing and sales of clothes.
The club expects revenue after signing Neymar to increase at least 30%.
It is obvious that seeing the most famous players left, the Spanish League was deeply angry, trying to stop Neymar’s action, and claiming the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club violating the Rules.
The chairman of the West League, Havill Tepas, told the Spanish newspaper AS, “This is a clear example of a ‘financial stimulant’ that both the club and the country are the same,” referring to Qatar, which has the final ownership of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
Arsenal team (all of the club is American sports hero) chief coach Arsene Wenger, holds reservations on the position of the club's national funding as well as the Western League.
“This is the consequences of ownership, which has completely changed the entire ecology of football in the past 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the country has a club, anything will happen.
This will make compliance with the Rules very difficult, because there are many different ways or interests for a country to require a big card player to represent a country.

An elderly infectious markets – Hae Summer Camp and Detective Twin
The story is to remember the actors' famous years of the 1980s and the garbage age of the 90s (after David Wayne and Michael Thwart produced the comedy "The Nation" for MTV); and also the concerns about the oldness itself, and the concerns about 2001; before this year, many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Paul and Paul Luther have not survived.
As a cultural artwork, it is a simulation and reflection of the perpetual memories of our Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is not enough.
The first day of the camp reacted strongly after broadcasting, but not just because of its ridiculous humor (the story is about a speaking vegetable pot, composed by H. John Benjamin).
Double use of core laughing in the scene - middle-aged actors playing a positive egg-age child - which makes it impossible to return back into the past also a funny part.
In "Decade After", adults are actually playing adults, emotions are not too deep, and the imitation is even more exciting, including upcoming creations of tracking films in the 90s, such as "The Hand of the Rock Basket".
At some point, a role falls in an Apple notebook, some straight-line skiing shoes and “some other things in 1991”.
Many core stories are the same.
Mr. Sweet (Mr. Murray) has now become a novelist, but he has not yet forgotten Katy (Margot Murray).
Victor (Ken Marino) still holds the body of a man.
There is another terrible conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. W. W. W. Bush (Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of this series is plug-in.
It’s especially interesting to see this forever young Mr. Luther, who showed Matt Dillon’s soul coating in the movie The Single Noble, and Andy in the previous Campus Giant now feels like a giant.
It’s a random crazy moment that might give this movie a drive, like the return of the Seven Years of Life series, until I find the logical conclusion: Hae Summer Camp: Twenty Years later, its final scene was to let these cashers go to the movie premiere of Hae Summer Camp.
Meanwhile, Amazon's Detective Twin speaks of different antiquities: the Cold War Rebellion's American Dream, the film The Cold City, and even the glow: Wonderful Women's Battle Alliance.
The comedy, created by Brian Gettwood and Alexander Tada, is pushed on the TV screen by director Rice Thomas: a comedy with the hard brother's tragic background in Romania in the 1980s, tells the story of two Bucharest officials fought for the path of truth, ateism and Marxism.
The main roles - the hardist Gregor and the idealist Arthur - are played by the little Flynn Piercey and Cornelius Ulrich respectively, whose dialogues were distributed by Channing Tatum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
This is a great idea.
But this is not just an idea.
Some of them have good visual heads (police watched on TV and sending time to chess because Americans love playing football).
And a number of celebrity actors – including Jenny Street, Nick Offerman, Mahsharahashbaz Ali and Colo Sevini – have made a great voice party.
But the Detective Twin is so committed to creating a noise-real advertising comedy - a murderer with a head-Drigon mask in the show - and it usually plays such a role.
The six-long TV appears a bit pulled, and the comedy effects were not released quickly or often enough.
The director of Detective Twins is more strictly edited and showed better ironic effects when Gregor and Arthur repeatedly visited the U.S. embassy, because there were always two fat wolves who swallow a lot of hamburgers in the embassy hall.

Reporters recently interviewed that the efficiency of the industry, such as steel, trail traffic, vessels and machinery, in the northeastern region, was generally decreased and even damaged.
Some experts believe that in the current situation, the new round of Northeastern industry revitalization is not only related to the national economic recovery, but will also have an impact on the long-term development of the manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, so it is urgent to adjust the transformation.
Enterprise efficiency is generally decreased in traditional industries and the loss of raw materials industry and heavy machinery manufacturing industries are the first performance of this round of economic decline in the Middle East industry.
In the past, low-end and primary products were mainly impacted, but during this economic fluctuation, both traditional industrial high-end and low-end industrial products were affected.
During the past few years, the Group (Micbo) received from the adjustment of product structure, focusing on the development of high-end panels such as containers, steel tracks, boat panels and civil household panels, however, sales of these varieties have seen a significant decrease this year, especially boat panels sales dropped by 50% compared to the same period of sales last year.

Bank of England will maintain 0.25% interest rate
The Bank of England will later announce the interest rates will remain unchanged, and previously weak economic growth and relaxed inflation have caused upward hopes to destroy.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will continue to be “weak” as it controls interest rates while strengthening household income recessions.
The monetary policy committee (MPC) decision-makers decided to maintain a 0.25% interest rate with 6-2 votes, and a minority of members this month called on to increase interest rates, even though weak economic growth has weakened the aid of the improvement.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced growth forecast for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, and issued warning that household income reduction will continue, while inflation will rise to almost 3% in autumn.
But it said it would need to raise interest rates in the next few years to stop Brexit’s inflation, while borrowing costs may need to raise more dramatically than expected in the financial markets.
A year ago, a large-scale economic promotion policy was implemented under the influence of Brexit, and members also voted for its withdrawal.
The Bank of England will announce a suspension of regular funding plans to start providing cheap funding to banks from February next, although the bank says the bank currently needs an additional £15 billion based on the plan.
The Bank of England said, “In the MPC’s core forecast, GDP (GDP) is still weakening in recent years as the recess of real income of households will continue to suppress consumption.
With regard to interest rates, the ban repeatedly reiterated the need for a “specific currency policy reduction” to suppress inflation, and to a “greater degree” than the market expected.
Current market is expected to the first growth in the third quarter of next year, and the second in 2020.
However, the line emphasizes that any upgrade will be “slow” and “blocked”.
The line’s forecast of growth this year and next year has a decline, compared to the forecast of 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
The lineins a growth forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
The pound dropped the exchange rate to the dollar, and the euro was followed.
The pound dropped to the exchange rate of 0.5%, to 1.31, and to the euro dropped 0.4%, to 1.11.
Furthermore, increasing improvement expectations were devastated by recent unoptimistic growth data before this remained unchanged decision. GDP increased to 0.3% in the second quarter and only 0.2% in the previous three months.
The line says growth in the third quarter may remain at 0.3%, although it will rise slightly at the end of the year.
Ordinary households are shocked by the growth of inflation, and wages are less likely, and the recent inflation report of the Bank of England did not bring good news to them, as the line says the compression would get worse before it becomes better.
It said monetary policy could not prevent a hit on revenue in the next few years, but wages are expected to "growth-scale" recovery at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, due to the devaluation of the pound, demand for British goods increases dramatically, the economy will be stimulated to compensate for the effects of some low consumption.
A year before the decision was taken, a shocking EU referendum dropped the pound, with the interest rate dropped to 0.25 percent in August.
The Bank of England estimates it may take four years to fully impact prices and the UK economy.
Before the line has announced its latest interest rate judgment, the call for rise of interests will never be heard, as inflation has already felt a double-sensitive pressure in ordinary households, while the three decision-makers have called for a rise of interest rates to 0.5% in July.
Last month, the inflation dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank of England said this is expected and will rise again in the next few months.
The line is compared to its 2% target, and the rest is already entirely the final bottom line of a weak pound.

UK National Health Service System (NHS) A controversial HIV drug open green light
After the High Court ruled the dust on the supply of drugs to NHS, patients will be able to receive “transformative” HIV preventive treatment starting in September.
NHS England announced that Pre-Exposure Preventive Drug (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sex, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk populations by approximately 86%.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal supported the High Court judgment last year. The decision stated that although NHS claims that local authorities should fund the drug, NHS is entitled to pay PrEP fees.
The initiative announced on Thursday was referred to as a “significant new intervention” by British NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, while the National AIDS Trust Foundation (NAT) described it as “crystal moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first registered sexual health clinics. More clinics will be joined in October, and then fully implemented in England in April 2018.
Pre-Exposure Preventive Medicine (PrEP) is a HIV drug that is taken before sex to reduce the risk of infection with HIV.
Studies have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission in a population at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means there is enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
Those who are eligible to receive treatment include gay, bisexual men, transgender people and HIV-positive carriers who have failed to receive treatment.
The clinic will identify qualified and agreeing participants to the trial, including men, women, transgender persons and unknown whether their sexual partner’s HIV-infection is receiving antiretroviral treatment.
Those who reside in England and registered to a doctor may also attend to their local sexual health clinics.
The plan will cost £10 million, and NHS England's branch has signed a contract to buy these drugs this week after conducting an international competitive procurement.
The aim of this trial is to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is located, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr. Stevens said: “This important new intervention should have a widespread and increasingly successful complementation and enhancement of HIV prevention.”
This is another milestone worth making progress on human health challenges for over 30 years.
Dipola Kim, Chief Executive Officer of the UK AIDS Trust Fund (NAT) said: “This is a crucial moment for fighting AIDS.
If it’s actually targeting people in need and at risk, then pre-exposure preventive drugs offer a possibility of changing the UK AIDS epidemic.
Beginning in September, the HIV-risk population will receive a new authorized tool through the NHS-funded test in England, which can be implemented independently without consultation with sexual partners, which will improve the lives of many people.
We are both in favour of this announcement.
Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of the Trends Higgins Trust Foundation, said: “The first task now is to ensure that tests are launched quickly across the country and that no HIV infected can fall.
Now we have purchased PrEP testing drugs and we are prepared to protect more than 10,000 HIV-risk people.
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hochison said: “After months of delays and government delays, the beginning of PrEP’s first trial was popular and should come earlier.”
Evidence shows how this drug can cause changes as part of our way to prevent HIV and stop spreading this deadly infectious disease.
This test will give us a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of PrEP’s benefits.
Now it is crucial to launch this experiment nationwide as soon as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and help us further stop the spread of HIV into society.

High quality of life: Apply cabinets and smart design to make the Count Palace's small apartment a spacious house
Joanne Re, once a bankier, was very passionate about repairing the house, and in 2014, she moved from a large house located in the Knights Bridge to a small apartment in the Count Palace.
This apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen's terrace - Joanne has no package baggage to sell it, which is a strong proof of the new design.
“Before, I and my former boyfriend lived in a larger house in the Knight Bridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for the right house for the offer.
I saw this apartment in the Count's Palace and its ceiling was also high.
I was very excited, that day I asked him to go.
Since the first view of the room, this 1,000 square feet apartment has now been fully renovated.
This apartment was originally a complex layout single room — needed to pass through the kitchen to go to the bedroom — and then Joanne wanted to add storage space and ceiling to take advantage of the sufficient height of the ceiling.
“I want high ceilings, large windows, and enough light.
That’s my request,” she said.
To do this, she hired Elvan Azadi from the Duck&Shed Architecture and Design Studio (located in Nottingham) to use this 12.5 feet high ceiling to carefully build a house. This house is not only a development project, but also a place where Joanne lives.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to add two up and down spaces, so the construction challenge is to create a height enough to stand.
Elvan has to be creative to solve this problem.
“The steel structure is quite complex,” he explains.
“We have to arrange the space to make it up and down, and we don’t need to climb the back.
Not only is it so simple to build a simple platform, but also to start these steel materials to keep it at the right height to the function.
Through this arrangement, Elvan was able to get two full-scale rooms in the space — which could be added to many hobby elements.
The floor features retrouvius branded recycled copper windows, which can view the charming living area.
Gold furniture with mirrors, silver small furniture and Serge Mouille's recycling lighting set the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing atmosphere, space and light.
A mirror on the two ends of the short corridor can make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a mirror protective panel is like a window that goes into another room.
At the door, a mirror-woven little boy gives Johnny storage space for storage of dishes and glass dishes.
The beautiful living room has an impressive sense of space, which can collect the kitchen when the kitchen is not used.
The folded kitchen is not fresh.
But the unique feature of this folded kitchen is a garage-style lifting door.
“This involves knowledge in some fields of engineering,” Elvan explained to the steel muscle fixed MDF door.
“It adopts the principle of balance, so when you push the door, it is easy to slide.
Thanks to the intelligent use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
“In the end, what you sell is the area of the house – or your property estimates are based on the area of the house,” Elvan said.
Basically, the real estate broker will enter the room and calculate according to the size of the floor.
They will manage to increase space occupation while using high-quality materials, giving this space a sense of luxury.
Elvan says, “The material is all your personal choice, so it helps to create emotional bands in your home.
“You won’t love the electricity on the wall.
These things are important, but they won’t stop your heart.
It turns out that by good design as well as increased additional area, standard apartments can make you surprising.
In fact, you might choose to stay like Johnny.

Two Brothers Play $500 Million Real Estate Empire Fighting World War
40 years after their Italian family founded the kingdom, the two brothers fought for a war for more than $500 million, one of Victoria's largest real estate empires.
Colin De Lutis, former director and developer of the Calton Football Club, lived in a luxury house located in the district of Tucara, where three rooms are the home of his brother Paul. The latter accused him to the Supreme Court of the matter of the division of their real estate and operating assets.
Paul has been hoping to leave family business since 2014, but the two brothers have been strictly debating about the asset division at the Supreme Court.
The two brothers and their mother have 38 properties worth more than $500 million, which have been accumulated since the family bought Colinwood’s Smith Street in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually expanded it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company was sold at a price of $85 million.
The money was then invested in real estate. Currently, the De Ruthis family’s portfolio includes city office buildings, Borrellick and Solonto development projects, Gold Coast and Blue Mountains apartments, as well as suburban shopping centers.
According to an agreement made with his defeated father, Colin, called his brother Paul as the “major driver and dominant person” of the de-Ruthis family, possesses approximately two-thirds of corporate assets, while Paul accounts for approximately one-third.
The documents submitted to the court indicated that Colin owned property worth $3.16 billion, while Paul owned property worth $1.76 billion.
Paul believes that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the result of negotiations.
“The Property Division Recommendation offered by Colin left him the best property I think,” he wrote in a first court judgment in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failures of mediation, the Supreme Court held a hearing for the first time.
Now, the two brothers are still fighting for the control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has thrown him out of office.
Colin denied this and accused Paul of inability to manage certain properties.
In the early promise that Colin submitted, he expressed his desire to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian tradition determines that the family is the most important option.My Italian origin determines that the family is the most important,” he wrote.
The cost of the case is increasing, and there are hundreds of pages of promises, e-mails, and corporate reports submitted by Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, top lawyers such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers employed by both parties.
Mrs. Ruthis and her late husband Louis were both Italian immigrants. They started operating mass food and cooking shops since the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunei in the early 1970s.
They used mortgage to buy Colinwood’s property, where Colin opened his family’s first cowboys shop.
Colin said, “I read high school three,” where he founded Westco, “when Paul was still young (about 10 years old).
Anna de Ruthis says she and Louie, who died in 2012, wish to be able to transfer property peacefully to his son.
“Louis has often told me he never wanted his brothers to finally get to court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke are no longer members of the Deuteronomy Group, Colin said Mark had paid him $10 million when he left the company and $26 million to Luke.
Paul said both Luke and Mark were “insatisfied with the terms of their property division.”
According to television star Eddie McGuire's record published in 2015, he remained low, although Colin was a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL club.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul, as well as their lawyers on Friday.
However, only Colin responded through a text message. he said because the case was submitted to court "I can't really say too much.
“My brother Paul chose to prosecute me and bring our family affairs to court, which is very, very sad,” he wrote.
In mid 2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
“Our father didn’t want to see Paul and I finally come up with such a dispute,” he added, “he still has hope for the dispute’s resolution.
On Friday, this hope seems to be destroyed.
“Our problem will be solved through court in the near future,” Colin wrote.

Kelly told officials that receiving good information helped the president make better decisions, so it was necessary to go through his hands—whether in writing or briefing form.
Kelly's diagnosis seemed similar, but others also tried to convince him through monitoring Trump's media time, but eventually ended in a failure.
President Trump’s television addiction has been long ago — now in the White House, he’s still deepening his habits to watch TV.
In February, former campaign advisor Sam Naberg told Politico: “If Trump’s candidate is disappointed with injustice reports, let him know his positive reports on reliable channels will be beneficial.”
Politico’s Tara Palmery wrote: “According to the experience of six former campaign officials, the focus on controlling Trump’s Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal receiving media information has always contained some compliments.
This is absolutely no problem.
But Trump’s Twitter habits have been “controlled” this view is ridiculous.
Per these campaign officials know something we don’t know – that Trump’s tweets would even burn up if not their intervention.
We may never know the tweets that Trump did not send.
If his staff can save him from the fire, even a few times, their effort is worth it.
But no one can stop Trump from making controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House of a competitive group, people promote their worldview by submitting potentially reliable and potentially unreliable information to Trump.
Politico — all about this story — in May the desire of advisors to provide suspicious information to the president’s strategic.
Here is an example described by reporter Sean Goodmanch:
"The current and former Trump officials said Trump's reactions to negative news releases such as volcano eruptions, especially those with disturbing information leakage, he would crazy want to find out the source of it.
At the end of February, some maliciously copied an article on the web-stimulant Charles C. Johnson’s website GotNews.com to the president, accusing Vice Secretary-General Katie Walsh as a “source of massive information leakage,” when Trump was so.
Even if Johnson had been permanently blocked by Twitter for harassment, he did not provide any specific evidence, and he had exploded a lot of mistake allegations, which later openly denied.
Trump looked at the article and began asking officials about the situation of Walls.
Goodmanch also said the then secretary Reynes Pribes and White House Secretary Robert Potter "have tried to build a system to manage and record the documents received by Trump."
What about the result?
Kelly intends to do the same in three months.
He may be able to prove himself a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These eternal influences will make Kelly’s task difficult.

Parking passengers negotiate with Chana and return to “Rich Street”
Some of the wealthiest owners in West Midlands have once again struggled with a firm-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-will-w
Garage drivers have parked their 20 trucks on an empty ground outside the vibrant Solihel Street, which is crowned as the “Rich Street”.
Parking passengers, taking horses, embrace babies and lead the parking team, returning again after they were deported in May, and the municipal department's excavated "City Rivers" did not stop their entrance.
The team of rough trainer found that the defence line had a gap, although there was a route that didn’t set a barrier suitable for passing, their vehicles wrapped through the gap.
Angry residents criticized the Solihull Council, saying it "has performed badly in dealing with the issue."
A non-named resident said: “They arrived there on Monday night before they came to Benchmark Street and throw stones on the passing streets.”
The committee should be ashamed of their actions, because they are just none of them in dealing with the issue.
The car passengers arrived here in May and were later deported, and now they are back.
There was a lot yesterday, and maybe more today.
She added: “Birmingham City Parliament knows how to deal with a way to protect its parks by implementing a long-term ban.”
I live on Streetbrook Street and I would not be willing to continue paying municipal taxes if the parliament cannot stop this.
A local resident who didn’t want to reveal his name said: “It’s so absurd that we just saw the previous group of car drivers go away, but it’s easy to destroy the other group.”
This time the number increased again, and some people even saw horses eating grass on the park grass.
A spokeswoman for the Soleil Committee said: “We know someone has carried out unlicensed campings on an empty ground on the Soleil Street, and now we work with the police in Soleil and take the necessary legal action to let them move as soon as possible.”
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible to report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps us figure out the situation when submitting the case to the court, for the judgment of the court.

Italy holds strong holding against non-governmental migrants rescue vessels
Italy warned non-governmental organizations operating migrants rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not continue to implement rescue if they were not signed by new operations management regulations.
In an interview with Turin Daily News, Interior Minister Marco Minetti said: “If non-governmental organizations do not sign new rules of conduct, it is hard to see what they would think afterwards.
A day before Miniti issued a warning, Italian officials arrested him because of suspicions that the crew on a ship of a German aid organization "Youth Rescue" had actually captured human traffickers to help illegal immigrants.
The aid agency operated only for a year and refused to comment on the specific subject of Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartocio's allegations.
The organization said in a social media statement: “For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing now, so we regret that we can’t operate in the rescue area at the moment.
“After all the information is collected, we can now only evaluate all allegations and situations.
Italy's officials began in October to monitor the youth rescue group's ship Iuventa.
Its crew suspected migrants carrying human traffickers directly from small ships and allowed smugglers to rush to escape and reuse the ships.
According to the prosecutor’s records, at least one such meeting was alleged to have occurred in the sea 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast.
Its crew is suspected of obviously ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which was monitored by humanitarian enthusiasm rather than any other motivation for the region.
Under the rules of conduct, vessels like Iuventa obviously need an Italian police officer to monitor their activities on the ship.
At the moment, only three of the nine NGOs participating in the rescue operations have agreed to comply with the behavioural rules: the Children's Rescue Association, the Migrant Maritime Assistance Station in Malta, and the Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday it considers the new provisions, although not necessary, are acceptable because they would not bring any "significant changes and obstacles to their rescue operations."
The organization that refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning Organization for Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Miniti said the number of immigrants arriving in Italy has decreased in recent weeks, indicating that efforts for strengthening the Libyan coastal guard and joint local mayor's efforts were first successful.
The minister said: “In recent days, we started to see the Sunshine at the end of the tunnel.
He announced the plan of deep talks this month: discussing economic development activities with Libyan mayors and discussing with Chad, Niger and Mali how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave these countries to go to Europe.
The Transport Bank’s chief financial scientist, Liang Pong, said, due to the end-season characteristics of industrial increased value in the three quarters before 2017, the growth of industrial increased value is expected to accelerate to 6.6 percent in December.
The cumulative increase in fixed asset investment is expected by 7.2% in December, compared to last month, lower than last year.
Although industrial production would be weaker than October, it was fundamentally stable with November.
And in December, China’s manufacturing industry’s low-level investment was running, but the basic construction investment was made a small improvement, so the monthly fixed asset investment is expected to remain flat in November.

Michelle Carter sentenced to suicide for texting Conrad Roy
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for suicide by phone and texting her boyfriend.
The 20-year-old Michel Carter will be sentenced to 15 months in prison and can be converted to penalty after expiration.
Carter was sentenced in June for unintentionally non-pre-mord against Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said on Thursday's hearing: "My family is sad."
My son is my best friend.
While waiting for the appeal, Carter was allowed to retain personal freedom.
She faced up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers think she and Mr. Roy both suffer from mental illness.
At the trial, Carter stood up, wearing red long pants and rice shirt, his hands clothed, his eyes were tears, and looked down.
“Her actions killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
She ended her life to live better.
She has no responsibility,” the prosecutor said.
“She didn’t have any regret.
But Carter’s lawyer said it was “a terrible consequence and she was very regretted.
However, judge Lawrence Moniz said he didn't find her "age or maturity, even her mental illness could have any significant impact on her behavior.
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy, she said, "I don't have a day to regret for the loss of my beloved son."
I hope he is proud of everything he has done for me and I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my suffering and those suffering will accompany us forever.”
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testifies that she was "spiritually frustrated" because she realized she could never attend her brother's wedding or become the girlfriend of his children.
Losing a person who has accompanied me since I was born is a pain, and the rest of my life will tell her about this pain.
The case seems to initiate a legal precedent because the Massachusetts law does not impose that others are guilty of suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead from carbon dioxide poisoning in the car; this year, Carter was 17 years old.
Carter's text revealed that she had committed suicide after the case caused national concern.
“Hanging, jumping and bite herself, there are many ways to say in the text she sent two weeks before his death when he was on vacation with his family.
Before his suicide, she wrote: “You have to do that, Conrad,” “All you have to do is start the generator and then you’ll get freedom and happiness.”
Judge Moniz said Carter became concerned by Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to benefit from the case through any media.
There are legal disputes in this case.

Automotive manufacturers face shock, Audi will repair up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before Audi announced the renovation, BMW said it would provide software upgrades to more than 350,000 cars.
BMW’s CEO said BMW believes that “driving has more smart options than restrictions,” meaning European major cities – including BMW’s headquarters in Munich – are considering to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will repair three million European Mercedes cars to reduce its diesel emissions.
No company has claimed that the action was recalled.
European car manufacturers are strongly promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help carbon emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may lead to asthma.
Automotive companies installing equipment to compensate for gas emissions increases also, making it difficult to keep diesel cars competitive at prices.
As German automotive manufacturers faced a review, the government led by Prime Minister Angela Merkel was also accused of over-the-countering these powerful automotive companies and ignoring various signs of the issue.
These automotive companies are trying to avoid repetitive crowd coverage, which is to hide their use of so-called failure devices, adjust emissions when car testing to comply with the regulations and restore normally under normal driving conditions.
Several public executives are accused in the United States, while other executives are undergoing investigations in both the Atlantic countries.
Last month, a former thermodynamic officer of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zacero Giovani Pamio is an Italian, therefore unprotected from extradition, and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the public, and the German government accused Audi’s installation system to escape European emissions requirements, extending the scope of investigations before limited to the United States.
Audi’s investigation may have a significant impact on the public: luxury car manufacturers have a disproportionate share of profits of Volkswagen.
A film from preparation to show, which lasts one or two years or even years, can be referred to as an empty practice.
The animated film Big Fish Sea was announced to be released on July 8, which has been 12 years from preparation to release!

Provence is threatened by climate change.
The grass has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is a bad news that it is being threatened by climate change.
Due to the continued drought and the appearance of viral-bossed insects, herbs are falling, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find a solution to the headache.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute of Agriculture in Provence (CRIEPPAM), said: “Provence’s peanut grass is facing a huge threat because the plant has been subjected to climate change in recent years, spring rains have decreased significantly, while falls in fall.
This will affect the life cycle of the wheat.
There is also an individual’s smaller eyelash, a leaf eyelash that can spread small bacteria, and in very dry weather, they will appear a lot of eyelashes.
The key is that their number is huge.
In addition to that which can attract vacationers, the bright garlic oil is also appreciated by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric Zeis said: “Unlike plants that can grow many large flowers, with long grapes, we have smaller individuals with poor development, lack or weakness.
So our essential oil content is less.
The solutions are being studied include improved irrigation techniques and reducing the evaporation of soil water, spraying protective mixture of clay and water on the plants, and developing more dry-resistant varieties.
Compared to science fiction elements in the film, the two main actors argue that the stories in the film are more attracted to them.

Mexicans are threatened, journalists are murdered
All employees of the Riodoce Weekly are usually gathered on Wednesday to review their reporting plans about the rebellion in Sinaro, which is caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today, the shadow of tragedy is covered by themselves, and they gather together to discuss security issues.
They are told to change their daily habits, which is important.
Two senior journalists discussed what would be more safe: whether to bring their children to the office (the office was attacked by a granate in 2009) or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the black board in front of the room: enemy, neutral and allies.
They let these journalists list their names under each column — no evidence needed, observation and intuition is enough.
There are suspicious drugs traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on the government’s list, or cartridges, which threaten Mexico’s reporting work.
Violence continues to stop, and the nation’s bodies are all over, including more and more journalists: According to the Protection of Journalists Committee, at least 25 journalists have been killed since President Enrick Peniya Neto’s top position in December 2012, 589 journalists have been protected by federal protection after attacks and threats, and at least seven journalists have died in seven states this year.
The last one died was their editor and source of inspiration, as well as the co-founder of Riodoce, Havill Valdiz Cardinas.
He wrote a lot of books about drug violence, and he wrote in one of them: “The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist.
Everyone could feel deeply that he was gone, even though he was everywhere – a huge picture hanging on the front of Riodoce’s office building, with the word “Justice” in the middle, and the T-Shirt of two more than 30 years old journalists Alan Evalar and Miriam Ramirez also showed his smile, he wears glasses or his iconic Panama hat.
The workshop took place less than two months after his death, and journalists discussed their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and suspicion.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to deal with journalist cases, according to the records of the Protection of Journalists Committee, the office only charged two persons.
Most of thousands of criminal cases every year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so it is rarely possible for murderers who kill journalists.
In Riodoce, they insist on reporting violent events in Sinaro, although their hearts are broken, although the land has been broken.
Evalah said there was no murder information, no justice extended, so a security discussion was not very useful.
He said: “Wasting time to attend such a workshop is stupid.
As long as we don’t know why, you won’t believe anyone.
On the morning of May 15, Valdiz left Riodoce’s office in the capital of Curiacan.
His red Toyota Carola was opened in just a few districts and arrested by two men; they forced him to go down the car and shoot 12 rifles, supposedly because of the newspaper’s name – translated to the Twelve River.
The robber took his car away and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
He left his wife and two older children.
Curia Khan spoke four times.
But on the topic of Valdez, there is actually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinaro has become the most bloody battlefield in the country, whose enemies are crazyly killed.
One or more people were shot every day on the streets of Sinaro, and the cemetery was filled with two layers of poison, which are already common.
A temporary forgotten state of “peace” is only when a carter controls the coastal state and its ports and dropshipping routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, even though Valdiz is deeply aware of the dangers of this work, 60-year-old Riodoce co-founder and director Ishmael Bohekee is guilty of not protecting his friend.
He believes two mistakes caused the tragedy.
On February 1st published an interview with Damasco Lopez, he led a carter group fighting with Guuzman's several sons.
The report might annoy these sons; the newspaper was broken down by a suspect group member once it was sent to the newspaper.
The second mistake was that another newspaper that the same story was captured after not forced Valdiz to leave Mexico for his own safety consideration.
Valdiz is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death has a significant significance for Mexican violence against journalists.
His spirit survived and his friends and colleagues believed he was always with us.
In 2003, he was a senior journalist for Noreste, when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold a share for $50.
Bochoui said in Sinaro, “it is impossible to step in the journalism industry without dealing with the issue of drugs.
Over time, the newspaper has gained a good reputation due to bold and honest reports, and sales and advertising increased as well.
Reporters like to be able to publish investigative reports that are directly damaged without worrying about review, and readers like to publish stories in the newspaper that others do not dare to report.
Riodoce won the Latin American National Mary Muscat Press Prize five years after its founding.
The same year, the Association of Protected Journalists awarded the Waldez International Press Freedom Prize, recognizing his courage to pursue the most authentic Mexican drug reporting.
He said he was also afraid of himself.
When awarding the Award for the Protection of Reporters Association, he said: “I want to continue to live.
Later, at the end of October, he said in an interview with local TV Rompeviento TV: “In Sinaro, drug trafficking is a way of life.
You have to take the task of falling on your shoulders as a journalist — either that’s the case, or be deaf.
I don’t want to be asked, “What did you do face so many deaths ... why don’t you speak about what’s happening?”
All the employees of Riodoce missed Valdez, missed him as a port worker, missed him who never missed his embrace and advice, missed him who knew how to survive.
They depend on his habits.
He was often wearing that hat.
The El Guayabo bar in front of the office is always sitting on the same table.
Now they will ask: Is it his daily habits that caused him to fall?
His death also caused them to think about how to work well and live well.
"They don't like you annoy their women and children, nor like you affect their legal companies and secret airports used to transport drugs."
They all crossed their bottom lines.
As a result, it is necessary to maintain a high self-examination and self-protection even in the safest time.
Believe in your intuition.
If you feel a dangerous breath, go away.
Andrew Vilaril, editor of Riodoce, said the problem is “the breath is a feeling of being deceived... then something like Harvey will happen.
He and others said the previous rules no longer apply to Sinaro – just as it no longer applies to Taulipas, Veracruz, Grayro and other states, these states’ traffic routes are profitable, and institutions are low, government officials corrupt, and smoke.
The situation is constantly changing.
The use of mobile phones was suddenly banned in the rooms where Riodoce employees participated in security training; a few days ago, spy software allegedly sold to government was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police walked cold under the trees and escaped temperatures of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were the offices of the state government to protect Riodoce, which are located in a four-storey building in the middle-class district of Curiacan.
Some journalists are half-joke to say they don’t know whether these police would belong to only 50% of the letters that the governor said.
Journalists have been traveling to mountains for months, where a drug trafficking group is under the control of its actual existence.
This week’s Riodoce three main issues.
Among them is the murder of the brother of the great former boxer Horio Cesar Chávez in Sinaro.
The government funds of the Governor’s home country also revealed,
As well as the kidnapping in a expensive restaurant in Curiacan, the restaurant is just a neighborhood from the prosecutor’s office.
Officials have not published information about the kidnapped objects and the kidnapping process, so it is necessary to be careful and careful when writing what the city knows: that’s where drug traffickers and officials love the restaurant.
A journalist learned from public archives that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician of the ruling Party’s Revolutionary System Party (PRI), which had dominated various political classes almost throughout the past decade.
Recently, several Governors of the Revolutionary System Party have been accused of corruption in several highly respected cases.
Viral asked reporters to write about what happened at the scene before the incident, including the incident of a son of the Mexican head of the Giuseppe Guzman, who hide a military attack.
If a few months ago, readers would look at the Waldi's column to find the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
The 46-year-old Viral called “the thick” because of his body, he said, “We knew what was happening for a long time.”
Now all our information sources communications channels are broken.
Valdiz’s offices are now used to store identities and labels for protesting against murdering journalists as employees have become what they never wanted to be: the media activists.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took his hand out of the room and went to the local prosecutor’s office to participate in a demonstration associated with another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in Michigan, western state three days after the murder of Valdiz.
Officials found a burned body and said that it was his body based on DNA tests.
Around the country, journalists have become more straightforward and organized protests, painting the word “rescuing media” on human trails and buildings.
On that day, Mr. Bohoquie is not in Washington, he is trying to extend justice to the Waldis case and seek international support.
The next day when Valdiz was murdered, at a meeting with the governor of Sinaro, Ramirese accused official assassination journalist information and killed them because they said the facts.
Since her anger has affected her objectivity, she also asked to resign from the post of reporting government affairs.
Valdiz has repeatedly repeated that Mexican journalists are “enclosed” by organized crime, polluted government officials and ignorant society.
In his previous book, Drugs Journalism, he wrote that journalists are not only murdered by a drug trafficking group, but also on a list of politicians and security forces who are involved in organized crime.
The media surveillance group Article 19 accused more than half of the journalists attacks last year against police and public officials.
Ramirez said, “In Mexico, they’ve got you to die to keep you silent.
This murder is obviously uncold.
No one has forgotten six years ago that blogger Maria Elizabeth Masiaas died at the northern border of Taulipas.
Beside her body, there was a signature allegedly signed by Zetascarter: "I came for my report.
Her head was cut off and placed next to him a computer keyboard and headset.
After the murder of Miroslav Brech in March, some news options were closed, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of Chiwa.
Others are still ongoing, the director of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo was killed in 2014, but they are still ongoing.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez opened a press release of a drug cartridge entitled “What do you want to get from us?”
Some journalists have escaped their homeland or even left the country.
This is a difficult choice.
It is difficult to find jobs in the exile, and they still need to be cautious on the streets and be cautious about the danger.
Sometimes they are arrested and allegedly killed in 2015 photographer Ruben Espinoza in a Mexican city and four women three months after escaping from Veracruz.
For those who continue to work behind the scene, this is a daily dance of high-risk decisions.
Ivalah once wanted to become a poet, and he admitted that reports of drug trafficking made him afraid.
“Mexico is becoming hell, so I became a journalist.
Last Friday midnight, the latest newspaper had been printed, and the editors of Riodoce were sitting on a walk outside of the office drinking beer, and suddenly their phones sounded.
A series of shootings took place by hostile forces and security forces near the beach resort city of Massachusetts, confirming 19 people were killed.
The war is still upgrading, as predicted by a series of carter information found in the region.
They uploaded the news on their phone to Riodoce’s website.
The next day’s title had to change.
The alarms sounded nearby — a shooting fighting in the area was once again.
Bochouchi looked at the police guard standing there and saw if they were awakening.
If they were afraid, they didn’t show up either.
The founder of the newspaper was dead, and in his massive portrait, he indicates where the entire state of Sinaro needs to be viewed, and the entire staff of Riodoce followed his steps.
The same day when Harvey was killed, the practitioners asked me to send her to the street to participate in the report.
China’s self-driving tourism market scale or exceed trillion dollars in 2020
In a large context of consumption upgrades and freedom of circulation, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and increasingly popular by consumers.
But at the same time, a trillion-billion-driving self-driving market is also facing a double challenge.
In the context of consumption upgrades and freedom of movement, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and a growing number of consumers.
But at the same time, the trillion-billion-sized self-driving market is also faced with double challenges, on the one hand, the development of self-driving industry is not fairly comparable to market demands, and self-driving tour organizers such as self-driving clubs and travel agencies are faced with low-profit difficulties; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services faced with self-driving are still in the early stages.
It represents 60 percent of domestic tourists, the market is expected to break trillions.
In 2016, 44,4 million domestic tourists all year round, self-driving tour accounts for about 60% of the total domestic tourism population, and by 2020 the volume of self-driving tourism market is expected to reach trillions.
According to the statistics of the Chinese tourist ships association on the number of self-driving travelers, the number of travelers from the driver has continued to grow for almost five years, and the number of travelers representing the proportion of domestic tourists is stable at more than half.
Meanwhile, regional and national levels have shown more attention and support in this emerging area of self-driving travel, and policy regulations regarding self-driving, passenger cars and camp tourism were closely implemented between 2016 and 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourism Agency, the National Sports General, jointly published the Automotive Sports Camp Development Plan; the focus of self-driving tourism was mentioned in the same month, jointly printed by 14 departments such as the Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Finance.
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self-driving travel.
Self-driving club profits are small, the entire industry chain is key
While the domestic self-driving market has huge potential and national policies are actively guided, the self-driving industry is still in the early phase.
According to the 2016-2017 China Self-Driving Annual Development Report, domestic Self-Driving Clubs, Car Clubs, Car Friends Clubs, etc. reach thousands, but the percentage of tourists who organize self-driving excursions occupies the majority, and only about 15 percent of tourists from various institutions such as Car Friends Clubs, Self-Driving Clubs.
At the same time, online travel companies and traditional travel agencies are also available for self-driving and self-driving products, many online travel platforms are sold for self-driving products offered by some suppliers, and some self-driving clubs are also important suppliers.
From organizing self-driving activities, it covers several aspects of "Eat, Stay, Travel, Travel, Shopping, Eat", high fragmentation, high supply chain weight, tourist consumption is great.
The founder and CEO of Beijing’s Line Sky Sports Club, Lee Zhangzhou, believes that the self-driving club is essentially similar to the travel agencies, and the early main profit models were mainly on offline activities, the core point was self-driving line products and leadership services.
But today the line products in the field of self-driving are serious, the level of leadership service is close, and the self-driving club faces the need for re-transformation.
It can be seen that self-driving tourism itself is not an independent industry, but it is important to form a cross-regional, industrial ecosphere by its self-driving tourism characteristics.
Experts point out that in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important consumption element.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving industry, the experience characteristics, the development of the “self-driving+” theme and the IP of self-driving products should be enhanced.
The landscape is not only the road, the car camp should not only meet the accommodation.
With regard to the rise of self-driving, the development of the basic self-driving accessories is also comparable to the primary.
Lee Zhangger pointed out that tourist landscape route is not only a route, but it is necessary to combine both elements of transport and tourism, but the renovation of the road and making tourism itself are two sectors responsible for increasing tourism elements, as well as staying in the construction of toilets, consultancy centers, promotional bars, etc. facilities, the combination of tourism is not very high.
Compare the well-known self-driving route "U.S. 66 Road", construction experience is worth taking advantage.
The design of the landscape route is no longer the fastest direct route between destination and destination, but follows the design concept of “experience driving pleasure” to provide the best enjoyment for self-driving tourists to appreciate the beautiful view along the road; the landscape can combine the point and face-to-face tourism landscape, both preserving the historical value and cultural value of the eco-tourism resources along the line, and also organizing a variety of thematic activities to enhance the participation and excursion experience of visitors, creating economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to the landscapes, the camp is also an important accessory facility for self-driving.
But among the self-driving tourists known by the New York Times, there are few consumers who choose to stay in the camp.
They believe that many camps are predisposed to infrastructure, only to meet the needs of food, the order is not high, the product is single, and cannot satisfy the need of self-driving this contains many elements.
There are people who do not want to reveal the names of the industry said that many of the companies who did camp in the past few years were for landing, landing after landing, the last set infrastructure construction and service did not follow, the operating situation is much losses, without the last funding injection, it is hard to do some corresponding set products.
Consumer Groups
According to data published in 2017 by the Chinese Tourism Association, the self-driving group is concentrated on 21-40 years old, especially 31-40 years old, that part of the population has a certain economic basis and has a higher demand for personalized tourism and is more for family travel customers.
According to accommodation surveys, self-driving people prefer non-standard accommodation relatively more.
From the type of self-driving, self-driving around is the main type of self-driving, accounting for 84.32%.
Self-driving is a desire for many people, but the proportion is still smaller.
At the same time as consumer demand increases, visitors who prefer to travel in the past have begun to change the idea, no longer “fotographing down the car, sleeping on the car,” but more focusing on the experience and process of traveling.
Dinosaurs use fake to hide enemies.
At first glance it was terrible, but it looks like a statue.
Researchers have published the first findings of incredible biological fossils found by Canadian miners, such as the beef-like, and pointed out that the fossil is well preserved, so experts call it the “Mona Lisa of the World of Dinosaurs.”
This fossil is very well preserved and can even determine the color of its skin is red brown, which indicates that it has had some “problematic experience”.
Related reports in the Journal of Contemporary Biology described it as “the best preserved pitch dinosaurs ever discovered, and one of the best samples of dinosaurs in the world.”
The fossil is a newly discovered conjunctive dragon species that lived in the middle of the White Age 1.1 million to 1.12 billion years ago.
Its preservation was excellent and shocked the researchers that they described it as “very amazing.”
According to the National Geographical Journal, this herb whitened dinosaur fossils have been the best preserved of the same kind of dinosaur fossils ever discovered.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the fossil during the mining of the Sencol Millennium Mine near McMurryburg, north of Alberta, Canada.
At that time, he encountered something that seemed less large than the rocks around him, so he decided to look carefully.
The fossils he found were later sent to the Royal Tarril Museum of Ancient Biology of Canada.
The researchers took six years to reveal the real sight of the beast that was hidden inside the 2500 pounds (1100 kg) of land.
After so hard work, the final results are now announced.
“If you look at it, you’ll almost believe it’s sleeping,” said Caleb Brown, a scientist and first author of the Royal Terrier Museum.
“It will be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs samples in science history – Monna Lisa in the world of dinosaurs.
By studying its skin, researchers found that this herb beverage organism, whilst wearing arms, like a walking tank, could be threatened by meat dinosaurs.
This type of heavy armed dinosaurs used red-white masks to hide the hunters, and used a hidden technique known as "anti-shaped", which is also used by many modern animals.
Experts say that by this way it is able to better integrate with the surrounding environment and thus avoid the enemy, indicating that it is caught by larger dinosaurs.
This 1.1 billion-year-old creature belongs to a member of the Cluster Dragon family and became the main news for the first time in May, and is currently exhibited at the Royal Terrier Museum of Ancient Biology.
After a museum technician Mark Mitchell spent 7000 hours carefully discovering the face of the giant beast, researchers are now researching it and naming it "Borealopelta markmitchelli".
The samples were stored perfectly, allowing Dr. Mitchell, as well as an international team of scientists to record the patterns and shapes of the shapes on him.
They discovered the “anti-covering” technique, which is a common way of defense in the animal community, meaning the back of the organism is darker than the color on its side.
Although “anti-shaped” technique is common, the results of the findings are surprising, as the body type of dinosaurs is far beyond the existing animals using anti-shaped techniques.
This dinosaur is faced with the pressure of hunting by meat-food dinosaurs, thus evolving in a favorable direction, allowing it to hide in the barracks and use it as a means of survival.
However, most of the existing animals using antiretrochemical therapy, such as turtles, worms, or cranes, are as small and vulnerable as hunting, indicating that the organism is facing real survival pressure.
“Big heavy-duty dinosaurs suffered crazy hunting shows how dangerous white-age meat dinosaurs are,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its spots also suggests that the dinosaur’s skin is red-brown.
Scientists are continuing to study traces of the organism’s life, including the stomach contained in order to find the food that the end is eating.
They believed that dinosaurs fell into rivers when they die and were then infiltrated into the ocean and eventually divided into the bottom of the sea in a way backward.
At that time, the climate in Alberta was as warm as the climate in the south of Florida today, and rivers and ocean might be more deep inland than it is now.
Brown said: “This conjunctive dragon is truly amazing because it is fully covered by the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape.
“Therefore, the form of the creature is now almost the same as the form of the White Age.
You don’t need to rebuild it with too much imagination; if you look at it, you’ll almost believe it’s sleeping.
The White Age was the time of two-foot-walking big animal-foot dinosaurs wandering around the Earth.
Although the Dragon was the king of the dinosaurs, it appeared only millions of years after the Dragon.
These include the Big Dragon, a giant beast weighing up to 6 tons and 38 feet (11,5 meters) long.
The latest research found that scientists in the Journal of Contemporary Biology believe that the dragons were thrown into the sea after their death and then formed mummies in the soil.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink excavated the creature in a millennium mine near McMurryburg, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved bite dinosaurs in the world, full of skin and arms in the area of the nose to the ass.
This organic average length is about 18 feet (5 meters) and weighs up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
It has two 20 inches long edges that stand out from the shoulder.
The researchers believe that this herb-breaded dinosaurs are active in the western region of Canada, after flooding rivers flooded into the ocean.
However, this dinosaur buried under the sea makes its armor fully preserved.
The fossil remains of this special sample are very well preserved, so that the remaining skin remains covered by unplanned scratches on the dinosaur head.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine, this preservation is very rare, just as in the middle.
The more I see, the more it felt incredible.
The remaining skin fossils are still covered over the arms that are sparked on the dinosaurs’ skeleton.
Its right front arm is on its side, with five fingers stretched upwards.
I can figure out their statistics.
Reporters realized that the addition of natural or plant sources of marine alpha acids, corrosive acids and amino acids additives to the urine production process can have a modified effect on traditional urine, formed marine alpha acids, zinc phosphorus, urine nitrogen use increases by 5 to 10 percentage points compared to normal urine.
Environmentally friendly, the growth potential of crops is obvious, especially large particles of urine added value are the quality raw material of BB fertilizer.
The total number of security personnel is double the number of security officers at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
To ensure the safety of the Olympic Games in Rio, Brazil will launch the largest security alliance plan ever.
Previously, the Brazilian government said a total of 85,000 military and police will cooperate, including 20,000 soldiers and 65,000 police officers.
Most of the soldiers will be responsible for the defence of the Olympic Stadium, while additional 3,000 soldiers will be responsible for the security of international airports, metro stations and streets.
Police patrolled other parts of the city, including metro, buses and streets.
Six thousand soldiers have already arrived in Rio for Olympic security services.
In addition to the four competition areas responsible for the Rio Olympic Games, they are also responsible for patrol on the airports and the main roads that connect the airport and the Olympic Stadium.
The introduction of the evaluation mechanisms in the service industry is no longer a new thing, to make the evaluation mechanism effective, it is important to make regulation more effective, not in the form.
How do radicalists learn to answer the question: “Who’s streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was nervous.
On the first day of his arrival in New York City, St. Louis sat on his bed for rent and browse the Facebook on his phone.
She accidentally found a post of a high school student.
“The police just killed a 18-year-old boy and the boy was still lying on the street.”
She found that no one else posted the message on the feedback, and she felt confused. She shut Facebook and opened Twitter.
A @TheePharoah user continuously pushed a dynamic Times to her.
Michael Brown is a 18-year-old, unarmed black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown’s body laying on the street and his body laying on the street for four hours.
“It’s crazy,” Ferguson thought.
But for her and the community where she is, death is not new.
She dropped the phone until she re-opened Twitter until that night, reading tweets about the crowd gathered in Campfield Street.
There were police videos and photos of people screaming, and a photo of a person who claimed to be Brown's father, on which it was written: "Ferguson police just killed my handless son!"
She saw a live message that was used by a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters.
She said in another video another police lifted his gun and cried: “I’m going to kill you all.
“It’s not normal,” Ferrell said in his memories.
“It’s not what we used to call a typical murder.
At that moment I felt cold.
I was angry, crying.
She planned a return flight and returned home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years was the theme of a new documentary, “Who’s Street?” on August 11.
It’s a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and perseverance from the perspective of people living in this community, filled with streets of streets.
When Ferrell and his daughter were driving to Ferguson (in a floral dress, in a crown decoration), they re-debated the numerous topics they discussed before that morning—About the Black Experience and the situation of the Black.
“Do you remember when I taught you when black people had to fight for their faith?” she recalled.
“We’re going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, it’s wrong.
“I had to take her,” Ferguson said later.
What happened today is all of the past... orgasm.
She needs to know, see and rise out of that.
She needs not only to develop well in terms of radicalism and organization, but also to understand the different levels of the black experience and the situation of the black, and to understand what we need to do to get freedom and liberation.
Even if I was lucky to provide her with a racist experience she had not experienced, she was nothing different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this case, I feel I’m hurt her.
They arrive at Ferguson’s first station at a place opposite the South Florida Police Station.The radicals wait until police officer Darren Wilson finally failed to prosecute the result, the place became their camp.
Ferrell and her daughter were in contact with a local business boss who made a bag lunch.
They prepared the bags and were responsible for transferring the bags to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrell began to form a new type of action.
She said, “My radicalism completely changed after August 9, when she studied a bachelor's degree at St. Louis University of Missouri, she was the chairman of the National Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health gap in the black community.”
“I have no organizational experience.
That's how it all came.
Several weeks later, Ferrer met with film director Sabah Foleyan during a night march.
Foleyan said she and her photographic director Lucas Alvarado Falar “just want to record” what happened.
Farrell’s question rises in his mind: “Do you want to record or want to find a story you can use?”
This suspicion arises from many of these cases: people – usually white – enter a community to benefit from its pain and endurance.
As Foleyan explains in a recent interview, “We have heard that people in Ferguson native people don’t focus their voice, and we want to do it differently.
Foleyan has already been in contact with co-director Damon Davis. Damon Davis is a regional artist known for its radicalism against dead prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrell and six other locals to join the team of “Who’s Street?” project, which has not been abandoned for years after Brown’s shooting.
“This documentary isn’t anyone talking to us or talking to us, that’s our speech,” David Davis said.
“I focus mainly on how these characters appear, because that’s the way I’m presented.
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrell’s experience – but to show the campaign “not about the leaders of the Saviour, but about community cohesion,” Foleyan says – the fact that she is the most open among the film participants.
The result, “Who’s Street?” surprisingly recorded Ferrell’s personal life, such as falling in love, married.
“I feel naked,” Ferrel laughed when he saw the finished product for the first time.
“But I understand that doing this job and humanizing the black people must have a certain degree of vulnerability.
Furthermore, Ferrel's story reaffirms and repositions the role of black-cold women in the wider black life events movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement — created #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 black teenager Trevoron Martin shooting — were identified as cool children.
“The black-cold women in the leadership in general supported this movement,” Ferrell said, “that’s because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black girl needs to suffer all of that.
Foleyan agreed and mentioned: “This movement has really been supported by black women and many black-colored women.
Because of her identity, Ferrell was chosen to be the core of the film. However, she insisted that "this is not a positive action for things."
“She’s the person who inspired that energy,” she says.
“While she’s on the front, it’s not a coincidence, because in the life of these crossroads, as a black girl, you have a lot of things to do.”
Through the screen, you can feel her energy.
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have long been gone, but tensions between the community and the police remain.
For attempting to block highways during a march, Ferrell was sentenced to more than two and a half years of detention.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in the region she calls home: "A group of bad
Nevertheless, since she walked on Ferguson Street three years ago, she has insisted on her striving to remember the sacred song.
“We have the responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have the responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We are no longer losing, except the chain.
In fact, online translation services were already available on the web a decade ago, and in fact, a long time ago, the argument about “machines are coming to translate human beings” was never heard.
Relationships: Artists Use Chelsea Manning's DNA Creating Portraits
There are several faces in the center of the exhibition at the Friedman Museum of Art in New York: white, black and brown, with almost imperceptible similarities between each faces, which are bound by rows wrapped from the ceiling.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea Manning sent to her face to make a cotton and hair crack.
Manning sent hair friction from Levensburg prison for disclosing a secret diplomatic telegram via the WikiLeaks website, a former intelligence analyst who was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
The exhibition was opened on August 2, with the title "The Similarities".
This is the result of two years of communication between Dwayne Hagburg and Manning, Dwayne Hagburg combined his disciplines with his disciplines in technology, computer science and art, while Manning was a famous diverse politician who had been in prison and completed transgender surgery in prison. Former President Obama forgive her remaining punishment three days before the end of his term.
Through an algorithmic analysis from Manning’s DNA, 30 portraits of “very likely appearance” created by H.D. H.H. H.H. H.H. H.H. H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H.H
Bradley Edward, whose name was born, had openly acknowledged herself as a woman in his youth. In 2013, he was convicted of 20 charges, including six of spying violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photo, with a particle-sensitive black-white self-shot, appearing obviously anxious, sitting on the driver's seat, wearing a black-gold hair.
In 2015, Heather Duwey Habogger achieved a huge success in her 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In that work, she utilizes the evidence of middle court, extracted from smoke and sugar, to create 3D portraits of characters that might look similarly.
That was an email she just received from the Paper Magazine.
“They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a portrait,” Heather Duwey Hubberg told the media at the opening ceremony.
At that time, Chelsea Manning could not visit or take pictures, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
So, the artist and her prisoner Mouse became his impossible friend and exchanged many letters to each other over two years.
They even created a comic book, The Head of the Repressed, painted by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted that the president could give Manny a privilege in the future, and she could see the exhibition in prison.
And just a few days after the book was published, Obama asked her release, and it was probably a coincidence when Manning spent the seventh year in the Kansas Military Prison.
In addition, the exhibition has another layer of profound intention. Because of the contemporary United States, the Trump administration is constantly declaring war against government hackers and transgender soldiers, while looking for a new way, which can be scattered on Twitter, to stimulate the division, and this exhibition is just to compensate for such divisions.
When asked about all these special moments, Heather Duwey Habogger said, “Everything has a reason.”
In an artist’s statement written on the gallery wall, Manning’s super-number signed below (the “i” in the name is painted with a heart) calling for an end of “gender, sexual orientation and culture-based party conflict”.
On the opposite wall there was her DNA sequence of particles, with a pen deformation of the symbols of Cs, Gs and As.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleic acid, each artist’s complex scientific dictionaries), Heather Duwey Habogger wanted to express this, at least in physical structure, by depicting these amazingly similar portraits.
“I want people to get rid of this problem that our genoms don’t care about who we are, how public genetic data is interpreted, and how subjective it is,” Heather Dway Hubgger said in his 2007 video work False Memories.
“DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so this is 30 of them.
The last work in the exhibition, in a room, comes from one page of the novel in the previous illustration.
Exhibited floating, diamond-shaped manning under the US soldiers' handheld extender.
“When they stopped your speech, they won,” he wrote on the wall.
“So don’t shut your mouth.
“The content comes directly from a letter she wrote to me,” the artist from Philadelphia said.
“I’m afraid, I’m still going to say.
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally, as forecasted in the comic, but when she does it, she will be rejoiced by her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters at the center of the exhibition.
It was also intended, as all the objects in the exhibition, to reach the height of her genetic single-group information written with a pencil (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
“In the past, I have hanged them on the wall, but I want them to feel like a group of people,” Duwey Hagberg said when he spoke to the portrait.
“But I want to make them feel like a group of protesters followed by Chelsea, just as people protested to release her.
Northwest University professor and Oxford University staff are accused of murder
Police said a man found deadly wounded in a Chicago luxury apartment and a Northwest University professor and an Oxford University employee were subsequently investigated and are currently looking for suspects across the country.
Cook County Court records showed that 42-year-old Wendham Riceem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were arrested on Monday for suspect of the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Durano.
According to the document records, 26-year-old Cornell Duranoin died from several injuries.
A community warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
After the police received a call, they reached Grand Plaza apartment and found several crashes on the victim.
Police said Cornell Durano was killed at the time, and the detective was investigating his murder, while the police was actively looking for two suspects.
Lesem has been a deputy professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Kobech, Vice President of the Campus Relations Department, said in an email statement that Leather has now been dismissed and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campus.
Coebec said, “It is now a criminal case, and the relevant authorities are investigating and the Northwest University is actively working on the investigation.
Warren is an senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
Oxford University Samuel College spokeswoman said in an email statement: “We have always been in contact with the British police and are ready to help the U.S. investigation agencies whenever needed.
The statement adds that Warren’s colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped he would be able to file his surrender.
The Chicago Police Department’s chief contact officer Anthony Guillermi said the suspects strongly encouraged to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have already an approximate idea of their falling and we are trying to locate possible locations.
Guerrmi said local, regional and national authorities are doing their best to help the investigation of the suspects.
Guerelmie said the police received a call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager and he just received a secret message that said the case was happening in the apartment number 1008.
Police said the situation was terrible at the time.
Guillermi said it is still unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He said, according to the security cameras, confirmed that Lesem and Warren were at the time in the building.
“We believe that Professor Lessem and the victim have a certain relationship,” Gorelmi said.
Grand Plaza’s management team issued a statement to residents: “Police is currently investigating the victim’s time lines and background, investigating various motivations, including possible domestic events together.
Russian Vice Prime Minister Mutko said “We will complete the World Anti-Doping Agency’s route map in the near future.”
Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitali Mutko said the implementation of the WADA’s remaining standards to restore the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will not take a long time.
“The implementation of the route map standards has been implemented at a certain stage, and RUSADA has gained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD.
The WADA route map is updated in this regard,” Mutco said on Thursday.
Vice Prime Minister Mutco made the above statement in commenting on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Authority Roadmap "Compliance Regulations", which set the standards for the restoration of RUSADA rights and recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the standard does not include anything that could cause Russia's concern.
He added: “Everything must be announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian anti-doping agencies must publicly accept the results of an investigation approved by Canadian lawyer Richard Michael on the WADA on the support of the Russian state’s use of doping events in their country’s sports.
Speaking about this, Mutco said: “We are investigating and our anti-dumping system has no doubt failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind that, we will not recognize something that doesn’t exist.
The words of Mutko responded to the words of Vitali Smilnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Antidoping Committee.
Smilnov acknowledged problems in the past of the Russian anti-doping agency in receiving a visit to the Russian outlet RSport earlier that day, but he added: “We have said several times in various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally,” Smilnov said.
Following the doping scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended RUSADA’s right to conduct doping tests in Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate tests this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA CEO Olivia Negri said during a visit to the organization in Moscow headquarters in July that RUSADA is “going in the right direction” trying to restore its rights.

The import tariffs of products such as electric refrigerators, electric kettle, massages, cosmetics and cosmetics in Korea have been reduced by 40% and will be reduced to zero tariffs in years.
There are also a significant reduction of taxes such as consumer electronics.
At the same time, zero customs products under the autonomous trade zone also include many intermediate products and raw materials needed to manufacture domestic end-to-end consumer goods, which also promoted to some extent the structural improvement of domestic consumer goods.
A senior spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce said that one-third of our total imports of products can enjoy the treatment of self-trade agreements, most of which are end-consumer goods, bringing real benefits to consumers.
Additional reduction of import tariffs of consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted the import tariffs on some consumer goods to further reduce import tariffs on consumer goods, covering food, health goods, medicines, chemicals, clothing shoes, household appliances, cultural entertainment, Japanese foods and other various consumer goods, including 187 eight-bit tax numbers.
The average tax rate on these consumer goods will drop from 17.3% directly to 7.7%, almost being "stopped"!
As of January 1, 2018, China has been partially adjusted to other import import import tariffs.
Import tariffs on parts of cosmetics, such as lipstick, eyelash, perfume, etc. dropped from 10% to 5%;
The reduction of tariffs means consumers don’t need to buy exchanges or go far away abroad to buy their favorite foreign products.

External report: U.S. shops regulates big differences at the end of the year. Refunds should be cautious
China New Network on December 29th
According to the U.S. Daily, Christmas was coming back.
American Broadcasting Company (ABC) that more than half of the goods sold last Christmas were returned.
Furthermore, readers have been cheated several times on-line purchases, and consumers need to be more careful when shopping on an unformal website.
Generally, large shopping companies have regular and reasonable return procedures, but you should be careful when buying gifts or e-commerce from some small stores.
Mrs. Ronan's Hus bought a jacket for more than $60 (USD, below) in an online store on December 1st, and the result has not been sent.

After knowing that he was fraudulent, request a refund to the website and get a full refund.
But there are also customers who believe that the website’s refund service is not 100% perfect.
A Northern California Chinese resident Mr. King said he had purchased an emergency delivery service for a website twice, and once an emergency service for $4 but hadn’t been delivered at time.
After that, a refund request was made and no response was received.
Large shops or shops have a better return policy.

If there is no certification, customers can also obtain shopping points that can be used to buy other goods.

Excellent shopping experience, a new era of shopping development in the business sector is coming.
More than a decade ago, our whole country was still in the sales market, with people’s choice is limited and demand is limited.
But after a decade of development, the market has already realized a transition from the seller market to the buyers market, today’s consumer tastes are becoming greater and they are no longer satisfied with the simple simple “hand-to-hand delivery” shopping behavior.
Therefore, how to make consumers get an exceptional shopping experience becomes the next competitive point for real estate developers.
And among the many factors that influence consumer shopping experience, the shopping center in the business sector is the most significant.
Look at how city builders around the world focus on shopping experience.
There are no two completely identical leaves in the world, no two completely identical shopping centers, and a famous shopping center must have its own characteristics.
For example, Turkey's famous Kanyon shopping center, its unique wave-shaped architectural design inspired by the Grand Canyon, so called the Harmonic Canyon, walking on the 200m walk of the Minister in the middle of the Canyon, as if it was placed inside the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon design, in the centre of the shopping center there is also a large circular exhibition area with appearance unique and often host special performances.
Because of its open platform design, visitors can walk on every floor to watch the activities performed in the "Cangee" and have the effect of changing views.
In the country, Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, called China’s first forest walking spot, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tale perfectly.
7000 square meters of green square, 3000 square meters of roof water platform, the project consists of 9 single buildings, connected air chain between each buildings, the entire submarine garden designed, taking up the ground of the French chicken tree as a building surface skin, roof water terrace, create a forest-like sense.
Walking into the Forest Moore, it is like an unbeatenly falling into Alice’s adventurous rabbit hole, climbing along the trees surrounding the buildings, the grass and the fountains, bringing people into a living and vibrant forests.
Also, in Hong Kong, Dong Lake, the Qaraji Water Trade Circle was built, planned to enter into the future more than 50 international top exclusive flagship stores, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 domestic and foreign well-known brands, to build a comprehensive business center of the service industry, theme characteristics.
Moreover, the Qaraji Aquatic Circle also integrates the ecology into the buildings, oriented to TOD public transport, bringing fashion shopping, living services, food, entertainment, education, sport together, while bringing consumers an incredible shopping experience, also bringing them to enjoy the unique “shore water culture” of Qaraji, combining shopping with water entertainment and recreation perfectly.
Overall, it can be found that some households have already understood the tracks of discovering this new urban business, and industry officials say that a consumer experience-centered consumption model that combines shopping with experience will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
Today’s business sector is not only a place of merchandise, but also a place of integration of artistic culture and creative themes, but also the responsibility of people to live in urban areas.
Therefore, while satisfying consumers eating and play-off purchasing one-stop material needs, maximizing the spiritual needs of multi-level transmission of cultural art, playing well-being living needs, is necessarily the highlight of the future development of the business sector.
In Hong Kong, the north coast of Jiangsu, the landscape of Jiangsu, close to the viewing bridge, the world's business excellence, the international giant surrounding, the first-class brands gather together, close to the international fashion.
Here is a great step, and the world is magnificent.
Eastern Tokyo has a better shopping environment, Eastern Tokyo is close to South Tokyo business area, only enjoying the leading four-layer steady transport system in the west and even the country, improved shopping convenience.
In addition, the greenization of the garden and landscape floors of the two walking streets of the Wanda Square, the planting of about 300 shares of Jumi, the renovation of the land covered 40,000 square meters, improved the image of the South Street commercial circle;
During the first low-density beach shopping district of Hong Kong, Zhangzhou, is surrounded by nine parks, the commercial district is low-density and high-open, making people more willing to stop, staying, slowly enjoy shopping pleasure, rather than by the people behind the flows of people quickly and rapidly jumping forward, truly achieving “walking shopping”.
Today’s commercial competition is only increasingly intense about how to kill a bloodway in a serious homogeneous market, taking the reputation of the “shopping holy place” in the mind of future consumers, which is worth all real estate developers considering seriously.
Simply differentiating strategy is far from not enough, only those who really correctly put the consumer into the mind, the consumer is hurry, think the consumer think, and the developers who offer consumers an extreme and simplified shopping experience can laugh on the market in which storms are coming.
Of course, to the end, the people of Hong Kong, who have such a good shopping experience and business circle, were placed ten years ago, no one could imagine the prosperity of today.

Whether it’s the online shopping platform or the payment platform, all belongs to the Ali Group of Macau.
A decade ago, no one would have thought that the 11th of November, single youth, from the self-created "Festival of Light" subculture, would be collected by e-commerce traders, becoming the "Double 11" shopping festival of today phenomenon.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used the marketing headline for the first time of the “Fighting Day Promotion”: No one talks about love with you, so “single dogs” come to shop online.
As a result, it was surprisingly, that day the trade volume of Abu Dhabi (the former of "Kats") broke 52 million, which was ten times the daily trade volume at the time.
Since then, "Double 11" has become a shopping festival built by Alibaba, from the beginning domestic buyers to sellers to the flow of global merchants, nine years have passed, the trade volume of the "Double 11" was already more than 3,200 times the same year, making "Black Friday" a dust.
Promote with Windy Kitty "Dou 11", there are many electric companies, among which "Kyoto" is the strongest.
Kyoto has its own shopping festival "6.18", but no "double 11" impact big, this year lasting from November 1st to 11th, Kyoto's total sales reached $1271 billion.
And after the "Double 11", the similar "Double 12" break the celebration and Christmas New Year shopping archive.
Through the new year, waiting for Chinese consumers and the annual purchase period of goods before spring, Valentine's Day shopping period, consumption, no vacation.
The environmental issues brought by immediate sea consumption have caused the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to the standard preservation estimates of 0.2 kg each package in the industry, at least more than 300,000 tons of waste were generated during the “Double 11” this year.
Liu Wu, Director of the Green and East Asia Department of Pollution Control Project, told China and foreign dialogue that the number of orders for “Double 11” cats will generate 160,000 tons of packaging waste this year.
The National Post Office published a report in 2016 that pointed out that the number of fast items in the 2015 "Double 11" period (11-16 November), using more than 3 billion textile bags, 99.22 billion packages, 169.85 billion meters tape, the band length can circle the Earth's equator 425 round.
And this year, the National Post Office expects “Double 11” fast-paced operations to exceed 1.5 billion.
King, the manager of a waste burning center in Beijing, told New York City, that after the “Double 11” there were more than 2,000 tons of waste every day, and that also exceeded the processing capacity of the burning station.
Express companies have realized that the environmental pollution caused by the fast transportation industry is not underestimated.
Several electronic logistics companies, including Sunny, have launched “Double 11” recyclable recyclable plastic shortcuts, cycle packaging bags that can be reused as shopping bags and garbage bags, and so on, but the consumer acceptability is not high.
Microsoft also calls on the logistics industry to support “green packaging” and “green logistics”.

What kind of mobile payments do Germans want?
Zhang Winter: The war of mobile payments launched in Germany is unpredictable.
Bitcoin payments and payments only moved the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, the robbers have not changed – the Chinese, that is also globalization.
Where there is payment, there must be micro-payments.
Under an agreement with German e-payment service provider Wirecard, Microsoft Payments officially launched in Germany in November this year and gradually launched by traders across Europe.
The two “old villages” of the expatriates repeatedly occurred in Europe.
Since then, paying treasures and mobile payments have been chanted on the path of globalization.
For the globalized way of China’s mobile payments, Ery Consulting China’s third-party mobile payments industry research report 2017 summarized in two ways: one is through strategic investment, experience output, stocking and supporting domestic mobile payments enterprises.
The second is to promote mobile payment services to foreign traders through consumer behavior of Chinese tourists abroad, thereby changing the recognition and acceptance of foreign domestic mobile payments in China.
Indeed, the Chinese must go to heaven.
China’s economy is rapidly growing, along with a large population base, the expenditure of Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure.
But it is also determined that the Chinese mobile payments war launched this time in Germany was unexpected.
Bitcoin payments and payments are just moving the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, the stolen position has not changed – or the Chinese, that is also globalization?
A more pioneering examination is whether China’s mobile payments can expand its territory in the mainland of Europe?
Take Germany for example.
The “Magical New Retail” was introduced.
Chen Zhang, Yang Kean: Amazon announces its entry into the bookstore and food stores when it comes to the top ten retailers in the world, regardless of the time and motivation.
In November 2015, Amazon opened the first entity bookstore in Seattle, and then opened two bookstore in Portland and San Diego.
Earlier 2017, Amazon opened a store in New York and plans to have at least eight shops by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced its brandless supermarket (Amazon Go) trial operations, customers to the store do not need ordering, do not need to bill, enter the code, get the desired goods leave, and the purchase amount will automatically be deduced from the customer’s Amazon account.
For Amazon, suddenly moving frequencies on entity stores in recent years have been very unexpected.
As early as in 2007’s Open Letter to Shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon would not open an entity store easily unless the following four conditions meet simultaneously:
We must be sure that this new opportunity will return the investments of the shareholders;
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is important for the whole company.
We must make sure that this new opportunity is ignored by the market.
We must be sure in this market we have enough resources to make customer-oriented differentiations.
Book shops and food stores are the most rocky classifications among the two entity retail stores, and are the first rivals to fall since Amazon’s rise.
Amazon announced entering the two entity markets when it comes to the top ten retailers in the world, regardless of the moment and the motivation.
Is Amazon’s practice contrary to the warranty in the shareholder letter?
The other end of the earth was heard a similar voice as well.In the morning of October 13, 2016, the President of the Alibaba Board of Directors, Maun, held a topic speech at the 2016 Hangzhou’s Summit.
“Alibaba will no longer mention the ‘e-commerce’ statement from next year.
The era of pure e-commerce will soon be over and there will be no e-commerce in the next decade or twenty years, replacing ‘new retail’.
Combined underline and logistics to create new retail sales.
At one time, the three words "new retail" were like magic, often hanging on the mouth by industry people.
But what does “new retail” mean?
If you just combine the finger line with the bottom line, then this concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked the 180 largest electricity companies estimated total sales of around $20 billion, with the largest 25 of which accounted for over $159 billion.
Of these 25 companies, 18 were traditional retailers on the line only in the past five years (e.g. Messi, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
Alibaba Group’s $283 billion in shares of Sunny Cloud, is still in sight.
Globally, retailers and telecommunications are moving from one channel to a full-channel retail system covering entity shops, e-commerce, mobile terminals and social media.
Is the “New Retail” of Mahanty more a summary than a prospective for the future?
If not, what is the difference between the whole channel concept and the “new retail”?
Per the key to the problem is not whether it will be fused on line and under line, but how it will be fused.
Given the last 20 years of retail industry, the rise of e-commerce, like the rise of early discount retailers, focused on prices and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, electronics moved very high standardized products, such as books and CDs, from the line to the line.
With the development of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, the e-commerce will also extend the touch to other categories and begin to improve efficiency.
“Using the ideas and technologies of the Internet to fully reform and upgrade the total number of existing approximately 300 trillion social retailers, the growing consumer needs of China’s consumers can be effectively satisfied, making the entire process of product production, circulation and service more efficient because of the wide use of the Internet and big data.
Therefore, the way of e-commerce is a way of superficial light assets, practically heavy assets.
“Light” refers to the loads of fixed assets, personnel configuration, management processes, etc. without a traditional retail industry; “heavy” refers to the need for huge investments in logistics, warehouses, etc.
Changing the logistics way ensures the high efficiency of e-commerce.
According to China’s government network, Prime Minister Li-Zong headed the State’s Permanent Meeting on April 28, the meeting believes that expanding domestic consumption demand is an important initiative for stable growth and restructuring.
The meeting determined that the relevant departments should strictly draw specific plans on the basis of scientific evaluation.

On January 18, Alibaba held an e-commerce pivotal dialogue on poverty in Hong Kong, announcing that by exploring a new model of “Internet+ elimination of poverty” it will promote precision of poverty and rural revitalization.
This is after proposing rural strategy, launching rural borrowing projects, up-to-line agricultural poverty support platform and establishing the Alibaba poverty reduction fund, Ali again “coding” on the fight against poverty.
The elimination of poverty is one of China's most important national strategies.
A complete elimination of poverty in China has never been achieved in the last thousands of years.
“Electrical poverty reduction is a new round of innovative initiative for poverty reduction development and is an important step in achieving accurate poverty reduction and accurate elimination.
The Central Bank emphasizes and points out that the Internet can play the role of helping eliminate poverty, promoting precision reduction, precision elimination of poverty, allowing agricultural products to get out of rural areas through the Internet.
As a result, Ali proposed rural strategy in 2014, combined with big data cloud computing and globalization as Ali’s three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the rural borrowing project, recruiting the village “Small II” in the village, leading farmers to become wealthy through e-commerce.
In 2017, Ali collaborated with the business department to build an agricultural poverty reduction channel, which currently supports 13 provinces of the country and 120 national level poverty districts.
There are 2118 villages founded by Ali platform.
Of these, 400 appear in the province’s poverty counties, and 33 appear in 13 countries’ poverty counties.
In 2017, the country’s sales at Alibaba’s Chinese retail platform reached $12 billion.
As he said, face to face the national strategy to eliminate poverty, Ali has been thinking about how to take a new way to eliminate poverty using the technology, big data and cloud computing of the Ali economy’s innovative capabilities.
Among them, Wuhan is the main transportation platform for Ali Electronic Commerce’s elimination of poverty, and has gone through a new link to direct-sales internet to eliminate poverty.
In the field of cultivation, the village and the monkeys are jointly supporting agricultural funding equipment and small loans.
In 2017, in 832 national-level poverty counties, 795 monkeys served, providing easy payments, credit and services.
We solve storage and logistics, Qat is responsible for sales, Alibaba big data reptiles guide agricultural production, further improve the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of e-commerce elimination of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
Ali opened e-commerce courses through the University of Abu Dhabi to teach farmers standardized, qualitative and scaled cultivation methods, achieving a combination of "removing poverty + encouraging mind" to enable farmers to get rid of poverty sustainably.
These courses have already covered approximately 92 percent of national level poverty counties.
The idea of “public-benefit and business means” of removal of poverty also ensures that Ali does “real poverty” when healed poverty.
Alibaba’s Executive Board chairman Mao said the elimination of poverty should be divided into three phases of poverty reduction, elimination of poverty and getting wealthy.
Poverty is given to people with fish, poverty is given to people with fish, wealth is given to people with fish, wealth is to create a “fish barbecue” for farmers, making farmers fish feedable.
The electricity-driven industry to reduce poverty is the production of fisheries.
In the field of industrial poverty reduction, Ali and Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zong Zong Zong Zong Zong Zong Zong Zong Z
The work of Ali Electronics in poverty reduction has also been recognized by the decision-makers.
Electronic enterprises represented by Alibaba have been sent through online sub-line channels to ensure farmers increase in production.
Some of the village’s little ones and monkeys were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of e-commerce removing poverty.
Currently, the United Nations World Food Programme’s Chinese office has, together with Shigong, conducted the e-commerce reduction of poverty in Anjou and other regions.
The “third New Economic Intelligence Conference” jointly held by Ali Institute and China Vision Qingdao, was held on January 16th, where Zhang Lee, head of the Institute of Electronics and Commerce of the Department of Commerce, was attended and spoke.
She believes that our globalization has actually ignored the most important issues, the body and use of globalization, and the phase of globalization.
Therefore, many people think globalization has stagnated, and many developed countries and developing countries have different attitudes towards globalization in the new phase, different models.
The second concept is the problem of the mid-term stage of globalization, and what are the limits of the mid-term stage of globalization?
The restrictions based on the economic environment are just because the economic basis has changed globalization.
Zhengy believes that the global economic adjustment is essentially ended by the end of 2017 and will enter a new round of growth after 2018 and the next round of growth must be a lifecycle drawing.
Kyoto's first fresh supermarket 7FRESH is officially opened recently and plans to open more than 1,000 stores across the country in the next three to five years.
Together with Ali's box of horses, glorious super species, Sunny's sovereign species, Melody's handfish, etc., "the new retail stores" began to appear and "call" each other in innovative models even at prices.
Fresh supermarket competition upgrade, has become a phenomenal level topic in the new retail sector, where is new retail?
“In 2018, we will quickly enter the country, and a lot of shops will be opened in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou before Spring Festival.
Box Mazzhen CEO Hussein revealed the "New Act of 2018" on the second new retail summit on 10th.
“From 2018, Box Horse is not just a live electricity provider, but a live-quality electricity provider that satisfies consumer’s immediate service.
The core model line is the drive, experience, and the line is real sales.
Different from the traditional store and supermarkets, the box is a fun and delicious "online shop" in the eyes of many consumers, and even brokers have introduced the concept of "box area".
Online telecommunications platforms and underline retailers have their own disadvantages, but consumers appear in many channels, so both are trying the full-channel model.
The industry is believed that in the context of a major consumption upgrade, there will be more and more stores in 2018 for "Class Horses".
While box horses are constantly explored from the original fresh to more consuming fields, predicting more innovation in the retail market in the new year.
“For example, the online combined business model attracted consumer’s eyes, and all over the world’s fresh supermarket calls are called good.
“But these relations say more, no more, no more, and finally realize whether you have brought a good experience to the consumer, I’ve experienced it and I’m ready to buy.
According to the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed, and purchasing demand has also changed.
Originally on the pure line, underline is broken, underline to beat the line, underline to counter-attack line, now one hand, because the consumer has no distinction underline.
The competition of capital has made the new retail fireplace now represented by the fresh supermarkets.
The analysis suggests that the competition for new retail in the first line cities is far from the Red Sea, and there are still large parts of the second line cities that are still being mined, and there is still a lot of opportunities and space in the market.
Different types of industry layout for new retailers will bring the development of new retailers into a state of diversified development.

Help you avoid a company becoming the next priority start-up.
Amy Erett once wanted to investigate the happiness of employees at her e-commerce startup, but the investigation didn’t work.
The answers received are often unforgettable, unhelpable, and even worse, there are fraudulent answers.
Even though she promised to take anonymous form, some employees still don’t trust the process.
Eret, responsible for the management of 75-persons in San Francisco e-commerce escort company Madison Reed, said “The response received is lack of consistency and objectivity.”
So she called out for help.
A group of new human resources startups, such as spring after rain, have emerged, helping companies understand the feelings of employees.
They build and authorize software specifically used to measure employee involvement, allowing companies to quickly conduct opinions tests on specific teams and populations, provide anonymous and complaint hot lines to employees, and, in some cases, allow reporters to move the executive report directly to the board.
“Now, you can track your health with tools such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit?” said Jim Barnet, co-founder and CEO of Glint, Redwood startups.Glint software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Eret said she has gained more insight on employees’ ideas and feelings with Glint over three years.
In addition to the rapid investigations and opinions of a specific team, Glint also provides the company’s quotes of which units complain the most, which managers approved the low-scores, at first sight – which allows her to understand why.
Companies begin to realize that they need to be skilled in controlling the company’s workplace culture to avoid becoming the next priority. Previously, employees published a blog post describing the harassment environment, which speakers were punished by the company, and then the priority fell into scandal.
For startups such as Glint, a company’s supervision desire is a money-free business opportunity.
According to data from the Financial Technology Analysis website Let's Talk Payments, the global governance, regulation and compliance sectors may be worth more than $1,187 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a start-up in Denver, Colorado, is committed to helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, and they saw an increase in interest and activity in this regard during priority reputation damages earlier this year.
Convercent has 600 customers, including Apple, Microsoft and Tesla.
Optimum recently signed a contract to become a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized “diagnostic” surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view hot maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
If the President is involved, the complaint will be directed to the Board of Directors.
Convercent’s founder and chief executive, Patrick Kunlan, said: “The Court of Opinion has taken away the authority of the regulatory authorities.
If a company is found to treat employees badly or behave unethical to employees, even if regulatory authorities do not intervene, the company may face the high consequences of consumer resistance, employee loss and involvement in proceedings, Queen said.
Ruby Tuesday is a restaurant chain across 500 locations and with more than 25,000 employees, which has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees understand their work rules and regulations and provide an easy way to contact the company’s headquarters.
Before that, if employees want to report a problem, they must find the company’s headquarters’ telephone number or e-mail, submit formal complaints and hope the headquarters can take it seriously.
This is often a frightening and disturbing experience, as Ruby Tuesday’s legal general advisor James Vitrano said he believes there is no good way to track employees’ complaints.
But now the company uses Convercent to detect and solve problems that were previously unknown by a remote office, city or state - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage behavior.
“I can get a closer and comprehensive experience in 360 degrees,” said Vitrano, responsible for Ruby Tuesday’s risk management team.
“We are protecting our shareholders from employment lawsuit.
Queen said, after the end of the end of the accounting office in Andorra because of a security scandal violating ethical norms, companies have increased emphasis on ethics, values and employment since 2002.
But until “social media entered their own world,” companies realized they could not stop their explosives from spreading viral online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people see hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service and charge the regular fees for the use of the products from different companies.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by risk investors who have already supported both startups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million funds from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, whose total capital rose to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, with a total of $60 million.
Given the interconnection between companies, culture and risk investments, these investments are hardly surprising.
More and more research shows that today’s employees’ expectations for the workplace are higher than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high wages and fun projects are just a bet.
Employees want to feel they are accepted and appreciated, and feel their time spent on a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to join a company, feel their voice is heard, and the work they do is useful, they are more committed to making a company succeed,” said Nina McCartney, Vice President of LinkedIn Global Welfare and Employee Experience.
Investors returns when their portfolio company performs well; the company performs well when employees are loyal and dedicated.
It is no wonder if third-party analytics tools promise to increase employees’ loyalty and devotion, they are seeking financial support.
Workplace culture experts say having employment data is very important.
However, these data are useless unless the company’s administrators take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees to provide feedback, it can be expected that the company is undergoing changes.
If the change does not progress fast enough, or there is no little progress, it can lead to disappointment and lead employees to leave the company.
Russell Ratz, consulting business manager at Cote International, said: “If you want to seek 4000 suggestions, you need to be prepared for 4000 conversations, and he has seen some companies that are too dependent on data collection mistakes.”
“Because if you don’t follow it all, the staff will think, ‘Do you really hear me?
Do you care?
If you don’t care, why do I care?”
Eret said Madison Reed is now performing monthly employee surveys and was able to take action on the day of Glint reporting the issue.
After collecting employees’ feedback about their failure due to their decision-making speed and quality of communication, she was able to solve problems by restructuring the company’s internal teams and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights on its employees, and in the long term they wish to be able to make a transformation in this industry known for high talent loss rates and better retain employees.
“If you are not committed to creating a transparent culture, you’ll lose talent,” Vitrano said.
If you lose talent, you’re going to lose customers.
When you lose customers, you lose your company.

NCAA cancelled training twice a day and extends the day-to-day training time
Close at 11 p.m., a football team from the University of California in Los Angeles walked alongside the team’s new campus practice area.
Some players have taken off the sports shirt and revealed the body that sweated after the training day of the training camp.
For a large part of the team, these free minutes are rest time.
Players who participate in the summer courses will return to the hostel after three hours of training, and then return to Waterman Football Center at 6:30 the next morning to attend a meeting.
“The next three days are a mixture for these guys,” Bear coach Jim Mora said on Monday when it is coming on Tuesday.
NCAA canceled two exercises daily (measuring to reduce the player’s burden), but actually extended their day training time – at least before the end of Friday.
This is why the first three trainings at the University of California at Los Angeles are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to adapt to the schedule of players who have been busy.
From the cancellation of two-day trainings to more one-day trainings, the Bear team started training almost a week before the previous season, with Morra trained in summer school for the first time in six seasons of Westwood.
They are scheduled to start 18 training sessions on August 20, and then start preparing for the official competition for Texas Farmers in September.
Mora said he supported NCAA's rules adjustment, although this would make the player's busy journey adds another project.
“In three or four days, we’ll have a huge amount of training to them, which is very challenging,” Morra said.
“They’re just passing too.They’re training and they’re all great kids.
I thought on Saturday, we'll have more time, it's really great.
At the end of the training camp, the California University of Los Angeles department will stop training.Given the clear views of the nearby parking lot and the Luskin Center, this is not an easy task.Luskin Center Advanced Hotel has been thrown injury by football through the back-pole defensive networks.
Starting this weekend, Bear team members will stay in the hotel, but Mora acknowledged that there could be problems once these rooms are open in the middle of the season.
“We will take security measures,” Mora said.
“It’s a really worrying issue.Thinking that someone might rent a room, sitting in the room and recording training scenes is not hard.
If you have a training video, it’s pretty good.
But we will take security measures there, and security measures are also taken at Parking No. 8.
We will use our resources to do our best.
I will not be too worried about it.
We have prepared a plan.

Facebook will launch facts verification function to combat fake news
Facebook announced on Thursday that it would send more potential malware articles to third-party detection agencies and show the results of the detection below the original post. Facebook, the world’s largest online social network, is trying to fight so-called fake news.
Facebook said in a statement on its website that Facebook would start using up-to-date machines to learn to detect possible malware and send it to the fact verificators and may display the fact verification results below the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points of so-called fake news, and many believe Facebook has influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
This issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, with voters faced a lot of false stories before the French presidential election in May, and Germany first passed the support of the fine plans before the September election, and would be punished if the social media networks failed to remove hate posts in time.

She added that Facebook will continue to test its "related articles" feature and make other changes to its news releases to reduce fake news.
Create a painting novel: The Story of the Castle of England
Recently, the small Scotney Castle became the protagonist in a compressed music film and once became a shelter for Mrs. Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s.
But Scotney has seen a 700-year turbulent history in the comfortable location of the Bell River, Kent, and now it is a source of inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes (a Yorkshire man who has a special interest in history, holding his head pulling).
“You can see the signs of ancient 300 years ago, and I find it really beautiful,” he said.
What kind of human destiny is that this letter falls in my hands.
From the Middle Ages to the Edwards Age, “A Castle of England” was recorded by families living in Scotney, each story was made by different, future British artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rose's first book to archive as raw materials: he also wrote The Teeth of the Dead and Other Stories of 2014, a book inspired by British Library literature, a work made with his uncontrollable creative passion.
He said, “The moment I saw the fingerprints left on the side of the letter, I couldn’t stop my writing impulse, which was written by a double agent who worked for Jacob in the 18th century.
That’s his fingerprints!
And the letters always smelled a smell of smoke, because at that time you need a fire to have light.
For us 300 years later, this smell makes them feel like they are around us too.
Oh, I like the archive!”
For those who were driven by old paper, getting the support of the National Trust and Art Commission of England and living in the castle for almost four months (“Then, I’ve been a little long time”) seems great, just not to believe it is true.
Rose spent a few days visiting Victoria’s “New” castle, reviewing the archives, exploring many treasures and ancient games in the field, such as a dog head hanging on the wall, and a bottle for centuries in the Gardens River.
He walked through the land and ruins of the old castle, talked with wanderers, gardeners, and sometimes with illustrative artists drawing for his books.
Then, at night, he will drink a bit of whisky and then write.
Scottney’s secret history is unclear, since the National Trust only entered fully after the death of his last heir Elizabeth Hesse in 2006.
A decade later, when Rose arrived, the staff began processing the files and described them as “the nobles of centuries ago are going to go,” “Oh, put it in the cabinet.”
The journal, a letter from the British Empire period, describing the map of the territories of different countries: “You would think land disputes would be boring,” Rose said, “but two families would be going to make a big deal for a white tree.”
Let’s go guys!”
Some of the stories in the work take the castle as a starting point and come into a wider study of British history, including The Labourer, a story of a man who left the newly built castle to participate in the farmers rebellion in 1381.
“The story in the book called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex” records a rebellion in the castle in 1380,” Rose said.
“The farmers rebellion began in that area and I think it’s a good place to start the rebellion.
“Maybe these two are connected?”
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the British Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, the master of the story is the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to take a funeral for himself through a stone-filled container (a few years later, his container was exposed to the ground until people discovered).
The Darrells is Rose's favourite Scottney Castle family: "These guys seem to be indifferent, always borrowing money and spend more money to buy things they can't buy."
Generation to generation Darley men solve their debt problems by marrying rich old women, I think they should be a group of cute guys who know how to pursue women.
As his mission in the castle ended, Rose began to look for other strange writing experiences.
He completed a painting novel for two weeks in the wilderness in Finland about “El?¤m?¤nm?¤ki”, a early 20th century therapeutic hospital, which later was slowly abandoned.
But Scotney has a special position for him.
“I am sad to leave,” he said.
“It’s like, ‘Oh, I have to face the real life of the dirty.”

Large energy companies are “rich country”, so who of the many energy companies in the world is the most worthy of money?
Yesterday, the famous PFC Energy Company announced the top 50 listed energy companies in 2011, followed by U.S. oil and gas producer Exxon M.F. with a market value of $406.3 billion, the Chinese oil and the Royal Shell.
In this PFC list, Central Oil has been in question twice in 2007 and 2009 and the rest of the year's list is all taken by ExxonMobil.
In the 2011 top 50 list, there were three companies from China’s domestic territory, in addition to second-rated Central Oil, and ninth-rated Chinese petrochemical and fifteenth-rated Chinese marine oil.
According to PFC’s statistics, although oil prices are far higher than four years ago, PFC Energy’s CEO noted that there are many reasons for the low market value, mainly including the drop in North American gas prices and low activity in the global stock market.

The law will replace the current scheme to reduce chain migration.
This new application process will benefit applicants who speak English, have financial support and have skills beneficial for economic development.

Sex robots are actually rising, but we should be careful.
Just when you think 2017 would not be more strange, a new report on the technological development in the field of sex robotics was published.
and yes.
Sex robots are important now.
Recently, the Responsible Robot Foundation (FRR) published a report over the development of sex robots in the next five to decades.
According to Sheffield University of Robotic Technology and Artificial Intelligence Honours Professor and co-founder of FRR Noel Shaki, we need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, breast shape and nail type.
Shaki said in the new report: “People laugh at the back, but big companies have actually launched a lot of sex robots, and we’ll see more.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from breathing dolls to robots, they have silicone skin, appear warmly, and specially used artificial intelligence to set human sexual reactions.
Users can also “customize” their robots to meet their preferences, choosing from eye color, breast shape to nail type or color.
But more disturbing is that many robots with “personality” will make “copy-wife” look very advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
RealBotix robots, for example, can be defined according to the characteristics that users think attractive, such as shame.
There is also a Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion, which can pre-set personality features, including a little shy “Cold Farra” and “Wild Vintage” with “Aventure pleasure”.
“Roxxxy Gold robots have as much personality as possible to you,” True Companion website said.
So she loves what you love, and evil what you hate.
She was just like a normal person in those days!
She can be lazy, can talk well, or even “sexual!”
The rise of sexual robots brought a lot of concern — not just replacing real human relations — but also the female characteristics of humble knees and the suggestion of rape drawn on a cool (interpreted as “resistance”) Faara are the most concerned.
True Companion compares Roxxxy to a male vibrating bar on its website.
The website says, “If women have vibrating, why don’t men have Roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not just a loving thing, nor just a sex toy.
Their appearance and growing maturity refers to the darker and deeper part of our culture: escaping from perfect gender equality to submission to sex as an additional option.
Of course, most men will not leave sex robots, and although FRR points out that sex robots are becoming increasingly popular, they are still at the edge of consumer culture.
But what comes through the edge allows us to see the process of this age in which we are.
Many people were not strange or aggressive until the free market gave them the opportunity to become so.
These subtle sex robots appear in a worldwide age of threatening women’s rights, where the White House also has a president whispering sexual violence against women, which is not a coincidence.
The most frightening part of the TV’s story of a woman is not the realistic picture, not the hanging body, not the eyes of the couple being excavated, but the excessively real imagination.
The Kyrgyz Republic was a jump, but now it seems not far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make the technology possible to create the most similar body of real women (although in proportion to porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have human touch and imitate real human movements.
But honestly, their “personality” cannot represent real women.
They cannot separate or leave.
They have no aid agencies, no subsequent stories, no absolute independence, and no absolute illusion of slavery could break.
In other words, they are fun slaves.
Or, according to the common statement of 2017: make women.

Trump’s great achievement?
Mitt Romney becomes a shortcut of common sense.
Political differences have led to a bipolar differentiation of American voters and, from a micro-perspective, have ruined the American family’s harmony, which has already been strange for Trump’s time.
After Christmas and Thanksgiving, major U.S. newspapers were filled with the fears of Trump's elected relatives in their commentary columns.
It is usually thought that we are doing our best to break our “filter bubbles”.
Less commented is Trump’s strength to bring together the family together.
I mentioned this because my sister, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, has long been disagreed with the Republicans in our house, and he is going to visit me this week.
She reminds me that unifying against common enemies can have a powerful effect.
Because of working with Trump at the White House, everyone she knows, including Republican relatives who have been in political disputes for decades, are now suddenly and strangely standing on the same front.
This is of course a good thing if you are at the dining table, but I’m surprised that from a wider perspective this would bring significant risks.
While the left-wing characters have long been chanted by Trump, the chanting effect of him as president has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, what we refer to is the possibility of concern that his strange behavior might one day stop.
However, there is another more worrying long-term scenario where Trump wants to “normalize” relationships with the right-wing Republicans, who had previously opposed Mr. President’s standards, and now suddenly appear to be a symbol of reason.
I’ve recently found myself some of the epidemic strange concerns about Matt Romney’s edition: putting a dog on the car, a 14% income tax (but at least we know his tax declaration), seems to be too small for the crimes of both actions compared to Trump.
After Trump’s time passed, the next Republican candidate only needed reasonably to acquire the qualification for unprecedented improvements.
When my sister lived in the city, we took the kids to the New York Park, which is the largest rotating horse operated by the Central Park Administration of New York, and if you don’t need coffee, this $3 ticket is the most consumable for you in this city.
The voice of the horse was huge like a rainbow, designed for glass fibers on the central column, all clowns and animals turned their heads, terrified and terrified looking at their shoulders, while the music whispered as a sound sounded strange.
Too much ordinary cities are disappointing: the landscape from the high-end buildings becomes old, the horizon becomes too familiar and can no longer provide too much excitement, and the reality of the city does not support dreams.
35 years later, I haven’t completely forgotten that day I found that this “Swiss House” is actually not a Swiss House, but a “Ye Olde Swiss Cottage” located on the theme bar, I don’t remember, but close to a crossroads in northern London.
However, the riding horse in Central Park remains a magical experience and everyone is pleased to play for the events where two 2-year-old children, a 11-year-old boy, and four 40-year-old two girls can attend.
If I could evaluate the rotating wooden horse, I would give it full, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week, at a century company, I was asked to score one to five stars on my transaction "experience" before cleaning the credit card.
In the coffee shops in my street corner, you can also choose to score for a 15% small fee, which is to buy things in the cabinet.
The effect of doing this is not only to slow down the speed of the transactions that should be neutral, but also to put pressure on the server to add personal factors to the unnecessary situation.
The poor woman in this store laughed unfortunately, and I was tired, and the credit card trading experience ran her five stars.

Of these, many provinces have even proposed to actively struggle to the central financial support for their provinces’ de-production.
One evidence is that only eight provinces announced coal-capacity targets stand up to 90 percent of the country’s coal reduction plan.
In an interview with a reporter, Linbur Zong, Director of the Institute of Energy Policy at Xiamen University, said that the "de-production capacity" of the steel and coal industry is far from the central $10 billion alone, far from enough, and more funds need local governments and from the line to solve.
In the recently published coal-production implementation rules in the province of San Suu Kyi, the San Suu Kyi Coal Group has proposed a reorganization of the company’s assets and activities to build a new business model.
The actual lack of funding may be three times more than previously subsidized, Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, Yonguong, said the initial statistics of the coal system of employees to deploy "to production capacity" are 1.3 million, and the steel system is 500,000.

Can the meat, dairy products and chocolate help relieve inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
Chicken and chocolate may sound like a dream of your digestive system.
But a new study shows exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help relieve related symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The unhealing disease affects the life of approximately 1.3 million Americans and approximately 300,000 British people, resulting in stomatitis and diarrhea, frequent or bleeding diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington usually advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers found that key amino acids in protein help promote immune cells growth, which can increase intestinal resistance.
Chief researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explains that immune cells are patroled in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not enter the body quietly.
The cells that cause inflammation keeps the balance between cells and increased tolerance, protecting the body without damaging all kinds of sensitive, vulnerable tissues.
When the balance is too predisposed to inflammation, inflammatory intestinal diseases may occur.
The experiment found a cell that promotes immunity appeared in small mice carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need amino acids (one of the components of the protein) to form the appearance of the cell.
Professor Colonna says: “We have established a link between a bacterial group (Royce-Lactobacteria, which is a normal part of the intestinal microbial group) and a cell group that can promote the development of resistance.”
The more amino acids in their diet, the more their immune cells.
He suggested that if humans use the same method, the combination of a diet rich in amino acids could create a more resistant, less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, post-doctoral researcher, studied an immune cell that could increase resistance when she found a group of research mice had such cells, but another group of the same bacteria were feeding separately.
She suspected that this difference was associated with the bowel microorganisms in small rats (i.e. bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the stomach intestines).
DNA sequencing of small mice’s cholesterol found that six bacterial groups existed in the body of mice with immune cells, but there were no in the body of small mice without immune cells.
White mice feed in an immune environment, so they lack intestinal microorganisms, and this immune cells can not appear, and the presence of Luther-Lactobacteria produce immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultivated laktobacteria in fluids and then transferred small amounts of non-bacterial fluid to immature immune cells separated from small rats.
This immune cell develops into resistant cells.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be proven that the active ingredient is a side-product of the phosphorus metabolism, known as phosphorus-3-laktic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of coloramino acids in small mouse feeds, the number of these cells increased by about 50%, but when coloramino acids levels dropped half, the number of cells dropped half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people, like mice, have the same increased resistance cells, and most of us are present in our gastrointestinal intestines.
It is unknown whether humans were able to trigger cell development, like small rats in the experiment, by-products from Luca-Lactobacteria in the body, but genetic defects associated with fluoracid were found in patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
"The development of these cells may be exactly the result we want to get because these cells can control the inflammatory reactions on the surface of the intestine."
It can be incorrectly stated that the high levels of amino acids present in Lucococcus may lead to an increase in the number of this species.
Jose Mourinho says Manchester United signed a “genial” Nemania Matic
On Wednesday night, after the first appearance in the Santorini match, Mourinho confirmed that Manchester United signed a "genial" middle player.
Matic from Chelsea, signing up to £40 million in gold and played 2-1 in the last pre-season race in Dublin against Real Madrid European Super Cup on Tuesday, winning the favourite of Paul Pogba and Andreas Perella.
However, Matic was seriously insufficient in the pre-season Asia Tour, completing only 45 minutes, and Mourinho acknowledged the need for improvements before the start of the English super season.
“He takes time, but he has experience, wisdom, and a genius way of thinking—he think about football,” Mourinho said.
“We will help him get ready as soon as possible.
Mourinho began to arrange his first front at the beginning of this season. Like Matic, the new-signed players Victor Lindlov and Romelu Lukaku also started the competition at the Ingev Stadium.
The Independent newspaper this week that Mourinho still wants to introduce three more sign-up players, but he insisted that the club is “working great,” he has four first sign-up players in his mind, and the club has already introduced three of them.
“The club introduced three of these players and I am very grateful for the addition.
“I would be happier if the club could introduce all four players, but they have made a lot of effort for me.
Would China be back in the world’s guard vessels if it doesn’t build this type of military vessels?
With recently all the world's marine forces later announced the construction plan of a new type of guard vessels, as if the guard vessels have become the focus of the major forces' marine in one night, first Japan determined the acquisition of two new types of guard vessels in the 2018 defense budget, making Japan's DEX guard vessels finally a substantial breakthrough, then the U.S. Lockheed Martin recently announced the latest program of the U.S. FG guard vessels, then what should China's new guard vessels go from?
With the underwater of one of the latest 054A-guard vessels, marking the 054A-guard vessels have built up to 29 ships, approaching the total of the 053H series, and from the first 054A-guard vessels in 2006 to now, the construction of 054A has been 12 years, even in the world, to build so many high-performance generalguard vessels, except China, only the United States built in the 7th and 80s can be compared.
And the reason why to build so many 054A is also simple, it is affordable, useful, and additionally supplemented by the Navy for years.
The 054A Guard Vessel has been a favourite of the Chinese Navy for many years, with a capacity of approximately 4000 tons of water, equipped with a 76 mm main gun, 32 units Red Flag-16 and Fish-8 anti-submarine missiles, 8 Eagle Attack 83 and a straight-9 helicopter, although it started construction in 2006, it was a very early time of design, but its combat force is not too bad even to today, with the eyes of the world's guard vessels can reach the middle level.
But after all, this is a type of ships designed in the early 21st century, with weapons configuration on the side, its power system and electronic radar equipment already have a large gap compared to today's world's main ships, as the same type of ships in Europe have been equipped with full power advancement, small multifunctional front radars, large-scale helicopter deck, and it is time to develop a new model.
So how China’s new guard vessels should develop, it is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic strategy of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will be entirely the Blue Sea Navy, and the future will also be going to the ocean, equipped with rapid deploying in areas that are closely related to China's cutting interests, showing the existence of forces, when necessary to have a strong fighting force to ensure China's cutting interests in the region are not damaged, so it seems that the new type of Hujiang will develop towards large-scale and remote oceanization.
Looking at the question of the positioning of the new guard vessels in the future Chinese navy sequence, the future Chinese navy should be similar to the U.S. Navy, other major vessels, apart from the necessary near-sea defence vessels, will be required to form a aircraft fighter group or two-biased attack vessels.
While the role of the new type of guard vessels in the future aircraft fighter group should serve as an anti-submarine force and the positioning of the middle-proximate area, and the two-proximate attack vessels should serve as a guard vessels class, so according to such requirements, the new type of guard vessels must have strong anti-submarine capacity and good medium-proximate aircraft capacity.
Based on the above positioning, you can boldly imagine the potential look of the future national guard vessels.
First of all, the discharge volume will be significantly increased compared to the current type 054A guard vessel, estimating the discharge volume of the new guard vessel will reach approximately 5,000-6000 tons; the power system will be adopted with a QC280 improved combustion wheel and two diesel engines, the maximum speed is expected to reach approximately 30 degrees, the continuity will be significantly increased; when weapons configuration 76 mm main rifles and 1130 close rifles should be preserved, but there will be added a red flag 10 launch system, behind the main rifles should be a 32-48 unit red flag 16 improved and fish-8 co-bounding system, on the back of the ship should be installed a 8-16 unit large vertical system for launching Coral 18 and new cruise missiles; the station and the station platform will also increase, to reach two 10-tone level helicles standing and storage; up to the electronic radar system, it should be equipped with a small fixed with the transformation of the low-functional transformation of the
As a result, the overall level of the new guard vessels will reach the world’s top level at present, even less than the U.S. FFG.
Of course, the above concept is just your guess about the new type of national guard vessels, and specifically how we can only wait until the new type of guard vessels can be discovered, let’s wait together.

China's household debt rate closer to the United States is more terrible than not buying a house?
Recently, everyone is discussing what changes in real estate policy recently, is the real estate policy to relieve?The diversification of land supply subjects, will the real estate prices come down?
But when we are worried about real estate prices, worried about macroeconomic regulation, worried about future movements in real estate markets, People's Daily once again wrote, the last time we discussed specifically the settlement of real estate regulation, and now what People's Daily writes is a more serious issue than not buying a house, that is, even if you buy a house, you still get a debt?
Today, we’ll talk about a more serious issue than buying a house: refund.
China's growing debt crisis
The People's Daily Foreign Edition published a commentary on the article "Premium and Loan..Fighting Youth's Joy and Worries", according to the data in the article, in November 2017, the report of the National Finance and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Society, the National Asset Report Research Center stated that the residential sector's leverage rate continues to rise, rising from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, rising 1.3 percent points, rising 3.8 percent points in the three quarter of 2017.
The residential sector’s debt proportion in the entire entity economy has increased and the leverage rate has increased faster.
Related studies show that Chinese household debt to financial institutions is mainly consumer loans, which account for about 2/3 of residents’ debt, approximately twice as operational loans.
Of these, in consumer loans, medium-term loans based on housing loans account for about 80 percent, but in terms of growth, short-term consumer loans grow faster and higher than medium-term loans.
In addition, China’s household debt rate just stated the total amount of loans received by the household sector from financial institutions, while there are many private loans, including borrowing money from relatives and friends, and large-scale hidden debts.
Looking at such data, it’s a bit unpleasant, according to the statistics of the Sunny Financial Institute, China’s population leverage rate was only 3% in 1996 and only 18% in 2008, but since 2008 the population leverage rate began to show rapid growth, doubling in just six years, reaching 36.4% in the third quarter of 2017.
Again, compared to another data, in May last year, the FedEx issued a survey report of tens of thousands of respondents across nine countries.
The report is visited for young people from nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
According to the report, 80 and 90 young people in China have 70%, Mexico is far the second leading (46%), and twice the level of the United States (35%).
These data tell us a very likely problem that is that, compared to the ability to buy a house, the largest potential “gray beef” estimates in Chinese residents at the present stage will not be borrowed.
Why is the debt crisis the biggest problem?
As we had previously analyzed, although we have always been talking about the highest prices in China, but compared to other countries in the world, the house ownership rate in China is actually quite high, so with the saying that the high price of the house can not buy a house, fear now ask a lot of friends the question is whether you still get a loan?
We look at the world’s real estate markets and China’s real estate markets have not had a big real estate crisis, except that we mentioned above in Hainan, but just a decade ago the origins of the global financial tsunami in 2008 was the US real estate crisis.
The cause of the U.S. real estate crisis was due to two rooms: the House of Representatives and the House of Representatives.
At that time, in the Golden Age of the United States, real estate companies sold the house with very low first pay to the US low-income population in order to expand sales, and the real estate market was also a pleasant pride when the US economy was good, but the good prospects were not long, with the stagnation of growth in the U.S. economy, which caused the buyers' income decrease, and therefore a large number of household consumption spending began to decline.
But when the current state of the United States was a component of the American family assets financial assets and real estate assets, almost all household assets in the low-income group of the United States were all real estate, and most of the first 20% of the high-income groups were financial assets, the higher the debt rate of households in the United States was the poorest.
A serious fact is that these people are all buying houses in better economies, so paying the loan is also calculated by their better income, and when the income decreased, the pressure on the loans not only did not decrease even because some subsidiary loan plans became floating, so that the real estate issues of these American households under the headquarters gradually evolved into the real estate crisis.
Therefore, some people could not pay the real estate due to the low income, so the banks began to recover the property, and when the banks took the property from the hands of the buyer who had borrowed the loan, they sold it at a very low price, which led to the area’s real estate prices a step-by-step down, and this process again triggered the real estate prices further decreasing, forming a malicious cycle, when the real estate prices dropped to a certain degree, more and more buyers find their homes worth even lower than their loan, so there are more people who stop to continue to pay the loan, and cause more bad accounts.
Therefore, a huge cycle of evil forms on this:
“Economic disruption – revenue decreases – some people still don’t pay loans – banks sell the debtors’ house in low prices – housing prices fall – more people stop paying the loan – banks sell again – housing prices fall again.”
And the problem is more than that, because the price of the property is continuously falling, people stop borrowing the house to the bank after not you have no debt, if the bank’s auction house has received the money you have not already borrowed to the bank, then you still need to return the money, simply assume that you paid 600,000, the loan 2.4 million bought a set of house worth 3 million at that time, when the property price fell to that house worth only 2 million, you no longer borrow the house to the bank, after the auction house, you not only lost your first payment 600,000, but also the bank’s 400,000 debt, you also need to return the money.
So, just under such a wicked cycle, the U.S. economy gradually collapsed and eventually triggered the US financial crisis in 2008.
So, at the present stage, China’s household debt rate reaches a high level of 46.8%, is a very careful issue, which is currently still below the level of developed countries, but the problem has begun to appear, the country has repeatedly emphasized the issue of lifting up since last year, which is a very obvious judgment that if the household debt rate continues to rise, it will lead to huge risks, so to strictly prevent the emergence of financial risks.
So after the house was used to dwell and not to be used to burn, the country was faster to establish multiple measures such as multi-entry supply, multi-channel security, rental and rental, to further eliminate potential risks.
For our individual families, it is necessary to give up the real estate speculation thinking, to act on the basis of the time of buying a house, to avoid falling into huge burden of our families, and only reasonable assessment of the level of income and debt is a healthy way to develop family wealth.

British inventor implants chips in his own body and put his hands into a car.
A British inventor installed a chip for himself, and he could open his home’s front door, enter the office and even start the car, becoming the first person in the country.
The 33-year-old Stephen Northem implanted a small piece of chip in his fingers and fingertips and is now providing this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, which is implemented by his company BioTeq through technology.
He has worked with Dr. Jeff Watson, senior advisor of the Hampshire Royal Hampshire Hospital to ensure that the implantation process meets medical standards.
The technique is similar to the implantation of a cat-dog chip, and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company will also replace the locks of each room and vehicle to be compatible with the chip, which costs £300 per lock.
The married father with a child has now installed the technology for his home and his BMW Z4, and he can start the car just putting his hand on the direction.
Speaking of the Central Financial Work Meeting, the content of the meeting focuses both on national development and affecting individual lives.
On July 10, the National Bureau of Statistics published the National Resident Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Industrial Manufacturers' Factory Price Index (PPI) in June 2016.
The White House’s tools cost thousands.
According to military records published in the Times Magazine, the White House decided last month to ship a Navy Navy Helicopter to the southern grass to demonstrate the enormous glory of the U.S. manufacturing industry, costing up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as the Navy Force No. 1) is an important exhibition on the White House's construction activities on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials have visited manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibition includes a helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, a yacht in Maine, a fire car in Wisconsin and a mississippi crash.
According to the records of the First Flight of the Navy Air Force Helicopter (HMX-1), the White House Military Office requires the helicopter to be present on a daily order (FRAGO), just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in South Range to participate in this “special” activity.
A day before the event, the commander of the HMX-1 said in an email sent to the Senior Navy Flight Commander, “I just want to confirm you know, because this event is highly appreciated.
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive at Southern Grass at about 7 p.m. on July 17 to participate in the event at 3 p.m., only after the grass was cleaned from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on the same day.
The report also indicates that if the time of departure from the White House is delayed, the return will require a second group of crew members due to the limitation of working hours.
The original crew was executed at the side of the helicopter during the operation, while the security forces were executed nearby when the plane was on the ground.
The records obtained by Time Magazine are unclear whether the second group of crew was ultimately needed.
The Hachic Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record notes that HMX-1 had asked if the event violated the law.
The commander wrote: “One question we asked was whether it was violated the Hachic Law and was told that it was not violated.
“It sounds like you are locked,” replied the Vice Commander.
The White House defined the “American Manufacturing” activity as an official activity, so it is not subject to the Hachic Act.
But even official activities have political colors.
During the event, the President promoted the theme of the Senate at the time: health reform, and strongly dedicated to control of government regulations.
It is no new thing to use the Navy Air Force 1 or Air Force 1 for political propaganda purposes.
The former president was asked to travel on these planes.
However, it is not common to use it for photographic purposes.
Trump was concerned in February when he was in Melbourne, Florida, where the president’s chart slides slowly and eventually stopped the background of his first election meeting, while his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the use of the former president’s chart.
White House’s deputy press spokesman Linsey Waltes said “The White House is so excited about the next ‘American Made’ exhibition, which exhibits products from all 50 states, all manufactured by American workers using American materials.
The HMX-1 crew regularly trained flight trains near Washington area and southern rails, exercising precision placing the U.S. president in the White House.
During Trump’s G-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 had 58 landing exercises in the White House.
One official said the U.S. manufacturing activity flight was included in the crew training requirements this month.
The helicopter forces also flighted 11 hours of “non-presidential support missions” on the same day.
The White House said taxpayers did not pay the cost of any other tool in the event.
Sikorsky's spokesman said the company did not participate in the arrangement of the South Park helicopter exhibition.
HMX-1 has no budget record for the president flight, so it is very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defense’s annual fiscal year 2017, the VH-3D’s Defense Department can repay a fee of $24,380 per flight hour.
Forces records recorded the aircraft's base flight from the Virginia Navy Navy's base for 30 minutes.
The White House said the operation of the helicopter costs much lower than the cost.
Waltes said “It is very misleading to estimate the expenses made by taxpayers on the basis of reimbursable costs.”
These estimates include personnel expenses, maintenance fees, and many more, including immersion costs in annual funds.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the Defence Department’s reimbursement costs do not include personnel expenses, but actually include oil expenses, maintenance expenses, and contract expenses.
Former White House spokesman Sean Spike used the helicopter to defend the event.
“The idea is to show what America has made this week.
And I know that both Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are proud of that, they have contributed to our national security, and I guess the work of thousands and hundreds of people should depend on it.
And I feel like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of countless Americans have made hard work.
So it is, of course, not in the wrong time.
We are not sure if Trump interacted with the helicopter while visiting South Range during the event, but he was actually sitting on the fire car’s seat.
In the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky's representatives to joke with the media on his own aircraft.
He said, “I know the Sikorsky aircraft very well.

According to Market Star, from 2005 to 2011, my province’s GDP increased from the middle line to the second place.
However, the economic growth of the province remains difficulty, such as low investment efficiency, lack of core competitiveness in the industrial economy. For this reason, the latest version of the Economic Information Centre, “Economic Blue Page” suggests improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
Based on some representative indicators of our province’s economy in 2005 and 2011, they are compared to national and central regions.
In the industrial economic benefit, in 2011, the province occupied a significant proportion of industrial energy, raw materials, such as high-energy industries, was affected by market fluctuations and overcapacity "double pressure", while domestic, automotive and other leading industry innovation is insufficient, resulting in low profits.
And a large amount of investments do not bring the corresponding economic benefits, which is an important reason for low quality and efficiency of our province’s economic growth.
In this regard, experts recommend that effective measures to encourage enterprise innovation, and the technological achievements of high schools and research institutes should be “transfered” to enterprises in time.
For industrial economic efficiency, experts say that it should also actively promote the reorganization of the industry, optimize the industrial layout and expand the industrial chain.

British General Trade Union (GMB) focuses on investments in McVitie’s Glasgow Factory
The trade union wants the management of the cookie maker MaVita company to ensure a long-term commitment to production in the Las Vegas factory.
The British Union General Scotland division said the company has remained silent about the future of investments in the Tolcross plant.
The factory has more than 500 employees and manufactures products such as Hobnobs, Rich tea.
Pladis, owner of McVita, said the company has invested more than £5 million in the factory in the past few years.
He added that if the operation of the factory changes, employees and trade union representatives "will know first."
In a letter to the head of the company, the British General Union Scotland Division calls on McVite to “solve the problem of the funds not transferred to the modernization of production lines.”
Drew Duffy, headquarters of the British Union, said: “We can’t understand clearly from the factory manager of the future business needs and investment plans of Tolcross, which makes our members deeply concern.
Generation after generation of families work here, and the local communities and the large Glasgow region are highly concentrated, which are an important pillars of decent employment in areas with high unemployment and serious social deprivation.

Two months ago, we had a regular meeting at Tolcross with employees and representatives of the UK’s general trade union to discuss some issues openly.
We discussed with our employees and then, like all other companies operating in a competitive and economically unclear environment, we reviewed the continuous operating models we applied to enterprises and factories to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in terms of production lines and operations improvements.”
We are fully aware of the historical status of Tolcross as a production base, as any changes in our operating operations at the factory, and employees and trade union representatives will be the first to know.
On May 11th, the Vice-Director of the Tibetan Autonomous Region Sports Office, Nymara Yin, said in the Jeumran-Ma-People’s headquarters that the future waste cleaning of life in Jeumran-People’s headquarters will go from past public interest actions to normalization conducted by the Chinese government and international participation.
On May 10, environmental volunteers have placed classified waste into trucks.
For a decade, with a sharp increase in mountains explorer and tourists, the environmental issues in the mountains where the mountains are located are increasingly evident.
In the spring of 1997, the Tibetan Autonomous Region Mountains Association launched its first cleaning activity in Peuple North to clean a lot of life waste, such as oxygen bottles left in the 1970s. The video was also played at the Tokyo World Climate Conference of that year, which attracted the attention of the world.
After 1997, the public interest team continued to clean up Peuples, but most of the participants were non-professional.
Paris Saint-Germain warned Barcelona to sign Neymar three years ago.
Westfalia may regret to throw olive branches against Marco Vilarati
After submitting a £1.89 billion offer attempting to enforce the exemption terms, Paris Saint-Germain won’t give up signing into Neymar, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago to launch an attack on this world record attacker?
This remarkable approach has already opened the summer transfer window, and the FA Cup is prepared to break the world transfer record at twice the price of the previous transfer record. Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season for up to £89 million.
Once the transfer is completed, Neymar will jump into the world’s highest-priced player and the world’s highest-paid professional athlete – Paris Saint-Germain offers more than £500,000 per week after taxes.
Barcelona was angry about how Neymar attacked as well as the way he went out, and sources from the Board of Directors of Catalonia insisted that the club had made his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the Paris Saint-German President have made such predictions about the football world three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed his interest in signing Blaise Mataddy in 2014, Nasil Alhelefi had been a strict warning to any club who wanted to sign the Paris Saint-German best player.
“I’m not worried, because they know if they contact any of our players we’re going to match their goals and we’ll also contact their players,” he said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign our players, they will also eat their own bad fruits.
Earlier this summer, the Spanish club seemed to have crossed the line, and Barcelona throwed olive branches to Paris Saint-Germain Marco Vilarati.
Paris Saint-Germain has clearly said they will not let the Italian foot leave anyway, and Barcelona is likely to be twice affected by the loss of the middle-class genius Neymar.

The British Sports Council announced the next month’s goal to participate in the Winter Olympics next month: win at least five medals, which is the “most magnificent” goal of the British delegation to participate in the Winter Olympics.
The British Sports Council is responsible for funding for various Olympic projects and, of course, also responsible for achieving goals for each project.
It is estimated that British athletes have projects hoping to shock medals from single-board skiing, ice boxes, stainless steel snowboards and short-way skiing.
During the last Winter Olympic cycle, the British Sports Council allocated a total of £32 million for the Winter Olympic project, which is twice as much as the Winter Olympic cycle.
Most of the money comes from national lottery, the rest comes from national finance.
The hopes for the UK's winning are mainly based on two people, one was last year's World Short Route Speed Championship Three Gold Winner Alice Christie, and the other was the last female steel snowball champion Lisa Arnold.
In the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, the British delegation achieved 1 gold 1 silver 2 copper, the best achievement they have achieved since the first Winter Olympics in 1924.
Wales AM worried about “like a fool.”
Some have suggested that AM should change the title to MWP (Welsh Parliament), which shocked many AMs.
This is why it was proposed because it was planned to change the name of the parliament to "Wales's parliament".
Political community is concerned that it would be ridiculous.
A Labour Party AM said the Labour Party member was worried about “this name is twp and Pwp.”
(Non-Welsh readers must know: in the Welsh, twp means “fool” and pwp means “fool.”
A nationalist AM said the entire nationalist members were "insatisfied" and suggested replacing them with other names.
A Welsh Conservative said the Conservative was “open to the name change,” but noted that it was easy to send MWP to Muppet’s voice in speech.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission is currently drawing a law on name change, saying: “It’s their own matter about the members of the committee ultimately decide to choose what name they will use.
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 states that the parliament will have the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals of these names, which generally supports the use of the name "Wales Parliament".
With regard to AM’s title issues, the committee favors the WMP (Welsh Parliamentary Members), but in public consultation, the highest support rate was MWP.
Obviously, AM suggests to adopt other names, but meeting chairman Elin Jones felt headaches that late discourse was due to submitting a draft legislation to change the name within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the way Parliament works, including the rules of abolition of AM qualifications and the design of the committee system.
AM will vote on the final name during legislative debate.
Macedonian referendum on changing name
Electors will vote on Sunday to vote whether to change the name of the country to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
Direct vote was to resolve the problem of decades of disputes between Macedonia and its neighbor Greece, with a province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighborhood means Greece has legitimate rights to its territory and repeatedly refused Macedonia to join the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Macedonian President Georgie Ivanov was opposed to the referendum that he said he would not participate in the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is only an inevitable cost paid by joining the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Churches in Harlem district, and St. Martin's clock falls in silence.
“The old people with whom I’ve talked in history have said that there would be a bar and a church in every corner,” Adam said.
“There are no bars, no church here.
He says the disappearance of the bar is logical.
“Today people begin to participate in society in different ways,” Adams said.
“The bar is no longer a neighborhood living room that people visit regularly.
As for the church, he fears that the funds for the sale of assets won’t support as long as the leaders expected, “the funds will soon go back to zero.”
He added that the church will be replaced by apartment buildings, whereas people living in the apartment will not help maintain the remaining shelter in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “thus, this will also accelerate the complete closure of the church, as most of those who move into these apartments are less likely to become members of the church.”
Both churches were built a decade after St. Martin's church, before Harlem became a black city (the capital district in 1870).
The first White Parliament Assembly was moved in the 1930s.
A black congregation in the nearby worship gained the property of the building.
Under the leadership of Pastor John Howard Johnson, the Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black crowd, and Pastor Johnson led a movement against 125 Street (125 Street) retailers, and 125 Street was a major shopping street in Harlem, but refused to hire or raise black people.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but because of Pope Johnson's plans to reconstruction the church, they were assigned to manufacture the clock.
The son of Pope Johnson, the heir of the Church of St. Martin, the pastor David Johnson proudly called the clock as the "clock of the poor."
Professionals who played the clock in July called it “the cultural gems” and “the irreplaceable historical instruments”.
Tiffany Ng, a professional at the University of Michigan, also notes that it is the world’s first piano played by a black musician named Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the River Church 18 years ago to play a larger piano.
Merriweather said the Church of St. Martin did not find anyone to replace him.
What has happened in the Church of St. Martin in the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors, some of which architects and contractors were brought by the church's secular leaders, while others were brought by the bishop district.
The district’s administrative authorities (the district’s committee, composed of secular leaders) wrote to the district in July, expressing concerns that “the district is trying to transfer capital to the district’s committee,” although members of the district will not participate in hiring architects and contractors who have been sent to the district.
Some church residents complained of lack of transparency in the activities of the church.
California, a 13-year-old boy injured by a sharp bite while fishing dragons in a swimming pool
Officials said Saturday, on the day of California Dragon Fishing season opening, a 13-year-old boy was bite by a sharp attack while swimming in a dragon fishing season.
The attack occurred at 7 p.m. in the morning near the Ensinitas Beacon beach.
Chad Hammel said in an interview with KSWB TV in San Diego that he was swimming with his friends on Saturday morning, and about half an hour later he heard a boy calling out to pull him out of the surface of the water.
Hammer said he began to think the boys were too excited to catch the dragon, but later he “conscioused the boys were screaming, ‘I was bite!
I was bitted!”
His entire cracks were broken,” Hammer said he noticed when he came to the boy.
“I called everyone to pull him out of the water: ‘There are sharks in the water!’
The boy is airly transported to the Rady Children's Hospital, which is currently in a serious situation.
The type of sharks in the attack is not yet clear.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was found a few weeks ago in the area, but it was certain that it would not pose a danger to human beings.
Jules added that the upper half of the victim was injured.
For investigation and security reasons, Casablad's Ponto Beach has officially closed to Swami Beach in Ensinitas for 48 hours.
Jars said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them are not dangerous to human beings.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British Beauty Market
Sainsbury’s will open a beauty corner with professional assistants, using Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
With a large number of retail companies enter into the UK’s £2.8 billion beauty market, and during the decline of fashion and household goods sales, the market continues to grow and will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and if the test is successful, it will be expanded to more stores next year.
Because supermarkets’ TVs, microwave furnaces and household goods shelves were once charged, the supermarket decided to invest in beauty products to use these shelves space.
Sainsbury’s company said it would double the scale of beauty products to launch more than 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Twezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L’oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have greater space with a brand-like area of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also re-released its own range of elegant cosmetics to make most of its products pure vegetable products – which is where more and more young buyers demand.
Furthermore, perfume retailers Fragrance Shop will conduct specialized trials in two stores in Sunsbury. The first was opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second will open at Selly Oak, Birmingham at the end of this year.
The current main trend is online shopping, as well as buying a small amount of food every day in local facilities, which means that supermarkets need to take more steps to attract people to visit.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive Officer, said that the chain of supermarkets will offer more services and non-food to counter discounts Aldi and Lidl, which will become more like stores.
Since the acquisition of the two chains two years ago, the Seinsbury Company has opened Argos stores in hundreds of stores and introduced some Habitat. The company said the acquisition boosted food sales and brought profits.
The supermarket has previously tried to transform beauty and pharmacies, but ended in failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Seinsbury tried to operate a joint venture with Booth, but the cooperation announcement ended after a dispute about how to divide revenue from Booth’s supermarket pharmacies.
Three years ago, Sainsbury introduced a new strategy to sell 281 pharmacies operations to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain Celesio for £1.25 billion.
The company said Loyds Pharmacy will add a range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores, and therefore play an important role in the program.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Seinsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of the beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in the introduction of special-trained colleagues who will provide advice on the site.
Our range of brands are designed to meet every need, the attractive environment and convenient geographic location means we are now an attractive beauty destination that will become a big challenge for traditional shopping.
After Holly Willoughby withdrawals from a £11 million deal, Peter Jones is "greatly angry"
Holly Willoughby, host TV show, withdrawals from £11 million lifetime brand business deals to focus on a new contract signing with Marks and Spencer and ITV, making "Dragons Den" star Peter Jones "great"
Willowby has no time to invest in their home clothing and decoration brand Truly.
This partner’s business is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of this Morning show has announced his decision to resign on Instagram.
In the last minute, Holly Willowby returned from the profitable lifestyle brand business and turned to the rich new contracts signed with Marks&Spencer and ITV, which shocked the Dragon Hole star Peter Jones.
Sources said TV Goldman Sachs admitted at a tensioned meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of the Marlo Commercial Empire in Buckingham County that she recently reached a transaction worth up to £1.5 million, and Jones was "grosely angry" after hearing the news, because it means she would not invest enough time in their collaborative home costume brand Truly.
The business is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand, which was expected to double the assets of Woolby’s estimated £11 million.
When the 37-year-old Willowby announced he would leave Truly on Instagram, Jones was on a plane from Britain on the way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was Holly’s first task at that time.
This will be her long-term future plan for the next decades.
The decision of her withdrawal shocked all the participants.
No one believes what happened on Tuesday, because the eye looks on the market.
A whole warehouse is waiting for sale in Malo headquarters.
Experts believe the departure of the UK’s most profitable holders of This Morning could lead to millions of dollars in losses to the company because the company has invested massive investments in products such as pillows, candles, clothing and household appliances and could further delay the market.
This may mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Now, the mother of three children, Willowby and his husband Dan Baldwin and Jones and his wife Tara Capp have been good friends for ten years.
Willowby and Capp founded the Truly brand in 2016, 52 years old Jones joined as director in March.
The couple have always been on vacation together, and Jones owns 40 percent of their share in a TV production company in Polvin.
Willowby will be a brand spokesman for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I’m a Celebrity for ITV.
A source who was closely in contact with Jones said last night: “We don’t comment on his business aspects.
After a long conversation, “We’re in love.”
He jokedly said critical speech to the press media. Some think it was “missing the president’s identity” and overrated the North Korean leaders.
Why does President Trump sacrifice so much?
Trump imitates the voice of the "press release".
“I didn’t sacrifice anything.
He noted that the first meeting of the two countries was held in Singapore in June, and Trump praised the move as an important step in achieving North Korea’s non-nuclearization, and now Kim Jong-un intends to hold a meeting again.
However, non-nuclear negotiations are in a stagnation.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korea's high diplomat Li Huang gave a speech to world leaders at the UN meeting on Saturday, saying North Korea has not seen the U.S. response to North Korea's early disarmament.
He said the United States continues to press and impose sanctions.
Trump expressed optimism in his meeting speech.
He said, “We are very good with North Korea.
“If we were fighting with North Korea,
Per millions of people have died.
Now that relationship is good.
He said the work on improving relations with Kim Jong-un has achieved positive results, the missile test ended, the hostages were successfully rescued, and the remains of the US soldiers were rooted.
In addition, when he talked about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, he argues for his special approach,
“It’s easy to be a president, but with it putting more than ten thousand people outside into this crowded place, we would prefer to let more than 200 people here stand here,” Trump said directly in front of the crowd.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroyed an island, killed hundreds of people
After the earthquake, foreign NGOs and NGOs were told that they didn’t need their help.
Although more than 10% of the population is displaced, the government has not announced a national catastrophe, and the national catastrophe is a prerequisite for the initiation of international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they are clearly not asking for international aid, so this would be a huge challenge for them,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Save the Children organized a group to Bali, but it is not yet possible to determine whether foreign workers can get to work on the site.
Sumopo, a spokesman of the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Bali to determine whether international agencies need to participate in the rescue work.
It is clear that Indonesia may continue to face earthquakes and to face nature’s wrath, Indonesia is still not fully prepared.
Although Azzi has already built a tsunami shelter, other coastal lines have not followed it.
Although the tsunami warning has already entered into force, Balous is obviously lacking a tsunami warning, which may be the culpable of making people injured.
Even in the most favorable circumstances, traveling among the many islands in Indonesia is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics harder.
A medical ship that originally stopped on the Dragon Island to rescue earthquake victims is going to Peru, but it takes at least three days to reach the new rescue site.
President Joko Widodo will improve Indonesian outdated infrastructure as the core of his campaign, and to repair roads and railways without spending a lot of money.
However, due to reelections next year, the financial shortage has continued to bother Zoko’s government.
Zoko is also faced with pressure from Indonesian unleashable tribal tensions, and the beliefs of most Muslim members are more conservative.
Christian and Muslim gangs using knives, arrows and other smaller weapons fighting on the streets have caused more than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands have been displaced.
Watch: Liverpool team Daniel Sturridge will score more than in the match against Chelsea
On Saturday, at London’s Stanford Bridge Stadium, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool’s position to lose Chelsea in the Super League.

“I saw Cant come here, touched the ball and shoot the door without thinking too much.
After the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard, Chelsea was temporarily in front of the middle by 1-0.
During that game, the Blue Army frontman handed the ball to Mateo Kovacic with his feet and then dropped the defensive half of the Liverpool entering in the middle field.
Kowasic played a quick cross-country match in the middle.
Then, with a beautiful live stream, Azar brought to the prohibition zone.
Azar surpassed the defence, and the left foot shot through Liverpool's Alisson Becker, shot into the remote gate column.
On Wednesday at 3 p.m., the Liverpool team will be held at Stadio San Paolo in Napoli, Italy, to meet the opponent Napoli in the Champions League group.
The Chelsea team will meet with the Vidiotons at the UEFA Europa Leaguge in London on Thursday at 3 p.m.

Parliament's Clenwell Statue Becomes a Memorial to Last Suffered By 'Rewrite History'
Clenwell’s fanatic cleansing followers have done the Taliban-like destruction of British cultural and religious objects, expulsing the punishment that they deserve.
But Clenwell has called Crick’s proposal “extremely stupid” and “take to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cologne Society, said: “In the current debate about removing the statue, the statue of Oliver Cromwell located outside the Westminster Palace is undoubtedly a target of attack.
The destruction of the British Civil War idolism movement was neither committed by Clenwell nor initiated by Clenwell.
Per the biggest mistake of Clenwell was to be the sacrifice of his first Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s high praise for Clenwill has well demonstrated the 19th-century claims and is also a part of Clenwill’s history that many believe it is still worth celebrating.
Kim Smith told Sunday Times, “Clenwill is considered by many as a defendant of Congress’s resistance to external pressure (that is, monarchy in his opinion), and it is probably less than the late 19th century.”
Whether this statement is completely accurate has always been a subject of historical debate.
But it can be certain that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century affected the later development of our country, and Clenwell was a recognized figure for representation of the division.
His accomplishments as a guardian of the country are also worth celebrating and commemorating.
“Killing pigs” bite Chinese farmers to death
On a market in southwest China, a farmer was killed by a pig.
According to the Southern Morning newspaper on Saturday, near a swine circle of a six plates market in Guangzhou, a young man named Yu was found dead and the arteries were cut and filled with blood.
On May 30, 2005, a pork farm in Xinjiang, China's province of Xinjiang was preparing for vaccination for pigs.
The pig farm and his brother went to the local markets on Wednesday from neighboring Yuan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin discovered the pigman had been dead and the door was opened near the pighouse.
He introduced that there was a larger heads-type pig in the pork, whose mouth was full of blood.
It isly confirmed by lawmakers that the only 550 pounds of fertilizer pig killed the farmer.
“The blood of my brother’s legs is obscure and unbearable,” Mr. Wang said.
Surveillance videos showed that a young man entered the market for feeding pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning.
His body was found about an hour later.
But the pigs that died were not belonging to the man of the name of Joseph, nor to his brother.
Market administrators revealed to Night News that the pig was locked in order to prevent it from attacking others again, while police were collecting evidence on site.
A young man’s family and market authorities are discussing his death compensation.
Although less rare, there have been previously attacks of pigs against humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in a farm in Massachusetts, causing two serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound fertilizer pig pressed a Welsh farmer on a tractor until his wife came to scare the cattle.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon was swallowed by his pigs, and a farmer in Lake Manitoba told the Canadian Broadcasting Company News Network (CBC News) that pigs are usually not aggressive, but blood smells can play the role of a “drive.”
“They just like to play joke.
They are like children, full of curiosity... they don’t want to hurt you.
You just need to give them adequate respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rose will continue to bring massive rain in the southwest of U.S.
Hurricane "Rosa" continues to move towards the northern coast of Mexico, as predicted, winds weakened after arriving in this cool waters.
But in the next few days, Rosa is expected to bring large rains and flashes to northern Mexico and southwest America.
Sunday Eastern Time at 5 p.m., the center of Rosa is 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, with a wind speed of 85 miles/h, belonging to level 1 hurricane.
“Rosa” is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific starts to form a low-valley, moving east toward the US west coast, "The Rossa" will form a tropical storm on Monday, near the lower California peninsula, where deep tropical moist gas will invade the north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, the interaction of tropical moisture with the upcoming wave valley will cause massive rainfall in the southwest region in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause abundant flooding, stone flow, and even mountain slopes in the desert.
The impact of deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall to reach a height of 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to reach 2 to 4 inches in southwest regions, especially in most areas of Arizona.
Because tropical rain is decentralized and accompanied by rapid deterioration of conditions, there may be abundant flooding.
Due to the threat of tropical rainfall, desert adventure activities will be very dangerous.
Large rain can cause the canyon to form a sharp river, and storms will bring local winds and dust.
The upcoming Bug Valley will bring local rain to parts of Southern California coast.
The total rainfall may be more than half inches, which may lead to a slight steel flow and road sliding.
This will be the first rainfall in the region since the rain season.
On Sunday evening and Monday morning, Arizona will receive decentralized tropical rainfall, after which the range of rainfall will be expanded on Monday evening and Tuesday.
The great rain will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Because the Arctic is cold, while the tropical regions remain quite warm, temperatures across the United States will experience drastic fluctuations in October.
This sometimes leads to drastic changes in the temperature within a short distance.
In the middle of the United States, there will be a huge heat displacement on Sunday.
The temperature gap between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, as well as St. Louis and Demein in Iowa will reach approximately 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the warmth will be returned again, and the range will be expanded.
Most areas of the Central and East of the United States are expected to begin with hot heat in October, ranging from the southern level to the northeastern regions, with a large range of temperatures to reach 80 degrees Celsius (about 27 degrees Celsius).
New York City’s temperatures on Tuesday may also reach 80 degrees Celsius (about 27 degrees Celsius), which will be about 10 degrees Celsius higher than the average.
Long-term climate forecasts show that temperatures in eastern U.S. were higher than average by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s audition
On Thursday, the hearing of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh with Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accused of having sexually abused herself in the 1980s, will be broadcasted on six TV networks, with more than 20 million viewers.
Meanwhile, the political stagnation continues, and the broadcasters disturbed the regular program of the last turn on Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake promised to ask the FBI to investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Justice Board that he was 100% sure Cavan was touching his body after he was drunk at a high school party and wanted to get rid of her clothes.
Cavano responded generosely and enthusiastically saying he was 100% sure that this has not happened.
Nielsen last Friday that more than 20.4 million people could watch the hearing.
The company is calculating the average view rate for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channels and MSNBC.
Other surveillance data from networks that simultaneously broadcast the hearing had not been obtained, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen has a lot of problems with watching the number of programs in the statistical office.
Objectively, this figure is similar to the audience size of a post-season football match or an Oscar prize.
Nilson said Fox News channel watched up to 569.000 views throughout the day of the hearing, pressing other online media. The founder of the Fox News channel was a strong supporter of the appointment of Cavano.
After ABC’s location, the viewers reached 32.6 million.
According to Nielsen, CBS is 3.3 million viewers, NBC is 294 million, MSNBC is 289 million and CNN is 252 million.
After the hearing, the attention is still low.
Freak became the key person of Friday’s show.
Earlier, the modest Republican, in a statement at the office, said he would vote for Cavano. On Friday morning, when he climbed the elevator to the court court hearing, he was shot by CNN and CBS cameras and protesters scream against him.
CNN's live broadcast saw he stood in silence for a few minutes while he was condemned.
One woman said, “I’m in front of you.
“Do you think what he says to the people is the truth?”
“You are holding great power, but so many women are unable to do so.
Before the lift was closed, Fleck said his office had issued a statement that he would make more speeches at the committee hearing.
If cable TV and broadcasting networks are continuously broadcasting, the Judicial Committee will vote for Cavanos nomination and send to the Senate for a full vote.
But Freck said he will vote only if the FBI will conduct further investigations on allegations of sexual abuse next week, and a minority of Democrats is also urging further investigations on him.
After a conversation with a friend Democratic Senator Chris Coons, Flake was confident to some extent.
After a conversation with Cohen and several senators, Frank made a decision.
Freck’s choice was great, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not vote for Cavanos without investigation.
Trump has issued an order to the Federal Investigation Agency to investigate the judge Cavano.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses Brexit critics of "playing political games"
British Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with Sunday Times, accused critics of her Brexit plan of "playing political games" on the future of Britain and damaging national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the newspaper, former British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson was strongly criticized his so-called Brexit scheme and said that the proposal that the UK and the EU should impose tariffs on each other is "really absurd."

Police have arrested a 20-year-old basketball player Wayde Sims, who was killed by Louisiana State University.
Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was imprisoned for second-degree murder.
Police released a video of Sims fighting with two Simpson, and police said Sims lost their glasses during the fight.

East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday that the death was originally due to a shooting injury to the head.
The police thanked the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the University of Southern Police, and the local citizens.
Joe Alleva, sports director of the Louisiana State University, expressed thanks to the regional law enforcement departments and praised the department "working hard and fairly".
Sims is 20 years old.
Sims, 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 feet), was a pioneer, grew up in Baku, and his father Wayne was also a member of the Louisiana State University basketball team.
Last season he earned 5.6 points and 2.6 basketballs.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball team chief coach Will Wade said the team's death was "not sad and unacceptable" to Wayde.
Wade said, “This is the end we don’t want to see.
Mexico City Volcano Eruption
The Popocate-Pete volcano exploded and the eruption of ash spread into the neighborhoods of the southern Mexico capital.
Mexico’s National Disaster Prevention Centre recorded 183 smoking over 24 hours on Saturday and then warned the Mexican people to stay away from the volcano after volcanic activity.
The Disaster Prevention Center monitored repeatedly broadcasting loud and mild earthquakes.
Pictures on social media show that a layer of ash covered on a car windshield glass near Hochimilco in Mexico City.
Earth physicists noted that volcanic activity has increased in 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since the 7.1 earthquake in Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano also referred to as the “Smoking Peak”, which began to enter its active period since 1994.
On the eve of the anniversary of Catalonia's independence referendum, police clashes with separatists
Thousands of people joined the protests on Saturday to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's bipolarization referendum, supporting independent protesters in conflicts with anti-violence police, and six people were arrested in Barcelona.
A group of supportive separatists throwed eggs and powder coating to the anti-violence police, resulting in dust over the streets of the day filled with visitors and then arrested by the anti-violence police.
There was a war later on that day, and the police stopped the turbulence with a police helmet.
The supportive independentist who calls “no forget, never forgive” has been confronted for hours with the united protesters who calls “Love Spain” for a long time.
Local media that fourteen people were treated for mild injuries during the protests.
The last October 1st referendum in Madrid was considered illegal, and a year later, the situation remained highly tensioned in this region, but Catalonia's separatists are celebrating.
The vast majority of voters opt for independence, however, the vote rate remains low, as the majority of those who opposed the division refused to vote.
Catalan authorities said the police attempted last year to block a sequential vote in the region’s vote stations, causing severe conflicts, wounding 1,000 people.
On Friday evening, they supported Independent collective camps, blocked protests and supported the action of the national police.
The protests are still ongoing, but other ways have been taken.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electricist who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope for Catalonia's independence.
Last year we had the best time of our life.
My parents were pleased to cry because they were able to vote, but now we are in trouble,” he said.
Despite a crucial victory in the last December regional elections, Catalonia's independentists are still trying to maintain their position this year, including many of the most famous leaders or self-deported, or being arrested for their appearance during the organized referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
A 42-year-old machinery worker Joan Puig recorded the protests on their phone, believing the police support, and said the conflict was triggered by both politicians.
“The situation is increasingly nervous,” he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he will participate in next year’s European Parliament elections.
“As a candidate for the European Parliament elections, it would be the most favourable way to openly condemn the Spanish government’s return to democracy and oppression,” he said.
London City: Three Men Driving Drivers Arrested
Three men (33 years old, 34 years old, and 39 years old) driven a car repeatedly hit a house in Delhi County in London and were arrested by police after the incident.
The case is about 19:30 on Thursday, where the case is Ballynagard Crescent.
Senior police officer Bob Blemmings said the attack caused damage to the doors and the building itself.
In some cases, it may have been interfered with the car.
Manga's goal helps the Levinston team defeat the surfing team by 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal wins the Livingston team.
The Levinston’s advancement shocked the router team, and Steven Gerrard lost the match for the second time in 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's goal was the key final goal, and Gary Holt's team defeated the Irish Hibernian in the second part.
Gerald's team has no guest winner this season, and they will face the battle ahead of their eight-minute rider Red Heart team next Sunday.
Before this, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna at the European League on Thursday. Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna at the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the Levinston team will continue its sixth failure record in the area, with head coach Holt no sense of failure since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
The Levinston team missed the opportunity to fight against the strong enemy.
Holt's team had already been leading signs before the score, and their attacks brought a variety of problems to the surfers.
While Scott Robinson broke the defence but put the ball on the other side of the gate, Alan Lithgow was pulled to the border after receiving Craig Halkett's headball.
The hosts are very willing to play with the router team because they know they can create trouble to the team when placing the balls.
This is how the key shooting is created.
The riding team lost an arbitrary ball, the Levinston team opened an empty place, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson formed the Manga, who received a record from the blocked zone center. The riding team lost an arbitrary ball, the Levinston team broke, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to block the Manga.
At that time, although the router had control over the game, the main team defense was hard to break down, and the gate guard Liam Kelly was basically nothing to worry about.
This pattern continued until the second half, despite Alfredo Morelos took a ball from Kelly's feet.
Scott Pittman has stopped Allan McGregor one foot by the wanderers’ door, and Lisgo has kicked out another positioning ball in the Levinston team.
Crosses continuously entered the bandwidth of the Levinston team and was continuously broken down, and two goals — after Harcott proposed to let the replacement of Glenn Middleton and a handball — were thrown back.
Lewinston team’s “extraordinary performance” analysis
BBC Scottish journalist Alasdair Lamont reports at Tony Macaroni Arena
The Levinston team performed superb and results were amazing.
All players performed greatly and once again exceeded people’s expectations.
There has been almost no change in the game style and personal configuration of the team since Holt returned to the top league, but the honour that Holt has brought to the team is truly worth praise.
He brought a lot of heroic players.
Captain Harcott Gong was unclear, he deployed an organizational super-powered defence force, and Monga, throughout the process, made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall never abandoned the precautions.
However, the team’s character is not enough.
They performed well at times under Gerald’s leadership, but far from the standard.
Their last ball didn’t get in—they only cut into the main team once—that could be a alarm alarm for the rocker team in the middle.
Erdogan is pleased in Cologne.
On Saturday (29 September), the last day of the Turkish President arrived to Germany for a state visit, and the two leaders held a friendly breakfast meeting in Berlin.
President Erdogan’s German action is controversial and a visit intended to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
They are stuck in issues such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to a huge mosque in Cologne.
The city of Cologne in Turkey is the most populated city in Turkey outside of the country of Turkey.
Police for security reasons stopped 25,000 viewers from the mosque to participate in the assembly, but there were still many supporters nearby and welcomed the President's arrival.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom belong to Kurds, also expressed opposition, condemning Erdogan's policy and condemning the German government not to welcome Erdogan's visit to Germany.
The protests of both sides reflect the differences arising on Erdogan’s visit: some German Turks call him a hero and others condemned him as a dictator.
Detford Road Accident: Bicycle owner died after collision with a car
A motorcycle driver died in an accident in London.
The incident occurred around 10:15 in the UK summer time, near the cross-border between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Detford, south-east of the city.
Drivers were checked and medical personnel implemented rescue, but the driver of the bike was dead at the place.
Just months before the incident occurred, on Childers Street, approximately a mile from Saturday’s crash, another bike driver died unfortunately in the crash.
The London Metropolitan Police said the police was determining the man’s identity and then informing his close relatives.
The roads are now closed, bus reforms are done, and drivers are advised to move around the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Injury to six prisoners
The prison office said a high-guarded men's prison had a revolt and six prisoners were wounded in the revolt.
At 9:30 a.m. in the UK summer time Sunday morning, the HMP Long Lartin prison in Wester County broke out a revolt and the revolt is still ongoing.
The relevant departments have sent specialized wind attack forces to handle, and the rebellion involves eight prisoners, who are currently controlled by all involved in one building.
The face of the prison police was mild injured and was treated in place.
A spokesman of the Prison Administration said: “We have deployed personnel dedicated to responding to prison rebellion to deal with HMP Long Lartin’s ongoing rebellion.
Six injured police officers have been treated.
We do not tolerate any violent act in prisons, and we will be transferred to the police who may face longer imprisonment.
HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the UK.
The head of the prison was attacked by prisoners in June and later sent to hospital treatment.
Last October, the anti-violence police were mobilized to go to prison to deal with major turbulences and were attacked by a tablet.
Hurricane Rose threatened flooding to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit from this)
Tropical low-pressure air attacks in Arizona are rare, but it is likely to occur earlier next week as the remaining forces of Hurricane Rosa will attack the southwest desert area, thereby triggering flooding danger.
The National Meteorological Authority has issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday to areas like western Arizona to south and east of Nevada, south east of California and Utah (including Phoenix, Prague, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City).
Rose is expected to arrive with rains later on Monday, on the cross over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Meteorological Office of Phoenix wrote on Twitter: “Since 1950, only ten tropical turbines have remained in a state of tropical storm or low air pressure within 200 miles from Phoenix!
“Katrina (1967) is a hurricane landing within 40 miles from the Arizona border.”
According to the latest model of the National Hurricane Cente, rainfall will reach 2 to 4 inches, while local rainfall will reach 6 inches on the edge of Mogol, Arizona.
Other southwest desert areas, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the big basins, rainfall is likely to reach 1 to 2 inches, and local total rainfall is likely to reach 4 inches.
For areas that do not cause flood-danger, because of severe drought in these areas, the rainfall brought by Rosa may be a good luck.
While flooding is given high attention, moderate rainfall may also be beneficial as the southwestern regions are currently experiencing drought.
According to weather.com, the U.S. Drought Monitor shows that more than 40% of Arizona’s areas are experiencing at least extreme drought conditions (second severe category).
First of all, the route of Hurricane Rosa will lead it to landing the lower California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa was still in a hurricane intensity, with a maximum wind power of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of the Yukinian corner of Mexico, moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The hurricane exposed cold sea waters in the Pacific, thus weakening wind power.
Therefore, it is expected to land from Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with intensity of tropical storms.
Rainfall may be great in parts of Mexico and there is a risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, “the total rainfall from lower California peninsula to northwestern Sonora is expected to reach 3 to 6 inches, and maybe even 10 inches.”
Rose will then cross Mexico north in the form of a tropical storm, arrive at the border of Arizona on Tuesday morning in the form of a tropical low-pressure air, and cross the entire state of Arizona on Tuesday night, entering the south of Utah.
The National Hurricane Center said “The main threat to Rosa or her remaining forces is to cause severe rain to lower California peninsula, northwestern Sonora and southwestern US desert areas.”
This rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening floods and stone streams in desert areas and cause mountains slopes in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four suspects of intentional killing arrested
A 16-year-old boy found several injuries on Samerset, and later the suspect was arrested for intentionally murder. The suspect was three teen boys and a 20-year-old man.
The damaged teenage boy was found injured on Saturday at 4 a.m. in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton.
He was later sent to the hospital and the injuries are currently “stable”.
Avon and Somerset Police said a criminal suspect, including a 17-year-old man, two 18-year-old men and a 20-year-old man, had been arrested overnight in the Radstock district.
Police urged witnesses who were captured with their phone to live videos to give tracks.
Trump calls Cavano a “humble victim of anger” of the Democratic Party
Trump said at a meeting in Wille, West Virginia: “One vote for Judge Puccavano is a vote against the Democratic Party’s uncomfortable and shameful tactics.
Trump said Cavano has suffered the humility and anger of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination.
Cavano on Thursday, when he was being questioned by the Congress, emotionally denied accusations made by Christine Blasey Ford, saying he had not sexually abused Ford decades ago.
Ford also accused him of attending the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said that the American people saw Cavano’s “goodness and courage.”
The president said to supporters in West Virginia: “Voting for Judge Cavano is voting to recognize the most successful legal wise of our time, a public service law scientist.”
When he talked about the importance of Republican elections in the middle-term elections, the president indirectly shot Cavanos nomination.
“There’s only five weeks from the most important election in our lives.
“I’m not in the campaign, I’m running around this way.
That’s to allow you to choose the best candidates,” he said.
Trump said the mission of the Democratic Party was “resistance and obstacle.”
A senior representative of the Republican leadership told the U.S. cable TV news network (CNN) that it is expected to take place the first key processional vote on Cavano’s nomination in the Senate on Friday.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami have caused hundreds of deaths, and the number of deaths is still rising.
Indonesian authorities said on Saturday a major earthquake and tsunami attacked the Indonesian island of Sulawi, which killed at least 384 people, most of them being taken away during a huge wave of Shanghai beach.
On Friday evening, hundreds of people gathered at a party on the beach in the city of Balo, where the shore of up to 6 feet (18 feet) overwhelming Shanghai coast, resulting in the deaths of many people, and the tsunami reached the entire face.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
Sumopo Purwo Nugroho, Indonesian disaster reduction agency BNPB spokesman, said in a statement about Jakarta: “When the tsunami occurred yesterday, people were active on the beach and were unable to escape in time and therefore they were unfortunately killed.”
“The tsunami clothes came with cars, woods, houses and covered everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the Open Sea at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) and then attacked the coastline.
Some people climb to the trees to escape the tsunami to survive, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 evacuation centers in Peru.
Photographs published by the rescue agency show that many buildings and stores were destroyed, bridges were devastated and collapsed, and a mosque was surrounded by sea waters.
On Saturday, the earthquakes continued to interfere with the coastal city.
The area with a population of 2.4 million people felt a strong shock.
The Indonesian Technical Assessment and Application Authority (BPPT) said in a statement that the massive earthquake released on Friday was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement also pointed out that the city is located at the end of a narrow long bay, so the geographical location is likely to increase the potency of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damages as "large scale" and indicated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of the victims were pressed under the ruins of the collapse building, he said, adding that 540 people were wounded and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the damage and destruction of the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Balo could be more severe, the area of the Gala building, closer to the earthquake.
The communication of the Gala was “totally paralyzed, no news,” Nugroho said.
The Red Cross said there were more than 300,000 inhabitants in the region, adding that the Red Cross staff and volunteers were traveling to the disaster area.
“While it’s already a tragedy, the situation may be worse,” the Red Cross said.
Due to the lack of information about a massive population's tsunami attack in Baloe, the agency was widely criticized on Saturday despite officials say the tsunami occurred after a warning was released.
In a video taken by amateur amateurs shared on social media, you can hear a man on the upper floor of the building crying crazy to the crowd on the streets below, warning them that the tsunami is coming.
A few minutes later, the water wall flooded the shore of Shanghai, surrounding buildings and vehicles.
Reuters cannot immediately identify the authenticity of the video.
Earthquakes and tsunami caused a massive stop of electricity, interrupting communications around Peru, making government authorities unable to coordinate rescue work.
Indonesian authorities say the army has started sending rescue aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated persons still need urgent food and other basic supplies.
The airport in Bali is currently reopen only for rescue operations and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation center in Peru on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia has risen to more than 800 people.
This is really very bad.
While the staff of the Galactic World Declaration Council have arrived safely to Baru and the staff of Baru are temporarily settled in a temporarily built oil shelter in the company’s garden, the scenery they saw on the way was unbearable, Doseba said.
“They said they saw many houses were damaged,” he said.
This is really very bad.
Just as rescue organizations started this brutal battle and launched the disaster equipment, some complained that foreign rescue personnel with deep expertise were banned from traveling to Peru.
According to Indonesian law, foreign funds, goods and staff are allowed only when the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
But not yet announced.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” Indonesian Red Cross spokesman Aulia Arriani said.
“When the government says it’s a national disaster, we can take action for international rescue, but the current situation does not allow it.
The next night after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the relatives of the missing persons still hold a line of hope in the hope that their relatives can create miracles and add a color to this terrible natural disaster.
On Saturday, rescue officers picked up a little boy from the waterway.
On Sunday, the rescue officers rescued a woman who had been undergoed for two days under the wave and the body of her mother was next to her.
Indonesian National Paraguay Team Coach Gendon Subandono has trained two missing paraguay athletes in preparation for the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month.
Other people who were stuck at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior athlete in the skiing field, I have a personal emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon said the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel has been published in the umbrella community several hours after he had sent a WhatsApp message to Barru’s competitors attending a beach party.
However, his message always showed only a grey parallel, not a pair of blue parallel.
“I think that means that the message has not been sent successfully,” he said.

Kanye West says the singer changed his name to "Ye"
Speaking singer Kanye West changed its name to "Ye".
He announced the change of name on Twitter on Saturday, and the specific content was: “Canye West, which everyone knew before.”
This year’s 41-year-old West has been named “Ye” for a while, and he also used the name as the title of the eighth album released in June 2018.
This change was announced before he participated in Saturday Night Live, and is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
The producer said he replaced the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the program for "emotional reasons".
In addition to the abbreviation of West's current professional name, he had previously said that the word had religious significance for him.
When West discussed the title of his album with Big Boy earlier this year, West said: “I believe ‘Ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, meaning ‘you’ in the Bible.
“So I am you, that’s us.
The name I used before was "Kanye", meaning "the only", now changed to "Ye", which reflects our good, evil, confusion, and everything.
This album reflects more who we are.
Many famous singers have changed their names.
Sean Combs has used many names, most commonly used by Puff Daddy (P. Diddy) and Diddy (Diddy), but this year he announced that he preferred both the names "Love" and "Brother Love".
JAY-Z, who has previously worked with West, has also changed its name, changing the way it is to use a linked character or no linked character and a large letter.
Mexico AMLO announces no use of force against civilians
Mexican elected president, Andreas Manuel Lopez Ofrador, has announced that there will never be any use of violence against civilians on the 50th anniversary of the country’s ongoing student persecution.
On Saturday, Lopez Ofradore promised at the Tlatelolco Plaza, “I will never use force to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, while left-wing student movements raised throughout Latin America, Mexican forces shot during peaceful protests in the square, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Ofrador promises to grant students and to open more free public universities to support the development of the younger generation in Mexico.
He said unemployment and lack of education could lead teenagers to the path of crime.
US should double the A.I. funds
As China’s research in artificial intelligence is more active, the United States should double its research spending in the field, said Kai-Fu Lee, investor and AI practitioner.
This speech focuses on AI announcements made by the U.S. government departments, and in the U.S. overall, there is a lack of official AI strategy.
China launched a plan last year: striving to become the leader of AI innovation by 2030.
“In this area, all the other countries are far behind the United States and we are looking for a new breakthrough in artificial intelligence, so doubling the AI research budget will be a good start,” Lee said.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling the funding could double the chances of the United States to become an artificial intelligence breakthrough again.
Lee’s book “Superpower of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published last month by Harcott Publishing. Lee is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in China’s most famous AI company Face++.
In the 1980s, he created an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that defeated the top-rated American player Othello, after he became the CEO of the Microsoft Institute and the President of Google China subsidiaries.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, Robotics Challenge, and then asked what competition would be launched in order to the next group of dreamers.
U.S. researchers often pay a weekly fee to get government aid, Lee said.
“It is not China stealing our academic leaders, but business,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired outstanding universities to work in AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policy can help the United States to strengthen the work on artificial intelligence.
“I think it should be necessary to provide a green card for the doctor of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Government published a new generation of artificial intelligence development plan.
Lee said in the United States, U.S. researchers can receive funding from the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations, as well as in China, the National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for researchers in academic institutions, but the quality of academic work in China is relatively poor.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to attract industry and academic partners, and the White House also announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced that it has invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
Currently, the National Science Foundation invests more than $100 million annually in research in artificial intelligence.
In contrast, for months, the US legislative department to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken action.
Macedonia will change the name of the country to hold a referendum.
The people of Macedonia held a referendum on Sunday to vote whether to change the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would address the tens of years of disputes between Macedonia and Greece, which has blocked its accession to the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, which retains its northern neighbor name meaning Greece has legitimate rights to its territory and has denied its accession to the North Atlantic Convention Organization (NATO) and the EU (EU).
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents believe that changing the name would compromise the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Georgie Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum, and the opposition campaign was suspicious about whether the vote results would meet the minimum 50 percent of votes to bring the referendum into effect.
The question about the referendum is: “Do you accept the agreement between Greece to be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the EU?”
Supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe Macedonia is one of the countries of the decomposition of Yugoslavia, seeking to join the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) worth a certain cost.
“I’m here today to vote for the future of the country, for the younger generation of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the EU’s umbrella, because this means that we all can have a safer life,” said Olivia Georgijevska, 79.
Although there are no legal obligations, enough members say they will be determined to comply with the results of the vote.
But the change of name requires two-third majority of the parliament.
The State Election Commission said no reports of illegal behavior have been received until 1 p.m.
However, the vote rate was only 16%, while the last 2016 parliamentary election was 34%, when 66% of registered voters participated in the vote.
“I came to vote for my children and we live in Europe,” says 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the capital of Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and his wife Zorica and son Dushko made their own vote in a referendum to change the name in Macedonia, which would open the way for Macedonia to join the North Atlantic Convention Organization (NATO) and the EU.
At the door of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54-year-old, is preparing a small stage and heading the chair in front of the tent built by people who opposed the referendum.
“While it’s for the North Atlantic Convention Organization (NATO) and the EU, we want to join the North Atlantic Convention Organization (EU), rather than by walking backdoor,” Kavardarkov said.
Although our country is poor, we have dignity.
If they don’t see us as Macedonians, we can seek help from other countries, such as China or Russia, to become members of Asia-European integration.”
Overall, Zaev said the membership of the North Atlantic Convention Organization (NATO) will bring a large number of necessary investments in Macedonia with unemployment rate of up to 20%.
“I believe the majority of people will support the referendum, because more than 80% of our population support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the EU,” Zaev said after voting.
He said the vote for “support” will “definish our future.”
A poll published by the Macedonian Policy Institute on Monday showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - and that figure is below the required vote rate.
Another poll by Telma TV in Macedonia found that 57 percent of respondents said they plan to participate in Sunday’s vote.
Of course, 70% of the people said they would vote for.
If the referendum is successful, the vote should be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum means the policy of the pro-Western government will be subjected to the first serious attack since its adoption in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City team Sergio Aguero breaks Brighton's strict defence to score
On Saturday, in Manchester’s Etihad Stadium, England, Sergio Aguero and Rajem Sterling double broke Brighton’s defence and finally won 2-0.
The 65-minute score of Aquiloti looks very easy.
At the beginning of the game, the Argentinian frontman received a transfer in the middle.
He quickly ran through the three defence teams of the Brighton team, moving towards the wide area.
Acquero later finds himself surrounded by four other players.
He launched a defence team and overpassed several defence teams on the border of the Brighton Blocked Area.
Then pushed the ball to the left and transferred to Stalin.
The British frontman used his first touchball in the prohibited zone to transfer the ball back to Acquero, and Acquero shot the ball to the right side of the gate with his right foot, knocking Matthew Ryan on the Brighton gate.
“Acquilo’s feet are wounded,” Manchester City’s chief coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We’ve been talking about making him play for 55 or 60 minutes.
He did it.
Luckily, at that point he played.
However, it was Stalin's initial advantage for Sky Blues in the Super League.
The goal took place in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aquilo received the ball at the back of the Brighton team.
He sent the ball along the left to Leroy Sane in a beautiful live story.
After a few balls, Saney led Stalin to the remote gate column.
The founder of Sky Blues easily puts the ball into the net before sliding out of the boundary.
On Tuesday 12:55, the Manchester City team will be held at the Rhine-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, to meet the opponent Hoffenheim in the Champions League group.
Scherzer wants to strike off when fighting the Los Angeles team.
Because the national team was eliminated in the post-season competition, there is no more reason to force them to start again.
The winner-winning Cheerleader wants to be the first in the match against Colorado Los Angeles on Sunday, but provided that the Los Angeles team is still immersed in the after-season influence, the Los Angeles team is ahead than the Los Angeles Duchs in the West League (NL).
On Friday night, Los Angeles defeated the National Team with 5-2 and locked at least one outlet card number, but they still want to get the first division champion.
“Even for nothing else, at least we can participate in the competition at Danvers, and the other teams will hit the highest level I will face this year.
Why should I not participate in the competition?”
The National Team has not yet announced the first match on Sunday, but it is that they are likely to let Cheerle play in this case.
This will be Cheerleader's 34th debut, he has already started playing on Thursday and will be playing balls on Sunday with normal rest.
The Washington's right hand player scored 18 wins and 7 defeats in 222 and 2/3 of this season, with a defensive score of 2.53, with 300 trips.
Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia
When the President talks about the importance of Republican elections in the middle-term elections, he indirectly filmed the situation faced by his elected Supreme Court voter Brett Kavanaugh.
“Everything we do is about the direction of November.
There are five weeks away from the most important election in our lives.
This is important, I’m not in the election campaign, I’m running around this way to make you choose the best candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You also see how terrible Democrats are, you can see now.”
They are determined to use any necessary means to take back power, and you can see their humble dirt.
No matter who they hurt, in order to control the power, to gain control, to put them on their feet, it doesn’t matter, they have only power and control in their eyes, and we don’t give them.
The mission of the Democratic Party is “resistance and resistance”.
“You have seen this in the past four days,” he said, and he called the Democratic Party “angry, embarrassed, humiliated, false.”
He mentioned the name of Senate Judiciary Committee Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, making a lie on the site.
“Do you remember how she responded?
Is it the documents you disclose?
Oh oh oh what.
No, no, no, others give me, this limb language is too bad, the worst limb language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a generalist.
People who cannot speak straight here.
I didn’t feel strange when local Momentum political party activists voted for condemning me.
After all, I am part of the Labour Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Parliamentary Par
My parliamentary fellow Joan Ryan has been treated similarly because of its firm resistance to anti-Jewishism.
And the criticism of my initiative was because I was opposed to Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, similar issues arise on responsible economic policy, national security, and European issues, which Jeremy has opposed with previous leaders.
In a statement from Nottingham Eastern Labour Party meeting on Friday, he said: “We hope that the meeting will be inclusive and productive.
During the eight years of my work as a local Labour Parliamentary member, most of the time, the GC meeting on Friday evening was this way.
Unfortunately, today, this is no longer the foundation for many meetings, and people have forgotten the political promises of “to good, gentler” (kinder, gentler) and have not even appeared to have begun to practice.
The Labour Party cannot tolerate the views of the left, and the basis of all the views is whether the Labour Party leaders are accepted.
This phenomenon began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the Labour Party, and I had previously thought that I and my colleagues have the same political views, but they began to want me to change my views and make me stand in a position I would never agree, whether on issues of national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly, what I say is irrelevant, followed by a series of charges on social media, asking to cancel elections, condemn the middle politics, or telling me that I deserve to join the Labour Party.
People who experience this situation are not just me alone.
In fact, I’m clearly lucky to have myself compared to some of my colleagues, because my comments are often political.
Many of my colleagues are faced every day with a common blame of flooding, or using offensive language for gender discrimination, or words of racist color. But they never avoided, and I admire their professionalism and firm determination.
The most disappointing thing in this political era is that insulting language has become a norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week the Labour Party should create a tolerant cultural atmosphere.
The fact is that we are no longer a large church with many voices, and with one another “discrimination” initiative, one another changes in the election regulations, making the Labour Party more narrow.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of suggestions to encourage me to stay low, not so straightforward, so that I can "bone myself".
But this is not my initiative from politics.
32 years ago, when I was still a student at school, I joined the Labour Party. At that time, due to the negligence of the government of the Sahel, our comprehensive school classes were fundamentally paralyzed, and since then, both as a parliamentary and as a government minister, I have done my best to seek better public service for those who are most in need of public service.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
No one in the East of Nottingham will feel strange about my political position and the areas where I have disagreed with my current leadership.
For those who have submitted the bill on Friday, I do not understand that you are still wasting time and energy when our country struggles to get out of the EU and damaging our families, and public services, claiming whether I am faithful to Labour leaders.
In fact, one thing I want to say to my voters (whether they are members of the Labour Party), and not to the Nottingham Momentum, is: I have the honour to serve you, and I assure that any threat to prevent the elected or political interests cannot prevent me from act in the way I think it is best in the interest of all of you.

League 38-17 Leicester Melros: Unfailed League wins again
The last two attempts might have influenced the final result to some extent, but there is no doubt that the win in this fun-going game would be worth it.
They are now in the top and are the only unfailed team out of ten teams.
Finally, their excellent defence and extraordinary opportunities to capture made the main team and coach Peter Murchie very satisfied.
“We have passed a heavy test of the competition, but have remained unsuccessful, so far, and I must be pleased for this,” Merkel said.
Robyn Christie from Melros said: “The honour belongs to the League and they took the opportunity better than we.”
Grant Anderson temporarily led the League in the 14th minute attempt, later replaced by Frazier Climo, but because Scotland team Rory Hughes met a golden medal in the match against the Warriors, the Melros took advantage in number, while Jason Baggot captured a chance to not be replaced.
Before the midfield break, Crimeo expanded the League's leading advantage with a score ball, and after the gol, when the midfield break, he obtained an additional point alone to divide the ratio to 17-5.
But Melros’ second half’s start was good, and a shot by Patrick Anderson in Baghdad’s exchange would shorten the gap to five.
Furthermore, Ruaridh Knott was suspended for a long time due to serious injuries, being raised out of the field, and after the competition re-started, a shooting gate by Stefan McDowall, who was replaced through the Crimea, was again larger than it was divided.
Later, Alliance's agent captain Blair Macpherson, faced a yellow card warning that Melros's team once again occupied the advantage in number by breaking the massive pressure magic with the unchanged Bruce Colvine's shooting gate.
However, after the main team recovered the atmosphere, when Struan Hutchinson was warned of a golden card because the ball out-of-the-country strike Crime, McFerson held the ball score behind the attacking team.
Like when the game began again, Crimeo was replaced again, after Kyle Rowe received David Armstrong's goal, the main team's fifth attempt was sent to the side Gregor Henry.
Still Game is prepared to enter the military food industry.
Still Game's main actor Ford Kieran appears to be prepared to enter the hospitality industry, who has previously been discovered as the director of a registered restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the British Broadcasting Company (BBC), the film was written by him and played jointly with a long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming 9th season will be the final season of the show, and Killan seems to be planning to follow the life of Craiglan.
Official records show that Killan is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, despite a source for the Scottish Sun’s newspaper suggests Killan wants to join Craiglan’s “Red Fire Food Industry”.
“The sea belongs to us”: Bolivia wants court to resume the Pacific route
Marines inspect the well-equipped Navy headquarters in Lapas.
On public buildings, a blue flag of the sea flooded with the wind.
From Lake Kaka to the Amazon Navy base, the headline was filled with the words: “The sea is legally ours.”
Return to the sea is our duty.
In the whole territory of Bolivia, during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, the memories of the coastline fall into Chile's hands remained in sight.
This decades of hope has reached its highest point, as Bolivia, after five years of examination, finally awaited the International Court’s judgment on October 1st.
Bolivia’s diplomat, Roberto Calzadilla, said: “Bolivia has the power, the heart of the people, the harmonious solidarity, and it is natural to wait for a positive end.”
The International Court will broadcast the entire judgment process live on the large screens of the country, and the Bolivians can watch the whole. Hopefully, after decades of interrupted negotiations, the Hague Court will be able to support Bolivia's claims. Chile is obliged to grant Bolivia a sovereignty out of the sea through negotiations.
Bolivia's extraordinary charming president Evo Morales is a native leader and will also be interested in Monday's decision.
In the end of August he announced that “We are coming back to the Pacific.”
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision favorable for Bolivia and that it would not change anything if it was actually made.
The United Nations agency headquartered in the Netherlands has no authority to grant territory in Chile and has been established provisions that do not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
Paz Zárate, an international law expert in Chile, said the final debate trial was just over six months and the International Court ruled that the case was "not complicated".
And this project has not pushed Bolivia at all in the past four years, and it may have gone back.
“The current Bolivia government has blocked access to the Pacific,” Zárate said.
She said Morales’ provocative speech exhausted the goodwill remaining in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue soon, but it is difficult to continue the dialogue after that.
The two countries have no longer exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Bolivia's representative in the Hague, former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, denied that the court's decision was extraordinary rapid.
Monday’s results will give Bolivia a “excellent opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and “to end the mutual benefit of 139 years of differences,” he said.
For Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, he denied that he wanted to use maritime issues as a political shell.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to use the Pacific,” he added.
“The judgment will create opportunities for us to overcome the history of the past.
North Korea says it will not dismantle nuclear weapons if it cannot trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Li Huang said that if they cannot trust the United States, North Korea will never dismantle their nuclear weapons.
At the United Nations Assembly held on Saturday, Li-Huawei gave a speech.
He urged the United States to comply with the promises made between the two countries during the Singapore Summit.
More than three months ago, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore to re-establish nuclear diplomacy.
Li Huang said it would be possible to force North Korea to knees, by continuing sanctions and even against making a war declaration, just doing a "day dream".
If Pyongyang is unable to take a major disarmament first, Washington would be cautious about this issue when he agreed to make a declaration.
Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump hoped to hold a summit again.
But it is commonly questioned whether North Korea would really give up its nuclear reserves, after all, it is very likely to see it as the only way to safeguard its security.
Pompeo plans to visit North Korea next month to discuss the issue of a Korean-American leader summit again.

John Edward: Language skills are critical for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland have always kept excellent academic score record, and in 2018, a series of pleasant exam scores, and individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community work are more successful.
These private schools gather more than 30,000 students across Scotland, under the guidance of the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best quality services to students and parents.
The purpose of private schools is to lay a good foundation for students’ continued education and higher education, career choices and social status as a global citizen.
As an educational institution capable of designing and implementing customized school courses, we are fortunate to witness that modern language has always been a popular discipline in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to each other in a language that others can understand, your words will enter each other’s mind.”
If you speak to each other’s mother tongue, your words will enter the hearts of each other.
This phrase reminds us that when we want to build relationships and trust with foreign friends, we cannot only rely on English.
Based on the latest exam results of this year, the language of private schools ranked the top by rate.
68% of students who study foreign languages have achieved a level A score.
Data from 74 member schools from the Scottish Private School Committee (SCIS) show that 72% of students achieved A-level scores in Chinese, while 72% of students who study German, 69% of students who study French and 63% of students who study Spanish also achieved A-level scores.
This suggests that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages to become an important skills that children and teenagers will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, as a subject, language and STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) are considered equal in private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that 17% of employees’ efforts to fill their vacancies are due to lack of language skills.
Therefore, in order to lay a good foundation for youth's post-day career, language skills are becoming increasingly essential.
As there will be more jobs that need language in the future, this skill becomes crucial in today’s globalized world.
No matter what profession you choose, if you learn a second language and mastered this lifetime-benefit skills, the future will have a real advantage.
Being able to communicate directly with foreign friends, people who speak multiple languages are determined to be the highest in competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult citizens in the UK found that 75% of people are able to speak well in foreign languages for a conversation, and French is the only language with a percentage of two-digits (15%).
Therefore, increased investment in language education for children today is essential.
Mastering in multiple languages, especially in developing countries, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school’s teaching language is different.
Many schools focus on teaching more classical modern languages, while other schools are teaching that they think it will be important for the UK by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
No matter which language your child is interested in, private schools offer a wide range of language options and are equipped with professional faculty in the field.
Whatever the future of children, private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a good learning environment where children can lay solid foundation and provide them with the skills necessary to succeed.
It cannot be denied that in today’s globalized business environment, language remains crucial for the future of the country and therefore must be reflected in education.
Actually, modern language should be truly seen as “international communication skills”.
Private schools in Scotland will continue to offer such choices, diversity and excellence to young people.
It has to do so.

LeBron will host Lake Team’s first show in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans are waiting for LeBron James’ first show at the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lake Team Chief Coach Luke Walton announced that James will participate in the first pre-season match in San Diego against Denver Gold Team on Sunday.
However, it is still uncertain when James came.
Watton said on Lake Team’s official website, “The time will be between 1 minute and 48 minutes.”
Lake Team reporter Mike Trudel wrote on Twitter that James’s time could be limited.
After the training ended earlier this week, James was asked about the schedule for the Lakers' six pre-season.
“At this stage of my career, I no longer need a pre-season game to warm up,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia Meeting Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will start a series of election meetings tonight in Wellington, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five meetings that Trump plans to hold next week, including staying in some of his-friendly places, such as Tennessee and Sicily.
Because the choices to fill up vacancies in the Supreme Court led to the suspension of voting, Trump’s initiative intended to seek support for the upcoming middle-term elections, as the Republican party was facing the risk of losing Congress’s control during the vote in November.
How to watch the time of Trump’s West Virginia meeting tonight and how to watch online?
Trump’s meeting was scheduled to be held on September 29, 2018, east time at 7 pm tonight.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia Meeting online via YouTube’s live channel.
Trump is likely to spoke on the issue of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in this week’s hearing, which under investigation by the Federal Investigation Agency (FBI), which led to the situation of accusations of sexual abuse due to the expected suspension of a week’s Senate vote.
However, the main purpose of these assemblies is to help the Republicans fight for some support in the upcoming November elections.
According to Reuters, Trump’s election group said the five meetings held next week were aimed at “motivating volunteers and supporters as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
A spokesman in the Trump election group refused to reveal his name told Reuters, “The control of the Congress is crucial to its agenda, so as the busy election season comes, the president will travel as many states as possible.”
According to the City Journal, West Virginia, “a planned meeting at the Wesbanco Arena tonight will gather many supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will attract a large number of Pittsburgh media to report.”
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month on Saturday, where Trump won in 2016 with more than 40 percent advantage in the state.
Trump attempts to help the Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey in West Virginia who was left behind in the polls.
According to Reuters, Simon Haeder, a political scholar at the University of West Virginia, said “the president had to push his wave in an opinion investigation, which is not a good sign for Morrissey.”
2018 Lady Cup: The American team showed a strong competition spirit in Sunday's single match
After the first three single-matches, a single-match for four people on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what the Reed Cup needs.
Movement loading is an entirely new concept invented by the sporting industry, and athletes have no doubt about it, especially in such competitions.
Where is the movement now?
“They were leading six minutes before, and now leading four minutes, so I think we have some motivation now,” Jordan Spieth said.
Of course, the European team has a certain advantage, now leading four points, and there are 12 points in the next match.
As Spice said, the American team felt somewhat less successful, but many aspects were encouraged, especially the performance of Spice and Justin Thomas, who played the whole day of the game, achieving three out of four points respectively.
Spitz was very harmful from the start-up to the Fruitfield and set a markable level.
As the competition continued, the screaming of Pivola, and when he and Thomas were behind 2 against 2, he recorded a key push to put the fourth match into a straight hand.
His pushing for the American team won the victory, and the screaming screams were heard again on the field, which let us see that they believe the American team didn’t leave.
Spitz said, “You really need to deep into your heart and heart competition.
This is the situation in which all players are currently.
18 holes to score the ball.
Over the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored over the players of Spice and Thomas, which is an indisputable race of the Reed Cup.
This strange but cute combination of the European team has not lost, four victories have not lost, they will not make mistakes.
Moliwood was the only group member who didn’t play a berry on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the berry on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday afternoon.
This energy flowed to the noise crowd and the way it flowed out of it, further explained the objects they were to be defeated on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players who could play European victory.
It is best in different holes at the same time.
But it is too early to talk about the European team’s victory.
Bobba Watson and Webb Simpson soon set up the morning four-ball hero Sergio Garcia, partnered with Alex Noren.
One bikes and two top nine "doubles" put this Spanish player and this Swedish player into a hole that never climbs out.
But on Sunday, no one can help you get out of the holes.
This four-person and four-person one-ball race is extremely attractive and is suitable for close-distance viewing, because the collaboration between partners, each other's suggestions, each other's suggestions and each other's suggestions and tactics can change instantly.
So far, the European teams have performed better and have achieved a clear leadership advantage on the last day, but the four-one match also indicates that people, especially those in the United States, are unrealistic to suspect that the American team desires to fight.
The European team reached the Leading Cup final with 10-6

The intuitive two-person group Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the leadership in the game against Tiger Woods, achieving two victories, increasing the score at Le Golf National so far.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn attempted to rescue the cup lost two years ago in Hesse, defeating the missing American team in the morning's four-ball match and won a 3-1 win.
The U.S. team strongly resisted in four-to-two games, winning two games, but always failed to compensate the situation behind.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points to defend the Cup in 12 single games on Sunday.
Fletwood was the first European new show to win four points, and he and Morinali were known as "Morwood" after the weekend of the bombing time, which were the second pair in the history to win four points in the start of four games.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-hour race, they joined in a great deal, eventually defeating the angry Woods and the new American actor Bruceon Dechambeau with a 5-4 big victory.
Woods, who had hardened to finish two matches on Saturday, had occasionally exploded, has already lost 19 matches in 29 matches of four four and two matches of four, including 7 matches.

Despite a relaxed and pleasant day in the southwest of Paris, the European team did not do what they wanted.

Only two-quarters in the history of the Leader Cup have been able to enter a single game, although the host Foreic team can only be able to defend the cup.
However, due to ranking the second in the first two days of the game, it seems to be overwhelmed in Sunday’s reactions.
North Korea says no trust is “impossible” to unilateral disarmament.
North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday to the United Nations that the continued sanctions deepened North Korea's lack of confidence in the United States, where it would never be possible to unilaterally give up nuclear weapons.
Speaking at the World Organization’s Annual UN Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea has taken “many friendly initiatives in the past year,” such as a halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear tests, and ensuring that it won’t increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“H, we have not seen any reaction from the US,” Lee said.
“As long as we still lack of trust in the United States, we are uncertain about national security, and in this case we won’t anyway become a unilateral disarmamented ‘start-bird’.
While Lee reiterates North Korea’s constant complaints against Washington’s means to resist “part-phase” non-nuclearization (in this case, North Korea will be rewarded for its progressive measures), his statement appears to be focused on the fact that North Korea has not refused to give up unilateral non-nuclearization like Pyongyang in the past.
Lee referred to a joint statement made by the current US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during the first meeting in Singapore on June 12 during which Kim Jong-un pledged to commit to achieving the "neuclearization of the Northern Peninsula" while Trump pledged to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the Korean War between 1950 and 1953, but the United States said that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed the call for a relaxation of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insist on the ‘non-nuclearization priority’ and by sanctions pressures to its objectives by compulsory means, and even against ‘Declaring the End of War’.
“Thinking that sanctions can make us surrender is just a day-to-day dream of those who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our confidence in the United States.
Lee did not mention the plans of a second summit between Kim Jong-un and Trump earlier this week, emphasized by the United Nations.
The Foreign Minister insisted that over the past five months Kim Jong-un had three meetings with Korean leaders in Moon Jae-in, adding: “If one side of the non-nuclearization issue is Korea rather than the United States, then the non-nuclearization issue of the Korean Peninsula will not fall into such a stagnation.”
Despite that, after Trump called Kim Jong-un as a "rocket agent" performing suicide missions, Lee told the United Nations that North Korea's fire would inevitably target the United States, but Lee's speech was completely different from last year.
Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, appreciated the courage of the United Nations to take unarmed measures against Kim Jong-un this year, but he said there is a lot to do and the sanctions must be continued before North Korea’s de-nuclearization is achieved.
On Wednesday, Trump said there is no time limit for it, saying “it doesn’t matter even if it takes two years, three or five months.”
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward the measures taken against Pyongyang.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday to the UN Security Council: “We must continue to strengthen the implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions until we have achieved the final and fully verified desnuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously agreed to strengthen the sanctions against North Korea in order to cut the sources of funding for Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile projects.
Pompeo encountered Li-Huawei at the United Nations Assembly, saying he will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has failed.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said that the line has made some progress if North Korea has not condemned him for a few hours to ask him for "the same demands of foolishness".
During a meeting this month with Xi Jinping, North Korea pledged that if the United States takes "the corresponding measures", we would dismantle the missile launches and the nuclear complex.
Lee said Kim Jong-un told him that the “correspondent measures” he was looking for are the security assurance Trump promised in Singapore, as well as the progress in normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard University students learn how to get enough rest time
This year, Harvard University launched a new course that allows all undergraduate students to get more sleep to resist the increasingly severe use of caffeine overnight.
One scientist found that the world’s first-rated universities are often unthinkable when talking about how to take care of their basic issues.
The program was designed by Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who believes it is the first in the United States of America.
After a speech about the effects of sleep insufficiency on learning, he was inspired to start studying the course.
“After the end of the speech, a girl came near to me and asked me, ‘Why did I all go to Big Four to understand this?’
She said no one told her how important sleep was, and that I was very surprised,” he told The Telegraph.
The course launched for the first time this year, the course mainly explains students how good sleep habits help in academic and exercise performance, as well as improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the Department of Health Services, said that Harvard University decided to launch the course this week after students found severe lack of sleep.
The course of up to an hour involves a range of interactive tasks.
In one session, a picture of the hostel showed students hit coffee cups, curtains, training books and books, listening to the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of lack of sleep on exercise performance, and the importance of pre-sleep activities.
In another section, students learn how long-term lack of sleep increases the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
On the classroom, a campus map was hanged on which interactive icons were drawn to encourage students to think about their daily activities.
“We know that this won’t change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just like you have the right to know smoking is harmful to health,” said Professor Zeisler.
He said there is still a phenomenon of pride in the “full power” and adding that the growing pressure of modern technology and students both means lack of sleep becomes an increasingly serious problem.
He said ensuring adequate sleep and good quality of sleep should be the “secret weapon” for students to respond to stress, fatigue and anxiety, even to avoid weight gain, because insufficient sleep makes the brain into a hunger pattern, making people feel hungry.
Raymond So, 19-year-old California, a professional in chemistry and physical biology, was his first year in Harvard University, when he attended a class by Professor Czeisler, helping Professor design the course.
He said that this course opened his eyes and encouraged him to make his best to build a campus course.
Next, his hope is to allow all graduates to complete similar study courses before joining competitive institutions.
Professor Czeisler suggests that students should consider setting up sleeping as well as wake up alarms, and pay attention to the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting devices, as this may lead to a person’s day and night rhythm disconnect, leading to difficulty sleeping.
Levinston 1-0 defeating the rocker: Manga's goal forced Gerald to leave behind
Due to Dolly Menga's goal that led Steven Gerrard to defeat the broken team by 1-0 against Winston, the rocker was lost again.
Ebrox had wanted to record the first guest victory since the 4-1 defeat St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team faced the second loss since Gerald's practice 18 matches, making his team behind eight minutes in a match against the LeBoo Super League leader Hertz.
Monga scored 7 minutes before the end of the first half of the game, with the team’s lack of atmosphere and seems to be hard to beat.
Now the routers have dropped to sixth place, while Levinston has risen to third, with the net winning number just behind the Hebrew.
The objects thrown at the end of the game resulted in injured front judge Calum Spence’s head, which could lead to further trouble for travelers.
Gerald changed eight times, Yoshua Elliott entered the semifinals of the Scotland League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt also selected the 11 Levinston players who took the Hertz one point last week, and he would be happy if these skilled teams could suppress the opponents in each round.
The router team may have already occupied the initiative, but Levinston is outstanding in controlling the ball.
They should have played the goal in two minutes, and Monga first transferred the ball to Scott Pittman over Allan McGregor to finish the goal, but the middle player missed a great chance.
Afterwards, Keaghan Jacobs's depth record willingly transfer the ball to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow was in the back column.
The rover teams actually have controlled the situation, but for a third of the final, they seem to have greater hope for themselves than their belief.
As the game took place at a moment, Alfredo Morelos had a collision with Steven Lawless, and Morelos was happy to think he would get the goal, but judge Steven Thomson rejected the claim of the Colombian player.
The router team entered only two goals in the first half, but former Ebrox gate manager Liam Kelly was hardly disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's headball and Ovie Ejaria's middle-range shooter.
While Lewinston’s 34-minute opening battle might not be favorable to the pace of the game, no one denies their hardness to deserve the result.
The wanderers once again deep into Jacob's carefully set offensive suite.
When Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield did not react, Alfredo calmly judged Manga would finish a simple shot.
Gerald replaced Ryan Kent with Curibali during the mid-field break, which was almost instantly effective, and the position of the frontman Morelos was vacant, but impressive Kelly stopped before jumping up on his defence line.
However, Levinston continued to attract fans' eyes in the way they enjoy, with Lizgo and Harcott performed one-to-one long transition.
Holt's team could probably draw the leading advantages in the final stage, but McGregor was well overwhelmed by Jacob's attack before Lisgo broke the ball from the corner.
The router team replacement team Glenn Middleton applied for gol again after a dispute with Jacob, but Thomson was missing again.
Annual Review: The Inventor of the Cover Meter
The following is the annual report of Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, which is 136 years ago, is the day that the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Gates developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually developed into a device called the “Gates Counter”.
Since then, the gauge counters have become the middle pillars of public culture, as in the 1950 film Colorado Clock, playing the proverb of cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who seemingly unlikely to become scientists:
Men, “What is this really a joke?”
Rogers: “It’s a coating meter used to locate radioactive minerals like magnesium.”
After wearing a headset, you can even hear the effects of the atoms released by radiation in the mineral.
Evans: “I have to cut down, it will be especially popular!”
"Hans Gogh died on his 63-day birthday in 1945.
But this invention named by his name will remain immortal.
New type of cancer vaccine can train the immune system to “detect” independent cells
New type of cancer vaccine can train the immune system to “detect” independent cells and kill them.
Vaccination training the immune system to identify independent cells, thereby used for treatment
This method requires the extract of immune cells from the patient's body, and then modify it in the laboratory.
This allows you to “detect” one of the common types of proteins of many cancers and then re-injects into the body.
A test vaccine was excellent in a variety of cancer patients.
After this training immune system to identify independent cells vaccine for the treatment of a woman, her ovarian cancer has gone for 18 months.
This method requires extracting immune cells from the patient’s body and then modifying them in the laboratory to allow them to “detect” a common protein called HER2 and then re-injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky at the US National Cancer Institute, Maryland, said: “Our test results show that we are coming to a very prospective vaccine.
Professor Berzofsky explains that HER2 “is a factor in promoting the development of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer.
Immun cells are extracted from the patient’s body and then “trained” them to locate cancer cells using similar methods that have been first seen in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West, who had previously been wearing MAGA hat to participate in SNL, is faced with complaints for supporting Trump.
The result is not good.
On Saturday Night Live, a public praise to US President Donald Trump and said he should participate in the turbulent discourse of the 2020 election, Kanye West was faced with a lie.
After performing the third song "Ghost Town" that night, wearing the hat of "Make America Great", he began to speak to the Republican party and reiterate his support for Trump.
“Many times I’ve talked with white people and they all say, ‘How would you like Trump, his racial discrimination?’
“So if I was concerned about racism, I would not have moved away from the United States a long time ago,” West said.
SNL starts with a funny short drama with Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star ridges the testimony given by Brad Kavanaugh in the Senate Justice Committee on sexual abuse charges made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Despite the show not being broadcasted, the video of West's screaming was uploaded on social media by comedian actor Chris Rock.
It is currently hard to determine whether Locke released the video was to blame West.
At the same time, West complained to the audience for having a hat and spent a difficult moment in the back.
According to the Washington Observatory Journal, he said: “They harassed me in the back.
They said, “Don’t take that hat out.”
They harass me!
Then they said I was in trouble.”
West continued to say, “Do you want to know what’s the problem?” he said, “Wear my superman shirt, because this means you won’t be able to command me how to do it.
Try to love.”
According to Variety, his commentary caused the audience lies at least twice, and the SNL artists seemed embarrassed, one of them told reporters: “The whole studio is falling into a deadly silence.
West was invited as the latest supporter of Ariana Grande, Grand's ex-boyfriend, saying singer Mac Miller died a few weeks ago.
West dressed in the Perrier Bottle, singing the song I love it, which annoyed many people.
Wester received the support of Candace Turner, head of TPUSA, and wrote on Twitter: “Thank you for the most fearless people: thank you for your courage to resist the terrorists.
But Karen Hunter, exhibition director, wrote on Twitter that Wester was just “dare to be herself, that’s just great.”
But I will not reward (buy his music, clothes or support his ‘art’) those who I think are accepting and spreading ideologies that are harmful to my community.
He is free.
We are too,” Hunt added.
Before the performance, the singer announced on Twitter that he changed his name and claimed he is now “officially becoming Kanye West.”
He was not the first artist who changed the name, but Diddy (also called Puff Daddy, Puffy or P Diddy) had also changed its name.
Speaking of the singer, Snoop Dogg had been named Snoop Lion and, of course, the dead musical talent Prince, he changed his name into a symbol, which was previously known as Prince.
At a restaurant in Belfast, he had a knife murder case.
On Friday, a restaurant in the East of Belfast had a knife injured case with a 45-year-old man who was accused of intentionally murder.
Police said the case was found at the Ballyhackamore restaurant.
The accused is expected to appear to court on Monday to receive an interrogation from the Belfast District Court.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
The Power Game Star Kit Harington attacked “toxic” men’s review
Kit Harington played Jon Snow in HBO's medieval drama series "The Game of Power" and is known to the public that he was a sworded hero in the drama.
The 31-year-old Kit has been strongly shocked on the phenomenon of the people’s impressions of his stick – a hard-held hero – and he said that such roles on the screen mean young people always feel that they need to act so cool to be respected.
Kit said in the Sunday Times’s cultural column he believed that there was a “problema” and abandoned a question of how to solve the “toxic” boys in the personality of #MeToo (only I) age.
Kit recently married Rose Leslie, the protagonist of the Power Game.Kit acknowledged that he had a “very strong” feeling of need to solve the problem.
"At this moment, I personally have a very strong feeling, where is the problem with our men's mentality?" he said.
“With this question we recognize now, what have we been teaching them as children grow up?”
Kit believes that the “toxic” boys are so popular that TV may be the main responsibility because the personality displayed on TV is very masculine.
He continued to introduce, “Who are born and what are learned later?”
What are showing on TV and on the streets that make these young people feel that they do not deserve to be men?
I think this is the most serious issue of our time, and how should we change it?
Young people have obvious problems.
In an interview he also acknowledged that this season’s Power Game will be killed in the summer of next year, after which he would no longer attend any prequel or continuation, calling himself “tired of the battlefield and the battle horses.”
From November, Kit will take part in the replay of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story between a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
Kit recently revealed that he felt his most happy thing to play in Power Game was to meet his wife Rose.
“I met my wife in this television show and therefore gave me the family after me, and the life now,” he said.
In Power Game, Rose plays the role of Kit, Jon Snow's lover, Ygritte. The Power Game won the Emmy Award for Best Comedy Series.
The couple had a wedding in the family camp in Leslie, Scotland in June 2018.
AIDS: Increased HIV cases in China by 14%
China has announced that the number of AIDS patients has increased by 14%.
The Chinese Guidelines Commission reports that there are more than 82,000 HIV-infected patients in China.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40,000 new patients were.
The vast majority of new infected people are transmitted through sexual behavior, which can be a historical change.
In the past, the main way to quickly spread AIDS in parts of China was the transmission of infected blood.
At a meeting held in Yuan province, the Chinese National Safety Authority said that the number of people infected by this way would be almost zero.
But at the same time, China’s HIV infected has increased by 100,000 people compared to last year.
For the LGBT population in China, HIV has become a serious problem.
In 1997, China legalized homosexuality, but the phenomenon of discrimination against the LGBT population is still widely used.
China’s values are relatively conservative, and research estimates that 70-90% of men have sex with men, and the final objects of marriage are women.
Many diseases are all due to the lack of sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to popularizing AIDS drugs to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denies the disclosure of Republican Senator's information, provoking "dangerous lies" and "conspiration theories"
On Saturday, U.S. Parliamentary Maxine Waters condemned the statement of disclosure of personal information of three Republican Senators of the House of Representatives on the Wikipedia page of the House of Representatives.
Maxine Waters (Los Angeles Democratic Party) said that the statement led to criticism of “extreme right” experts and website.
Waters said in a Twitter statement, “Liegs and lies are all humble lies.”
The information has been published included the US Senator Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and the family address and telephone number of Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch in Utah.
The information was published on the Internet on Thursday from the Congress Mountain, an unknown person attending a Senate group hearing held by the publisher of allegations of sexual behavior against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was disclosed to the three senators after Cavanos interrogated.
According to Hill, a report from conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState stated that the IP address of the information publishing device was linked to Waters’ offices and disclosed information from one of Waters’ employees.
Waters continued: “This statement is just absurd, complete falsehood, absolute falsehood.
“My staff is absolutely not the people who disclose this information, this claim is a liar of a liar but damages their identity, personal information and security.
This statement is simply absurd, complete lies, absolute lies.
Waters' statement soon brought criticism from internet users, including former White House news spokesman Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer writes: “The word of her denial is full of anger.
“This indicates that her anger is not suitable for a member of the Parliament.
To be accused by others and to be innocent, the most necessary thing is anger.
There is no one in the eye.
The motivation of the accused cannot be questioned.
Must be quietly squeezed.
Fleischer appears to compare Waters’ reactions to Democratic criticism of Cavano Judge, and the appearance of Cavano Judge on Thursday’s hearing, which was accused by critics seemed too angry.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro who intends to replace Waters in the middle-term election, also posted his opinion on Twitter.
He said on Twitter, “If it is true, you don’t have to exaggerate it.”
Waters said in a statement that her office had reminded “these claims are fraudulent to the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies.”
She continued: “We want to make sure the culpables are found and they are legally responsible for what they have done, which have a devastating impact on me and my employees.”
The East Mountains of the Robbie Agent 3 Reviews: Robin Eckinson Makes a Funny Spy Imagery Again
Current movies reflect some of the significance of the British Brexit and tend to the British position. The same is the English action comedy horror series "The SpongeBob Agent". The first episode "The SpongeBob Agent" appeared in 2003 and the second in 2011.
This joke ironic no new opportunity to export, ironic how unworthy we are?
Anyway, Johnny Englis, who was blinded and unable to express anything, was again licensed to make things confuse. His name was more expressive, precisely describing the creation of this well-known comedy character, which was aimed at non-English viewers.
Despite his unusual desire to dress an elegant lady, unusual appearance, and unable to get rid of the stupid image of the secret agent, he can see Cruise, beans, and the guy playing the 2012 London Olympic opening theme song, Chariots of Fire.
Originally he was still a tourist in Barclays TV ads and an international mysterious man, Ekin, who always made a bunch of strawberries, although these ads have been forgotten behind the mind.
In this “Bobby Agent” there are two points of highlight when England came out.
I liked Johnny English wearing medieval arms close to a helicopter when a rotating sheet hit on his helmet, giving a moment of a calling.
Edison’s action comedy talent is evident, but the sense of humor is fairly insufficient, strange, and strong, especially “serious” film brands such as 007 and Spy, which are now confidently integrated into the comedy components.
The objects of this sense of humor are more like children rather than adults.I personally think that compared to the joke that Erickson played in the noise movies, Johnny English's various strange outer events, creativity and cohesion was lacking.
Today, the theme of the year is mainly melodied with Britain falling into serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated into the UK’s super-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents, which hurt the brain as a ban agent – a small role played by Kevin Eldon.
The Prime Minister's role in the film appears overwhelmingly, problematic and politically uninterrupted: Emma Thompson does his best from the outside to show the characteristic of this role of Theresa May, but there is no word in the film.
Her intelligence advisor told her that all current spies have disclosed their identities, only to find a person from a retired agent to replace the job.
The only choice is the fool and fool Johnny English, who is now modified to serve as the director of a luxury institution, but he teaches in private how to become a bedroom agent: The package here is new, because England has opened a rock-campus-style spy school.
England is quickly taken back to the White House, attending a emergency conference and reunited with the old friend Bough, who has eaten a lot of pain, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bob is now a married man, his wife is a submarine commander, who is somewhat favourite role, played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, Batman and Robin, committed great mistakes at the Queen's Majesty's agency, returned, and later they met the Serpent, Ophelia Bulletova, in the role of Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the British Prime Minister is embarrassed under the captivating technological billionaire – Jack Lacy’s secret character, Jason Volta.
Engles and Bob started their funny adventure: they figured as a servant, burning a gorgeous French restaurant; making chaos suicide behavior on Volta's luxurious yachts; engles triggered pure anarchy when using virtual reality headsets familiar with Volta's home.
All the hangs were finally unlocked, so harmonious, so exciting, but in general, only remained on the level of the children's play.
The overall assessment is not equal.
Just like the other two films of Beans Agent, I’m not going to think about: Can the British film industry give Rowan Egginson one that deserves his role?
The Labour Party denies that the UK's wages do not reduce the "Four-Hour-Three" plan
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider implementing a radical plan for British workers to work four days a week, but wages will not be reduced.
The Labour Party is to expect companies to take advantage of the expenses saved by artificial intelligence (AI) to provide workers with more day-to-day rest.
In this way, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend at the same time, while their wages remain unchanged.
The idea was “compatible with the Working Party’s economic agenda” and the plan would tend toward British workers.
The implementation of the four-day working days program is supported by the British Union (TUC), so that workers can benefit from economic transformation.
A senior source of the Labour Party said Sunday Times: “The results of the policy review are expected to be published by the end of the year.
“This action is not possible at once, but the ‘Four-Hour-Three’ system of work meets the objective of the Labour Party’s inclination towards the interests of the workers and the entire industrial strategy of the Labour Party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support this idea, and the Green Party pledged to introduce a ‘Four-Hour-Three’ system during the 2017 general election.
However, the plan has not yet been supported by the entire Labour Party.
One of the Labour Party’s founders said: “The work system is not a political party’s policy, and the Labour Party has not yet taken into consideration.
Shadow Minister John McDonnell, at the Labour Party meeting last week, specifically presented his views on the Socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power from the hands of “non-disclosed directors” and “actors” in public business companies.
McDonnell’s plans also mean that existing shareholders of a water company may not be able to recover their entire shares, as the Labour government may be “discussed” on it by unethical behavior.
He also confirmed that he plans to support workers as the board of directors, creating “inclusive ownership funds” that would give 10% of private corporate shares to employees, so that employees could extract up to £500 annual shares from them.
Lyncy Graham and John Kennedy in the 60 Minutes show show whether the FBI’s investigation on Cavano could influence their decisions
The FBI investigates the accusations of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, forcing the final vote for the U.S. Supreme Court judge to be nominated for at least a week, while making people wondering whether the FBI’s research results would disrupt Republican Senator’s support for Brett Kavanaugh.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 minutes, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Parliamentary John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, the FBI, whether the results of their investigations would affect their decision.
Kennedy’s idea is more open than Graham (from South Carolina).
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said I would go to the hearing, and I said I’ve already talked to Cavano.
After the release of the accusations, I called him and asked, ‘Have you ever done it?’
He is very determined, very firm, very clear.
However, Graham’s vote seems to have already been buried on the board.
“For Brett Cavano’s vote, I’ve got a good idea and I’m not going to change my mind, even if it’s a blame of drug-fighting,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what the truth is, but I’m clear: Brett insisted that he didn’t do it,” added Graham.
“Everyone she says can’t verify what she says is true.
It was 36 years.
Can’t change anything.
What is the Global Citizen Music Festival and what contributes it to the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Music Festival, the Global Citizen Music Festival is an annual music festival with a very impressive star performance scene and the same impressive mission: eliminating world poverty.
This year, the 17th Global Citizen Music Festival will attract thousands of people to the Central Park’s big grass, while appreciating the performances of Jenny Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, while raising awareness of the true purpose of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
Established in 2012 as an extension of the Global Poverty Project, the Global Poverty Project is an international promotional organization aimed at eliminating poverty by increasing the number of populations actively fighting poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience must complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, calling, or by any other meaningful means to help people improve awareness of their goals to eliminate poverty.
But, if it’s only 12 years left to reach the goal, will Global Citizen really succeed?
Is it possible to persuade people to act using a free concert as a reward, or just another statement of the so-called "web-click activism" (people feel they are really doing by signing an online petition or posting tweets)?
Since 2011, Global Citizen said it has recorded more than 1,9 million “actions” from supporters to promote a wide range of objectives.
Global Citizen said these actions have helped promoting world leaders to publish more than $370 billion commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than 22,5 million people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the organization recognized 390 commitments and announcements in its actions, of which at least $10 billion have been paid or raised.
The organization is expected to have a direct impact on 6,49 billion people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between UK investors and implementers that is committed to “helping children to fulfill their growth potential,” and committed to funding $3.5 million to Rwanda to help eliminate the country’s malnutrition phenomenon after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
At a concert held in London in April 2018, the Power of Nutrition Ambassador, Tacey Ullman, said, “With the support of the UK government, donors, governments of countries and many global citizens like you, the social injustice is coming to become a foundation of history.”
The organization also said that after taking over 5,000 actions calling on the UK government to improve the nutritional condition of mothers and children, the government announced the establishment of the Power of Nutrition project, which will take nutritional interventions for five million women and children.
To answer a common question on the website, “Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded, “This will be a long and difficult way – sometimes we even fall and fail.”
But, like the great civil rights and anti-racial movement in front of us, we will succeed because we are united and we will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe will be performing guests to the music festival events held by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Secretary of State said the United States will “block” off the navy to block Russia’s energy exports.
According to the Washington Observatory Journal, US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke revealed that the navy could "if necessary" move to Washington to stop Russian energy shock on markets including the Middle East.
Zhang said Russia’s activities in Syria – especially on the invitation of the Syrian legitimate government – are just a motto of exploration of the new energy markets.
“I think the Russians are involved in the Middle East issue because they want to repeat their actions in Eastern Europe and serve as energy agents for the southern part of Europe.”
According to officials, there are several methods and means to solve this problem.
“The United States has the ability to, together with our navy, to ensure that maritime routes are smooth and can be blocked if necessary to ensure that Russia’s energy is unable to enter the market.”
Speaking at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, Zhejiang said the Consumer Energy Alliance is a non-profit organization that calls itself the United States “the spokesman of energy consumers”.
He compared the way Washington addresses Russia and Iran issues, pointing out that both are actually the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less using and replacing fuel,” he said Russia is a “black horse” economically dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement was due to the fact that the Trump administration has been committed to promoting liquid gas exports to Europe to replace the position of Russia that is cheaper for European consumers.
For this purpose, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project that, according to Trump, would make Berlin a "monopoly market" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 110 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is just a purely economic project aiming at doubling the existing pipeline capacity to 11 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington’s strong opposition to the project was entirely for economic reasons and that it was unfair competition.
In September, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow: “I believe we all recognize that energy cannot be a tool to put pressure and consumers should have the right to choose suppliers.”
The U.S. position was strongly opposed by Germany, and Germany has reaffirmed it would join the project.
The German Industry Federation (BDI) urged the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
The German Industry Federation (BDI) chairman Dieter Kempf said after a recent meeting with German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, “We will face serious problems if third countries interfere with our energy supply.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says it will be “seriously considering” 2020 presidential elections
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “seriously consider” the presidential election after midterm elections.
During his office in Hollywood City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider nomination.
Warren said, “It’s time to let women go to Washington’s politics from a broken government that we support, which requires a senior woman.”
“After November 6, I will seriously consider the presidential election.
When referring to President Donald Trump during his office in the City Hall, Warren said “he’s leading our country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about Donald Trump’s actions against democracy,” Warren said.
Warren speaks directly in the accusations against Trump and his nominated Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said “of course, we need the FBI to investigate before voting.”
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters believe she shouldn’t participate in the 2020 elections.
According to a poll of the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of the Massachusetts voters say that Senators shouldn’t be elected.
32% of voters support their election.
A poll showed that the majority of voters support the election of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38% of whom voters support his election and 48% opposed his election.
Other prominent candidates who may participate in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the United Nations agency, Biden said it will officially decide whether to be elected in January.
Sarah Palin accuses Track Palin, who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder in the presidential meeting
Track Palin, 26-year-old, entered the army in September and remained in Iraq for a year later.
On Monday night he was arrested and accused of committing domestic violence.
"My son's feelings, the feelings he experienced after returning, believe that other soldiers who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or injured soldiers' families can feel like the same," she told the audience at Donald Trump's meeting in Tallinn, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was “the elephant in the room” and said her son and other pensioners “have changed when they returned, and they wondered if they respected their homeland as well as the soldiers, pilots and all other members of the army.
According to the Washington Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett, he was arrested on Monday in Alaska and allegedly committed domestic violence and carrying arms against a woman after being drunk.
U.S. Challenge New Asylum Policy, Solidarity with 18 states and District of Columbia
18 U.S. states and District of Columbia support a new policy that refuses to provide shelter for victims of gangs or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives from 18 states and Columbia District submitted a court-friend report to Washington on Friday supporting an asylum seekers challenging the policy.
The American Civil Liberties Union has not yet revealed the full name of the prosecutor in the case against federal policy in August, Grace v. Sessions.
Grace said she was abused by her partner "and his son of a violent gang," but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace said countries such as El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are facing a common problem of gang and domestic violence, which has produced a large number of people who are seeking asylum in the United States.
The U.S. new asylum policy reverses the decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals in 2014 to allow illegal immigrants to seek asylum from domestic violence.
Colombian District Justice Minister Carl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “dismissed state, federal and international law for decades.”
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be ruled based on the specific facts and circumstances of the application, which violates the above principles,” the court’s friend said.
Lawyers further argued that the policy of refusing immigrants to enter the U.S. economy, which is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "providing the necessary labor force".
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to provide shelter for victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
On June 11th, Sessens declared that “those who are persecuted or feared to leave their country because of their race, religion, nationality or membership or political views of a social group can be granted asylum.”
Asylum is never to alleviate all the problems facing every day, even all serious issues.
As the number of deaths doubled, the desperate rescue officers in Peru struggled in a second to search for survivors.
For survivors, the situation is getting worse.
“Feel very nervous,” 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to calm her fevered son in a seriously damaged evacuation center in Balo.
The ambulance takes the bodies every minute.
Clean drinking water is very rare.
Inhabitants return to destroyed homes, carefully searching for objects infused by water, trying to rescue anything they could find.
This 7.5-degree earthquake caused hundreds of injured, hospitals were destroyed and flooded.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris, who was injured in the back and shoulders, rested outside of the Palus Army Hospital, and patients were forced to be treated outdoors due to severe trauma.
Remembering the intense shock when the 5th floor of the hotel’s house earthquake, which lived with his wife and daughter, Harry’s eyes were full of tears.
“We don’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I’ve been stuck in the ruins of the walls,” Harris told the United States Reporter, adding that the whole family was attending a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife crying for rescue, but there was no voice afterwards.
I don’t know how my wife and children are.
I hope they can be safe.
US Ambassador to China accuses China of "fraud" behavior in "political advertising"
A week ago, a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad on a U.S. Daily newspaper whom the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American media for political propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the Chinese Daily published a pay-up in the Demain Journal (the largest selling newspaper in the Iowa) accused China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections on November 6 and later denied the charges.
Trump accused Beijing of attempting to interfere in the U.S. elections, marking what U.S. officials said to Reuters has entered a new phase where Washington’s pressure on China is increasing.
Although foreign governments publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently under a growing trade war and have imposed several rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts said at the beginning of the trade war, China's revengeous tariffs were aimed at fighting Republican exporters that supported Trump in states such as Iowa.
The U.S. Ambassador to China, former long-term governor of Iowa, told the main exporter of China, Terry Branstad, that Beijing’s actions hurt U.S. workers, farmers and.
Bransstad wrote in a commentary on Sunday’s Demain Journal that China “has increased its strength of fraud by posting political propaganda advertisements on our own free media.”
“In terms of political propaganda, the Chinese government is using the US appreciated traditions of freedom of speech and freedom of press to publish paid ads in the DeMean Records,” Bransstad wrote.
“In contrast, you rarely see a voice of opposition in Beijing’s streets, and you can’t see a real reflection of the Chinese people’s different views on China’s worrying economic development track, because the media is under strict monitoring of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added, “The most famous Chinese newspaper even refused to publish his articles,” but he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts warned that Republican women's voters will lead to Cavano's defeat before the middle term.
For the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, multi-Republican leaders insist on support and defending it, analysts warned that in the upcoming middle-term elections they will face strong opposition, especially women's opposition.
The emotions caused by the incident were greatly increased, and the majority of Republicans recorded in the case had indicated that they wanted to get the vote to go down.
In an article published on Saturday, Professor Grant Reeher from the Maswell College of Snow City University told the Congress Hill, “these things cannot have a way back.”
Rail said he suspected Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona Republican) in an emergency closure to fight the FBI’s investigation would be sufficient to calm voters’ anger.
Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and state spokesman for Progress Organization MoveOn, said on Friday: “Women never forget what happened in the past – they cannot forget tomorrow, and the whole November cannot forget.”
According to MIC, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee still chose to continue to support Cavanos nomination, leading to a similar demonstration in the Senate hall on Friday morning, and protesters screaming “November is coming!”
Non-party political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news website that “the enthusiasm and the motivation of democracy are coming up.”
“People say the enthusiasm has increased; that’s true.
But the enthusiasm can be even higher, especially in suburban women and young voters (18-29 years old) who usually don’t vote when they don’t like the president.”
Before Ford’s open testimony detailed his allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidates, analysts had warned that it would cause strong opposition if the Republican continues to vote.
According to NBC News, former President of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said “this would bring a chaos to the GOP.”
Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, said to the news channel, “it’s not only about the vote of the committee or the final vote outcome, or whether it’s going to put Cavanos on a substitute, but also about how the Republicans deal with the issue and how they treat the victims.”
However, as Ford and Cavano’s testimony came out, the American people seem to have made some differences about who they should believe, a little more tending to the latter.
YouGov’s latest opinion survey showed that 41% of respondents clearly or likely believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35% of respondents said they clearly or likely believe in Cavan.
Furthermore, 38% of respondents said they thought Cavanos testimony might or must have lied, while only 30% said they thought they might or must have lied in Ford testimony.
According to the Guardian, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations submitted by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate’s Justice Board to prove Cavan had rape her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court candidates of exposing her genital organs naked during a party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventors Planned to Launch New Internet With Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Bernas-Lee is launching a start-up that is trying to compare with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest legendary technology project, Inrupt, is a company based on Bernas-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which information they allow to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Bernas-Lee joked that Inrupt’s intention was to “rule the world.”
Speaking of the start-up company, he said “We have to act immediately.”
“This is a historical moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology that allows users to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It can include contacts lists, attendance events, calendar, library and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, it can be used simultaneously on the same browser.
The unique feature of online personal data storage is that it is entirely determined by the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls this feature “performing personal authorization through data”.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt’s intention is to help companies introduce resources, processes and appropriate skills so that everyone can use Solid.
The company currently includes Bernas-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a number of full-time developers dedicated to the project, and a community of programmers volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will use tools available on Inrupt’s website to create their own decentralized applications.
Bernas-Lee said he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether to make a radical change if all their business models are completely reversed in one night.
“We are not getting their permission.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Bernas-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the quality and integrity of new networks based on Solid.
In 1994, Bernas-Lee founded the World Wide Web Alliance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which transformed the Internet.
In recent months, Bernas-Lee has become the central force of cyberneutral debate.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Bernas-Lee was the founder and chief of the World Wide Web Alliance, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I look at the next generation of networks very well,” Bernas-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemorating the Victorian Cross Medal Winner of the World War II
During the First World War, the only British church priest who took part in the operation won the Victoria Cross Medal, celebrated a ceremony every 100 years in their homeland.
Pastor Bernard Vann won a medal in the battle between Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
Unfortunately, four days later he was killed by a sniper, so nobody knew he had won the highest military honour in Britain.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were opened as a monument during a party march in Northampton district Rashden.
His grandchildren Michael Vann said the monument was a “brilliant symbol” to commemorate his grandfather’s medal for 100 years.
According to the London Publication, on September 29, 1918, General Vann led the army, “in the rain of firefighters and rifles” across the Canal de Saint-Quentin.
He then moved to the front line, “heroically” leading the front-line fighters, and then shot with a single-hand fighter rifle, withdrawing three small divisions.
On October 4, 1918, more than a month before the end of the war, Colt Vann was shot by a German sniper.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann assessed his grandfather's behavior as "I understand that grandfather's heroicness I'll never be compared to it, but will make me feel humble."
The leadership of the march was the Brentwood Empire Youth Band. After the march ended, Michael Vann and his brother Dr. James Vann gave a flower circle.
Michael Vann said he was “very honourful to participate in the demonstration,” and later added “a real hero can see what their heroicness is from the support of people.”
MMA fans's full-night waiting show Bellator 206 turned into Little Pig Pitch
Imagine that you’re not sleeping all night waiting for a Bellator 206 game, but at the end you’re told that you can’t watch the main game.
There are 13 matches in San Jose, including 6 main matches. The UK’s 5th channel live broadcasts throughout the night.
At 6 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were prepared for the match, the channel was changed to Little Pig Pitch, which was greatly shocked by the British audience.
Some people are not sleeping and wait until the morning, especially to watch the boxing game, but fall in the glasses.
On Twitter, a fan said transforming the show into an animated film was simply a “drawing appetite joke.”
Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication at Bellator, said, “The government has regulated that such programs should not be broadcast at 6 a.m., so the TV was forced to be replaced by children’s shows.”
“Little Pig Pitch”
Bellator’s president Scott Coker said that the future arrangements will try to include the British audience as much as possible.
“I think we can solve this problem when we consider replaying,” Coker said.
“But it was 6 in the UK Sunday morning, but we could only wait for Sunday on our side to broadcast again, then it was Monday in the UK.”
However, we are still looking for a solution.
Believe me, after the program changed, I received a lot of information, and all of them are unfriendly.
We also thought it was a technical failure.
But not, it is a matter of government control.
I can assure you that this will not happen next time.
We were going to control five games instead of six, usually we were all playing five games, and we wanted to make fans enjoy more, but it was too long.
The situation is somewhat embarrassed.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley is self-sufficient for sexual orientation
Olympic swimming pool Tom Daley said he felt selfish since childhood because of his sexual orientation, but that also became his motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old boy said that after he went to high school, he discovered that “not everyone is like me.”
In the Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne’s broadcast 4 channel, he said he talked about homosexual rights to give others hope.
He also stated that after having a child, he had little to do with the issue of getting an Olympic champion.
The regular host of this program, Kirsty Young, has been resting for several months.
As a host at Laverne’s first show, Daley said he feels “lower than others” during his growth because “social does not accept the relationship between boys and girls of the same sex.”
He said, “Until today, I’ll still feel very accurately, low people, feel different, but this also gave me the strength to succeed.
He said he wanted to prove that he was “working” so that people don’t disappoint anyone when they know their sexual orientation.
Daley has won two Olympic gold medals and now becomes an attractive LGBT activist and appeared at the Australian British Federation of this year, calling on more countries to legalize homosexuality.
He said he dared to speak because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without any consequences, and he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said he met American film producer Dustin Lance Black in 2013 when he found himself in love with this man.
Last year, Daley married his 20-year-old Oscar winner, saying the age gap was never a problem.
Daley took part in the Olympic Games for the first time at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer, he said: “It was so young that it was hard to find people with similar life.”
The couple had their own son in June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
“If you asked me last year, I would say ‘I have to win a gold medal,’ he said.
“But you know there is something more important than the Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
He took his son a same name as his father Robert, commemorating his father who died from brain cancer in 2011.
Daley said his father didn’t believe he would die, and his last question was whether there were tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit on the front line.
“I can’t say to him, ‘Daddy, you can’t sit in front line,’ he said.
“When he stopped breathing, I was holding his hand, in fact, until he stopped breathing and was dead, I admitted he would never fall,” he said.
In the second year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a copper medal.
“I just knew that this was what I dreamed of all my life, swimming in front of the home audience during the Olympic Games, and there was no better feeling than that,” he said.
Just because of this, Proud by Heather Small became his favourite song, he fell in love with the song during the preparation for the Olympic Games, and now he's going to be one of them.
Desert Island Discs' broadcast time is Sunday 11:15 (BST), broadcasting channel for BBC Radio 4 channel.
Mickelson was replaced on the Leeds Cup on Saturday.
American player Phil Mickelson will set a record in his 47th Lady Cup match on Sunday, but he must adjust his status to avoid playing negative milestones.
Michelson, who participated in this two-year event for the 12th time, was replaced by Captain Jim Furyk during Saturday's four-and-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-t
This five-fold winner not only did not become the middle-power of the competition as in the United States, but spent a day on the Lara team and training field hoping to fix his problems back to the field as soon as possible.
Even at the peak of his career, with the most straight golf course in his hands, the tensioned French national golf course is not suitable for this 48-year-old player, where high-low routes will make it difficult to shoot off the track.
If the stadium itself is not prestigious enough, Mickelson will be able to win all the victories of this week’s match against the exact British Golf Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, and Francesco Morinari joined with newbie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the U.S. team start 12 single matches with a quarter loss, then the match of Michelson will be crucial to make a good start.
Forrick has confidence in his team, but he has nothing to say except that.
"He fully understands the role he plays today, shot my back and holds me with his arms and told me he'll be ready tomorrow," Furyck said.
“He is very confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Famer and has made a huge contribution to the team in the past, and this week.
I couldn’t expect him to play two games.
I want him to play more games, but that’s the result and I have to accept it.
Like everyone else, he wants to be very special in the competition.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break the most record in the Ride Cup matches created by Nick Faldo.
This may mark the end of the Lady Cup career, and his personal record has never reached that high.
Mickelson achieved a score of 18 victory 20 negative 7 points, despite Forrick said his appearance brought some invisible strength to the team.
"He's funny, acute, harmonious, loves to laugh on others, and he's a good person in the team," he explained.
“I think young players like playing him, and this will be fun this week.
In addition to the competition, he has given us a lot.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn realizes that the situation in the leadership of the big portion is about to be broken.
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn, according to experience, is easy to generate a disadvantaged situation to enter the single final of the Leading Cup with a large advantage.
Dean appeared for the first time in the game at Valderrama in 1997, when Seve Ballesteros was a captain in front of the American team with a five-point advantage, but at the end only 141⁄2-131⁄2 with a very weak advantage.
After watching the two 2018 matches held on Friday and yesterday at Le Golf National, respectively, 5-3 victories, eventually leading up with 10-6 points, Bill John described: “You should remind yourself of that we had been leading in Valderrama and Brooklyn with great proportions; although we lost in Brooklyn, we won the victories in Valderrama.”
History will tell me and every team that everything is not over.
You must do everything before tomorrow comes.
Go out and do the right thing.
It's not all over until the score comes to the score list.
Our goal is to try to win the prize, and that is also the focus of our attention.
I’ve always been saying I’m interested in our team’s 12 players, but we’re very clear what we’re going to face – the strongest players in the world.”
Bee John was satisfied with the hard match of the players on the golf course, he added: “I can never win myself in this regard.
Tomorrow is another wicked war.
Tomorrow is a self-sufficient personal performance, somewhat different from usual.
If the competition progresses well, and the counterparts fighting alongside it would be a great thing, but if the solitary fights, as a golf player, the test will be your overall ability.
This is the information you need to make the team understand and make the fullest possible of your personal ability tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, and your partner also have to leave you, each of them to fulfill their capacities.
Unlike John, the opposite Jim Furyk expects the team's personal performance to overcome the team's performance, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took a third in the quarter.
As the European team struggles to accomplish the "Miracle at Medinah" with a failure, as a member of the Brooklyn winner team, Forrick has already stood on both ends of the final turnpoint and victory is possible.
When asked how Ben Crenshaw (1999's temporary captain) inspired the teams to welcome the final, he replied, "I remember every damn word."
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you can imagine the first one in Valderrama and Brooklyn.
If everyone goes in the same direction, it will be a lot of pressure on the middle of the game.
“So our front has made corresponding adjustments to appear in a way that is favorable to us, and everyone knows we are struggling to create a miracle tomorrow.
Thomas is responsible for leadership of the team’s reaction, and he will fight against Rory McIlroy in the final, and in the semi-finals with European players such as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
Speaking of the single game, B. John said, “I have deployed players in such a order, it is a decision taken after all-considered.”
New German war vessels are delayed again.
According to local media, German Navy’s latest guard vessels were expected to be inspected in 2014 to replace the old war vessels during the Cold War, but due to system failures and increased cost-rolled snowballs, we could not see the appearance of the guard vessels until next year.
According to The Zeit newspaper, a spokesman of the military said that the investigation of the new Baden-Württemberg-grade guard vessel, "Leanland-Puffaltz", is currently postponed to the first half of 2019.
The shipping was supposed to serve the Navy in 2014, but the painful after-production problem consistently disturbed the fate of this massive project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-grade guard vessels returned from the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Baden-Württemberg-grade guard vessels.
It is known that the ships will have powerful fire power, a large number of anti-air and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisible technologies such as radar reduction, infrared and audio signals.
Other important features also include longer maintenance cycles – which can be deployed for up to two years away from the motherland port.
However, continuous delays mean the most advanced battle vessels — allegedly allow Germany to deploy forces abroad — will be obsolete when it was put into use.
Earlier last year, when the German Navy officially refused to appeal to the guard vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg, the famous F125 guard vessel became a news center.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilding plant after delivery.
The outside world is little known about the reason for the return, but German media cited some key “software and hardware defects” saying these defects would make war vessels useless when performing operational missions.
Since the Baden-Württemberg-grade guard vessels will be managed by 120 crew, only half of the human resources of the old Baden-Württemberg-grade guard vessels will require, software defects will be especially fatal.
Similarly, it was revealed that the guard ship was seriously overweight, which would reduce its performance and restrict the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
It is said that the 7,000-ton-weight "Leanland-Puffaltz" weighs twice as much as the equivalent guard vessel used during the Second World War.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the entire project - including the training of crew - also became a headache problem.
The expenses are said to have reached astonishingly €1.3 billion ($3.6 billion), while the initial budget was only €2.2 billion.
Given recent warnings about German naval forces are underwatering, the problems with the latest guard vessels are becoming more serious.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the German Navy actually "no more ships that can be deployed."
The official said that over time, the problem is increasing and the old vessels are gradually removed from service, but there is no new vessels that can be replaced.
He regreted that there was no Baden-Württemberg-class guard vessel that could serve the Navy.
National Trust Listening to the Secret Life of the Butterflies
A new study is being carried out on a farm in Scotland to reveal how butterflies use the land to eat.
Research hopes that this discovery will reveal the behavioral faces of this unique flying mammals and help guide future protective activities.
The study conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will track common wings and high-voltage wings in Wester Ross’s Inverewe Gardens, as well as brown long ears and Daubenton wings.
They will install special recorders in some key locations around the garden to track the activities of the bats for four seasons a year.
NHS staff and volunteers will conduct fluid investigations using handheld detectors.
Then professional sound analysis of all recordings to determine the frequency of the bathtub screaming and what kind of activity the bathtub is performing.
Then create habitat maps and reports to generate detailed real-world images on the behavior of the butterflies.
The NHS’ natural conservation counselor, Rob Dewar, hopes that the research will reveal what habitat is crucial for butterflies and how each butterflies use these habitats.
This information will help judge the interests of habitat management work, such as the plantation of grasslands and how the best preservation of the forest for the survival of butterflies and other related species.
But since the last century, the number of butterflies in Scotland and the UK has decreased dramatically.
Construction and development work pose a huge threat to butterflies, affecting their habitat and even causing them to lose their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting, the chemical processing of mosquito papers and some building materials, as well as the attacks of pet cats, pose a risk to the bats.
But cats are actually seen.
However, due to night hunting habits, their ears are more useful when catching the hunter than the eyes.
They are able to accurately identify small insects and obstacles in the flight trails using complex rear positioning technologies.
The NTS, responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historical buildings in Scotland, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, is very serious.
The NTS has ten cent-war experts who regularly investigate, inspect habitat, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only dedicated butterflies protected area in Threave, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight species of butterflies in Scotland.
David Thompson, farm manager, said the farm is an ideal land for butterflies.
“At Threave Farm, we built an area dedicated to butterflies,” Thompson said.
“There are old buildings, old trees, and all the wonderful habitat.
But there is still a lot of unknown knowledge about the butterflies, so the work we do here and in other fields will help us understand more how the butterflies grow stronger.
Thompson stressed that it should be necessary to check the situation of the butterflies before undergoing the farm maintenance, as if an unknown damaged habitat of a female butterflies could lead to the death of up to 400 female butterflies and butterflies, resulting in the total extinction of local species.
Bats are protected and catching, attacking, harassing, or destroying their habitat is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to contribute to their strength.
She said: “We have a lot of knowledge to know about the bats and many other species of which we don’t know about their species.
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and lawyers are prepared to prosecute German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo, who was awarded a “fake news” for the bad name of facing allegations of rape, said people wanted to use him to “drive himself.”
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German news magazine Mirror Weekly, which has published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus leader was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga in a 2009 room at a hotel in Las Vegas.
According to the Mirror Weekly on Friday, Ronaldo was accused of paying $375,000 to the woman after he was charged with the incident.
A few hours after the allegations were exposed, 33-year-old Ronaldo posted a live video on Instagram to 1.4 billion followers accused the reports of "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no, no and no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
What they are saying today is fake news,” the five Golden Ball winner said in front of the video.
“They just want to use my name for themselves.
This is very normal.
They want to make me famous, but that’s also part of their work.
I’m a happy person and good in every aspect,” Ronaldo added, laughing.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers were prepared to prosecute the allegations by the Mirror Weekly, calling his “unlicensed reports suspected violations of personal privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would ask for compensation “a amount of mental damage that corresponds to the severity of the violation of behavior, which may be the most severe case of human rights violations in recent years.”
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents from the Clark County Court, Nevada, Ronaldo and Maorga, after meeting in a night shop, they were to return to the player’s room where rape occurred.
Maorga said Ronaldo knees to her after allegedly occurred that he was “99%” when he was “a gentleman” and now pulled up by the “1%”.
The document indicates that Ronaldo acknowledged having sex, but both of them were voluntarily.
Maorga also said she went to the police station and took photos of her injured in the hospital, but later agreed to reconciliation outside the court because she was "afraid of revenge" and feared "public shame."
The 34-year-old Maorga said she is currently seeking for reconciliation outside the court because of the alleged incidents.
When the case allegedly occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer Ronaldo had joined the Italian Premier League for a bill fee of €100 million.
Brexit: Britain's loss of car manufacturers "to be its eternal regret"
Britain’s trade minister Greg Clark said the loss of its global leader in the automobile industry after the Brexit would “be her eternal regret.”
He added that the UK’s Toyota factory told BBC that if the UK withdrawals from the EU without an agreement, Toyota would temporarily stop production of the Bernston factory near Debbie.
“We need an agreement,” Mr. Clarke said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the UK would leave the EU without an agreement, and border delays could lead to decreasing employment opportunities.
The Bernstein factory is responsible for manufacturing Toyota's Auris and Avensis, which manufactured 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which exported to other EU countries.
“My opinion is that if the UK withdrawals from the EU at the end of March, our factory will stop production,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of the Bernstein Factory, Toyota.
Other British automotive manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Chiang Mai, also said concerns about what would arise if there was no agreement on cross-border trade operations after the UK's Brexit.
For example, BMW said it will close a mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Britain’s Brexit.
The main concerns of automotive manufacturers are to leave the EU without an agreement, and there is a potential risk of supply chain.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “temporary basis” and receives car orders from UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK withdrawals from the EU without an agreement on March 29, the UK border could have a problem with interruption, industry officials said it could lead to delays and shortage of parts.
The company said Toyota’s factory in Dubai district cannot hold stocks for more than one day, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clarke said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was “accurately verified and could avoid border controls.”
“We want to reach the most successful agreement, both to the current success and to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers indicates that we need absolute capacity to continue to promote a range of significant supply chains.
Toyota has not stated how long it will stop production, but in the long run, cost growth will weaken the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately affect employment opportunities.
Peter Bouvallaris has been working at the Burnstone factory for 24 years and is currently a joint collector of the factory, he said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, I can’t return once I lost these jobs.”
A government spokesman said: “We have prepared accurate and reliable plans for future relations with the EU.
The White House says Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again.
The White House said on Sunday that due to the wind of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavano, Trump’s top meetings with Deputy Justice Secretary Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed a week.”
Rosenstein is responsible for supervising the work of Special Advisor Robert Mueller, whereas the Trump’s election team is accused of private communications in Russia and the president’s investigations that could interfere with judicial justice.
Whether Trump would dismiss the Deputy Minister of Justice and thus threatening Mueller's independence, Washington has been debating about it for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times that Rosenstein had discussed wearing hearing record conversations with Trump, and whether it was possible to dismiss the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House in the report of his coming resignation.
On Thursday, there were reports that he had a meeting with Trump at the time in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he was "willed" not to dismiss Rosenstein but later delayed the meeting to avoid conflicts with the Senate Justice Commission hearing, where Cavano and a woman accused of her sexual behavior, Dr. Christina Brasy Ford, will present witness to the hearing.
On Friday, Trump ordered the Federal Investigation Agency to conduct a week-long investigation of Cavano and delay the Senate’s full vote.
Trump's news secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "Given all the other things that the Supreme Court is doing, it may be delayed a week and the specific date is not yet determined, I think maybe this week.
But we will see this day, and I will tell the media about progress at any time.
Some news conferences have rejected this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asks why.
Sanders said the absence of a press conference was not because he hated TV reporter's "people's favour", although she said: "I'm not going to object to reports of their people's favour."
She later said it would increase direct contact between Trump and the media.
“President Trump’s questions are more scary than any other president ever, but she did not refer to any evidence that we’ve studied these figures.
Sanders said a press conference would still be held, but if the media had the opportunity to ask questions directly to the U.S. president, it would be much better than talking to me.
We have been trying to organize as many questions as possible and have been organized several times in the past weeks, and a press conference can be canceled when people can speak directly with the President of the United States.
Trump often set questions when he leaves the White House or participates in an open meeting or press conference with the visitors.
There are very few press conferences held separately.
This week in New York, the president may have explained us the reason behind this, appearing without hesitation in front of journalists gathered and sometimes even appearing strange.
Health Minister sends a letter to EU staff of Scotland’s National Health Service System (NHS) concerns about Britain’s Brexit
The Minister of Health sent the EU staff of the Scottish National Health Service System (NHS) to express their gratitude to the country and hopes they continue to stay in Scotland after the UK’s Brexit.
Jeane Freeman from the Medical Services Program (MSP) sent a letter six months before the UK withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has pledged to pay for settlement applications for EU citizens working in the public service sector that it transferred.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Negotiations between the UK and the EU on a Brexit have continued throughout the summer, and it is hoped to be made a decision this autumn.”
However, the British government is also preparing for a possible no-deal situation.
I know that this time is really annoying for you.
Therefore, I want to reaffirm how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of your nationality.
The valuable experience and skills provided by our colleagues within the EU and beyond will strengthen and improve our healthcare work to benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland will always be your home and we hope you can stay here.
Christion Abercrombie under an emergency surgery after headache injury
Mike Organ, Tennessee State Tigers that the Tennessee State Tigers had defeated Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday 31-27 at the time of the match, where the Tiger Defender Christian Abercrombie was injured in the head and subsequently undergoed an emergency surgery.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State University, told reporters that Abcronby was injured shortly before the end of the half.
“He ran to the edge and suddenly fell,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abkron Bee lost oxygen along the line, and then lifted him up on the shelf and brought him back for further evaluation.
An official of the Tennessee State University's Tiger Team told Chris Harris of Nashville WSMV News, Tennessee that Abkronby had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added, “the type/degree of the injury is not yet determined,” while Tennessee State University’s Tiger team is trying to figure out the specific time of the injury.
Abu Dhabi was a second-degree red shirt player student in the University of Tennessee, which was his first season after he moved to school from Illinois.
In Saturday's match, he completed a total of five goals before leaving the game, increasing his season's total score to 18 times.
Higher print taxes on foreign buyers who buy apartments in the UK
According to the newly launched Conservative Party plan, the UK will pay a tax on foreign buyers who buy real estate in the UK, which will be used to help address homeless issues.
This will compensate Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters.
Additional tax is intended for people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to fund £1.2 million annually to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged with higher print taxes when they buy properties in the UK, and the added income taxes will be used to help homeless people.
The initiative also promises to provide more economic appliances to lock high-income populations, which is also considered to compensate for Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters.
Additional taxes are aimed at individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional funds will be used to improve the government’s solution to accommodation issues.
In addition to the current printing tax, including the second suite of housing and housing purchased two years ago, the additional fee may be up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to invest £1.2 million annually.
It is estimated that 13% of new-built London real estate buyers are non-UK residents, which increased prices, making the first buyer's way to buy a house difficult.
Many of the rich regions of Britain, especially London, have become a ghost city because a large number of foreign buyers are not in the UK most of the time.
Just before the new policy was launched, Boris Johnson called for a reduction of printing taxes to allow more young people to buy the first set of properties.
He accused large buildings ofining high levels of housing prices by purchasing land rather than using land, and urged Mrs. May to give up the quota of the economic-applicable houses to address Britain's "housing shame".
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of housing reform proposals with many eyes, including rental controls and ending “flawless” movements.
He also hopes to give Parliament more power to build new houses.
Mrs. May said last year I was going to restore British dreams during my office of prime minister and make every new generation life better.
This means repair the broken housing market.
The UK will always welcome those who want to live, work and build a family here.
However, it is wrong for individuals who are not in the UK and foreign companies to deal with working British residents in the difficulty of buying apartments.
For too many people, the dream of having a house is too far away, and the insult of the accommodation is still very real.
Jack Ross: “My final ideal was to be a Scottish coach.”
Sandland’s head coach Jack Ross said his “final ideal” was to be a Scottish head coach one day.
The 42-year-old Scotch, who manages to revive the north-east team, is currently ranked in the league three points behind the first.
After leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish League last season, this summer he returned to the Stadium of Light.
“I want to act for my homeland as a player.
I got a top B hat, and that’s what’s going on,” Ross told the BBC’s Sportsound show.
“I grew up watching Scotland’s games, and when I was a child, I’ll always remember that day.
But only I have succeeded in the team, I have such a chance.
Before Ross, he had served as Sandland's chief coach including Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic said there were so many famous characters in such a big club that he had not feared before he had rejected the invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“My success now depends on “Can I lead the team back to England?”
Due to the structure and facilities of the team, it will surely be able to hit the super,” he said.
“It’s not easy, but I only lead the team back to England and I might think I’m successful.
After all, his bishop career was just beginning for three years.Rose spent a while as a assistant coach in Denbaton and worked for 15 months at the Red Heart team.
He later led Aalo from the down to the third stage team, and in the next season, he led the San Milan’s transition from the downward edge to the general champion.
Ross said he feels more comfortable now than his previous career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Miller and Hamilton Academical teams.
Reminding his experience in the Arola team, he said: “This might be a real crossroads.”
I really think I’m more suitable to be a coach than playing football.
This sounds strange, because I performed well, there is no problem with this life, and there is a lot of fun.
But playing football is sometimes difficult.
There is a lot to do every week.
I still feel stressed to play, but as a coach, I feel good.
“I’ve always wanted to be a coach, and now I’ve done it, it’s the most comfortable day I’ve felt since adult.
You can listen to the full interview with Sport Voice on Radio Scotland from September 30 (Sunday) at 12:00 to 13:00 in the UK summertime.
Research found that Saturday at 5:30 p.m., it is best suitable for a cup of clean drinking water.
The cold heat of the summer, British hard-fighted bars reckoning, the chain of restaurants weighs pressure.
Data show that bar sales rose 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenue dropped 4.8%.
Peter Martin, business consulting company CGA, said: “The warmth of the day, and the time of England’s World Cup was beyond expected, making July repeat June’s coverage (2.8% in the bar revenue during June), and the restaurant was suffered a stronger shock.
In June, restaurant transactions dropped by 1.8%, while in July, it was greater.
The bars where alcoholic beverages are mainly performed best, and in comparison, the trade volume of the restaurant continues to decline.
The bars that mainly served meals were also affected by cold heat, although the impact was relatively small compared to restaurant operators.
People seem to just think about drinking outside.
The whole bar industry has increased 6.6 percent of wine sales this month, and food sales dropped by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, recreational and hospitality analyst, said: “This trend has been continued since the end of April.
Among the main factors affecting sales in foreign consumer markets, the biggest factors are weather, as well as important social activities or sports events.
It is not surprising that the continuous hardness of the food industry is struggling, compared to a drop in sales with 4.8%, more headache is the continuous increased cost pressure.
For food-driven operators, the effects of a long warm summer can be called sunshine, and the time will tell us if the weather in August is appropriate to give the necessary breathing time.
The entire bar and restaurant industry (including newly opened bars and restaurants) has increased sales by 2.7% in July, which is seen by slowing the speed of brand promotion.
The British bar and restaurant industry monitoring agency Coffer Peach Tracker collected and analyzed performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than £9 billion, establishing the industry’s index.
One-fifth minors hid their parents and secretly use social media.
Survey shows that one-fifth minors (below 11 years old) hid their parents and teachers and secretly use social media.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed increased use of “Fake Insta” pages
This news raises concerns about publication of pornographic content.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “major” account to deal with parents.
One fifth of minors (below 11 years old) hides adults using social media.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed that the use of "Fake Insta" accounts (referred to an image sharing site Instagram) has grown rapidly.
The news raised concerns about publication of pornographic content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “clean” main account used to deal with parents and other secret accounts.
A mother accidentally found a 13-year-old daughter's secret website, and she found a teenager encouraging others to "rape me".
The survey, jointly launched by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference, found that 40% of 11-18-year-old minors have two accounts simultaneously, half of which have a secret account.
Mike Buchanan, HMC’s chief executive, said: “There are so many teenagers who create a web space and hide in it, and both parents and teachers are not aware of it, that’s really disturbing.”
Eilidh Doyle will join the Scottish Field Commission as the "sperson of the athletes"
Ilidh Doyle was elected as non-executive director of the Scottish Field Committee at the annual general meeting of government agencies.
Dore is Scotland's most award-winning field athlete, and committee chairman Ian Beattie said the event was a great opportunity for field coaches to get a rich experience on the international level.
“Eric has a reputation in Scotland, UK and the world’s sports sector, and we believe that if he joins the committee, Scotland’s sports will be greatly benefited,” Betty said.
Dore said: “I’m happy to be a spokesman for athletes and I hope I can make a real contribution to the sports career in Scotland and help provide guidance.
The American athlete has earned four Olympic gold medals, including 200 and 400 meters gold medals at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and is currently a long-invited commentator for the British Broadcasting Company (BBC), who is unable to walk after he suffered a temporary anemia attack.
He wrote on Twitter: Today, a month ago, I had an stroke.
Unable to walk.
The doctor says whether I can recover and how much I can recover depends entirely on time.
Fully recovering and re-learning walking is a difficult task, but now I have been able to complete speed training!
Thank you for your encouragement!”
Smoking advertising makes mothers compare to cows
A advertisement published by a breastfeeding company suggests breastfeeding mothers than a breastfeeding cow, which triggered distinctions among internet users.
At the launch of the new product “the world’s first noise wearable milk absorber,” consumer technology company Elvie released a harmonious music video inspired ad that shows the freedom that this new milk absorber brings to the mother.
Four real mothers dance with music in a dried cattle, and some of the songs in the music are: “Yes, I feeding myself, but you can’t see the tail,” “Haven’t found my grandmother, actually my chest?”
The next song was: “Take it out, take it out, feed my baby, take it out, take it out, grandmother, my little princess.”
However, this advertisement has caused controversy on the internet after its publication on the company’s Facebook page.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times, with hundreds of comments, and the audience’s reactions vary, and many people think that it is suspected of dishonoring the dairy industry’s “horror”.
“The decision to promote this product with cows is too wrong.
Cows, like us, need pregnant birth to have milk, but the difference is that the baby of the cows will be stolen a few days after the birth,” a webmaster wrote.
Elvie breastfeeding can be placed in the breastfeeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another Twitter commented: “This is no doubt a trauma for both mothers and babies.”
“Why do you want to see a mother in the smoking advertising compared to a city cow, and mother doesn’t want the child to leave herself?”
Another Twitter adds: “This advertisement is not very real.
Others thought the advertising was good, and a lady admitted that she found the song "crying".
“I think this idea is especially new.
If I still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
The process of breastfeeding makes me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit overhead, but I think it's okay.
This product is very new, according to a webwriter.
Another webmaster commented that this funny advertising was aimed at having milk (usually in the company or in the toilet) to feel like a “cow.”
It is not intended to praise or judge the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of mothers showed themselves when they were dancing, and actually wearing a milk in the chest.
This post-advertising creativity comes from many women calling themselves as a cow when breastfeeding.
However, the Elvie adoptor is completely silent, without a cable or pipeline, can be perfectly placed inside the breast, allowing women to release their hands, hold the baby, and even continue to breastfeed when they are out.
Mother’s partner and CEO of Creative (ECD) Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product worth trying.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers and cows, we want to put the process of breastfeeding and their problems under a polypropylene light, while showing that this new type of breastfeeding can give people an unparalleled sense of freedom in an interesting and connected way.
This is not the first time the Elvie Smokers’ news on top.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children went on the T table in a dress designed by designer Marta Jakubowski when she was wearing the product.
Hundreds of flying children are quietly moved to a camp on the border of Texas.
Although the policy on the border front is relatively unchanged every month, the number of mobility children detained is still growing dramatically, partly due to the implementation of the Trump administration’s strict speech and policies that increased the difficulties for sponsors to settle children.
The legend is that most sponsors themselves are illegal immigrants, and they are afraid to stand up and adopt children would threaten their possibility of staying in the United States.
In June, the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members had to submit fingerprints and the authorities would share their fingerprints with the Immigration Office, leading to a significant increase in the risk.
Last week, senior official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence, confirmed in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor children without adults.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested persons have no criminal proceedings.
“Nearly 80% of individuals who are sponsors or members of the sponsors’ family are illegal entering, most of them transnational criminals.
That’s why we are constantly chasing these people,” Albert said.
In order to solve the problems of these children as soon as possible, officials have introduced new regulations that require some of them to come to court within a month of detention (not 60 days later).
Many children won’t go to court personally, instead, they will appear in the form of a video telephone conference to advocate immigration judges about their legitimate identity.
Children who are deemed not qualified for rescue will be quickly deported.
Asylum staff and the system’s reports in recent months, the longer children are detained, the more likely they become anxious or depressed, leading to violence or attempts to escape.
Defence lawyers said the concern is more severe in large facilities such as Tornillo, because such places are too large and easy to ignore signs of children's rebellion.
They added that when children don’t have enough time to be emotionally prepared, not enough time and friends’ goodbye, transferring children to the tent city could aggravate the trauma that many children have already suffered.
Syria orders US, France and Turkey's "occupation forces" to immediately evacuate
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, a speech at the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home as soon as possible, despite the Syrian war has lasted for eight years.
The Syrian vicepremier Moalim said foreign troops illegally enter Syrian territory as an excuse to combat terrorism "will be treated accordingly."
“They must be immediately unconditionally evacuated,” Mohammad told the United Nations General Assembly.
Mohammed insisted on Syria’s “war against terrorism is coming to end,” which has caused more than 360,000 deaths since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said Damascus will continue to “fight this sacrifice battle until we clean all terrorist organizations in Syria” and “all illegal foreign forces”.
More than 2,000 US soldiers are located in Syria, primarily responsible for providing training and counseling to the Kurdish forces against President Bashar al-Assad and Syrian Arabs.
More than 1,000 French soldiers are located in the country in this war.
With regard to refugee issues, Mohammed said conditions allowing them to return home and condemned “some western countries” “seminating irrational fears” forcing them to leave their country.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help help refugees return home,” he said.
“They are politising pure humanitarian issues.”
The United States and the EU have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until Assad has reached a political deal with the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomat said Russia and Turkey recently reached an agreement to establish a refuge zone at the last major rebell base in Idlib, creating an opportunity to advance political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented the Russian-backed Syrian armies from launching massive attacks on three million inhabitants.
However, Mohammed stressed that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and said he hoped that military operations would target saint warriors, including the armed forces of the Nusra Front associated with al-Qaeda, "will be eradicated".
The United Nations Special Ambassador, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that a new committee comprised of government and opposition members holds a first meeting as soon as possible to prepare the post-war Syrian constitution to open the way to elections.
Mohammad listed the conditions for the Syrian government to join the committee, he said the committee’s work should be limited to “reviewing the provisions of the current constitution” and warned not to interfere.
Why did Trump win a new appointment?
According to this logic, Trump will win his presidential term in 2020 unless a lot of freedom audience wishes to end his presidential term earlier.
“This will be the end of the most dramatic presidency ever!”
But so far, people have not seen signs of cosmetic fatigue.
Since 2014, the views of the US Cable TV News Network (CNN) Gold Hour have more than doubled to 1.05 million, while the views of the Microsoft National Broadcasting Television Company (MSNBC) have tripled to 1.6 million.
Nielsen’s data showed that the average audience in Fox News’s Golden Age has risen from 1.7 million to 2.4 million four years ago, while MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show has ranked the highest number of cable TV viewers with the main night news of up to 3.5 million.
For the Cabinet Minister who became president after an attack that destroyed the U.S. Congress building, American Broadcasting Company (ABC) producer of Designated Survivor, Neal Baer said: “People are attracted like a flame because we don’t understand.”

However, when you find yourself watching a team of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s “Deep Background” roots in his book Fear, Paul Manafort’s $15,000-worth shorts (The Washington Post calls it “orgotten thick clothes”) and Stormy Daniels’ descriptions of Trump’s “Hey, bone”) meanings, you’ll find this far beyond the intelligence of a ordinary citizen.

A large amount of cash to the most intense middle-term elections in the House of Representatives
The re-division of the Parliamentary Election Zone led to two current MEPs to the same seat in the Penn State 17th Election District, and a large amount of cash sources continuously flowed, is not surprising.
The recently redefined suburban Pittsburgh election district became the target of Democratic Parliamentary Conor Lamb, while he won another election in a special election last spring.
The competitor against Lam is the current member of Parliamentary Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representative of the original Benchmark 12th election district, which is combined with the new 17th election district.
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania issued a decision in January, saying the old parliamentary election area map is favorable to Republicans and belongs to unconstitutional actions, and therefore re-divided the election area.
The new seat of the 17th election district triggered a major party financial issue between the Democratic Parliament's Election Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Parliamentary Committee (NRCC).
In the widely regarded Penn State 18th District Special Elections held in March, Lam won with a weak advantage, and later Lam became a well-known name in Pennsylvania.
Previously, the seat was stable by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won in the election area with 20 percent points.
Political experts have made a little advantage for the Democratic Party.
The United States had been considering sanctions for supporting China, but finally decided to give up.
The diplomat noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing and have almost not been blocked by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and then remained in Panama until partner expulsed the Trump administration’s management team.
State spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that the State officials decided to return to the head of the U.S. diplomatic missions in Insanza, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "no longer recognizing Taiwan's recent decision."
But just consider sanctions against El Salvador because the country received US $1.4 billion in aid in drug control, development and economic support in 2017.
Planned sanctions, including reduction of economic assistance and targeted visa restrictions, will have a serious impact on the Central American country and its higher unemployment and mortality rates.
As internal meetings took place, officials from North America and Central America delayed a focus on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a big step forward to prevent migrants from traveling to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior government officials clearly said they wanted the meeting to continue, which actually ended the idea of punishing El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is currently planning to speak at a meeting expected to be held in mid-October, and diplomats said it was a sign of government authorities’ emphasis on the meeting.
Three U.S. special ambassadors are quietly returning to El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic without being blocked or punished by Washington’s latest hard news.
Bolton’s spokesman refused to comment on the details of the discussion of the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss the internal discussion on anonymous basis.

The next need to be resolved may be special legal advisor Robert Mueller about Trump’s report that could hinder justice, which has already been very confirmed in public records.
Miller isly moving the direction of investigation to whether Trump is committed to attack Russia on our elections in his campaign.
If Congress is easy, Trump will face Congress’s responsibility, and it may eventually only remain a jury composed of his colleagues when he is prepared to re-elect.
There are a lot of assumptions here, and I do not mean Trump’s failure is an inevitable result – nor does he mean his failure in Europe is an inevitable result.
Everyone on both sides of the Atlantic can make choices, and these choices will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers prepared to launch a coup against Hitler, provided that the Western world would resist Hitler in Munich and support Czech Republic.
We have failed and missed the best opportunity to avoid the massacre that followed for many years.
The process of history is always focused on these turnpoints, where the unavoidable progress of democracy either accelerates or slows down.
Today, Americans are facing a number of such turning points.
What would we do if Trump dismissed the Deputy Justice Secretary Rod Rosenstein, who controls the fate of Miller?
Since the newspaper last year that Rosenstein suggested the president to make a cybersecurity recording and suspecting Trump was not suitable for the office, Rosenstein has become a hot-botted monkey.
Rosenstein said the Times's statement is inaccurate.
“How would we respond if the investigation conducted by the FBI’s just requested investigation against Brett Kavanaug is not sufficiently comprehensive or unfair – or if the Supreme Court believes that it is true without trustworthy sexual abuse charges and fraudulent testimony?
First, will we vote in the middle-term elections for a Congress that will be taken responsibility by Trump?
If the attempt fails, the Democrats will enter a long winter.
But I am firmly convinced that we won’t fail because I have taken the lessons from Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s office.

Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the competition with the Vienna Fast Team.
On Thursday, the tourists hosted the Vienna Fast Team, and after the Spanish Viral team earlier this month, they knew the victory was coming to the Austrians, which would be a favorable position for them from the European League G group.
Knee injury made the middle player Graham Dorrans unable to attend the first appearance of this season before the 2-2 Battle of the Pinguinville team, but he believes the surfers can use this as a jumpboard to get better results.
“This is a great opportunity for us because the Virall team is strong, 31 year old Graham Dorrans said.
“Before the game started, we believed we won’t get back and at the end we won a point.
Maybe we shouldn’t stop at this, but we finally reached the level.
They played better in the first half and we performed better in the second half.
Thursday will be another important European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a hard game because they have made good results in the previous game, but there are so many people who support us and I believe we can continue to get good results.
Last year was undoubtedly a very difficult year and a lot of things happened after I was injured, and the club itself had some faults, but now we feel well.
The team is good, the players enjoy the game, and they are training well.
Hopefully we can go ahead and go beyond the past season and succeed.
Women are insomnia due to worries about retirement savings
While the survey participants were clear what kind of care they wanted to receive, few people have talked about it with their families.
In the Nationwide study, approximately half of the people said they had talked with their spouses about long-term care costs.
Only 10% of people said they had been talking about this with their children.
“People want families to take care of themselves, but they don’t try to communicate with their families,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of National Life Insurance Business.

Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspects of terrorist attack in New York
New York Federal Prosecutors wish to condemn the death sentence of the New York suspect Sayfullo Saipov, which has caused the death of eight people, a rare case in New York City since 1953.
In October, the 30-year-old Seyf was driving a Home Depot rental truck on the west side of Manhattan Highway to bicycle trails, pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to prove the death penalty is reasonable, the prosecutors must prove that Seapov was the 8 victims of the "deliberate" killing and "deliberate" killing others.
According to the court document, both of these crimes can be sentenced to death.
Several weeks after the attack, a major jury of the U.S. announced that the suspect Sibov was accused of 22 charges, including eight murder charges, supporting chantage charges (a charges used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases), and the charges of violent destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutor said the attack requires “a lot of planning and predictive work” and described the way Zipov attacked was “focking and crueltly humble.”
The intention statement stated that "The victim's family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco have suffered huge injuries and losses."
Five of the victims were Argentinians.
The last death prosecution in Southern New York was 10 years ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of murder of two drug suppliers but was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death sentence was executed at the New York Federal Court in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of murder.
On June 19, 1953, the couple of Rosenbergs were executed by electric chairs.
The court documents show that Sifov was a Uzbekist who did not show any self-sufficiency in the days or even months after the attack.
Police said he told the investigators that he was satisfied with what he did.
According to the charges, Sipov told the authorities that he was only inspired after watching ISIS’s video on the phone.
Police said he also asked to hang ISIS's flag in his hospital room.
He was not guilty of 22 accusations.
David Patton, a federal advocate for Seif, said their decision was “particularly disappointed.”
Button said: “We believe that the decision to seek death penalty, without accepting lifetime imprisonment, would only extend the trauma of all involved persons.
Zipov’s defence team has previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative Parliamentary Parliament says Nigel Farage should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
In a protest of the Conservative Party meeting, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize today’s People’s Army”.
The former Independent Party Quebec said politicians must "feel the warmth of the "doubted Europeans"," as a parliamentary member Theresa May said, it should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back-seat deputy Peter Bone said in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage was a Brexit Secretary, Britain would “have already been out of Europe.”
However, the participation of the Tri-European Party in a separate protest against the UK’s exit emphasizes the challenges that Ms. May faces in reconciliation with a deep sequence of differences.
Under the pressures of Brexit, intra-European and the EU, the Prime Minister is trying to adjust the Chequers plan to make it on the right track.
The allies insisted that despite the strong opposition, she will continue to work to reach an agreement with Brussels and forced the European Parliament and the Labour Party to choose between her plans and “cause”.
Mr Bone told Solihull’s Leave Means Leave meeting he wanted to “give up the Chicks plan.”
He said he should let Mr Farage go with himself and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
He said, “If he was responsible for it, we would have gone out of Europe for a long time now.
Wellington’s parliamentary said, “I’m going to work hard for Britain to leave the European Union, but we need to give up the Chicks plan.
Speaking his opposition to the EU, he said: “We don’t need a world war to obey it.”
We want to develop our own laws in our country.
There was a suggestion that public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016, and Mr Bone rejected the suggestion: “This feeling that British people have changed their mind, the idea that they want to leave is not real at all.
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative Brexitist, also participated in the demonstration, told reporters: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.”
“People don’t welcome the Chicks plan, the opposition party won’t vote for it, our party and our activists won’t welcome the plan, you should remember, these people who are pleased for us on the streets, they are the first ones we chose to take office.
Please give up Chicks and listen to people’s voice.
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: “The Prime Minister can only keep his position in keeping his promises.
Farage introduced to assembly politicians that if they intend to betray the decision in the 2016 referendum, they must “feel the warmth of the cry.”
“Now, this issue concerns us—the trust between the people and the political classes.
“They want to betray the Brexit, and we are here today to tell them ‘We won’t let you do this.
In a speech to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I hope you can make the political class that intends to betray the Brexit feel the warmth of the cry.”
“We want to mobilize the British People’s Army that contributed to our Brexit victory, and we will never rest until Britain’s independence and autonomy reaches.
Meanwhile, Europeans marched in Birmingham, and then two-hour assembly held in the city centre.
After the creation of the team this weekend, several activists flags of the "Conservative Party against Brexit".
At the opening of the meeting, Labour fellow Lord Adonis laughed on the conservative party’s application faced security issues.
He added: “It’s these people tell us that they can have an IT system to Canada ++, without friction borders, free trade with Ireland without borders and all the technologies.”
“This is a complete thriller.
There is no such good thing as the Brexit,” he added.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins Sebastian Vettel with the help of the team's instructions
From the moment when Valtteri Bottas won Lewis Hamilton last Saturday, you can see clearly that Mercedes’s “team directives will play a big role in the game.”
Starting from the height, Potas led the road, almost hurted Hamilton during the first two defence rounds, and also caused Vitel to attack his team fellow.
Whitler first entered the maintenance station, and Hamilton ran to the end of the team, which originally had to determine the end.
After a round, Mercedes entered the station, returning back to the race track, after the most competitive match, in order to avoid staying in motion after the third curve double defense, the Ferrari driver (Vitel) unwillingly left the way out and Hamilton took the lead position.
Max Verstappen, who was celebrated the 21st birthday that day, was in the back row of the racing track and ran to the 7th place after the end of the first round.
During most of the time, he advanced full speed, striving to complete the game quickly, overpassing Kimi Raikkonen, running to the fourth place.
He eventually entered the maintenance station in the 44th round and failed to raise the speed in the remaining eight round, and eventually Lakonin won the fourth place.
Hamilton said: “It’s hard to stand today, because Watley performed quite great throughout the weekend, and he gave me the place very gently.”
The team achieved the first and second score, and it was great.
W limb language is not right.
President Donald Trump laughed Senator Diana Feinstein on a Saturday meeting as she claims she did not disclose letters about Christine Blasey Ford accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a speech at an assembly in West Virginia, President Trump did not speak directly about Ford’s testimony to the Senate’s Justice Board, instead, he commented that everything that is happening in the Senate is good to prove how “humble, dirty, false” people are.
“When you see anger, when you see angry, humble, dirty, false people, something might happen, and good things have been happening in the Senate in the past few days.”
“When you know the release and leakage of the news, they say, “Oh, that’s not what I do.”
That’s not what I do.”
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, is your news leaked?
Remember her answer... is the file you’ve leaked – “Oh, oh, what?”
Oh no no .
I have no leakage.”
So please wait a little.
Are we leaked... no, not us,” he added, recalling the senator.
In July, Van Stan received a detailed description of Ford's charges against Cavano, which was leaked in early September - but Van Stan denied her office caused the leak.
According to the Congress Hill Journal, Van Stein revealed to the committee, “I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, nor disclose her incidents.”
“She asked me to keep the letters confidential, and I also kept it confidential according to her request.”
But her denial appears not to be accepted by the president, and the president commented on a meeting held on Saturday evening: “Listen, the limb language can really be wrong.”
Maybe she doesn't, but it's the worst limb language I've ever seen.
The president continues to defend the Supreme Court candidate who is accused of three women of sexual abuse, saying the Democratic Party is using the charges to their own purposes.
According to Mediaite, the president said: “They will definitely take back power through any necessary means.
You look at these humble, dirty means, they don’t care about who they hurt, and they don’t care about who they want to get power and control.”

A new Guinea airline flight crashed to the River River Lake in the Pacific of Micronesia, the airline previously said 47 passengers and crew members were all evacuated safely from the plane under the lake and now one man was missing.
New Guinea Airlines said in a Saturday afternoon conference that it was unable to explain the disappearance of male passengers.
The airline said it is working with local governments, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately disclose the passenger’s age, nationality and identity information.
When the plane landed to Chuuk Island airport, it collapsed the lake and then local vessels participated in rescue and other passengers and crew were rescued.
On Friday, the official information said seven people were sent to hospital.
The airline said on Saturday six passengers were still hospitalized and all of the passengers were stable.
The cause of the accident and the order of events are unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the aircraft landed off the runway into the Rifle Lake.
Witnesses believed that it was the plane coming out of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
Jaynes said, “It’s good to fly low.”
Jaynes told that after the airplane dropped, the water in the airplane was deep, and everyone went to the emergency output.
He introduced the passengers were scared, screaming, and their head were slightly injured.
The U.S. Navy said sailors in the nearby port were involved in rescue, driving a gas-charge boat, bringing the passengers to the coast, and then the aircraft dropped in the water of about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that over the past 20 years, 111 people have died in a flight crash registered by Papua New Guinea, but New Guinea has not yet recorded passenger deaths.
Analysts listed a timeline of women being burned alive at night
The prosecutor was accused of burning a Mississippi female suspect in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett, as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis, made several hours of testimony.
He introduced the jury how he used phone records to combine 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers in the event that night.
According to Clarion Ledger, Roleith said he had received location data from several phones, the data showed that the night when Trice was with him at the death of Pompeo, which was contrary to the previous statements of Trice.
Terry said he was at the time with his friend Michael Sanford, and data showed that Terry’s phone was in the same position as Chimbers’ phone at the time, so the police went to Sanford to find out what happened.
Sanford testified on Saturday, saying he was not in the city the same day.
The prosecutor asked Sanford if his case was true on the truck in Sanford that night. Sanford said, "Ly because my truck was in Nashville.
Another point of contradiction is, Trice said, they both had known about two weeks when Chambers died.
The phone records showed that they just met for a week.
Rowlet said that some time after the death of Chambers, Therese deleted Chambers' text messages, telephone and contact information from their phone.
Hale said, “He removed her from life and removed her clean and clean.”
The accused was charged with the final statement on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would be sent to the jury later on the day.

Again a black man?
He was dismissed after receiving “racial discrimination” text, a New York nurse accused employer’s couples to court
A New York-based nurse was arrested after receiving a text from a child's mother complaining that he was "anymore a black man" for mistake, accusing both of the couples to court of calling them "ethnic discrimination".
The couple refused to acknowledge racial discrimination and called the case "chantage".
In 2016, the mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed disappointment after finding each other black before child care provider Giselle Maurice took office.
“No,” he wrote in a text message to his husband Freaksman.
However, the text was transmitted to Morris twice incorrectly.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the disappearance, Mrs. Freaksman was "completely embarrassed" dismissed Morris, because an African-American who was coming to leave his job was badly caring while she was waiting for a Filipino.
Mrs. Freaksman paid Morris for a day’s salary and then called a car to send her home.
Earlier, Morris was charging the couple, asking them to promise to stay at the employer’s parents for a temporary work for up to six months, paying up to $350 per day in compensation, despite no contractual validity.
On Friday, Morris told New York Post reporters “I want to tell them, see, you won’t do that,” and added “I know that this is racial discrimination.”
This rejected the accusations against the couple that they did not have racial discrimination and said the end of the employment of Morris was entirely reasonable and they fear that they could not trust her after being offended.
“My wife didn’t want to send her any message.
She does not have racial discrimination.
We have no racism,” his husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
“But would you be confident to give your child to someone you once harassed, even if it was unintentionally?”
Have you just been born a child?
Per no one will. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Plasco called the case a "chantage" and said her wife had a child two months ago and it is "very difficult."
Would you hire someone like that?
That’s not a wise action,” the investment bankier added.
While the case is still under trial, the Court of Opinion has quickly started condemning the couple’s behavior and logic on social media.
The latest letter reveals that Pattinson Bear publishers are concerned that readers will not accept a speaking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born soon after the readers accepted the book, revealed in a letter: "It was hard for people to imagine the reader's first reading this book before the publication of this book.
But now the Pattinson Bear has achieved a huge success, it’s really funny.
Speaking of his father, she said his father was a photographer at the British Broadcasting Company (BBC), who later wrote the child’s reading, inspired by a Toy Bear, who was always full of hope for his work repeatedly rejected, and she added that the 60th anniversary of his father’s death last year, the release of the book was called “Half of the Pleasure”.
Speaking of the Pattinson Bear, she said it was “a very important member of our family,” she also said her father was proud of his ultimate success.
“A father is a very quiet person who never swallowed himself,” she says.
But because the Pattinson Bear is too real to him, as if your child achieved achievements: you are proud of them even though that achievement is not yours.
I think that’s what he saw the success of the Pattinson Bear.
Although it was the crystal of his creativity and imagination, he always attributed success to the Pattinson Bear himself.
My daughter spoke and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was urgently sent to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were not able to rescue her life.
“Nad called us and said it was bad, she didn’t think it would happen,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then I received Nad's call and said my daughter's only a few minutes left and I had to have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
I photographed it.
I said, “Dear Jessie, I love you very much.
I’ll go with you soon.
I will always be with you.
The doctor gave her to maintain heartbeat drugs gradually failed.
She died early and everything was over.
Knowing that all this has happened, I can only sit there and wait.
I can’t cry, cry or cry, because my family and friends are around me.
I have to stay calm.
Finally, Miss Ednan-Laperouse, who was immersed in the pain of the woman, on boarding the plane with other passengers, quietly seeming to forget the torture she was experiencing.
“No one can see it,” she said.
“I’m down the head and tears continuously flowing down.
I know it is hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt strong sympathy with Nad.
He needs my understanding and care.
I know how much he loves his daughter.
Unfortunate women post cards, advise a light-minded person to return to mind.
Two women who lost their relatives are trying to stop others from suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on the Welsh Bridge, writing inspirational texts on the cards, and telephone numbers that make it easy for anyone in need to get support.
Mrs. Davis's son Tyler suffered from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want other parents to experience the pain I’m suffering every day,” she said.
Lady Davis is home to Lydney, 45 years old, and her son is an uncertain future chef, whose face is always hanging with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knows he’s a laughing person.
People always say that his laughter makes people in the full house happy.
However, he gave up his job and soon died, and he went to “a special dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother was just 11 years old when he discovered that Tyler ended his life.
Davis said: “I’ve always been worried that his suicide would produce a link reaction.
Then Davis made the card, “I hope people know that someone is willing to help you, willing to listen to your complaints, even if we are friends, it doesn’t matter.”
Don’t be silent, you need to complain.
Mrs Humphreys has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for many years, and soon after her mother died, her husband also left herself, now it has been 15 years of vision.
“He never told us that he was feeling low or depressed.
Just a few days before Christmas, we noticed that his feelings were not very correct.
On the same Christmas day, the kids opened their gifts, and he didn’t have any other eye exchange like that, when his emotions had fallen into the lowest valley.

Federal Investigation Agency (FBI) Leads Investigation on Brett Kavanaugh's Future
“I think if we could really get what he wanted – an investigation that was limited in time and scope – then maybe we could rescue a bit of solidarity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee would take advantage of this opportunity to “start down” the deep-rooted party stagnation.
Why did Cavano and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their desirability is entirely due to the problem of time.
Only five weeks left from the middle-term elections on November 6, and if the Republicans performed poorly as we expected, then their efforts to push up the U.S. Supreme Court candidates will be severely damaged.
George W. Bush continuously calls Senators to try to lobby their support for Cavanos since Cavanos had served in the White House for the Bush administration and met his wife, Bush’s private secretary Ashley through Bush.
What happens after the FBI’s report is published?
The Senate has 51 Republican seats and 49 Democratic seats.
It is still unclear whether Cavano could obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate to break the equality between Vice President Mike Pence, confirming the nomination of the Supreme Court candidate.
The number of North Korean refugees under Kim Jong-un's regime "droped"
A South Korean legislator said the number of Koreans who have fled to Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug referred to South Korean data that a total of 1,127 North Koreans fled to South Korea last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key reason for the reduction in the number of refugees was the strengthening of North Korea’s border controls with China, as well as the increase in costs charged by human trafficking groups.
North Korea has no public development list comment.
The vast majority of North Koreans who flee to Korea will eventually obtain Korean citizenship.
Since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 Koreans have been illegally crossed the border.
Most refugees fled through China to North Korea because North Korea’s longest border line with China and is easier to cross the non-military zone (DMZ) between the two countries.
China considers the traitors as illegal immigrants, not refugees, so they often force them to return to the country.
Relationships between North Korea and Korea have been significantly improved in recent months, although technically still in war.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries held talks in Pyongyang to start a dialogue on the non-nuclearization negotiations that are under a stagnation.
Improvement in relations between the two countries is due to the historical meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, and during a meeting, the two sides largely agreed on efforts towards the non-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Li Huang accused that no progress has been made since the meeting ended, as the United States is still implementing sanctions.
“If the United States is not trustworthy, we can’t assure our national security is guaranteed, so we can’t unilaterally dismantle nuclear weapons,” Li Huang said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hystery" not suitable to serve as Supreme Court Judge
Parliamentary minority leader Nancy Pelosi said the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh was "hysterious" and was not suitable for the position of the Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi said in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
“I can’t wait to think that if a woman had such a behavior they would describe it with ‘hysteries’,” Pelosi said, addressing the testimony made by Cavano at the Senate’s Justice Committee on Thursday.
Cavano is emotional uncontrolled against the charges made by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who said he did not have sexually abused Ford at the younger age.
Cavano was emotional uncontrolled in his initial speech and almost cried several times when he discussed his family and high school life.
He also clearly condemned the participating Democrats, calling the charges as a “strange united human attack” by the Liberal Party, because the Liberal Party is angry over Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Cavano's testimony shows he could not win the position of the Supreme Court, as it suggests he had prejudice to Democrats.
"I think his testimony, and his attitude towards Clinton and Democrats, show that he's not qualified enough."
When asked if the conviction of Cavano was finally confirmed and whether the Democratic Party would beat Cavano if it obtained a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, Pelosi opposed.
“Let’s say that if he said to Congress or the FBI is not the truth, he is not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also unsuitable for the court in which he is currently serving.”
Cavano is currently a judge at the Washington DC Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned that Cavano could have made a denial judgment against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case because he belongs to a conservative judge.
Cavano, confirming the hearing, avoided the question whether he would reject some of the Supreme Court judgments.
“Now, it is not appropriate to put a hysterical, prejudice to court office, and we want to say, ‘Isn’t it good?’
Women need to exercise their powers.
It was a burial of justice, in which anger continues to spread for months or even years, and if she didn’t cry, she could not get rid of it.
45 years later, Steinem told me, “We’ll cry when we’re angry.”
“I think that’s normal, do you think?”
She continued, “A lady helped me greatly, she was the manager of a company, she said she would cry when she was angry, but she found a trick that when she started crying she would tell the people talking to her,” you will know I was sad because I was crying.
I am angry.
Then she continued to come.
I think it's just great 😂😂
We spread anger with tears, partly because we fundamentally misunderstood tears.
The most impressive thing I had was in my early work, that was a man’s dominant company, once I cryed for an inexplicable anger, and then I was caught by an old woman (a manager who I’ve always been a bit afraid of her) who pulled me into the stairs.
She warned me, “Never let them see you cry.”
“They don’t know you are angry.
They will think you are sad and happy for it because they have defeated you.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Parliament member of Colorado, had participated in the presidential election with Gary Hart.
In 1987, Hart returned from the campaign on a ship named "Monkey Business Dinner Boat", and Schröd was very frustrated to think he should personally practice the idea of the election of the president.
“It’s not a thoughtful decision,” she laughed 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the campaign, and they didn’t need another candidate.
This is called the Snow White Princess and the Seven Little Men.
Since she had already entered the late election campaign, Schrödt was more behind in recruiting funds, so she swore that she would never participate in the campaign unless she raised up to $2 million.
This is no doubt a struggle of defeat.
She found that some supporters donated $1,000 to male candidates, but gave her only $250.
“Do they think I need a discount?” Shroder doubts.
When she spoke announced she would not launch a formal campaign, she was bothered by a variety of complex emotions - gratitude to supporters; disappointment over the institutions that made her difficult to collect funds and not to target target voters rather than representatives; and anger over gender discrimination - she began to swallow.
She recalled the media’s reaction to her when she said, “You should think my spirit has collapsed.”
“You might think Kleenex is my company’s sponsor.
I remember when I thought they would write on my cemetery.
“She was crying?”
What will be the benefits of China-American trade war to Beijing?
Experts say that the U.S. and Chinese trade war has been opened, although the war has just begun, in the long term, the differences between the two countries may be more beneficial to Beijing.
Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump first warned that it was about to impose taxes on China’s major export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The trade war has grown up this week, with new tariffs will impose taxes on half of China's imported goods in the United States, affecting a wave worth of $20 billion (150 billion euros).
Beijing responded in the same way every time, the last time the tariffs were increased by 5% to 10% on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to face the U.S. in the end, the world’s second largest economy will never retire in the short term.
Let Washington give concessions means the need to meet their demands, but it is too difficult to surrender publicly to the United States to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing is able to fix the mark, the pressure of the U.S. trade war could reduce the degree of mutual dependency between the two countries and provide long-term positive support for China.
Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher in Asia at the Center for New American Security, said: “If Washington or Beijing make political decisions quickly, it may lead to economic chaos, which is actually more dangerous than the situation where it has already been recognized.”
Foreign Minister says Syria is "prepared" to receive refugees return
Syria has said it is ready to allow refugees to return to the country voluntarily and calls on people from all borders to help them reconstruct their homes suffering from seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem told the United Nations General that the conditions in Syria are improving.
“With progress in combating terrorism, the ground is stable and safer today,” he said.
The Syrian government will continue to repair the area destroyed by the terrorists to restore it to normal.
At present, all conditions for refugees’ voluntary return to home are prepared. Refugees who flee from the country are forced to leave their homes due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at everyday life and survival.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
The remaining six million people living in Syria are still in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime welcomed other countries to help rebuild their afflicted homes.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or support from the rebellionist countries.
European team wins the Paris Ride Cup.
In the 2018 Le Golf National in France, the European team defeated the United States with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5.
The United States has lost six times in the European territory in a row and has not won the Red Cup in Europe since 1993.
The Danish team captain Thomas Bjorn first got the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States, and Europe won the championship again.
American footballer Phil Mickelson fought in most of the matches, after he hit the 16th hole, the third tournament, directed to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golf player Molinari has been greatly distinguished in all rounds, becoming one of the four players who have scored 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in its current form in 1979.
American player Jordan Spieth was defeated by the European team's lowest ranked player Thorbjorn Olesen with 5 against 4.
World's first-class player Dustin Johnson is 2 against 1 behind Ian Poulter, England, hoping to participate in his last Lady Cup match.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia took part in eight Leeds Cups, a senior general who has become the highest European winner in history, with a total of 25.5 points.
“I’m not always crying, but I can’t stand up today.
This year it was hard.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and trust me.
I’m glad to get the cup back.
It’s a honour for our entire team and I am pleased to do my best,” Garcia expressed emotionally after winning the European Championship.
He passed the fire to his peoples John Ram, who in a single match on Sunday defeated the American golf legendary Tiger Woods with a score of 2 against 1.
“I’ve been watching the Tiger Woods competition from child to child, and I’m very proud to be able to beat him,” 23-year-old Ram said.
Woods lost four matches in France with a score of 13-21-3 in this game, making the lowest record of the Leeds Cup.
For the greatest player ever, this set of statistics is somewhat strange, because he is probably only after Jack Nicklaus won the champion in 14 important matches.
Besides Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, the American team was not very optimistic throughout the week, apart from playing high-quality balls throughout the game.
U.S. Captain Im Furyk said after his team showed disappointment, “I am proud of everyone and they are fighting hard.”
This morning we put a lot of pressure on Europe.
We have finished.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He is quite good as a captain.
12 players played very well.
We will re-group team, I will join the US PGA and the Lady Cup committee, and we will continue to move forward.
I love these 12 people and I am honored to be their captain.
They must be respected.
We have been defeated.”

U.S. Navy Operations Vice Secretary General William Moran said, even though the U.S. Navy is rebuilding forces to address the increasingly concerned Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the U.S. continues to expand the region to the focus of the Navy, including the Indian Ocean, Asia-Pacific.
According to the United Kingdom’s Defense Weekly website on September 24, the United States ranked Central Russia as a strategic competitor in the new defense strategy released at the beginning of the year.
The U.S. Navy has then restored the second fleet in order to fight Russia more directly.
These actions raised some question and concern among allies and analysts who fear the U.S. Navy could be far away from the “Asian-Pacific Re-balance” strategy marked by Obama’s administration.
But Colonel Moran said the U.S. Navy's focus is still on the western Pacific.
On January 24, 2018, at a roundtable discussion held by the U.S. National Asia Research Bureau in Washington, he said: “No significant changes have occurred for us.”
Moran said, “The focus remains to re-balance, focus shift, or whatever you want to describe it.”
However, he acknowledged that the United States has a close relationship with Europe.
“We will continue to focus on growth in the West Coast and balance we can do.”
While Morlan pointed out that the general policy regarding Russia belongs to the U.S. Defense Secretary’s powers, he warned: “Russian people may face demographic and economic challenges, but history shows that they would be very strong if we are in conflict with them.”
As part of the U.S. re-operation against Russia, China and other competitors, the U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying forces into a "new operation model", which will help allow opponents to take action against U.S. aircraft fighters or other assets to be deployed at any given time and place.
“Our Navy and Navy have supported it—the unpredictable concept of fighting, not appearing again and again in the same place, almost like a decrease—that’s our practice.”
The first to try this new practice was the "Harry Truman" fighter group, which had early deployed the fighter group including work visits to the port and patrol in areas that usually only passed.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is currently working to ensure allies know that the vessels will remain on traditional regional patrols and are still solving logistics and family contacts for new deployment programs.
Australian Royal Navy Commander General Michael Nuan also spoke at the event, saying the Australian army could work smoothly with the U.S. aircraft fighter group.
He said the situation will continue as the Royal Navy plans to acquire nine more guard vessels equipped with the Zeus Shield.
Since October 5, a number of airlines raise or restore fuel charges to pay on board next Friday.
Yesterday, Qingdao Airlines, Okay Airlines and other airlines announced that from October 5, 2018 (the ticket date) the domestic route add-on fuel fee will be charged by $20 per passenger on the route below 800 km (including) and $30 per passenger on the route over $800 per passenger.

Since June 5, 2018, several airlines such as National, Eastern, Sea, Shanghai, Springshan, Shenzhen, Western Airlines, Okean Airlines have canceled the three-year domestic fuel add-on fee, charging standard is $10 per person.

It is also known that Hong Kong Civil Aviation Authority has provided that airlines can decide whether to charge additional fuel charges from November to November.
Thai Airlines first announced on September 27 that it will reimburse additional fuel charges as of November 2.
Thailand’s website shows that all air tickets issued or re-emitted on November 2 or later will include additional fuel charges, long flights to Hong Kong and Southwest Pacific, North America, Europe, Middle East and India, Africa, fuel charges are $652 and short flights are $146.

Japan's ITO trade trade agreement recorded $1.3 billion in China's investments in China's shares on Friday, reducing its largest enterprise investment transaction due to trade tensions in China and the United States.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man went through the headquarters of Turbo Corporation.
The company said the trade war has shocked the U.S. grain sector, which has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Previously, some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies, and so on, had issued warnings about the impact of Chinese-American trade friction, and now these Japanese trade firms have joined the line as well.
The U.S. and China imposed customs on each other hundreds of dollars of goods, and US President Trump threatened to extend the range of taxes to all over $50 billion of Chinese imported goods if the dispute cannot be resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Minister of Finance, said the trade disputes might have a greater impact on China’s economy next year.
Itoto and Thai Bee Group invested $10 billion in China in 2015 and gained 20 percent of its shares.
Hachimura said the ICO’s shareholders have lost 1.43.3 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) losses, as he believed that the shares will not regain soon.
ITO Businessins profits for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 in a round of 50 billion days.
China imposed 25 percent import tariffs on U.S. soy in July to counter Washington's initiatives in trade friction.
“Our grain business has been hit by the U.S. and China trade friction,” Mr. Tucson said.
He said Gong has stopped financial transactions on his account since September.
Goldman Sachs spokesman Pat Burke said in a statement that the company was “in accordance with internal policy restrictions and due to lack of market opportunities.”
He also said the suspension of financial transactions would not lead to a decrease in employment.
Rooseveltins an annual profit estimate of 23 billion yen round unchanged, supported by paper and paper manufacturing and electricity.
On Thursday, Resident Business announced a 16% increase in profits between April and September, emphasizing “the trade issues with the United States and China lead to unknown prospects.”
Mitsubishi Business on Friday raised annual profit forecast to a record level due to increased coal production and rising prices of large commodities such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Business also announced a new business plan, striving to increase profits in the fiscal year of 31 March 2022, from the estimated 64 billion yen to 90 billion yen (79.8 billion yen).
On November 5, a comprehensive report that the U.S. middle-term election vote has come into a re-counter time.
On November 4, President Trump and Democratic opponents actively "vote" to their core voters.
Both major parties point out that voting rate will be the key to the right-wing election.
It is that 48 hours before the U.S. referendum, Trump was busy to attend a Republican candidate, while former President Obama arrived in Indiana to stand for the urgent Democratic Senate candidate Joe Donnelly and calls for the masses before the election.
On November 4, Trump went to Georgia's Meiji station for Republican Governor candidate Brian Kemp, saying: "On Tuesday you have to go to the vote hall, you have to vote."
“The comparison of this election could not be more clear.”
The political enthusiasm of the voters has risen to a rare peak, and early votes in some states have been far more than usual.
The president of the United States faces the first term of elections, and the seats of the parliamentary party to which he belongs are often decreased.
According to a new poll published by the Washington Post and ABC News on 4th, although the Democratic Republican election in the Federal House of Representatives remains in advance, Republicans can benefit from economic assessment and Trump's strict concern about border security.
A poll showed that registered voters prefer more candidates to the Democratic House than Republicans, with a proportion of 50% to 43%, but still a drop compared to the top 14 percent points in August.
Another poll conducted by the U.S. National Broadcasting Agency (NBC) and the Wall Street Journal also showed that Democrats are still leading Republicans by 7 percent.
Obama said to the crowds at Senator Donald Trump: “When people don’t speak the truth, when words no longer represent anything, it will surely be bad.”
“When people lie only by self-sufficiency, democracy can’t work.”
“The only way to stop these Republicans now is you and your vote.”
The Democratic Party has faced the most difficult election in the Senate in decades, with the Republicans now hold half of 51 seats.
But the election in the House of Representatives was more favorable, and the Democrats need to win another 23 seats to control the House of Representatives with 435 seats.
Analysts at FiveThirtyEight.com predicted that the Democratic Party won the House of Representatives is up to 85%.

Three prosecutors believed that the patent holders and inventors who have been patented “based on mobile terminals puzzle service systems and methods”, while the entire operating process of the “drop out” app corresponds to the technical program concerned patent protection, constitutes a patent infringement.
However, during the judgment of the court, Xiaobo Technology believed that Guangzhou Pacific was not an appropriate prosecutor, which only provided free downloads of the app concerned "Drop Trip" on the web, not implemented the patent methods concerned, no direct or indirect violation of rights, and should not be listed as the prosecutor in the case.
Second, the infringement of the case is not in Guangzhou.
In accordance with the law, the breach of the patent concerned should be the place where the patent procedure is fully implemented and therefore objected to the jurisdiction of the court requiring the transfer of the case to the court of the accused’s residence, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court believes that Guangzhou Pacific has provided App products for the alleged infringement on its network platform, and it is not wrong to classify Guangzhou Pacific as the alleged.
And the accused is located in Guangzhou’s Pacific residence in Guangzhou city, which belongs to the jurisdiction of Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The prosecutors claimed that the case would be transferred to Beijing Intellectual Property Court, with insufficient reasons, rejected the prosecutors' objection to the jurisdiction of the prosecutors, and covered the costs of receiving the case of disputes.
Other examinations of the case are not yet announced, and journalists will also be closely focused on the subsequent details of the patent infringement case.
Interview with Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Science and Industrial Research Organization: Australian Technology Co-operation results are significant
“China’s scientific technology has evolved rapidly over the past decades, and the two countries in Australia’s collaboration in the field of science can great results.”
Larry Marshall, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Science and Industrial Research Organization, said in an interview with China’s new company in Beijing that cooperation in the field of technology in Australia has been a lifelong opportunity from the response to climate change to the Sky Eye project.
As the largest national-level research institution in the Federation of Australia, CSIRO has achieved numerous innovative research results in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials, and astronomy.
CSIRO hasined close cooperation with research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
“It’s a long-term friendship that includes a tradition of trust in partners and long-term cooperation,” Marshall said.
In May this year, China’s 500-meter spectrum ball radio telescope – “China Sky Eye” installed the first 19 wave L-band receiver internationally.
This is currently the most advanced 19 wave back source receiver internationally, jointly developed by Chinese scientists.
Marshall said the successful development of the receiver was based on CSIRO’s over-year-old technological accumulation, which will increase the speed of the FAST to 6 times after being activated, while also expanding more scientific observation targets.
“This is the strength of CSIRO’s contribution to FAST.”
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO also has closely cooperated with Chinese research agencies in the construction of a square kilometers range of radio telescopes, the development of new fuel technologies, and the reduction of energy.
“Scientific research in the past is often focused on issues hundreds of years later, and it is now needed more research force to solve the problems that are facing.”
Marshall believes that both countries in Australia are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a series of challenges in the development.
For example, extreme weather appears in frequencies around the world, droughts and floods have led to a decrease in food production, and food shortage has seriously affected human development.
At the same time, problems such as demographic explosion, aging, chronic diseases are also serious challenges facing today.
“The cooperation between the two countries in recent years focused primarily on solving these current challenges.”
The International South Hemisphere Ocean Research Center jointly established with the Blue Sea Science and Technology Laboratory of Blue Sea, which focuses on observing El Niño and Lana phenomena, studying the relationship between both extreme weather, and building an emergency facility for extreme weather; new varieties of grains that overcome extreme weather, jointly developed by CSIRO and the Central Academy, can also relieve food shortage caused by extreme weather.
“In the current environment, technological innovation is hard to accomplish alone, requires very high costs, and there are a lot of problems to be solved, so cooperation seems especially important today.”
Marshall said the closer cooperation, the more likely to be achieved breakthrough progress, which is also the meaning of strengthening cooperation between both Australia and China under the "One Belt and One" framework.
“Strengthening bilateral cooperation is for us mainly in the field of technology.”
Marshall for example, CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification law that does not use potassium, because traditional potassium gold purification law is very harmful to the environment, many countries want to find a way to purify gold with a small amount of pollution.
“We are willing to introduce this technology in China, which is one of the results of our participation in ‘One Belt and One Road’ cooperation.”

North-East revitalizes, concerned with the main development of the country.
Industrial enterprises in the North East region are more important and more basic, for the North East, catching innovation is catching development, and catching innovation is catching the future.
Can the vitality of the old industrial base re-insured and liberated, engraving the heart of the Secretary-General?
North Korean Foreign Minister Li Huang said on Saturday to the United Nations that the continuing implementation of sanctions would deepen North Korea's misconfidence in the United States and that it would not be possible to unilaterally give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
He said in the United Nations General that North Korea had taken “very friendly practices” last year, including stoping missiles and nuclear tests, dismantling the nuclear test sites, and pledged not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we have not seen any corresponding response of the United States,” he said.
“There is no trust in our national security if we do not trust in the United States, and in such circumstances we cannot give up weapons on the first side.”
While Lee Huang is repeating North Korea’s complaints against the US’s “part-phase” nuclearization, his speech is important because it has not been completely rejected by one-sided nuclearization as North Korea had before.
Lee Huang referred to Kim Jong-un and Trump's joint statement on June 12, when Kim Jong-un agreed to "nuclearization" efforts towards the Korean Peninsula, and Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said North Korea must give up nuclear weapons first.
The United States also refused to relieve the demands of international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insist on ‘unuclearization first’ and increasing sanctions pressure to its objectives in a high-pressure way, and even refuse to publish a ‘Declaration of End of War’,” Li Huang said.
"The idea of thinking that sanctions can make us knees to ask forgiveness is not to understand that our people are doing day-to-day dreams.
But the problem is that this continuous sanctions are deepening our confidence.”
Liu Xiao did not mention the second Trump meeting program that the U.S. President mentioned earlier in the United Nations this week.
Instead, he stressed Kim Jong-un and the Korean President Xi Jinping’s three meetings in the past five months, saying “If the other side to nuclearise is Korea rather than North Korea, the nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so stable.”
China has announced to reduce import tariffs for 1585 customs purposes since November 1, 2018.
Since this year, China has joined initiatives to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1, this year, the total reduction of the taxes will be adjusted to zero import tariffs for total of 28 tax purposes, including anti-cancer drugs and bio-alky drugs with anti-cancer effects, non-resistant drugs with actual imports.
At the same time, it also significantly reduced the value added tax taxes for the production and import of anti-cancer drugs.
On July 1, the tax was reduced on 218 vehicles and parts for tax purposes.
After the reduction of the tax, the tax rate of China has been lower than the average of developing countries, in accordance with the practice of the Chinese automotive industry.
This tax reduction will promote industry structural adjustment and resource optimization configuration, accelerate top-down, help improve the quality of products and services, hopefully, to some extent push the car price adjustment, allowing consumers to get more availability.
On July 1st, the tax was reduced on 1449 daily consumer goods for tax purposes.
Tax reduction on daily consumer goods needs to be closely linked to the good lives of people.
This tax reduction is not only large, but also large, with an average tax reduction rate of 56%.
Tax reduction on daily consumer goods, directly benefiting large consumers and promoting domestic industries to increase competitiveness.
On November 1st, a tax reduction will be imposed on 1585 industrial goods such as mechanical equipment, parts and raw materials for tax purposes.
The appropriate reduction of import tariffs on some domestic urgently needed industrial goods, will be able to attract more foreign investments, to increase domestic efficiency supply, help the industry upgrade, while helping to build resources globally, reduce production costs, and also to reduce the pressure on domestic environmental loads.
The relevant head of the Office of the Customs Code Committee of China said the above four autonomous reductions, as well as the third step reduction of taxes implemented by the results of negotiations on July 1st, will reduce China’s total tariff level from 9.8% to 7.5% last year.
The adjusted total tariffs level is slightly higher than the EU, lower than most developing countries, at a medium-low level, basically corresponding to China’s status and development phase.
The head introduced that the total level of tariffs as one of the important indicators of the level of openness in the field of Chinese goods trade, should adapt to the phase of economic development in China, reflecting the characteristics of the time.
China’s goods trade is the world’s first largest, and has already expanded an open economic basis, but the quality and efficiency of trade development is still a difference compared to developed economies, therefore, the overall level of tariffs should be reduced appropriately.
Customs are a means of compliance protection, customs levels should adapt to the competitiveness of the industry, to encourage good competition, excess protection against the development of the industry and improve the quality.
The customs rate adjustment should correspond to production needs and consumer needs.
Focus on reducing larger domestic demand, contributing to industrial transformation upgrading commodity tax rates, strive to increase the importation of products compared to the needs of the crowd, constantly enhancing the sense of access to enterprises and the public, meeting the upgrading needs of industrial structure and consumption structure.
Tax reduction should be taken into account the tolerability of financial income and industry development.
On the choice of specific tax reductions and tax reductions, two domestic and foreign markets, two up-to-down aspects, two production and consumption relationships, to maintain China’s economic stability towards good development.
The head emphasized that this year is the 40th anniversary of the reform opening, China’s initiative to reduce the total level of import tariffs is a major initiative taken according to China’s own achieving high-quality development needs, favouring the global use of two resources abroad, promoting the quality of domestic supply system improving, meeting the needs of the people’s mass consumption upgrades.
This action and initiative indicates that China will firmly follow an open strategy for mutual advantage, firmly support economic globalization, firmly uphold the principles of free trade and the multilateral trade system based on the WTO, continue to take advantage of the development of the open to the world, and also allow China to develop better to benefit the world.
Serbia announces the highest state of fighting preparation: President of Serbia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
According to reports from the President’s Office of Serbia, Kosovo’s forces occupied the passage of the Gaziwoda water plant in the northern part of Kosovo, President Vucic ordered the country’s armed forces to enter the highest state of combat.
On 29 September, Serbian Defense Minister, Wulin, said the Serbian army had entered a full state of combat.
Mr. Wulin stressed that as long as the order issued by Mr. Wuchic remains valid, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo, and the Serbian armies will respond, no matter where the situation develops.
On September 29, Mr. Wuchic said in an interview that he had been informed of the current situation with countries such as the US and Europe and would visit Moscow to meet Russian President Putin on October 2 to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When asked whether Serbia needs Russia's military support as much as Syria, Wuchic gave a negative answer: "I don't want a major military conflict to occur on our territory."
Vucic also said the Serbian forces entered a state of complete warfare only to form a threat to prevent the conflict, but it is also a clear warning that there is absolutely no tolerance for any violence in Kosovo.
The Syrian army's raise of combat reserve is linked to two major actions on the side of Kosovo.
According to the Serbian side, Albanians have recently arrested generations of Serbs living in the northern Kosovo, and these arrested Serbs have not violated any law.
Vucic said the Arabs have improved regional situation since the Serbian government’s Kosovo and the head of the Office of Metochia, Marko Yurić, was attacked and arrested by the Kosovo army on March 26 this year, making inhuman arrest and deportation of Serbs.
Furthermore, more than 100 people, including the ROSU Special Forces, Armed Police and snipers of the Republic of Kosovo, which was announced today, occupied a location near the Gaziwada water plant’s reserve lake, entered the ecological and sports center near the northern river of the Kosovo region and blocked all nearby roads that were originally controlled by Serbia.
Mr. Vucic noted that the military adventure operation of Kosovo was carried out under the control of Western countries and that the actions of the Kosovo army had not previously notified Serbia, violated Chapter 9(1) of the Brussels Agreement, and also violated the Military Tech Agreement between the UN Security Council resolution 1244 and Secco.
Wuchic has spoken to NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg to criticize the false words of Western countries on the Kosovo issue.
The root of the current conflict remains hundreds of years of historical grief between the two Sea tribes in Kosovo.
About Kosovo belonging, the Serbs and the Arabs have different statements.
Serbia and Kosovo are the nations’ birthplace and culture, since Serbia established its most powerful nation right here in the 12th century, while the Arabian immigrated massively only after the Ottoman Empire invasion and the Serbian defeat.
The Arabs insisted that the original tribes of the Illerians who lived in Kosovo in the 4-5 centuries BC were the ancestors of the Arabs, and therefore Kosovo has been the territory of the Arabs since ancient times.
Subjective political divisions have caused severe conflicts between different ethnic, religions and cultures, which have caused severe conflicts between Serbs and Arabs in Kosovo.
In 1912, Kosovo declared Albania's independence for the first time.
After the First World War, a large number of Arabs living in the Balkan peninsula moved to Turkey, with the proportion of Serbs relatively increased, as the Serbs viewed the practice of “just take back their own land” but was considered by the Arabs as a “Celebarianism” kidnapping and the two-ethnic contradiction.
Kosovo has become a “fire bar” in the Balkans.
In 1999, Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army had a armed conflict with the Serbian army and police, resulting in the bombing of the NATO forces on the southern coalition of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Kosovo war broke out.
On February 17, 2008, Kosovo unilateral declared independence from Serbia.
Although there has been reports that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, the agreement underlined by multi-party forces such as the US and Russia was unable to be signed due to historical national complaints and geopolitical wave.
Just a month ago, Wuchic expressed for the first time his claims to isolate the Serbs and the Arabs in Kosovo, and again to open the two-tribal contradictions.
Electrical communications are still interrupted, Indonesian earthquake accompanied by tsunami rescue difficulty
According to the Indonesian Emergency Agency, the intense earthquake and tsunami caused in the central Sulawesi province of the country on 28 May, have caused 420 people to die.
Wilm Rampangilei, head of Indonesian disaster rescue agency, said the figure is only preliminary statistics in Pulu, Central Sulawesi, about 80 kilometers away from the earthquake, due to the lack of large-scale rescue machines, many of the city’s hotel, shops, warehouses and people-intensive buildings that have been damaged by the earthquake.
On September 29, 2018, Indonesian Bali, a bridge devastated by earthquakes and tsunami crashed into sections.
Due to severe damage to electricity and communications facilities, the earthquake Gala district and neighboring Sichhi are still unconnected "isola", which is unable to estimate the number of victims.
Indonesia’s vice president Cara said the number of deaths is up to thousands.
Electricity interruptions, communications interruptions, road blocks, airport damage ... ... rescue work after tremendous earthquakes and tsunami is difficult.
Due to electricity interruptions, several hospitals and rescue facilities in Palo need to generate electricity from fuel.
The road to the city was blocked due to mountain climbing, and large transport vehicles, including oil tanks, were unable to access, making fuel supply very tensioned.
Indonesian Social Minister Agus said the department has not yet been transported emergency rescue materials from the neighboring South-Western Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern Southern South
Disaster rescue material transported from the capital of Jakarta is being transported to the disaster area via aircraft.
Since the command tower and runway of the airport of Palau were damaged by the earthquake, all commercial flights have been stopped to land only for transporting rescue goods and personnel, to ensure safety and security of rescue.
Indonesian Political, Legal and Security Affairs Director Viranto, who commands rescue in the earthquake area, has called for the restoration of electricity supply and commercial flight services from the airport as soon as possible to ensure the operation of rescue agencies such as hospitals, allowing more rescue personnel and volunteers, and aid material to be transported to the disaster area.
Several severe earthquakes occurred in the Gara County of Central-Western Indonesia on the 28th day, where a 7.7-degree earthquake occurred at 17:02 local time caused tsunami, resulting in major disasters in the city of Palo, Gara County, and Sigi.
China New Company Beijing on October 1st (Reporter Yinry) Been as washing, shining, shining miles, shining full sky ... ... Recently, Beijing continued to open the most beautiful blue sky mode, bringing thousands of people of Kyoto in the social platform flower show, showing happiness in continuous cleaning screen, saying “Blue sky under the cloud, ‘drunk’ beautiful sky line, this is Beijing’s best card.”
Beijing has been celebrating the “Blue Sky” since August.
In Kyoto, people can be seen anywhere, either with a smartphone or with a single camera.
On social platforms such as microblogs, microblogs, microblogs and microblogs, you can see all over the web pages of the homestay, the sky gate, the birds, the hose ... The various buildings show different beauty under the blue sky.
Some internet users say that such a “big piece of landscape” is Beijing’s best city advertising; some internet users say that if such a long-term blue lighting screen, people with cervical diseases can be healed; and more internet users hope that “these blue lighting can be better winter and spring summer, and make the Kyoto’s landscape blue for four seasons.”
Why do people love the blue sky?
Only because the people who lived in this city in the past suffered from smoke, thus extremely desirable to the blue sky, while in Beijing the "Blue Sky Defence War", after continuous improvement of air quality, the smoke became less, the blue sky increased, the people see in the eyes and the feelings of happiness are also extremely proportional.
On the day of Beijing, the weather was good.
The vast majority of 35 air quality monitoring sites across the city were displayed as “first-level” green.
The public-spontaneous “Blue Sky” theme photography contest on social platform is still ongoing.
Why is the sky in Beijing so blue?
According to Beijing City Environmental Protection Authority, Beijing’s average concentration of fine particles (PM2.5) was 35 micrograms per square meter in August this year, making the best record in the history of the same period in almost five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 between September is more frequent than the current bits.
A major factor in the appearance of "the blue sky" is that the weather conditions have been generally beneficial in recent years, and more importantly, Beijing has continuously implemented air pollution management, strongly advancing clean air action plans for the past five years, continuous release of environmental benefits, reducing the total emissions of pollutants within the region, which all lay the foundation for continuous improvement of air quality.
Beijing officially launched and implemented the Beijing City Clean Air Action Plan for 2013-2017 in 2013.
According to the plan, official continuously conducting non-capital functional dismantling, promoting energy cleaning alternatives and pollution reduction work, eliminating a total of 4,923 coal reefs.
Beijing is also the first big city in China to implement a full network of natural gas.
The data showed that between 2013 and 2017, Beijing’s PM2.5 annual concentration was reduced by 35.6%; the number of air quality achievements increased for 50 days; the number of top-level days increased for 25 days; the number of days of heavy pollution reduced for 35 days and the incidence of heavy pollution was significantly reduced.
While continuously improving air quality, Beijing official based on a new round of PM2.5 source analysis, launched in September this year the Beijing City to win the Blue Sky Defense War, which focuses on the current governance phases and pollution characteristics, focusing on the main areas of protection such as diesel truck, dust, fluctuating organic management, optimize the adjustment of transport structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land structure, strengthen regional defence control, struggles to strengthen urban precision management, fully promote green development, strives to make the "best blue sky" constant in Kyoto, no longer "some thing is rare", making it back to the background of people's list rather than the main character.
During the National Gold Week of this year, the Municipal Tourism Commission, Business, City Administration, Security and other related departments will strengthen the law enforcement inspection of the “One Day Tour” market, focusing on tourism “Six Black” illusions, the infringers will be charged with the law of heavy and severe punishment.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a discussion on the illegal "One Day Tour" to implement special actions to further seriously combat the illegal "One Day Tour".
The meeting revealed that the “Six Black” illusion focused on black tickets, black guides, black companies, black cars, black shops and black internet interest chains interconnected, the city has launched a special action to strictly target illegal “One Day Tour” since July 28.
Special action has been conducted so far, the entire city has received 39 “One Day Tour” complaints, a drop of 63 percent; since this year, the entire city has received 270 “One Day Tour” complaints, a drop of 62 percent.
Over the past two months, the city has arrested 248 black cars, found 158 violations of tourist transportation business, closed 29 black shops and performances, searched 13 black companies, 27 black guides, captured 26,000 illegal advertisements, dismantled 31 illegal day trip cards, 3 fake bus stops, investigated 1789, investigating various travel irregularities, from a severe fine of $448,000, detained 111 people involved in travel irregularities.
After repair, the illegal "One Day Tour" illusion was fundamentally restricted, and the "One Day Tour" market order presented a stable and good position.
In recent years, the city has increased its strength to repair against illegal “one day travel”.
In 2016 and 2017, the City Tourism Commission received 1612 and 897 complaints of "One Day Tour", respectively, reduced by 79% and 44%, but the illegal "One Day Tour" continued to repeatly, frequently rebound, and formed the "Six Black" illusion of interest chains of black tickets, black guides, black companies, black cars, black shops, black networks.
Specifically, street illegal tourists named “Black Tickets”, which publishes false tourist information illegal websites such as “Black Internet”, travel agencies that are involved in illegal “One Day Tour” or non-Travel agencies operating qualifications or individuals such as “Black Company”, “Black Company” employed without guidance or guides for illegal practice, “Black Guide”, the vehicles that are not used for tourist qualifications or the vehicles that are qualified for tourist travel services for illegal “One Day Tour” such as “Black Car”, and ultimately they bring visitors into the designated tourist shopping store such as “Black Store”.
During this special operation, the city continued to strengthen the fixed inspection and mechanical inspection of illegal “One Day Tour” to address high-frequency and influential tourist lines for illegal “One Day Tour” and the relevant department sends a visit group daily to the group with a group visits to find evidence of illegal infringement.
Among them, “Black Car” and “Black Shop” became the two major focuses in the special action.
Without a black car, illegal “one day trip” cannot be done, black car is both easy to find, remember and find, and a single fixed asset of higher value.
Related departments use road traffic monitoring detectors to increase the regulation of the “One Day Tour” route tour buses, using technical and technological intelligent means such as the “Black Car” search can be found in time.
Tourism shopping "Black store" is also a major focus due to the small number of seating operations.
In order to strengthen the shock and struggle against illegal "One Day Tour", each of the functional departments will be subjected to severe punishment by law if any violation is verified in the special action.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to the strictly struggling with illegal "One Day Tour" to explore measures to combine administrative penalties and penalty sentences.
The City Tourism Commission said in the future will encourage more official travel agencies to conduct a "One Day Tour" in Beijing, increasing the supply of regular "One Day Tour" to further occupy the survival space of illegal "One Day Tour", and specific programs are currently under investigation.
In addition, the City Tourism Commission continuously improves the tourist group’s electronic travel information system to ensure that each team is integrated in the electronic travel platform regulation.

With positive treatment, the survival rate of early births in China for 29 weeks and above reached the level of developed countries.
China's National Children's Medical Center in Shanghai on September 30 (China's NICU Hospital for Early Birth and Afterparty Quality Improvement Project) revealed that it introduced Canada's advanced approach in the headquarters "China's NICU Hospital's Early Birth Pre-Later Quality Improvement Project".
The project results showed that with positive treatment, China’s survival rate of 29 weeks and older premature births at 98% has reached a developed country level, but there is still a lot of improvements in the survival rate of premature births and premature births.
For almost 20 years, the Chinese government has been focused on the rescue of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71 ‰, significantly below the national average, reaching advanced levels in developed countries.
“China NICU Hospital Prefectural Quality Improvement Project” has significantly improved the survival quality of premature birth through four years of continuous efforts.
Professor Yu Yuan, Director of the Neonatal Gravity Care Chamber (NICU) of the University of Utah, said to reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature birth, focusing on reducing the quality of premature birth survival, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the neuronal development prognosis, improving the overall end of the patient, improving the overall survival quality of premature birth and population, is an important issue of attention to the domestic and foreign pediatric community, as well as the key issue of the focus of this project.
“China NICU Hospital for Early Birth After Quality Improvement Project” through four years of continuous efforts to collect tens of thousands of cases of pregnancies aged 33 weeks and under the country, making domestic premature birth age and premature birth weight decreased 1/3, while the prevalence of severe premature complications decreased significantly, significantly improving the survival quality of premature births.
The project, by establishing a national newborn quality improvement cooperation network, introducing the concept of cooperative quality improvement, radiating 25 cooperative hospitals across China, establishing a set of cooperative methods for improving early birth prevention and improving newborn healing levels of complete, systematic and effective cooperative quality improvement.
The University’s affiliate pediatric hospital is joining the National Newborn Children’s Force to develop newborn infection diagnosis guidelines based on the project’s experience, to provide references and guidance for the standard diagnostic treatment of newborn infection in China.
It is known that in the “China early childbirth pre-post-quality improvement project”, the pediatric hospital introduced the EPIQ approach to 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces of the country, committed to solving the problem of premature child infection in China’s newborn care room.
Over more than 10 years of continuous improvement, Canada has increased the survival rate of premature births without complications by approximately 1/3, Canada has now ranked one of the best countries in the world for premature birth.
The EPIQ method has now been applied to all NICUs across Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
Pediatric hospitals revealed that the results showed that two years after EPIQ intervention, premature infection decreased by 35%, while antibiotic use decreased by 20%.
In the future, the University’s associated pediatric hospitals will continue to promote and implement this approach across the country, aiming at fully reducing the incidence of all complications in premature births and improving the quality of healing for newborns in the country.
At present, there are differences and inequalities in the level of rescue in the regions of China.
As an important construction unit of the National Children's Medical Center, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role of radiation, covering several western provinces of Xinjiang, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Jiangsu, in order to progressively promote homogenization and standardization of newborn healing throughout the country.
It is known that the University of Bhutan affiliated pediatric hospital is joining the National Newborn Children's Force to develop newborn infection diagnosis guidelines based on the project’s experience, to provide references and guidance for the standard diagnostic treatment of newborn infection in China.
In 2019, the co-ordination center located in China’s newborn cooperation network of the associated pediatric hospital of the University of Shandong, will conduct the next stage national quality improvement of 63 national hospitals in order to promote the uniform development of China’s newborn health level.
Shanghai, Director of the Shanghai City Health Audit Committee, said that Shanghai can be the central city of Asia, not only reflected in research, but also the construction of the entire service system, the quality of the service and the results of the service should be a place in Asia, thus truly reflected the health level of China.
Sinai: Build the “hero monuments” in the heart—written on the Fifth Martyr’s Day.
On September 30, in the eve of the Republic’s 69th birthday, we celebrated the Fifth Martyr’s Day, where Xi Jinping and other party leaders and national leaders came to the Tianmen Square to attend a gift basket ceremony to the heroes of the people.
At this moment, wherever you are, thank you very much.
The day is warm and awakened.
Behind the name of each martyr is a lively life.
They also have hot youths, have genuine love, and have connected families.
However, because they firmly believed in “Our belief is the truth of the universe”, in order to “eliminate the suffering of the next generation”, they are willing to sacrifice everything for themselves.
“One day I survive will cry for China.”
Through time space, the engles set up a spiral route indicating the direction of the way forward.
“Where to come from, where to go,” “What kind of person,” read Englishly, it is not difficult to get the answers.
To remember, the most important thing is to build a “hero monument” in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the Revolutionary War, approximately 20 million martyrs have dedicated themselves to national independence, national liberation, and national heroic.
For various reasons, many predecessors have not even left their names.
Indeed, countless heroes are worn with blood, practising faith with life, remembering their heroes, inherited their spirit, guarding the roots and the soul of the nation.
This “Hero Monument” does not allow any damage and destruction.
For a while, historical nativism, extensive entertainment, such as dark flows have been flowing.
A variety of distorting history, undermining the violent practices, challenging justice consciousness, distorting values judgment, raising public anger and awareness of the whole society.
The heroes cannot forget.
The act of touching the bottom line, which cannot be heard, must be courageous to light the sword, to defend the dignity of the rule of justice.
The Protection Act of Hero Martyrs was officially implemented on May 1st.
From the judgment practice, the judgment of some cases is very fast, both effective in the law to maintain the bright image of England and to release the positive energy of worshiping heroes and devotion.
A persecuted nation cannot be without heroes, and an ideal nation cannot be without a pioneer.
Forgiveness and calling heroes has become a universal social consensus.
Currently, there are millions of various monuments in the country, and more than 100 million people visit the Mirror Garden every year.
Human heart is the strongest foundationstone.
Let the worship of heroes, defend heroes, learn heroes, care for heroes, bring the spirit of the spirit into the bloodstream of the nation, a seat of “hero monuments” will stand in the heavens and earth, in the depth of human heart.
Reuters, Brussels, September 28, - After Italy disregarded the EU’s demands to surprise the market by the massive budget deficit program, the EU took a non-controversial position against Italy on Friday, but the EU might take a more radical position if Italy adheres to a too brave goal.
Italy suspects the European government’s goal to have a budget deficit equivalent to 2.4% of GDP (GDP) for the next three years, indicating that there is no debt reduction in face only the demands of reduction.
The Executive Commission for Economic Affairs, Moscow Vivi, said on Friday, “We are not interested in the crisis between the Executive Commission and Italy,” he took cautious response because EU’s recommendations and sanctions may have no effect on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats are still hoping that the market forces will be able to persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before it is officially submitted to the Executive Committee in October.
After the government announced its plans, the euro fell to the lowest level of almost two weeks on Friday, with Italian bond revenue rate reached the highest three weeks.
If the deficit targets remain unchanged until the end of October, the Executive Committee may reject Italy's budget draft, something that the Executive Committee has never done to any country.
Deputy Chairman of the Executive Commission, Tombrovsky later said at a meeting in the Latvian capital Riga on Friday that Italy's current fiscal plans " seem to be in accordance with the Stability and Growth Treaty", he referred to the EU's fiscal regulations.
But he didn’t say what would trigger the EU’s reaction.
Officers may submit applications for this open tender before October 26.

National non-membrane cotton site observation and research exchange activities experts go to the test field and listen to the representative of the Chinese Engineering Institute of Technology.
Shenzhen Shayai on September 30th (King Shayai) is located in Shenzhen Shayai district's non-membrane cotton plant experimental base, no-membrane cotton long pleased, compared to the near-membrane cotton, a snow-white cotton competition "open", hanging the branches.
From 27 to 28 September, the national non-membrane cotton site observation and research exchange event took place in Shenzhen Shia province.
Reporters at the observation meeting learned that the non-membrane cotton technology system undertaken by the subject of "Cotton 619" and its package cultivation measures, initially achieved the objective of non-membrane cotton cultivation, reduced the contamination of the shinjuku cotton residues to the ecological environment and raw cotton, and made significant progress in comprehensive technical research and demonstration of non-membrane cotton.
Chinese Academy of Engineering, well-known cotton genetic breeders, the chief scientist of the cotton system of modern agricultural and industrial technology system of the national cotton system in the modern agricultural and industrial technology system, has introduced the cotton system to Zhejiang University's Parties Committee Secretary of the National Parties of the University of Zhejiang.
“We have developed a comprehensive non-membrane cotton technology can fully realize non-membrane planting cotton, can fully solve the problem of contamination of the remaining membrane, achieving green cotton plant.”
The Chinese Institute of Engineering has been introduced rapidly.
Xinjiang is China's most important cotton production area, according to the National Statistics Office, in 2017 Xinjiang cotton cultivation area was 35 million hectares, accounting for 61% of the national cotton area.
Since the introduction of the landmembrane in China in 1982, the area of various crops covered the landmembrane in the Xinjiang region has reached more than 50 million hectares, and the landmembrane annual use of approximately 300,000 tons.
Among them, cotton floor coverage reaches 100%, and cotton floor covering accounts for about 60% of the use of Xinjiang floor membrane.
The production of cotton without membrane is performed, cotton production is fully achieved production of 320 to 350 kg.
With the continuous increase in the amount of Shenzhen membrane deposits, the recycling rate of residual membrane is low, the amount of residual membrane in the soil increases gradually, the residual membrane causes a number of problems such as soil structure damage, seriously affecting the sustainability of agriculture.
The remaining membrane not only causes serious pollution on the soil, but also significantly affects the quality of cotton fibers.
Currently, more than one-third of Xinjiang’s cotton land has achieved mechanized harvest.
In 2017, the Shenzhen Machinery has an area of about 14 million hectares.
In the process of machine cotton harvest, a large amount of surface, fragments on cotton stones, the fragments in the raw cotton are difficult to clean in the process of raw cotton, and in the subsequent textile processing cannot be completely cleaned, seriously affecting the quality of the textile products.
On September 28, the national non-membrane cotton site observation and research exchange event took place in Shenzhen Shaya County.
In order to solve the pollution of cotton, simplify the planting of cotton technology, improve cotton efficiency, Yuri Wood rapidly led his team through 8 years, implementing "Cotton 619" non-membrane cotton technology cultivation, "adding wings" for the green development of Xinjiang agricultural.
Through innovation to cultivate new ideas, cultivate special early-known, salt-resistant, low-temperature resistant, high-produced land cotton new product "Cotton 619".
“China Cotton 619 has achieved a range of mechanical arrangements in non-membrane cultivation conditions in the southern region of Xinjiang, no-membrane planting mechanical arrangements, improving seed depth, dropping pipeline under no-membrane conditions, suitable seed density screening, reasonable chemical control, etc.”
Currently, Aksu, Keller, Alal and others have built a non-membrane cotton sample base with a production of 4800 kg per hectare.
Non-membrane cultivation of cotton, achieved productivity, savings, environmental, and increased overall effectiveness.
Zhang Jiang Hai, Farmakologist at the Third Department of Agriculture of Xinjiang Manufacturing Military Construction Group, said through almost six years of research and demonstration of technology without membrane cultivation, the production of without membrane cotton seed can fully production of 320 kg to 350 kg, maybe even higher.
“The prospects for promotion of non-membrane cotton cultivation technologies are great.”
Xianghai believes that the non-membrane cotton cultivation technology can fully solve the problem of soil rest membrane pollution, but there is still a certain gap compared to the current economic benefits of soil membrane cultivation.
“The support of cotton purchasing prices will be favorable for future promotion.”
The next step, he and his team will continue to do in-depth research and large-scale promotion of non-membrane cotton, making the non-membrane cotton industry strong and thoroughly solve the problem of soil pollution caused by the soil.

China's Foreign Minister and Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee on Friday that the relations between China and America are once again on the cross, and that if the two sides can actively integrate each other, expand positive cooperation and properly manage differences, they can open better prospects.
“The relationship between China and America is our common asset and needs us to care together.”

In his speech entitled “Opportunity or Challenge, Partners or Opposition,” Wang Yi said that the deep-level of the problem currently facing is that some American friends believe that China will also have to overcome and even challenge and replace the U.S. leadership in the world.
“This is obviously a major strategic misunderstanding.”
He said, but this self-imaginable speculation is spreading and increasing existing contradictions, triggering new doubts and making it more difficult to solve specific issues between China and America and face more resistance.
China’s way is a path to peaceful development.
Chinese people have never had genes that expanded to the outside.
We believe that countries can live in harmony and exchange mutual understanding.
Whether in the past, now or in the future, China will not follow the foreign model, nor will require other countries to copy China's practices.
Early in New York, when he met the former U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger, Wang Yi said that cooperation with China and America will win double and face the inevitable double defeat.
China is always committed to developing long-term and healthy and stable relations between China and America, achieving non-conflict non-conflict, mutual respect and cooperation win-win.

The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain President Trump’s ability to implement a 25% tariff threat on imported cars, while generally exempted from tariffs for passenger cars, pick-ups and car parts imported from Canada and Mexico.
If Trump imposes the so-called “Chapter 232” tariffs on cars for national security reasons, both Mexico and Canada would have a tax exemption of 2.6 million passenger vehicle quotas annually to the United States.
In accordance with the annexed arrangement, the pics produced in both countries will be fully exempted from customs.
If Trump raises car tariffs, Mexico will receive $1.08 billion in car parts tax exemption quotas annually, and Canada will receive $324 billion in quotas.
Both quotas are far higher than both countries' current production levels, providing space for growth for both exports.
Reuters, Washington/Mexico, September 28, - Mexico said on Friday, after several days of debate, the US President Trump administration and Canada are making practical efforts to resolve trade policy disputes, causing foreign borders to expect the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to maintain the form of a tripartite agreement.
Despite the lack of details, the above obvious progress is sufficient to push Mexican and the U.S. government to suddenly stop publishing plans of the two-party trade agreement, giving Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican candidate president Andreas Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government had submitted new counter-suggestions to the Canadian government and said he would continue to encourage all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Mexican Economic Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said the time to submit the text of the trade agreement to Mexico and the US legislation was delayed due to Canada and the U.S. government attempts to reach an agreement "very seriously".
“In the next 48 hours we will know whether we have reached a text of a three-party agreement or have to publish the text of the two-party agreement.”
Guadalajara said his U.S. and Canada counterparts have “specially requested” to delay the publication of the text.
A spokesman of the U.S. Trade Representative Office (USTR) did not comment on the text of the two-party trade agreement and the US-Canada consultations.
The Canadian Prime Minister’s Office and officials of the Foreign Ministry’s Office did not respond to the request of comment on the counter-suggestions.
According to foreign media, in a nursing center in the suburb of the South African capital, Ptolemy, two lions play together, and it is hard to see any abnormalities, but in fact they are not alone.
The University of Ptolemy announced: “This is the first lion born by artificial fertilization – the first pair of the world.”
Scientists in the campus are engaged in researching the reproductive system of the mother African lions.
Ganswint, director of the University of Beirutoria mammals Institute, said the two young lions born on August 25 were fairly healthy and normal.
His team passed 18 months of intense trials and finally achieved this breakthrough.
Ganswent told a media visit: “We collect sperm from a healthy lion.”
Subsequently, researchers and researchers performed artificial fertilization when the hormone content in the mother lion reached the appropriate level.
Ganswent said, “Fortunately, the result succeeded.”
He said the researchers “done several attempts, but unexpectedly, they didn’t spend too much energy.”
He said the previous research breakthrough could be repeatedly verified, and scientists hoped to use this technique to rescue large cats in threatening extinction.
The International Nature Conservation Union notes that the lions have been extincted in 26 countries of Africa, with the total number of surviving wild lions decreased by 43% over the past 20 years, with only about 20,000 remaining.
African lions are classified as vulnerable animals by the organization.
Ganswinter said, “If we don’t do anything for these animals, they will face extinction.”
He said that this new technique does not necessarily allow the lions to be feeding, but just injected sperm into the pregnant lions' body, just as North America and Europe's practices for the breeding of elephants.
South Korea’s export decline was the highest in more than two years in September, but analysts blame the decline for fewer working days and said global demand for Korean goods remains strong despite growing trade tensions between China and America.
Indeed, Korean exports have increased every month last month.
Furthermore, earlier published initial data showed a two-digit increase in exports during the first weeks of September before the long holidays.
South Korea’s exports in September fell the largest since July 2016, with a drop of 5.7% greater than Reuters’s estimated 11 analysts.
The initial value announced on Monday showed that exports in September were $506 billion, lower than $512 billion in August.
Despite the worsening US-Chinese trade disputes may lead to other dependent exports of China's neighbours, South Korean exports to China rose 7.8 percent in September, expanding for the 23rd month in a row.
South Korean exports to the US fell 11.8 percent, due to oil products sales.
South Korean memory chips and oil products overseas sales rose 28.3% and 13.5%, respectively, despite market concerns that the so-called “super cycle” of chips may have already reached the top.
“H, the impact of trade conflicts will be unavoidable, as Korean exports are largely dependent on the US and Chinese markets.”
Imports dropped 2.1 percent to $40.8 billion, not as a growth of 3.1% as Reuters estimated.
The initial trade surplus in September was $9.9 billion, higher than $9.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said the global manufacturing industry will remain vibrant, which is a beneficial factor for Korean exports.
The statement stated that “the increase in export prices caused by oil prices will also be beneficial for exports in the second half of this year.”
“But the continuing trade conflict between the US and China, along with the increased market volatility after the U.S. rise in interest rates, are negative pressure on exports.”
Average exports per working day in September rose to $2.6 billion, and $2.2 billion in August.
South Korea's Mid-Autumn holiday falls on September 24-26 and therefore only 19.5 working days in September, four days fewer than the same period last year.
South Korean exports grew 4.7% compared to the same period last year.
According to the Japanese/Markit Purchasing Managers Index, Korean manufacturing activity rose back in September, but was supported by domestic orders, as orders from China and Japan dropped, which threatened to cover other export prospects.
North Korean media criticize U.S. failure to relieve Korean sanctions
The North Korean Labour News published a signed commentary on September 30, criticizing the U.S. seeking a dialogue with Korea but not relieve its sanctions, calling it a "self-conflict" practice.
U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo said "the key to implementing sanctions against Korea is to the desnuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," emphasizing the position of the United States on continuing to implement the UN sanctions resolution.
In the joint statement of Singapore to America, the two sides pledged to build a new North-American relationship that is adapted to the desires of both Korean people expect peaceful prosperity.
The US, on the one hand, increased sanctions and demanded dialogue, is undoubtedly contradictory.
The article says that if to build new relations with North America, build a permanent consolidated peace system on the Korean peninsula, achieving a complete desnuclearization of the Korean peninsula, trust building should be put in the first place, starting with what can be done, step by step.
The article also says the United States should understand that sanctions imposed on North Korea cannot work.
The article says even the "North Dewensk" before the "Kasan" also praised the U.S. military.
The National Interest magazine quotes the U.S. Navy's opinion: "We will face strong potential opponents.
The U.S. Army's current Commander General in the European Navy Fogo also praised the submarine "North Dewensk".
“The submarine is impressive.Looking at the development of the Russian Navy and how the resources are used, you will know that its main efforts in research and development are first to strengthen the submarine fleet.”
But the National Interest magazine still believes that the United States retains its advantage over Russia in this area.
Fogh said, “I believe Western countries still have an unparalleled advantage.”
Previously, the Russian Navy will be preparing the "Kasan" submarine in 2019.
"Kasan", "New Siberia", "Krasnoyarsk", "Alhangelsk" multi-purpose submarines are all improved "White Candle-M" type, with a discharge of 13800 tons, a depth of 520 meters underground, 64 people prepared, 31 submarine speeds, will carry the cruise missiles with watermines, fishing mines and "Cammarine" and "Cammarine".

Ignor the U.S. threat!
EU or Iran will make an agreement on crude oil
The U.S. government said it would reboot a new round of sanctions against Iran in November and even urged other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
However, the US allies did not seem to listen to it.
According to the New York Times, Iran’s Foreign Minister Zarif revealed in an interview on 29 December that despite the U.S. threats to sanctions any country doing business with Iran, Tehran is closer to reach an agreement with the EU on the sale of raw oil.
The core purpose of the agreement was to attempt to create a new payment mechanism, namely to replace the transactions in the dollar in a way of valuation of easy commodities or currencies.
The purpose of this approach is to want to circumvent the United States and prevent the United States from obstructing financial transfers.
Meanwhile, although the EU is committed to promoting the agreement, some French and UK officials are concerned that this would be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States against the U.S. withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal if the agreement is implemented.
In an hour’s interview, Zarif’s words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement has the ability to “exclude” the traditional allies of the United States, it effectively breaks the action of the US attempts to cut Iranian incomes.
“This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit,” Zarif said, under the 2015 agreement, countries have the legitimate right to trade with Iran.
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said: “No sovereign state or organization can accept others to decide with whom they can trade.”
However, she also predicted that before the U.S. government imposes the next step of sanctions in November, U.S. leaders could take a range of financial instruments aimed at banks, traders and nations that trade with Tehran.
In May this year, the U.S. government unilaterally announced withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal and said it could not permanently ban Iran production of nuclear fuel.
The U.S. threatened to ban companies purchasing Iranian oil and other goods from operating in the US.
This threat led some companies to retire Tehran and the Iranian currency crashed.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Daudard have canceled billions of dollars in Iran.
British and French officials once said the U.S. government could "take up the wind".
According to a recent Turkish media report, U.S. sanctions seem to have no significant impact on Iranian oil exports.
Iran’s oil minister Zhangane said no country has stopped buying Iranian oil except South Korea.
Zarif and Iran's President Rouhani both believe that a series of actions by the United States were aimed at "tempting" Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also ignorant of a series of U.S. oral attacks, and when asked whether the United States would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, “It’s a regime change strategy, that’s the real purpose of the US.”

Reporters from the National Health Commission learned that the incidence of malnutrition in children in China has decreased compared to decades ago, and the incidence of overweight increased significantly.
Experts point out that keeping a healthy weight, the most important concept is “healing unhealing”, strongly promote science fitness and reasonable nutrition.
According to the recent publication of the National Health Commission, China Youth Health Education Core Information and Release (2018 edition), the key toining a healthy weight is reasonable nutrition and scientific movement.
Overweight, obese and blindly lose weight are not beneficial to health.
The health problems behind “small fat” should not be ignored.
Chinese Disease Prevention Centre for Nutrition and Health (CIC) said overweight is a threat to normal development of adolescents, affecting their mental, behavior, cognitive and intellectuality, and even leading to high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high blood fat.
At the same time, overweight in adolescents is likely to persist until adulthood, increasing the risk of adolescents to develop chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes after adulthood.
The Nutrition and Health Survey of the Chinese residents in 2010-2012 showed that children aged 6-17 in China were 9.6% overweight rate, obesity rate 6.4% and the two were 16%.
Meanwhile, children’s teenage overweight shows high-quality characteristics in boys than girls, in cities than rural areas, and the rate of overweight increased significantly over the past decades.
How do teenagers deal with overweight?
Chuan, deputy director of the Research Center for Science Fitness and Health Promotion of the National Sports General, stated that the main cause of obesity in teenagers at present is because of excessive calorie intake and insufficient physical activity.
For this simplicity of obesity, the focus should be on science exercises plus reasonable diet control.
The most important concept of keeping a healthy weight is “healing without illness”, an important part of which is conducting a comprehensive Cope education to schools, parents and students, spreading the dangers of overweight and obesity, and raising adolescents’ preventive awareness.
Adolescents should be regularly examined, monitoring growth development indicators such as height and weight, and early detection and scientific assessment of whether there are problems with overweight and obesity, in order to take timely intervention.
For teenagers who have already overweight, Tint Steel strongly recommends that, in addition to initially scientifically organizing diets and exercise, teenagers are in a special physiological stage, should avoid using hunger or half hunger therapy to control and lose weight, and should not blindly take weight loss drugs.

Reuters Nagoya November 5 - Japan's central bank president, Heeda Tokyo, said on Monday that the central bank realized that the long-term implementation of a super-sensitive monetary policy could press the profit rate of financial institutions and potentially damage the stability of the country's banking system.
But he said, given low inflation and uncertainty in foreign economies, the Central Bank of Japan needs to maintain its massive stimulus plans while focusing closely on the disadvantages of its policies.
“The Central Bank of Japan fully recognizes that the strength of the financial institutions will be increasingly affected under the continued monetary relief,” Heather Tōma said in a speech to Nagoya’s corporate leaders.
He said that if financial institutions take risks more actively to compensate for the effects of low interest rate reduction over the years, the banking system is likely to be turbulent once a serious negative impact occurs.
“While these risks are not large at the moment, the central bank will carefully monitor the developments of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures,” he said.
The Japanese Central Bank Conference record published earlier on Monday showed that the Japanese Central Bank Policy Committee discussed the cost of long-term relaxation policy increasing at the parliament meeting in September.
Meeting records showed that a member stated that if the economy continues to expand, “The Japanese Central Bank will have more flexible space in terms of policy in the future.”
The meeting records showed that another member stated that, given its limits for the duration of the policy, the committee should discuss how long the Japanese central bank could maintain the stimulation policy.
The Japanese central bank will evaluate the financial risks of its relief policy, while also considering the uncertainty surrounding Japan’s economic prospects, which could affect global demand due to trade friction and rising protectionism.
“The impact of such issues on the Japanese economy is temporarily limited,” he said.
“But as the problem continues, the impact on the Japanese economy may grow,” he added.
“It is necessary to continuously conduct a strong monetary relief policy while considering positive and negative impacts in a balanced way,” he said.
Despite the increased disadvantages of radical stimulus programs, such as long-term low interest rate corrosion of profits of financial institutions, low inflation forces the Japanese central bank to maintain the plan.
Japan’s central bankined monetary policy last month; facing the risks brought by a global trade conflict, he excluded the possibility of recent interest rise.

Xi Jinping gave a very important speech at the private enterprise conference, inserting strong confidence in the advancement of the private economy towards a wider stage.
Xi Jinping emphasized that “Let entrepreneurs go out of their minds and make it easy to move forward” triggered strong noise among large entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market dynamics come from people, especially from entrepreneurs, and from entrepreneurship.
During the wave of 40 years of reform opening, tens of millions of entrepreneurs have entered into innovation stories, the growth of the entrepreneurs group is great, continuously pushing the breakdown of the Chinese economy forward.
For a while, people in society have made some denial and suspicious statements about the private economy.
Wrong statements such as the so-called “private economic out-of-theory” and “new public-private joint-theory” raise some entrepreneurs’ concerns and concerns.
Recently, some private enterprises have faced a lot of difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have impact on some export enterprises; rapid adjustment of demand structure brings pressure to transformation upgrade; some policies are incoordinated, policy effects are co-directed, or a simple way of working, resulting in some initiatives, good policies have the opposite effect, etc.
A variety of factors interact, the private economy faces difficulties, some private enterprises operate faces difficulties, and entrepreneurs show a lot of concern.
In this context, correction of cognitive misconceptions, removing entrepreneurs' mindset, allowing the company to develop, government to develop, concern market trust and development expectations, has a particular deep real meaning.
The meeting once again emphasized the important argument of “three unchanged”: “The position and role of non-public economy in the economic and social development of our country has not changed!”
From profound advancing the liberation of powers, establishing a power listing system to creating a law-rule environment that protects the legitimate interests of entrepreneurs, creating a fair competition market environment, shaping the environment of respect for entrepreneurs throughout the society, in recent years, the level of attention of the party center to entrepreneurs, and the stability of the system has been unprecedented.
The conference also clearly proposed policy initiatives to strongly support the development of private enterprises in six aspects, and launched a series of practical actions dedicated to “light forward” for private enterprises.
All these encourages the group of entrepreneurs and give more expectations to society.
The mistake is opened, the policy is set, the key is to implement.
To constantly create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve the difficulties in development, help accomplish China's economic transformation upgrade; to make entrepreneurs feel fair in the market competition, feel safe in legal operations, feel respect in social life, inspire innovation dynamics and create potential.
The process of entering the Chinese economy towards high-quality development requires more entrepreneurs to express ambitions, and also provides more space and stage for entrepreneurs to play creativity.
We have reason to believe that with further deepening reforms and eliminating barriers, the civil economy will have better prospects of development and opportunities to move towards a wider stage.

With the continuous deepening of the country's "One Belt and Road" construction, as one of the most convenient paths to connect China to Southeast Asia, the entrance flow from the river port is steadily growing.

During the 73th UN Assembly, the parties released some positive information about the issue of the Korean Peninsula.
The Korean President Xi Jinping refers to the Korean's "irreversible" commitment to abandon nuclear weapons and said U.S. President Trump and North Korea's top leader Kim Jong-un might meet before the end of this year.
The U.S. Department of State later said the Secretary of State Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to promote the promise to implement a meeting of the U.S. Korean leaders in Singapore.
Since the beginning of this year, Korea has broken the ice to open the way to dialogue, Korean and Korean American leaders have held meetings, the major tendency to slow down the situation on the Peninsula continues, and the principles of dialogue to solve the problem of the Peninsula can also be insisted.
Firstly, the “essence of the peninsula issue is a security issue” has not changed, achieving peace in the peninsula, the key is to properly and balanced resolving the reasonable security concerns of the parties, rather than pressing one another and emphasizing their own claim.
Second, in the dialogue on the achievement of the non-nuclearization of the Peninsula, the stakeholders differed in the steps and ways to the non-nuclearization of the Peninsula, due to the long-term lack of political trust between North America, the “who is first who after” is still strong.
Last week at the UN headquarters in New York City, the United Nations headquarters held different voices around the Korean sanctions issue again highlighted the two points of the “unchanged” on the peninsula issue.
US Secretary of State Pompeo insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the North Peninsula is fully desnuclear.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Lavrov emphasized the principle of “action to respond with action” and noted that “the weakening trend of sanctions should be the same as the steps taken by North Korea on the progressive abandonment of nuclear roads.”
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to complete, comprehensive and accurate implementation of the Security Council’s resolution, but the pressure is not the purpose, the implementation of sanctions and the promoting of a political solution are the requirements of the Security Council’s resolution, both of which cannot be dismissed, not only choosing one.
As China’s Foreign Minister and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, taking into account the current positive progress in relations between Korea and the United States, China believes that it would be necessary to consider the implementation of reversible provisions in time, thereby encouraging North Korea and concerned parties to take greater steps towards the desnuclearization.
Considering the past, every progress in the non-nuclearization and peace process of the Peninsula requires sufficient political courage from both sides.
At present, face to the increasing expectations of the international community to promote the political solution of the peninsula issue, the parties concerned should especially demonstrate the political position, make political decisions, implementing commitments, resolving the issues, continue to take the opposite steps, parallel to advance the process of non-nuclearization of the peninsula with the establishment of a peninsula peace mechanism, together to establish permanent peace in the peninsula.

Free vaccinations include residents of Macau: 6 months to 18 years old, 50 years old and older, pregnant women, all patients with chronic diseases including obese people (i.e. those who have a BMI of 30 or more), as well as children’s, kindergarten, primary and secondary school staff, all health professionals, as well as residents of Macau who work in gambling entertainment sites.
At the same time, the Health Service believes that other people who have been vaccinated, including the public sector, will initially contact the concerned agency to arrange vaccinations by the health center after receiving the list.
In order to facilitate vaccination and reduce vaccination time, the Health Administration will send medical personnel to the secondary, primary, kindergarten and kindergarten in Australia between October and December this year to provide collective vaccination for children, young children, young children, teachers and employees, and also organize collective vaccinations for people to elderly and disabled hospitals, a larger number of public sectors or other institutions.
If students and young children have failed to participate in collective vaccinations, they can have a Macau resident identity card, a Health Office user card, an influenza vaccine card (if any), a student card, a staff card or a professional certificate document from 3 December 2018 to the Count Yin Integrated Hospital vaccination station or a health center.
The Health Agency reminds residents that those who had been vaccinated with the influenza vaccine 2017 to 2018 between September 2017 and August 2018 still need to be vaccinated with the new season flu vaccine from September 2018, because the flu antigen component contained in the 2018-2019 North Hemisphere flu vaccine has been updated, targeting the winter 2018-2019 and seasonal flu 2019 in the North Hemisphere.
The influenza peak periods in Macau usually occur between March 1 and March each year, later than the warm regions (such as northern China and Japan), and the Health Authority urges those who are more likely to develop complications after influenza infection such as elderly, children, pregnant women, obese and chronic patients, and those who are frequently exposed to high-risk to vaccinate as soon as possible.

The Japanese Central Bank’s short-term quarterly survey published on Monday showed that the trust of Japan’s large manufacturers in the September season reached the lowest level in over a year, due to increased raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affecting production, making companies feel stressed.
This survey has almost showed that the growing global trade friction has hit the trust of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a comprehensive trade war broke the company’s business prospects and could threaten the company’s capital spending.
Active capital spending is a highlight in the Japanese economy.
The survey questioned the view of the Japanese Central Bank of a stable economic expansion would help push the inflation speed to the 2% target, despite signs that companies are gradually transferring costs to customers.
“In the context of the global trade war, manufacturers’ confidence has stagnated due to export slowing and factories’ weakening production,” said Nano Wu, chief researcher at the Agricultural Kim Complex Institute.
“The trust is still high, and as the company’s profits are improving and prices rise, I don’t think the trust will continue to fall.”
A short-term survey showed that September’s large manufacturing landscape assessment index dropped from exact 21 to exact 19 three months ago, worsening for the third consecutive season.
The average estimated market is 22.
The September’s large non-industrial economic assessment index dropped from the exact 24 in June to the exact 22, worsening for the first time in eight quarters.
Reuters’s investigation is 22nd.
The survey shows that large manufacturing and non- manufacturing landscape estimates in December remain unchanged.
Investors don’t care about the decline in the economic judgment index of short-term enterprises, the Japanese stock market index.N225 rose to its 27th high on Monday, because the continuous devaluation of Japanese companies helped improve export profit prospects.
Capital expenditure is stable.
Despite the decrease of corporate trust, the latest shortcomings show that corporate capital expenditure plans are stable thanks to renewed production capacity and increased investments in robotics and automation to address the lack of labor force resulting in the ageing of the population.
The Central Bank’s brief survey shows that large enterprises plan to increase capital expenditure by 13.4% in the fiscal year ended in March 2019.
In the previous short-term survey, it was 13.6%.
South Shui said all corporate capital expenditure plans have grown by 8.5 percent this fiscal year, close to the pace of the Japanese bubble economy.
“Given the highest profits forecast from now on, capital expenditure is still available for further growth, but this depends largely on the impact of trade war’s trust.”
Short-sight surveys show that companies have increased their capacity to transfer costs, and large enterprises have produced the price index of just seven, which is a high point in the past decade, which is an inspiring sign that reflects Japan’s efforts to counter recession.
The measurement of the employment situation of large enterprises touches negative 23 to the highest level since 1992, highlighting the tension of the employment market.
Benefiting from strong corporate spending, the Japanese economy has rebuilt in its contractions since March 1st this year.
But summer trade friction increased and supply chains are interfered by natural disasters, the Japanese economic prospects that depend on export.
If calculated in dollars, the export of services has increased by 16.4%.
The Department of Commerce website quoted the head of the Department of Commerce said that the total imports of emerging services exchanges exceeded $10,000 on August 1 and grew faster than overall.
Of these, emerging services import imports have a total of 11,383.9 billion, a growth of 20.9%, higher than the total growth of services imports by 10.4 percentage points, pulling emerging services accounting for increasing almost 3 percentage points.
In terms of service exports, on August 1st, service exports continued the rapid growth rate since this year, with export growth rate greater than import growth rate of 5.7 percent.
The top three areas of growth are telecommunications and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, insurance services, with 61.1%, 38.8%, and 26.5%, respectively.
The head of the trade department also notes that the share of imports of emerging services increased gradually on August 1st.
On August 1st, emerging services imports grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6% of service imports, a growth of 1.6 percent points compared to the same period last year.
The imports of financial services, intellectual property use fees, telecommunications computers and information services have grown more than 20%, respectively by 47.1%, 23.3%, and 23.2%.

President of the International Space Federation Jean-Iv Legar said at the opening ceremony that the global space is no longer part of only a few countries and institutions, and the number of participants this year has increased significantly than previously, indicating that more and more institutions and individuals are joining it.
He calls on the countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation, to promote the development of space.
Vice-Minister of China's Department of Industry and Information and Director of the National Space Agency, Xi Jinping, presented China's space plan at the exchange event, and said China will expand international cooperation in the space field to contribute to human space activities.
Related agencies such as China Space Technology Group, China Space Science Group and several representatives of private enterprises attended, showing the latest achievements of China's space, including various types of carrier rocket, satellite and space technology applications products.
The International Space Conference has been held annually since 1950 and is the largest event in the world's aviation industry.
This five-day conference is jointly organized by the International Space Federation, the International Academy of Space Sciences, the Centre for Applied Technology and Micro-Gravity Research Center, the International Space Law Association.
Reuters Beijing November 5 - A press release released by China's Foreign Trade Center on Sunday said the exchange showed China's foreign trade situation is still complex, with 80.6% of companies expect exports in 2018 to be better than last year or last year.
However, considering the cost of domestic raw materials, labor, integrated elements such as continuously increasing and increasing the impact of China-American trade friction in the external environment, the exhibitors at the same time consider the export situation next year unoptimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th General Meeting, Vice Secretary-General of the General Meeting, Press spokesman and Vice-Director of the Chinese Foreign Trade Center Xi Jinping said that the number of visitors abroad and export agreements at the same time decreased.
This time the buyers attended 189,812 people from 215 countries and regions, with a reduction of 1.11% in comparison.
Export transactions have reached 2,064,94 billion yuan (combined 298,6 billion) with a drop of 1% comparison.
From the market point of view, Japan, the ten countries of the ASEAN, the “British Four” countries and Korea have grown by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2%, 2.5%, respectively, and by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8%, respectively for traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the EU.

Xi Jinping said, as a clear rain and wind indicator for China’s foreign trade, the general exchange buyer status and export deal data show that China’s foreign trade development will still face many uncertain instability factors next year.
But with profound progress in supply side structural reform, as well as recent national and local policy measures such as "Six-stain" are continuously introduced, new drivers for China's foreign trade development are accelerating the accumulation, and the diversification of the enterprise market is constantly making new progress, which are important bases and strong conditions for foreign trade development.
“In combination of the factors, China’s foreign trade imports are expected to maintain steady growth throughout the year, and the quality and efficiency will further improve,” Xi Jinping said.
China’s Customs Office announced that exports have grown by 14.5% in September, imports have grown by 14.3% in September, trade spread in September was $316.9 billion, and exports have grown by September and trade spread both the highest since February this year.
Despite the continuous rise of trade friction, China’s export performance in September remains significantly exceeding expectations, foreign demand rise, enterprises investing the Yuan exchange rate before imposing tariffs, or the main support factor, also demonstrated to some degree the resilience of China’s foreign trade, the Chinese trade war’s pressure on trust, the impact on the industrial chain, analysts believe the challenges of China’s foreign trade may appear in the four quarters or next year.
Reuters’s survey showed that the U.S. fund managers in September suggested increased cash holding and continue to remain cautious, since the U.S. and China launched the latest round of mutual import tariffs, and there was no signs of slowing the dispute.
But according to the 12 fund managers involved in the survey, the North American asset configuration has risen to the highest since June 2017, while the UK, the euro area, especially the emerging markets have declined.
The global stock configuration accounts for an average of 56.6%, the bond accounts for 35.5%, basically consistent with the last month’s survey.
Its most obvious change was that the cash dividend ratio rose to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager of a large fund company said, “Some economic data brought confidence to the market, but trade war remains the biggest concern, so be better prepared to enter when the market falls.”
But fund managers still preferred shares in September, especially U.S. shares, even though U.S. shares are considered to be high-priced.
Today, Shanghai, the world’s first large national-scale exhibition on import-themes – the China International Import Exhibition, officially opened in the expectations of all.
A exhibition is like a “window” that makes the world better understand a city and a country.
Through this “window” of the entrance exhibition, people can see the “open China” towards a higher level; through this “window” of the entrance exhibition, the world welcomes the mutual benefit of the “reform open again” of China.
“For a country, open is like broken a butterfly, even if it is a momental pain, it will change to a newborn.”
Secretary-General Xi Jinping’s conclusion of the Open Road, highlighted an important reason for “Why China Can”.
Looking back to reform opening for 40 years, China, who dare to enter the world market in the Oceania Sea, although faced storms and winds, always in an open position facing all risks challenges, constantly releasing internal power and constantly improving competitiveness.
It can be said that China, using its own real achievements, has strongly interpreted the value and meaning of the open.
Standing at a new historical beginning, holding an import-themed exhibition, is a major decision made with Xi Jinping’s core party focus to promote a new round of high-level foreign opensions, a major initiative of China’s initiative to open markets to the world, a practical action of China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization, showing the strong and clear desire to “the door of China’s open will not be closed, but will only be larger.”
And the country’s exhibitors’ sign-up and the position of “one demand” is the greatest confirmation and best response to China’s open economy in a larger, wider field and deeper development.
More importantly, the current global economic order has gone on a crossroads.
Some countries have built the high walls of trade protectionism, the old way back to unilateralism, increased the concerns of the international community about the prospects of free trade, and added many uncertainty to the global economy that is positive to warming.
In the context of such an era, the event at Zhou Jiang has reflected China's defence against free trade, allowing the world to see open markets, share China's confidence in the future and China's responsibility.
Go alone fast, go far away.
China opened her heart, embracing the world, not only has been able to promote its development, but also bringing a vast “China opportunity” to countries and regions of the world.
In recent years, it has been promoted and promoted the co-building of “One Belt and One Way”, launching the establishment of Asia-Pacifications, establishing a Silk Road Fund ... China has provided a range of international public products, providing real export markets, development opportunities and employment, allowing national enterprises to develop “speed cars” “flight cars” via China.
The exhibition is also a public product, a large platform for global economic cooperation.
Over this platform, more than 3,000 companies in more than 130 countries and regions, with high-quality products and services, have made a new step in the Chinese market.
In addition to domestic companies, there are also domestic consumers.
By building this “Optional Advance” platform, consumer upgrades provide multi-channel quality supply to meet the personalized, diversified and differentiated consumer needs of the people.
As the door of China opened, the greater, the goods flow, the things make use of it, the steps towards a better life will be stronger.
From a more macro-scale point of view, the importance of the exhibition is beyond the scope of economics and trade, rather than looking forward to the future, spreading the ideas of open, inclusive, universal, balance, joint win, forming a consensus on today’s challenges.
The world is good, China is good; China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to bringing the world greatness and fulfillment; we are more aspiring toward a higher level of “Open China” with the world to build a brilliant future for the community of human destiny.

More than 90 percent of Brazilian women voters said the presidential candidates did not consider women's needs.
Data published by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) recently show that more than 90% of Brazilian women don’t think presidential candidates consider women’s needs.
Today, the number of women in Brazil has reached 1.07 million, and if women across Brazil gathered together to form a country, the country’s population would rank the 13th place in the world, twice more than the population of Spain.
In Brazil, female voters account for 52% of the total voters, and men account for 48%, while women have a very high percentage of voters, women are only 10% in the Brazilian parliament.
In 193 countries around the world, Brazilian women are ranked only 154th in political participation, higher than in Arab countries.
After over 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women still have failed to obtain the rights they deserve.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori notes that the cause of this phenomenon is the result of the interaction between ancient ancestral society, racism and capitalist values.
“Politics should be made of the same society by democracy, citizens’ rights, identity, access to public products and made up of multiple social groups; but Brazil’s politics belongs to a group’s monopoly and the majority of the population is not represented.”
A previous study conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Motor Vehicles (Locomotiva) also found that 94 percent of Brazilian women don’t think politicians generated by the election can represent their rights, 90 percent of Brazilian women disagree with politicians’ decisions and 93 percent of women disagree with the current government’s policy.
“We need to reverse the problem of the lack of representation of women in parliament, and the Brazilian political system remains affected by inequality.
Despite the lack of women’s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76% of women believe they can play a role in democratic elections, and 72% of women are interested in politics.
Moreover, 55% of women believe democracy is the best way to make women suffer less prejudice.

Because growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets is mostly unpowerful, the United States becomes increasingly the main drivers of global economic growth.
On September 23, 2018, a container truck parked in the port of New Jersey, USA.
But because the current growth of the United States is due to the time struggling to reduce taxes, the country’s economy is also taken close attention from the outside world.

Despite Barclays optimistic about the U.S. economic prospects before the end of this year, the bank acknowledges that it is more difficult to predict a further time.

Despite the turbulence of the global financial markets, the Hong Kong Financial Administration said on Monday that foreign currency fund’s investment revenue decreased by 97 percent per year in the third quarter of this year, but performed better than the previous season, due to the high increase in foreign shares under the Central American trade war, and foreign currency losses were also significantly narrowed.
According to the latest data of the Gold Authority, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded $1.6 billion in investment in September 7, 2018, significantly lower than $6.18 billion in the same period last year, but better than $100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Kim’s Board’s president, Chengdu Chengdu, said in a legislation that during the beginning of the Chinese and American trade war, Hong Kong and the emerging market shares were opposed to the stock index, until the end of September and early October after the U.S. stock market index continued to top, market emotions began to reverse, as investors gradually realized that the trade war is bad for the United States itself.
“Change in market mood is good, and if trade war has only a unilateral impact, it will not help to solve things.”
But at the same time he noted that “if the Chinese-American trade war fails to resolve, the volatility of the financial market will continue to increase.”
In the third quarter of this year, the Foreign Exchange Fund in Hong Kong’s stock investment losses were reduced by 8% to 4.7 billion UAH compared to the previous quarter, and foreign stock investment revenues increased by 172% to 12.8 billion UAH; foreign currency losses are 16.2 billion UAH, bond revenues are 9.7 billion UAH, periodically reduced by 24% and 31% respectively, mainly reflecting the general increase in the main currencies of the dollar during the season and the U.S. interest rate rise by 3 centimeters in September.
The foreign currency funds are mainly used to support the portland dollar.
Hong Kong has implemented a linked exchange rate system linked to the Hong Kong dollar since 1983.
With regard to Hong Kong's current financial situation, Mr. Chen said the economic and asset market uncertainty increased, the risk of downright increased, but Hong Kong's financial system is stable, well defensive and strong resilience.
“Hong Kong’s international capital is sufficient, with a net asset worth of 1.4 trillion dollars equal to four times GDP, 2.5 times higher than Singapore and 0.6 times Japan, enough to deal with a recession cycle or reversion.”
The recent portfolios rupture continues to fall back and expand with the interest rate with the dollar, Chen Dean pointed out that the exchange rate of the portfolios rupture was once risen to over 400 base points on September 21, the market is generally considered to be mainly associated with the growth of portfolios rupture, after which the portfolios rupture spreads to the level close to 7.80-7.84, until the recent portfolios rupture continues to fall back, with the dollar interest rate expanded, could attract the market of portfolios rupture, buy the dollar swap activity, making the portfolios again trigger the weak exchange assurance for a long time before.
But he believes that as the Hong Kong Bank’s interest cycle starts and the Hong Kong Dollar interest rate normalization continues, the future Hong Kong Dollar interest rate is lower than the dollar interest rate will change.
“Hong Kong’s interest rate will be more consistent with the dollar’s interest rate, and we must be more careful to manage the risks and be prepared to respond to market volatilities.”
Due to the sufficient amount of funds, the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation of the depreciation
From the middle of May to September, the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar was close to $7.85 to $1 most of the time.

The Gold Authority purchased Port Dollar and exchanged dollars at a level of 7.85 according to the contact exchange rate system to maintain the Port Dollar's exchange rate stable.
Gold Authority purchased approximately $52.2 billion under the weak exchange warranty mechanism in May and August.

With the “Two Children’s Economy”, the growth of the mother-in-law market, from the north to the three-quarters cities, various kinds of monthly assembly have emerged all over the world.
Currently, the fierce monthly meeting meets the consumer needs of the masses, charging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, but at the same time is in a shameful situation, the institution has not yet a limits, and there is still an empty zone for regulation.
The National Market Regulation Headquarters recently conducted the national "Quality Month" series of events in 2018 and journalists came to a five-star monthly center in Tianjin to visit the certification experience of mother-in-law care services.
The general Monthly Centre provides newborn care, nutrition, and postpartum repair plastic services.

At the same time, in order to satisfy the needs of the new mom, from the initial wound care of the baby to the middle of the baby's late cosmetic care, providing medical care programs such as cosmetic treatment to help mothers recover their shape.
A new mother in the house told reporters that she was scheduled to go to the moon’s house eight months earlier.
The service project of the Monthly Board directly affects the level of comfort during the maternal childhood and the condition of body recovery, some small-scale Monthly Board offers only a few simple monthly services, there are desinfectant hygiene irregularities, easy cross-infection, dieting single unknown and so on.
The head of the Moonlight Center said they were the only one of all five-star Moonlight centers in Tianjin to receive a B-level service certification.
“While some customers initially don’t understand the meaning of level B certification, it’s important for the long-term development of the company by empowering a firm strictly standardized process management,” he said.
Panelifen, Vice-Director of the National Market Regulation General Certification Authority, said service certification is a new type of certification system based on customer perception, focusing on organization’s quality management and service characteristics satisfaction, is an important component of the national quality infrastructure, playing an active role in improving the proportion of quality service supply and enhancing China’s international competitiveness of services.

Panelife said to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually expand the coverage of service certification in health, education, sports, finance, e-commerce, promoting the supply side reform and quality improvement of the service industry.
Reuters Hong Kong November 5th - Hong Kong's building prices dropped two consecutive months after the peak, Hong Kong Financial Administration chairman Chen Dean said on Monday that it still takes time to observe whether the building market has entered the next cycle, and if confirmed, it could be considered to have a strict policy of continuous reverse cycle relief.
Chen Dean also pointed out that if the price of the building reverses, the first impact will be those who are employed at the highest time of the building market, but the price of the building is expected to decline rapidly, such as the Asian financial storm in 1997, and the chances of the citizens to sell the property significantly lower.
Chen Dean, who led several senior members of the Gold Administration at the legislative meeting, said that there could be a continuous relaxation measure if confirmed that the building has entered a decline cycle.
“But now we see only a few weeks of data, relaxing is still too early to say, it still takes more time to see if the building market is entering the downline cycle.”
Since the 10th of 2009, the Gold Authority has already introduced eight round reverse cycle measures to significantly strengthen the disclosure of various properties, including reducing the disclosure number, disclosure applicants must pass rigorous pressure tests, etc., to improve bank risk management and shock resistance capacity.
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest rate cycle, the Hong Kong Private Housing Price Index saw a top drop for two consecutive months on September 8th, with a monthly drop further expanded to 1.44% in September.
However, the accumulated increase in the first three seasons of this year is still 10.2%.
The financial situation of the households in the quantitative capacity of Hong Kong to face financial risks remains healthy, in the second quarter of this year, the percentage of self-resident households in Hong Kong has reached 66%, higher than the average of 2009-11; the average of the new disclosed disclosed average and the supply and income ratio of new disclosed disclosed disclosed 47% and 34%, respectively, and significantly improved 64% and 41% compared to 2009-11 respectively.
But Chen Dean said the high earthquake resistance does not represent the damages that already employed citizens will not suffer from the economy, as the property estimates will fall, and those who buy buildings at the peak period will be the first place.
While the financial authorities strictly strengthen banks’ loans to disclosure loans, employers can also obtain high-percentage disclosure loans by disclosure insurance or providing disclosure loans by developers.
Chen Dean said that, along with the developer’s disclosure loans, borrowers can be up to 85-90% of disclosure, and a negative asset (i.e. the real estate market value falls below the amount of unpaid disclosure loans).
However, the Vice-President of the Gold Administration, Yongjiang, noted that the authorities estimate the total amount of high-percentage disclosures provided by developers, accounting for only 2-2.5 percent of the total bank disclosures, and the proportion remains lower.
At Hong Kong’s negative asset peak in 2003, the negative asset number was more than 100,000, accounting for 22% of buildings suppliers.
By the third season of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero-negative assets seven consecutive seasons.

Systemic spark ulcer is a chronic suspicious disease of the accumulated and whole body polygonal organs, which has been previously considered as a “incurable disease”.
Due to its mechanisms of occurrence of the disease unknown, the diagnosis is difficult and the lack of effective treatment cannot be removed.
Recently, a joint team, a researcher at the University of Chihuahua Life Sciences at the University of China and the Director of the Water Immunity Center of the People's Hospital of Beijing, found a mutual variation in human immunoglobulin in the presence of increased sensitivity of systemic liver liver liver, and this variation involved in controlling the immune B cells.
In short, the two teams have confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of systemic spots ulcer.
According to one of the authors of the article, Mr. Zhuang, the team collected almost 2,000 large samples of systematic liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver liver l

This is not a shortcut, but a law.
A lawyer carries an arrow to court court?
The news was really exciting at the first time, and the bowl was also exploded in the legal circle.
Furthermore, the Fukushima Lawyers have sentenced a fine of 500 yen to the attorneys involved, and in writing recommended the Fukushima Lawyers Association to conduct an investigation.
According to the New York Times, the Sunshine Law Council issued an official announcement that the actions of the two lawyers do not involve violations of the law, and no penalties are imposed by law.
According to multiparty reports, the processing of the Sunshine Lawyers' Council was not short or contradicted, but was approved by the Sunshine Senate.
Together, events that could initially trigger tensions within the legal community are eventually resolved properly.
The reverse of the situation comes from a more comprehensive recovery of the truth: the attorney in question carrying an arrow with the accused’s killer, the same model, the same model, but not broken, as an auxiliary evidence only in the proof ring, and there is no threatening action or the subjective intention of “dangering the security of the court”.
There are four very important details to consider whether the behavior of the attorney in question is illegal: the first, the local court has previously opened two trials, showing only photos of the attorney, showing the need of the attorney’s raw material from a defence point of view; the second, the attorney has been purchased only an hour before the attorney’s opening, and the attorney was not willing to seek the judge’s consent, but objectively unable to contact the judge; the third, the entire attorney has not been excessive or incorrectly used; the fourth, the attorney in question openly acknowledged the mistake for the first time and apologized to the court.
Combined with these facts, we can see that the attorney concerned has nothing to do with the “bearing out of court” but just to defend.
After clarification of the whole facts passed, the Sunshine Lawyers Council did not push the boat into the water, but made an unpunishable decision under pressure.
This decision also has been tested by facts and laws.
When it comes to the court without the court’s permission, being taken as an arrow of a control knife to the court, it is very easy to cause anxiety and misunderstanding.
For safety and caution, the previous penalties and legal recommendations of the Sunset Senate were also unprecedented.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from persecution of lawyers, the Supreme Law issued in 2014 the National Court Judicial Police Safety Inspection Rules, establishing the principle that lawyers do not need to conduct personal safety inspections.
Since the release of the rule, a large number of lawyers have rarely occurred in cases that threatened the security of the court.
In extremely individual cases such as the state of Sunset, misunderstandings are not difficult to eliminate if they communicate in a spirit of respect and understanding each other.
The Lawyers Association, as an autonomous organization of the lawyers industry, is responsible for the double mission of punishing illegal and ensuring legality.
Former individual law associations have been suffering from illness due to prejudice to punishment, loss of security.
And the decision of the Swan State Law Council, regardless of the process or the result, is praised and set an example for more law councils to perform correctly.
What taxes will affect our wallet from October 1st?
The new personal income tax law will be in force from January 1, 2019, in order to enable large people to enjoy the tax reduction interest as soon as possible, from October 1, 2019, to deduct the earnings from the earnings of the actual wages of taxpayers at the starting point of 5,000 yen per month and apply the new tax rate scheme.
With the new political collapse, what benefits will affect the crowd’s money pockets?
Benefit 1: Salary tax reduction is obvious
Taxpayers who obtain wages after October 1, can withdraw from the basic reduction costs of $5,000/month and apply a new tax rate scheme, with most taxpayers have different levels of reduction, especially low-income reduction rates are more obvious.
According to the tax reduction figures of different income groups, the monthly income of those who have been deducted after the "three risk gold" amount of 8,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, after tax changes, the tax reduction ratio of 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, and 18.8%, respectively.
It is worth noting that, due to the holidays, the wages issued by the units at the end of September by law should be issued in October can apply to a new basic reduction fees and tax rate scheme.
For this purpose, the tax department’s unified promotion of payment client software has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax must still be declared within the legal declaration period.
Advantage 2: The low tax level is significantly increased.
In addition to increasing the starting point, a new tax rate will be applied from October 1.
This salary and wages are consistent with the previous, no changes, but the level of the tax rate was significantly changed, the level of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax rate of the tax amount of the tax of the tax amount of the
It is worth noting that the tax law also adjusted the tax rates on the income of production operations, with the lowest limit of the tax rate of the maximum 35% increased from 100,000 to 500,000,000.
This means that both individual and individual exclusive partners will benefit from tax changes.
“From the previous period of personal tax reduction calculations on Shanghai taxpayers, large taxpayers will fully feel the interests of the individual tax reform, especially the significant tax reduction of the middle-income population.”
Lammi, head of the Personal Income Tax Office of Shanghai City Tax Office, said.

On the other hand, a tax policy for large-scale citizens is promoted to implementing “full-scale, multidimensional, stereotyping” tax policies.

Early elections for the guverner of Okinawa due to the death of former governor Hong Kong from illness announced the results in the morning of local time and were successfully elected against the U.S. base transfer plan in Japan.
The election was held on September 30, and the final results showed that the city won a total of 39.663.2 million votes, with the highest score in the historical election of the governor of Okinawa County, with more than 80,000 votes than its main opponent, Zhejiang.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a vote rate of 63.24%, a 0.89 percentage points lower than the 2014 Okinawa County Governor elections.
On Sunday, Yong City told media that the election results indicate that the countryside people don’t want to let the efforts before the Governor of Yong, he would inherit the Governor’s will and continue to make efforts against the Japanese government and the U.S. government against the plan of relocating the US bases and the closing of the U.S. bases.
The U.S. military base located in the city of Ikea Bay, Okinawa province, has been suffering from sickness, and the Japanese government has previously agreed to move it to the border of Okinawa, but the people of Okinawa were strongly opposed, hoping to move the base completely out of Okinawa.
With regard to the residents of the countryside strongly opposed to the relocation plan and the demands of withdrawal of a license to fill the coast of the coast of Beijing, Yu City said he was not at the beginning standing in opposition and division with the central government, hoping that both parties could fully exchange views, showing the intention to resolve through consultation.

At the same time, he expressed the intention of a conversation with the city.
Tokyo will officially become Governor of Okinawa County on 4th of this month.
Since the middle of the 2000s, as China’s demand for oil seeds increased, the American farmer of North Dakota, Paul Thomas, has grown more soya in his land.
This transformation reached its highest peak this year, with he planted 1,600 hectares of soya in 5,000 hectares, reaching an unprecedented size.
But Thomas and many farmers like him are planning to replant the main food crops of the previous American agricultural area: corn and wheat in 2019.
American farmers have grown soya this year exceeding corn, for the first time in 35 years.
The plan is to transplant other food crops is because, in the context of the US President Trump launched a trade war against China, U.S. farmers are facing trouble selling soya.
China usually buy approximately 60 percent of US exports of soy, but due to trade war, almost zero purchases of US soy in recent months, leading to the price of soy dropped to the lowest decade.
Thomas plans to grow more wheat next year and hopes to earn more by reducing dependence on crops dependent on China’s demands.
Thomas said the price of soybean “have given us a painful blow.”
He said there is no need for China to buy, with the current price of soybean near its farm is $7.10 per ear, while the cost required to cover is $8.50.
U.S. farmers have recorded soya planting area this year, and harvest is also expected to reach a record high.
At such a very impactful moment, they suffered the shock of a trade war.
Trump imposed tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, China imposed tariffs on imports of US soy in July.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will publish the first estimate report for planting areas next year, which will include considerations of the impact on customs.
The forecast is expected to confirm civil authorities’ expectations of reducing the area of soya planting.
According to a report seen by Reuters, Info Economics predicted on October 19, 2019 the area of corn planting will increase by 4% to 9,2 million hectares (37.5 million hectares) and the area of soya planting will be reduced by 7 to 8,3 million hectares.
Informa also expects the US wheat planting area to increase by 4%.
The area of soya grown before the implementation of revengeous tariffs rose to 8.9 million hectares this year, which was about 15 million hectares higher than ten years ago.
The landscape of corn has increased since 2008 to 8.9.1 million hectares, with the landscape of wheat planting this year at the lowest level in almost 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois corn cultivation association, owns a total planting area of 3,600 acres, this year he spent almost half of the planting of soya, but plans to be cut in the future.
He said it could have increased corn planting area by up to 20 percent at his farm northern Illinois; the state is the largest state of soya cultivation in the United States.
Soya per hectare is less produced than corn, but fewer fertilizers are needed, which makes soya’s overall planting cost less.
If farmers turn to the end-value corn, it may increase costs, but it will benefit some, including Anderson Inc fertilizer vendors.
Andersons chief executive Pat Bowe told Reuters he expected transformation of corn would benefit from fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from farmers’ transformation of corn.

New York Times: Defending multilateralism, China lead to unity.
In the moment of unilateral reflows, international rules and multilateral order are shocked.
To some extent, the conflict between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a crucial period.
As a responsible powers, China, with the empowerment, the concept of coalition and firm action, supports multilateralism together with the international community and promotes continuous progress of multilateralism.
Faced with the new challenges of the new situation, China gave a loud voice on the direction and path of development of multilateralism.
As Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi said in the Speech of General Debate of the 73th UN General Assembly, the new age’s multilateralism should insist on cooperation as a goal of joint win, based on rule order, based on fair justice, and directed on effective action.
At the same time, China calls on the development of a global development cooperation model, which is complemented by the United Nations core, the main channel for South-North co-operation and South-South co-operation, and calls on the parties to cooperate in building a community of human fate.
China’s thinking and cry reflect the main voice of the international community.
As the 73th United Nations President Espinoza said, in the current situation, “The United Nations need more than ever to promote multilateralism and maintain the rules-based international system.”
The International Monetary Fund President Lagarde said the international community should continue to maintain the multilateral trade system, adhere to international trade rules and resolve disputes through consultation.
In recent years, accompanied by the adjustment of global economic and political forces, the rise of some emerging markets and developing countries, playing a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, providing new development drives to the multilateralism faced with reverse wind.
Standing in this dimensional consideration, China advocates to build a family rather than compacting small circles, insist on joint-commercial co-construction rather than winner-commercial, such as multilateral philosophy, according to the trend of the time, is an inevitable choice to address global challenges, solve the world problems, representing the common demand of most countries in the world.
There are more advanced ideas and more solid action.
China’s “One Belt and One Way” initiative has become the largest international cooperation platform.
China launched international and regional cooperation initiatives such as “One Belt and One Road”, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, “16+1 Cooperation” to promote international regional cooperation, complement existing international systems and order, bring innovation dynamics to multilateral cooperation and contribute to the development of international order towards a more fair and rational direction.
As a protector of international order and practitioner of multilateralism, China’s action is increasingly strong on this multilateral stage of the United Nations.
Global hotspots, responding to climate change, participating in peace action, strongly reducing poverty and helping other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As UN Secretary-General Guterres said, China has become an important pilar of multilateralism.
As the world faces the “deficit of trust” increases, as populism and polarization trends are rising, it is the most urgent moment in the world’s need for multilateral cooperation.
At such a historical end, the international community needs to work together to bring consensus into action, firmly defending multilateralism and jointly promote the construction of a community of human fate.

Fifth “Disability Speaking Month” is coming to focus on the issues of disabled teenage education - China New Network
In recent years, China’s youth sexual education has been widely discussed, but the challenges are still difficult for young people with disabilities.
Recently, a comprehensive educational challenges and practice strategy workshop for people with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to promote sexual education for children and young people with disabilities has become an important topic of this workshop.
The Chinese report of sexual knowledge, attitude and behavior of children with disabilities and adolescents published in the meeting shows that children with disabilities suffer from sexual harassment and sexual harassment more than healthy children.
For children and adolescents with disabilities, social attention is also given to “sex protection”.
This seminar aims to explore the three aspects of family support, school education and institutional services in China to promote comprehensive education for children and teenagers with disabilities, providing from the source support for children and teenagers with disabilities, giving them the right to enjoy their own love as their neighbors.
Experts believe that the awareness of the Chinese public about disabilities has always remained at a level not sufficiently deep.
Under the influence of factors such as traditional ideas, China’s comprehensive education in people with disabilities, especially children with disabilities and teenagers is not deep enough.
But in recent years, with the support of the United Nations and persons of public interest, Chinese people with disabilities have seen a pleasant development of sexual and reproductive health education practices and pathways for achievement throughout the entire cycle.
The report shows that vision, hearing, intellectual disorders and limb disorders children and young people have been more difficult to acquire sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships, but generally have developed towards facilitating and enriching.

The Central Bank's previous data showed that the Central Bank had a total of 604.4 billion foreign currencies for long term contracts and futures contracts by the end of August last year, unchanged for four consecutive months; the size of the empty head calculated in SDR (Special Withdrawal Rights) was 42.76 billion SDR.
Since then, the Central Bank’s foreign exchange’s long-term empty head has remained zero.
The Central Bank published the data for the first time at the end of March 2016; data showed that the Central Bank’s foreign currencies at the end of February 2016 are $24.38 inches for long-term and futures contracts of the currency, and $289.9 inches.

On the evening of September 20, this year, on the K158 train, Joe’s students, who read the Big Three in Jiangsu, took a car to the Yuan Wall.
One of the first grandfather in the train bought a ticket without a seat, but took her seat: “Take it, take it.”
Two hours of driving, the train manager advised him to remain an hour.
Finally, one of the male passengers in the car couldn’t see how to pull his grandmother up.
From the public view, although the ultimate result is mostly the heighteners being publicly condemned, administrative punishments by the police department, and even included in the black list of integrity, the public still feels not “disclaimer”: Why can’t the heighteners be punished at the place?
Why is it not possible to stop his immoral or illegal behavior, but to be sentenced later?
And for the unreliable behavior of the “General of the Seasons,” why just a male passenger “complainted” to pull it up?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police passengers, short-distance trains are generally not available; even with police passengers, police passengers are more concerned about the possible indifferent reaction of the header without taking compulsory belt removal.
The frequently occurring hassle events made people realize that the hassle must be forced to be taken away and even punished in order to play a shocking role.
This requires that our train police passengers have the courage to take strong measures in time, and the train without police passengers should be installed as soon as possible to safeguard the timely stop and fight illegal actions.

Activate rural consumption, to clean the market by normalization mechanism, to guide healthy consumption needs, to improve the sense of access of farmers on consumption.
Data show that the consumer potential of rural residents continues to be liberated, with rural consumer goods retail sales increased by 10.5% in the first half of this year, growing by 1.3 percentage points in the city.
Visiting a poor village in some western countryside, the whole village has only one facility store, entering the store, some of the goods seemed to have known, “Golden Dragon Fish” symbolized “Golden Dragon Oil”, “Wangji” became “Wan Milk”, “Shi” goods a lot.
During the years, a similar phenomenon has often been exposed, some rural false goods, named relatively close, packaged similarly, in false false, and unresolved.
A consumer survey published in a western city showed that rural retailers have a serious problem, with 66% of consumers purchased counterfeits in supermarkets under rural lines, which account for more than half of food.
Related sectors regulate rural markets, year-round screaming, why is “Lee Ghans” still not repeatedly?
Unlike the city markets, the farmer's rights consciousness is relatively poor, plus a lot of rural locations away, in the blind areas that are not sufficiently regulatory forces, allowing false goods to feed soil.
A goods multi pipeline, some department pipeline prices, some pipeline production, some pipeline markets, cross-functional, yearly vacation, concentrated governance a period of wind, fake goods hidden from the wind, and again slowly rise out, just finished the old fake, new fake again rise out.
The lack of long-efficient regulatory mechanisms, rural markets are difficult to clean, illegal costs are low, and profits are large, resulting in some illegal traders move the distortion of the “rise down the mountains” and some rural areas become a “drop market”.
From warm-saturated to small-coun, large-scale farmers are moving towards developmental consumption.
Earlier, the Party Central and the State Department published a number of opinions on improving the mechanism of promotion of the consumption system to further stimulate residents’ consumption potential, which proposed to encourage rural residents’ consumption step-by-step, aimed at allowing large farmers to “consume”, “will consume”, “dare consume”, to make rural consumption truly grow.
On the one hand, to deepen reforms, to eliminate the market regulatory system out of many, multiple management defects, due to the land-friendly, healthy food security, product quality monitoring network, constantly compressing rural vacation space, vacation sale.
On the other hand, to strengthen law enforcement, to regulate the "mature blood vessels" and will never allow false falsehood to spread in rural areas.
The strict punishment of the farmers is the protection of the farmers, regardless of how much the fake is hidden, should not be a reason for the feeding of fake goods, the relevant department should clear responsibilities, the basic level of regulatory forces dropped, which part of the issue, must pursue responsibility, let the vacancy, the fake sellers have no place to hide.
Strictly closing the market access, implementing strict qualification inspection to the producer operators, putting the residence market circulation connections, allowing products to come straight and go straight, think of the way from the source and root, allowing legal distributors to operate safe, allowing farmers to buy safe.
Activating rural consumption to guide health consumption needs.
With the increase in consumption, many farmers seek not only to eat, eat well, but also to pursue a quality of life such as culture, health, and can’t bring rural markets as “low quality”, “ cheap” painting, etc.
This needs to promote the extension of e-commerce coverage to large rural areas, the two-way connected sales channels, promote the combination of underline industrial development platforms and online e-commerce trading platforms, support the expansion of new models of consumer new sectors to rural markets; promote the organic combination of commercial logistics with recreational agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc; a healthy rural modern network system, optimize the integration of storage facilities resources, effectively reduce rural traffic costs.
Create a clean and peaceful market environment for rural areas, making farmers consumption uncomfortable, rural consumption can grow, to increase the sense of availability and happiness of farmers consumption.

In June this year, the government forced 15 officials of the Central Indirect Tax and Customs Commission to retire for charges such as corruption, receiving fraud, trafficking and even conspiracy crimes. Before that, the government has forced 12 senior officials of the State Tax Office to retire for charges such as corruption, sexual harassment, massive unknown assets, according to Article 56(J) of the Central Public Officers Rule.
In August, the government forced 22 officials of the Central Central Indirect Tax and Customs Committee to retire.Article 56(J) of the 1972 Central Public Officer (Pension) Rule provides for regular examination of the performance of government officials to determine whether they should stay in office or retire in accordance with the public interest.
In accordance with these provisions, the case of government employees set out in Article 56(J), 56(1) of the Basic Rule of 1972 or Article 48(1)(b) of the Central Public Employee (Pension) Rule, shall be examined six months before they reach the age of 50 to 55 years, if they are in accordance with the provisions of the Basic Rule of 1972 and Article 56(1) of the Basic Rule or Article 48 of the Central Public Employee (Pension) Rule.
A Myanmar woman receives 500 letters from joint health insurance in five days
Stephanie Ray said her mailbox was bombed from insurance companies from Thursday to Monday.
“The first wave started last Thursday and I received 46 letters,” she told the cable TV news network I immediately called the Joint Health Insurance and told them I received 46 letters of the same content.
But the letters remained nearby, with more than 500 copies on Monday.
The letters were mailed to her son who lived in a private nursing hospital with autism, she explained. But the letter dissolved not to mention her son’s name, but to say “Respectable Mining State Department of Health and Public Service, Cincinnati,” she told local media.
These letters were claims for $54 or $0 outside the joint health insurance coverage, Mr. Ray said.
When she asked the joint health insurance why she received a lot of letters, she was told that it was because the coding had a problem, she said.
Joint Health Insurance in a statement told cable TV news networks that they are solving the problem and they can't provide more details in view of privacy requirements.
“We have identified the root of the problem.We apologize for the incident and we have contacted the family and asked about their situation,” the health insurance company said.
Miss Ray said at the bottom of each letter there was a message calling people to carry out a non-papersed message I think these letters they sent wasted half of the trees of the forest,” she said.
Antonio Brown says he’s not prepared to resign.
Antonio Brown said he would not resign from the United States National Football League, just a few days ago he cried on Twitter and announced he had left the National Football League.
The four-time full-time player wrote on Twitter on Thursday: “I’m very good now, why to resign now, because he accepted the match needs his advice.”
Brown was accused of sexual abuse by two women. Last week he was released by the New England Patriot team after playing a match. In the last six months, Antonio Brown was abandoned by three different teams.
Brown, who lost Nike’s sponsorship identity last week, said he would start from Miami, training a day a week at high school.
The 31-year-old brother broke up on Twitter with the Los Angeles Cowboys Security Team Guard Eric Weather, who frequently fought with him during the Baltimore Cowboys Team.
Banking Conversion Crime Detection Tools to Expand New Businesses
The UK’s FX Group has transformed the algorithms used for detection of financial crimes into a means to expand new business opportunities, which was previously forced by money laundering scandal, the bank’s head said.
The system combines customer banking related data and corporate ownership with public data of the directive positions to identify appropriate potential clients for the Group Bank staff and provides a way to communicate with those clients through existing customer relationships.
The overall revenue strategy of the Bank is to make more profit from its large-scale physical networks and customer data, while using data and artificial intelligence to try to increase revenue are part of the strategy, increasing overall revenue is also the primary task of the temporary CEO Noel Quinn.
“It’s the first time investing in prevention of financial crime to be used for commercial purposes, and thus developing business is low-risk and rapidly visible,” said Stuart Nevison, Global Head of the Customer Network Bank.
The Bank refused to reveal how much revenue the new system expected to bring, but said the overall “network revenue” initiative has already generated hundreds of dollars in additional revenue.
This is also an important step in the United Bank’s efforts to maintain its global business, and some analysts and investors have previously stated that the bank should reduce scale or withdraw from markets where profits are lower than the cost of funding, such as the U.S. market.
In 2012, Inc. reached a $1.9 billion reconciliation agreement with U.S. authorities because it failed to stop drug traffickers from doing money laundering through its Mexican subsidiary, which was forced to invest hundreds of dollars in compliance with financial crimes was part of the agreement.
By visualizing relationships between individual clients and companies, searching for abnormal trading models, or exploring previously unknown links between the two, the system can its design initiatives.
The system has liberated the workforce of more than 400 employees who no longer have to manually check transactions and records, but have more to take on customer-oriented services, said Adrian Rigby, Chief Operating Officer of Bank Trade Operations.
The company’s Nevison said they suddenly realized that only a bit modified to the tool could use it to search for the “small green flag” for more attractive potential customers, rather than “small red flag” for the search for illegal acts.
“We have obtained the customer data set, combining it with the data of the company’s registered office (UK) and then reverted the previous algorithms to search for the potential of customers, which could be achieved through the registered office, the company’s development or the links of existing customers,” Nevison said.
The tool has captured 22.5 million UK entities and individuals, which can identify a link network in three minutes, and bank employees often take three hours to manually build a screenshot, he said.
Rouhani says Iran has been promised to remove “all” sanctions in exchange for dialogue
European countries are very keen to negotiate with Iran, suggesting that if Tehran is willing to negotiate, the United States would end sanctions against Iran, President Hassan Rouhani said.
According to Rouhani, the European signatories of the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal called him to meet US President Donald Trump, promising Washington to lift “all” sanctions in exchange for dialogue.
“Three of the six countries – the Prime Minister of Germany, the British Prime Minister and the President of France – insisted on the meeting, saying the United States would abolish all sanctions,” the Iranian president said.
He said he rejected the proposal because negotiations will take place “under the U.S. limits of pressure and sanctions on Iran” and cannot predict any outcome at all.
Trump quickly denied any assistance to Iran and said on Twitter that Tehran had asked him to lift sanctions as a condition for a dialogue, but he “of course” refused.
Rouhani also said in a statement that many countries have expressed support for Iran during the UN General Assembly, and we have discussed several topics with the countries, all of which have condemned the United States' retirement from the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan and its actions of pressure.
Government initiates consultation on dog breeding law
Due to concerns about the lack of control of animals and the owner’s innocence, Scotland’s dog breeding law is being reviewed.
The Scottish government has launched a consultation to seek public opinion.
The Scottish Community Security Ministry has committed to “assuring community safety and keeping people away from innocent owners” aimed at determining whether the laws on uncontrolled dogs need to be amended.
Scottish Parliamentary Assh Deanam said: “We are reviewing dog breeding law twice because we are absolutely determined to ensure the safety of the community and keep people away from innocent dog owners and their uncontrolled dogs.”
This consultation aimed at improving the implementation of the 2010 Dog Control Act in Scotland, and next year we will review all Dog Control Acts more widely to assess whether changes are needed.
“Pleeding will bring some responsibilities, including keeping your dog under effective control, and I encourage anyone interested in this area to respond to our public consultation.
Public consultation will last until January 15, including proposals for strengthening and clarification of existing regulations, such as asking whether a national dog control database should be established.
Scottish parliament’s post-legislative supervisors have been listening to the testimony of victims and children’s parents who have been attacked or killed by dogs, urging the government to review the dog breeding law.
Scottish MPs have been told that regulations need urgent reform to protect vulnerable populations and children.
In Glasgow and Clade alone, 1417 people were sent to emergency hospitals last year, including 255 children.
912 people were treated by the National Health Service of Lanack County, 439 people were treated by the National Health Service of Elsa County, both of which were the highest in four years.
In July, Parliamentary Committee concluded that the current dog breeding laws are not compatible with the purpose, calling on the Scottish government to review all dog breeding laws.
Commission chief, Jenny Malala, said: “Scotland’s dog breeding law is not compatible with the purpose. There are still many dog attacks against children, but existing laws that could prevent these attacks have been almost never implemented or known.”
“Obviously, the existing dog breeding law has not entered into force.The existing dog breeding law is urgently necessary to reform so that we can properly handle uncontrolled and dangerous dogs, we can try to build a system that prevents our children from hurting dogs.
The consultation was published on the government’s website on Friday, with the following: “Unified effective law enforcement is the key place to address Scotland’s problem with uncontrolled dogs.”
This review focuses on measures that can be taken to help aid executives such as local authorities use their powers to maintain community security.
Saudi Arabia Offers Tourist Visa For The First Time To Abolish Abbey Long Dress
Currently, Saudi visa is issued only to foreign employees, their families and Muslim practitioners.
Saudi Arabia said on Friday it would provide tourist visa for the first time to open this extreme conservative kingdom to holiday tourists to promote economic diversification and reduce dependence on oil.
The launch of tourism is one of the core components of Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 reform program, which aims to prepare for the development of the largest Arab economy in the post-oil age.
Just two weeks ago, the U.S. government accused Iran of launching destructive attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure, disturbing the global energy markets and triggering concerns about larger regional conflicts.
“Opening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historical moment for our country,” tourism agency director Ahmed Hattib said in a statement.
“Tourists will admire ... the treasures we share – five UNESCO World Heritage sites, vibrant local culture and amazing natural beauty scenery.
Bloomberg said Saudi Arabia will open online tourist visa applications to citizens of 49 countries on Saturday.
He said Saudi Arabia would also extend strict clothing regulations on foreign women, allowing them to not wear abaya longs, which remain public clothes Saudi women must wear.
However, he added that foreign women would be asked to wear “simple clothes” but no detail.
In this desert kingdom, which has numerous Beethoven remains and archaeological sites, the visa is currently limited to foreign workers, their families, and Muslim saints visiting the sacred places of Mecca and Medina.
Saudi Arabia began issuing temporary visa to tourists last year, allowing them to participate in sports and cultural activities to start tourism, which is a rare initiative.
But this serious kingdom forbids drinking and has strict social regulations which are seen as an obstacle to tourism.
Prince Mohammed is trying to change this situation through a comprehensive liberation movement, which has brought new movies, mixed men and women’s concerts and sports festivals to Saudi Arabia.
Observators say the international community’s criticism of Saudi human rights records, including the terrible murder of critic Jamal Khashoggi last year and the repression of women activists, could be further disadvantaged to attract foreign tourists.
After the attack of the state-owned oil giant Ameri Oil Company on September 14, concerns about the regional conflict could also undermin the Saudi attractiveness of holiday tourists.
Under the impact of low oil prices, the government said hopes that tourism will contribute to GDP by 2030, while currently only 3%.
By 2030, Saudi Arabia’s goal is to attract domestic and foreign tourists up to 100 million times a year.
But Saudi Arabia is currently lacking infrastructure and cannot accommodate so many tourists, officials estimate that the country will need additional 500,000 hotel rooms in the next decade.
According to the government, tourism industry is expected to create up to 1 million jobs in tourism sector in response to youth unemployment rates.
Saudi Arabia invests billions of dollars to build tourism from zero.
In 2017, Saudi Arabia announced a billions-dollar project to transform 50 islands in the Red Sea and other original sites into luxury resorts.
Last year, the "Entertainment City" of Kidia started construction near Riyadh, which will include a high-end theme park, motorsport facilities and a hunting area.
The country is also developing historical remains, such as the hundreds of years old Marmara Salle, where the sandstone tomb remains of the same civilisation that built the city of Petra in Jordan.
Facebook Hide Points in New Tests in Australia
Facebook said today that it has begun to hide the dynamic number of points published in Australia, the test is intended to alleviate social pressure that may be promoted worldwide later.
Today, Facebook users in Australia are no longer able to see the dynamic reactions and video browsing of others, but can still see the reactions of others to their dynamics.
“We don’t want to make people feel like Facebook is a game.”
“This time we want to test people’s use of the new version. We would like to spend some time observing the user’s feedback on the new version to see if it is being promoted,” the company said.
More than a billion Facebook users worldwide, but the social media giant is also faced with pressure to prevent the platform’s impact on user’s mental health.
According to Australian cyber security Commissioner, one-fifth of children in the country reports they have suffered cyber violence.
Before making this decision, Facebook had tested a version of hidden points on a photo wall under its flag in July.
The photo wall testing began in Canada and later expanded to Australia, Brazil and several other major user markets.
Facebook said the test was intended to "learn some circumstances as soon as possible through small scale tests.
“While the photo walls are already being tested, Facebook and (photo walls) are different platforms, so we may get different test data,” the company said.
Social media giants have not confirmed how long the test will last.
“We want to find out whether eliminating points can improve user experience while limiting other positive interactions,” said Mia Garyck, head of Facebook Australia.
Lawrence Rise to Level 4 Hurricane in the East of the Caribbean
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the Hurricane Lawrence was increased to a Level 4 hurricane on Thursday, with a huge wave of the hurricane could affect the wind Islands and parts of South America.
The National Hurricane Center is at 11 p.m., and the Hurricane Eye is located about 1660 miles southwest of the Ashley Islands. Eastern summer time is updated. The storm moves north-westward at a speed of 14 miles per hour, with a maximum continuous wind speed of 145 miles per hour.
Storms are not expected to land in the next few days, but the wind turning to north-east on Saturday may bring Lorenzo closer to the Ashley Islands next week. Weather forecasts the storm will weaken to level 3 on Monday.
Giant waves generated by storms could cause life-threatening sea waves and fluids to the Wind Islands and the north-east of South America.
Lawrence is the second level 4 or higher level storm in the Atlantic hurricane season.Dorian reaches level 5 near the Bahamas.
According to meteorologist Philip Krausbach at Colorado State University, 16 named storms have been produced in the western hemisphere (including the Atlantic and the eastern Pacific basins) since August 21.
Philip Krausbach tweeted: “This is the most recorded storms in the Western Hemisphere since August 21st to September 21, breaking the old record of 15 named storms created between 1984 and 2002.
Patriot missile systems entered Saudi Arabia after Iran attack on oil facilities
After routine inspections on patriot missile batteries in Turkish military base in Gaziantep, U.S. soldiers discussed.
The Pentagon announced on Thursday that the United States plans to send a patriot missile battery, radar system and approximately 200 supporters to Saudi Arabia because of the attack on Saudi oil facilities earlier this month.
Pentagon spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, wrote in a statement that Defense Secretary Mark Esper has “approved the increase of forces in order to prepare for deploying orders.”
The increased forces included two patriotic artillery batteries and a final high-air defense system, also known as the Sad anti-guidance system.
The Sadd’s anti-release system is one of the world’s most advanced missile systems that can target and destroy the missiles in the air. The Sadd’s blockbuster was launched by the launchers, using the power to “collision-destroy” ballistic threats.
“It’s important that these initiatives show our commitment to regional partners as well as security and stability in the Middle East. Other countries have accused Iran of making disasters in the region, but we hope they can help strengthen Saudi defence capabilities,” Hoffman wrote.
The United Nations World Head said President Donald Trump has criticized Iran’s role in attacking Saudi oil facilities. The United Nations Assembly said Tuesday they should press Tehran to encourage its participation in diplomatic talks.
Trump said, “All countries have the responsibility to take action, no responsible government should fund Iran’s murder. Iran does not stop its dangerous behavior, sanctions will not be abolished, but will only be harder.
The strike of the world’s largest crude oil processing factories and oil fields forced Saudi Arabia to close half of its production operations on September 14, therefore, after the drone attack, the price of crude oil was the highest rise in decades and again triggered concerns about the outbreak of the conflict in the Middle East. Although countries widely believe Tehran should be responsible for the attack, Iran has always insisted not participating in it.
Specialist umbrella hit a big truck in California Road
The 28-year-old woman jumped umbrella with seven other men around 2 p.m. on Thursday, California Road Patrol Public Information Officer Ruben Jones told the U.S. cable TV news.
These people flew from the Loddy’s parrot center. The U.S. cable TV news network has contacted the agency to comment.
Jones said the wind was strong at the time, and when the umbrella jumpers landed near Loddy airport, the woman hit a truck.
The TV interviewed Lisa Reyes when the woman collapsed with a car, Lisa Reyes was driving on the 99th Street with her father and brother on the car.
She told the TV: “The man was constantly fighting in the wind, but her body dropped at a very fast speed.
Central Coast deformation fake children rape accused of direct viewing victims in court
In May 2017, the man wears a set of wooden-colored dresses and caught her from behind on the way of a 12-year-old girl went to a school in the Central Coast.
He then bound the girl on the tree and committed sexual abuse.
Shortly after he was arrested, police investigated his home and found many items related to the detection of the case.
The man accepted seven charges of the attack and also acknowledged three other charges of seduction and sexual harassment of another 11-year-old girl between August 2016 and April 2017.
The 12-year-old victim was walking along a small road and when she turned back, she saw him suddenly jumping out of the drill, holding a large branch and a knife in his hand.
The man was dressed in a tree-leafed dress.
While the girl repeatedly asked the man to hold his hand, the man still closed her neck with his hand and hardly pulled her into the pot.
The man said to the girl, “Lay, don’t call. Don’t call, or don’t blame me on you.
He had his right hand with a knife, banded the girl's hands and feet with a nylon belt, and then banded her on a tree and violated her for almost an hour.
The man arrived at the work unit about 9:30 p.m., before he failed to answer several messages and calls from his colleagues.
On his clothes wearing something like crawl, grass, and leaf trees, he claimed to have had a road accident, jumped with another driver, pulled the car into the wooden crawl and turned down from the roadside.
The hearing of the man will continue on Tuesday.
Police in California have not been charged with federal charges after shooting a black man
On Thursday, federal authorities refused to raise civil rights proceedings against the murderer's black man Sacramento police, which triggered multiple protests and pushed up changes to state laws restricting law enforcement authorities using deadly force.
The U.S. Federal Prosecutor’s Office and the Federal Investigation Office said the federal investigation of the case of a 22-year-old Stephen Clarke in 2018 showed that there was no “sufficient evidence” to prosecute two police officers, Trance Mercadant and Jered Rovinet.
In March, California’s Prosecutor’s Office refused two police officers to raise a criminal prosecution in California after completing almost a year’s case investigation. Prosecutor’s Office, Havill Basira, pointed out that evidence suggests the two police officers had reason to believe their lives were threatened because the man was approaching them and allegedly holding a gun in his hands.
On Thursday, Sacramento police also issued a statement saying its internal investigation did not find the two police officers committed any violation of police regulations or training requirements.
“Despite the fact that the police has not found any acts violating the police regulations of this accident, or in the course of this incident, we are still determined to implement new tactics to prevent such tragedy from happening again,” said Daniel Hahn, Director of the Sacramento Police Office in a statement.
Clark's brother Stewart Clark posted a dynamic on Facebook on Thursday, saying he was completely unemployed at meeting with federal and local authorities (in terms of pursuit of responsibility) at the time," he wrote.
Authorities said the police were convinced that Clarke had a gun in his hand when he was near the police, and before he ran away from the police's chasing to his grandmother's back court. The police ran Clarke that night after receiving reports that someone had broken the car's glass and the glass sliding door of an older neighbor.
When Clark approached two police officers, the police shot him seven.
Federal investigators have examined relevant evidence, including witness testimony, live videos and recordings, police records, police reports and body inspection reports, to determine whether the police has deliberately used force beyond objective and reasonable limits.
Legislatives last month added an amendment to the oldest U.S. controlled police use of deadly force law, which will become the most strict standard for the use of force in the U.S. after all police have been trained.
California’s old version standards make the police to shoot the police very difficult, and even more difficult to condemn the police. It is based on the principle of “reasonable fear” that they can use deadly force if prosecutors or inspectors think the police have reason to worry about their safety.
The new law entered into force on January 1, requiring police to use deadly force only in response to the deadly threat to the police or the surrounding people.
Pope Francis warns technical executives about using artificial intelligence for public interest
Pope Francis told CEOs, diplomats and financialists on Friday that creation of artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development campaign increases the risk of social inequality unless the work provides ethical assessment of public interest.
Francis gave a speech in the Vatican at a meeting attended by government special agents, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists and ethics. Few scholars and Catholic bishops attended the “public interest of the digital age”.
The Vatican side hopes to take a place in the debate about the prospects and dangers of artificial intelligence, and this three-day meeting is the latest proof of the idea.
The discussion includes technological progress in war, the growing dependency of future work on machines, case studies of the New Zealand Christchurch massacre, and decisions made by social media companies after the video of the massacre.
In the conference speech, Francis praised the potential of technological advancement and pointed out that the machinery in the early industrial revolution kept workers away from danger and avoided uniformity of work. But Francis also warned that increased dependence on robots for profit could be deprived of the dignity of people's work.
“If technological progress is the reason for increasing inequality, technology is not true progress; if so-called technological progress becomes an enemy of public interest, then the whole society will unfortunately degradate into a barbaric age of the strongest law.”
The organizers said they would like to use the expertise of the participants to find appropriate counselors for the Catholic Church on high-tech issues in the future.
The House of Representatives held a vote on Friday to prevent U.S. President Donald Trump from making a "National Emergency Statement" that Trump hopes to use the Statement to fund the border wall he proposed to build.
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed a resolution to end Trump’s action with 236 votes against 174 votes and sent the resolution to the President.11 Republicans and an independent member expressed support for the resolution. As 11 Republicans joined the Democratic Party, the Senate passed the measure with 54 votes against 41 votes.
Trump may deny the resolution, which will be his sixth time to block Congress legislation as president. In March he has already denied a measure to end the declaration of emergency.
None of the House of Congress seem to have reached the two-third majority of the votes needed to reject the resolution.
Due to failing to obtain the funds needed for the construction of the southern border wall from the Mexican government and Congress, Trump announced a state of emergency in February. Trump’s administration plans to allocate $3.6 billion from military construction funds for border projects.
Democrats accuse Trump not only of overlooking Congress's "wallet rights", but also using key defense funds to create unnecessary barriers. A minority of Republicans in the House of Representatives and Senate is also concerned about Trump's statement will lead to future "writing power".
Several Senate Republicans who will participate in the next year’s elections face huge political pressure to vote for the state of emergency.
Google Launches Its 21th Anniversary Celebration: Stories You Don't Know
Google is celebrating its birthday with peanut today. Peanut is a computer photo in the 90s style with a Google search page and a date of September 27, 1998, surrounded by a colored peanut of Google. The search results page shows a smaller peanut with a Google logo designed to be a 21-shaped candle. The search giant was founded 21 years ago by Larry Pitch and Sergey Brin in 1998, when they were students of Stanford University, California. However, September 27, is not Google’s real birthday.
If you think the company’s establishment date is the company’s birthday, then Google was born on September 4, 1998, however, the company never celebrated its birthday on that day, at least not in the form of peel. Until 2005, Google celebrated its birthday with peel on September 7, then changed to September 27.
Initially, this search engine was referred to as “web reptiles” and later changed its name to “Google”.
“We named our system Google because it’s a common puzzle of Google (or 10100), which is not in accordance with our goal of building a large-scale search engine,” Sergey Brin and Lawrence Pitch wrote in a paper published in 1998 on the launch of the “big search engine” prototype.
The company was founded thanks to the co-founder of the solar computer system Andy Beetholsheim invested $100,000; in June 1999, the company gathered $25 million from Red Angle Capital and Keenan. Google moved to the Mountain View office in the same year, which is still there. In 2001, the company's technology was patented.
From a web search engine to a large enterprise group’s letter holding, Google is a subsidiary. Today, Google operates worldwide in over 100 languages, responding to trillions of search queries annually.
Google has more than 60,000 employees in 50 different countries, from oil pipes to Android, and, of course, Google has developed hundreds of products for billions of people around the world.
Trump denies Iran claims to drop oil prices after US proposes to lift sanctions
On 10 January 2019, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke at a ceremony held in Tehran.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday that the US proposed to lift all sanctions against Iran in exchange for negotiations, which led to oil prices drop. President Donald Trump and the U.S. Department later denied these statements, leading to oil prices to rebound from low point.
West Texas’s latest price of medium-sized crude oil futures dropped to $55.91 with a drop of 0.9%, previously dropped to $54.79; Brent’s crude oil futures dropped to $61.89 with a drop of 1.4%.
According to Reuters, Rouhani said on his official website, “Germany’s Prime Minister, British Prime Minister and French President are all in New York and they insist on the meeting.
Trump later responded to Iran, “Of course not!” he said Iran hoped he could cancel sanctions to hold a meeting.
According to Bloomberg, the U.S. Department called the report “no-founded” and adds that the United States is determined to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero.
On September 14, a series of drones attacked Saudi oil facilities, forcing the country to half oil production, after which Rouhani commented. The United States and some European countries, as well as Saudi Arabia, accused Iran of the attack. Tehran denied itself of any role in the incident. The Trump administration also announced plans to deploy US troops in the region.
The U.S. Department did not immediately respond to American consumer news and commercial channels to comment.
John Kildaf, a recovery capitalist, said: “People may not have seen a long-term relief of tensions in the UAE, which would make a large amount of oil return to the market immediately.
“It refers not only to Iran’s production and exports, but also to millions of barrels of oil in floating oil storage facilities and millions of barrels of oil staying in Chinese port waiting for customs processing,” Kildaf said.
Last year, Trump ordered the United States to withdraw from the nuclear deal signed by Iran, the United States and five other countries under the agreement withdrawal of sanctions against Iran in exchange for their commitments to halt nuclear projects.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has been the target of US sanctions for decades, and Washington accused it of recent attacks on a tanker on the Holmes Strait, but Tehran denied it. Iran also shut down a U.S. drone and announced plans to execute 17 suspicious US spies.
Afghanistan Strengthen Security Response to Presidential Elections
Afghanistan has conducted large-scale security operations across the country, preparing for Saturday's national presidential election.
The government will arrange approximately 100,000 security personnel to protect the vote stations in response to the threats by the Taliban forces.
Due to fear of revenge, many voters (particularly voters in rural areas) will remain at home, while others say the vote system is prepared for the powered and not suitable for the poor.
Royal News: How Princess Beatrice “response angry to hostile family members”
On Thursday, Duke and Duchess of York announced their older daughter, Princess Beatrice, was married to her boyfriend, 34-year-old Real Estate Major Edward Mappelly Moz. As the ninth ranked heir of the British throne, the princess will marry Mappelly Moz next year.
“We have a lot of similar interests and values, and we know that this will be great for us in the future years of love and happiness.
Princess Beatrice's parents, Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, also expressed their excitement.
Duke of York wrote on Twitter: “I know my mother’s feelings, so I have flowed tears of joy.
Andrew and I are the luckyest people because we have two great brides.
This royal wedding will be an opportunity to bring the whole royal family together again, hoping that it will completely repair the relationship between Fiji and the Duke of Edinburgh.
Since Sarah entered into one of the biggest scandals in the royal family history, her relationship with other members has become unusually difficult to survive.
In 1992, five months after the announcement of his divorce with Prince Andrew, she and her "financial advisor" were exposed to her life with photos taken in a holiday villa in Saint Tropez.
In these photographs, a millionaire from Texas, John Brian, kisses, swallowing the Duke's fingers and legs, which was allegedly the most intense reaction of Prince Philip to the Duchess's son's scandal.
However, his behavior wasly “shocking” to Duke of York, and Princess Beatrice once claimed her mother was “the victim of humiliating behavior that made her feel unpopular.”
Kate and William: Couples' Shocking Habits Disclosed
The spokesman of the Duchess was unable to comment on this, but a friend of Fiji said: “Sara’s daughters are very bored with the way the royal family members treated their mothers, and that’s no secret.”
“Some of the accounts she received are quite confusing.
“They have always blamed their father to leave this thing, especially Beatrice has always asked Prince Andrew not to treat their mothers as being deported.
Last October, at the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brookesbank, Philip and Sarah were shot together for the first time in 26 years.
The second wave of strike in Oregon
State University staff complained, primarily focusing on low wages and lack of dignity in both aspects.Only looking at the wages gap is noticeable. Approximately half of these staff’s annual income is under $40,000 (for hundreds of people’s annual income is less than $25,000). Meanwhile, the average annual salary of the university directors is $50,000, and the annual salary of four university sports coachs is slightly lower, with a total of $1 million. Although school administrators’ wages are six-digits, the overall administrative expenses are still increasing, and one sixth of the confidential staff qualified for food tickets.
As another information technology specialist at Portland State University, Alexander Segula, said: “I want to strike because I think the wages paid to people cannot guarantee their lives in the city they serve, it is unfair.
As inflation increased, the cost of living in Oregon increased, and the staff were in trouble, and the management has almost no sympathy for it. The contract negotiations began in February were interrupted in mid-August. At that time, the bosses submitted some especially excessive suggestions — a slight increase in living costs, rejecting long-term staff qualification requirements, and the employee's food costs rising — the staff thought it was not respecting them, even cruelty.
He continued: “For decades, educational workers have been attacked. We finally stood up and reacted. Corporate executives saw their relatively jealous wages constantly rising at a rate of inflation, class discrimination and the pressure of the middle class can be peacefully faced. But the same thing is happening in the educational world, staff will not continue to tolerate.
Staff of the Oregon State University is not the only crowd to take action.Oregon is now a fighter-fightened fire bar, with the insurer has been burned, hot and bright. Fred Mayer’s food store staff are struggling against employers, although there is no formal strike plan, tensions are growing; their union’s local 555 division of the Food and Commercial Workers Union has demanded joint resistance and submitted unfair labor practices reports against the chain.
In the healthcare industry, if the local 49 members of the International Federation of 4,500 employees in the service sector of Caesar Medical Institution did not reach an agreement before the expiration of the existing contract in October (just temporarily avoided by a new temporary agreement), the strike would be ratified. In other areas of the industry, the Oregon Nurses Association, representing more than 120 nurses in Astoria Hospital, are stuck in contract negotiations with the hospital management department, the last contract of these nurses expires in May, and time is very urgent.
Billy explains: “The working movement in Oregon is very strong and has been implemented very thoroughly. This is part of the nationwide wave of labour growth. It is seen as economic instability, actual wages are decreasing, and the solution is to take collective action on the workplace.
It is unclear how deep these collective actions will be implemented this autumn, but if the big strike returns to Northwest in 2019, it is appropriate. We only hope that the spirit of action can spread further into Middle-West agriculture, Southern manufacturing, Texas oil fields, Abalacia coal mines, North East construction, Silicon Valley technology giants and any sector and industry in the middle.
Political Civilization: The establishment of a new prize program is to eliminate Westminster’s discrepancies and recognize the courtesy politicians.
A new prize program is set up to recognize the courageous politicians.
After parliamentary reassembly, Westminster welcomed a week of debate.
During this controversial week, parliamentaries face threats and speeches of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as well as rage.
In addressing disputes, the “Political Civilization” Prize revealed last Friday that annual politicians were awarded £3,000 a prize for charity.
Boris Johnson was criticized for his voice used in the lower House.
At the announcement of the award, Lord Stuart said: “Everyone agree that British politics is facing a trust crisis and a civilisation crisis.
“The UK’s Brexit disputes are increasing, the disputes and pain are increasing and we strongly believe that politics must respond not to these trends, but to resist these trends.
These awards are a small attempt made by a group of public, aiming at bringing the attention of the public – whether political fractions are different or without political fractions – to politicians who defend for their own reasons in a wise and courageous way, as well as politicians who can cross the differences that affect all of us in contact and cooperation with people.”
The nomination will be announced on the sixth cycle, and the award ceremony will be held in March next year.
Former Cabinet Minister Ambul Laden, in an exclusive interview with the British Standard Evening today, accused Johnson of using provokative words that "really stimulate violence".
Johnson said he was “sorry” for the threats to parliamentary members.
Jesse Phillips is "scared" after receiving a "threatening" death threat
On Thursday, Labour Parliamentary Jesse Phillips, another criticist of Johnson, said a man was arrested after trying to “shoot” the door of her elected district office, allegedly when the man cried him as “Fascist”.
Meanwhile, Liberal Democratic leader Joe Svenson spoke to the police after her young child was threatened.
The daughter of Labour senior parliamentary Ivit Cooper, Eli Cooper, posted a rapidly spreading post on Twitter describing her concerns about her mother after Cox was murdered.
US income gap is the highest in history
Last year, the US poor income gap was the highest since the US Census Bureau began statistical income in 1967, both Washington and New York are the largest income gap.
The United States may be the wealthiest country in the world, but it is the same: the super wealthiest can continue to grow, anyway, and a poor-washed family often calls on “to finance me” (a crowdfunding website) to pay medical fees. Economic imbalance affects both wealth and income, while the latter is at the highest level in history.
One way to measure the income gap is the Guinness coefficient. The Guinness coefficient at least 0, represents absolute average, at maximum 1, represents the assumption of a family having all income in the country. For over 50 years, the Bureau of Population has been tracking this indicator. The Guinness coefficient in the United States was 0.397, but in 2018 has risen to the highest 0.485.
There are also some more severe income gap among other countries in the world, including some relatively strong economies. For example, the World Bank estimates the Guinea-Bissau in 2014 to 0.63 in South Africa, and the Guinea-Bissau in 2017 to 0.53 in Brazil. In contrast, the Guinea-Bissau in all EU countries is below 0.4.
New data show that the most severe income gap is often the areas of wealth gathered, including Washington, New York and Connecticut, and, of course, some poorly washed areas such as Puerto Rico and Louisiana, whereas in Utah, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota, these five states have the highest level of economic equality.
The rating agency also showed that the growth of the average household income has stagnated to more than $62,000. This is the highest level measured by the US community survey, but the increase was only 0.8 in 2017 to 2018 compared to a significant decline in the first three years, and that figure is almost no growth in terms of inflation.
New statistics are likely to bring the direction of the campaign for Democratic candidates nominated in the next year’s presidential election party, where Democrats usually supports the imposition of more taxes on super wealthy and large corporations.
This could also undermine the idea behind the current government’s corporate tax preferences policy, which was approved by Congress in 2017, which aims to convince multinational companies to bring jobs in the manufacturing industry back to the United States while making income flow to the middle and poor classes. In fact, these policies seem to only bring extra income to the executives, while most Americans lose the benefits of economic growth and record low unemployment rates.
A North Carolina man wins five times at the same lottery prize.
A North Carolina man wins five times at the same lottery prize, including $163634 first prize.
Pickville’s Garan Lancaster told North Carolina’s education lottery officials that he bought five cash lotteries using his five group numbers when he stayed in Pickville’s Wisconsin brothers and sisters were able to take five prizes on Monday night.
“When I picked up the prize, my wife helped me write the numbers,” Lancaster said, “When my wife gave me the paper and I checked a lottery, I just couldn’t believe it. One line matches 5 numbers, the rest line matches 4 numbers. I cried out, “I got the prize! I got the prize! I got the lottery!”
Lancaster had a line of five numbers matching the middle prize, winning $163634 for him, while the remaining four lines of numbers matched the middle prize numbers each winning $250 for him.
The winner said he intended to use the money to pay his bills and perform some houses repairs.
Tristan Thompson, Coler Cadisane's ex-boyfriend, left another extremely provocative comment on her photo wall before there were rumors that he wanted to combine with Cadisane.
Tristan Thompson, Coler Cadisane's ex-boyfriend, left another extremely provocative comment on her photo wall, before there were rumors that he wanted to combine with Cadisane.
Earlier this year, the 35-year-old star completely abandoned the American National Basketball Association player because Thompson was accused of having sex with his family friend, Jordan Woods - before Coller had been treated with their daughter, Trudeau, who was 9 months pregnant.
One found that Tristan left another word of enthusiastic praise on Coler’s photo wall’s home page.
However, 28-year-old Tristan refuses to give up easily - leaving a shameful glory in his ex-girlfriend's latest self-shot.
In this obscure picture, Coler stands in front of the rising sun, writing in the image as a mother: "May you have the courage to explore every dream you dream."
In an open commentary, Tristine wrote: "The sun brilliantly shines the beautiful you [diamond expressions symbols]."
The fans were angry by the comment, and someone answered, “Yes, the diamond you drove down.
Colleen betrayed her when she was nine months pregnant.
Another fan warned: “Slip out the photo wall.
The third person wrote: “Collor, don’t be in a shame.
Just a few days ago, Tristan wrote: “Perfect,” next to a heart-like eye appearance, located below one of the other real-life photographs of Coler, is a photo she made a model for Gales’s trousers.
Earlier this month, according to Drake’s recommendation, Tristan spent £400,000 to buy a Porsche for Coler to combine with Coler.
Earlier this year, he was accused of fraud with a friend of the Cadisane family, Jodine Woods.
After his songwriter’s calling for a “great action”, Tristan decided to choose this disappointed gift, allegedly a Porsche 911.
Finally, his friends said Tristan won Coler's invitation to attend a "Tacco" dinner at her home on Tuesday - which brings him a step closer to reunite with Cadisane and their 17-month daughter, Trudeau.
A source said: “Tristan and Drake were good friends and he was always asking Drake’s advice when he planned to follow Cadizan.”
Tristan’s infidelity has hurt Coller’s heart.
Drake told him that if he wanted to pursue Cooler, he had to do his best.
“Even though to exchange an arbitrary dinner with a fashionable super racing car, it might sound less reasonable.
“But after Tristan did this, Coller did not immediately open the red carpet to him.
This couple is a 17-month-old Troy's parents.
In the first season of the real-time show, “College with Cadisane” series 16 premiums, Coler Cadis cries with tears over the deceit of his boyfriend Tristan Thompson.
The Sun Times revealed last month that Tristan intended to invite Coler to a romantic Greece trip after he swore: “I’ll let my family come back.
Although Coler was broken with the constant deceit of Tristan during their love process, he still invited Tristan to attend their daughter's first birthday party earlier this year.
However, the star's family real-time show "A companion with Cadizan" later showed that the incident ended with the tears of Cooler's hard to accept Tristan's infidelity.
Children's Hospital Freezer Failure: Stam Cells Damaged 56 Children's Cancer Patients
The Los Angeles Children’s Hospital’s freezing machine failed, resulting in damage to 56 children’s blood stem cells, which were collected and stored when each patient starts with tumor treatment, to prepare for future usefulness.
“We apologize for the pain or confusion that has caused patients and their families. If you do not receive a message or call from our team, your child will not be affected.
All patients have received basic treatment, but one patient except. Chief Medical Officer James Stein said the patient really needed to collect stem cells.
Earlier September, a letter sent to the patient's family informing the loss of stem cells was accidentally sent to children, not to parents.The police also apologized to parents and said they would monitor the transmission of the message.
The department said that long-stored stem cells damage would not harm any child’s health.The department also provided assistance to families who wanted to collect again, but the process of collecting could be more difficult.
One of the patients described it as it was "unbelievable." 13-year-old Sean Anderson Corona, who was diagnosed with a four-stage neurocellular tumor (a cancer often found in the kidneys), undergoed stem cell treatment. The boy didn't get off the machine all day and the machine collects stem cells from his blood. Then the machine re-injects the blood into the body.
“I’ll try to fall asleep, but my body starts to scream and then I’m crazy and crying,” Corona told ABC-7.
In November, Corona would have three years without recurring cancer, but his mother Elizabeth Anderson said she was worried that if his cancer recurring, he might not be able to collect more stem cells from his blood.
Stan said it was recommended that the patient re-accumulates stem cells only if the patient’s condition requires stem cells.
“We think this is almost unlikely, so we won’t ask anyone to do so in advance.
The chamber has replaced the freezer, and the sensor monitoring and alarm system has also been upgraded.
“Obviously, this is a huge expenditure for us, Mr. Stan said that we will contact each family directly to ensure that all their questions are answered.
Prince Harry attacked Princess Diana by foot through Angola
This is the sixth day of the Duke of Sachs to visit Africa with his wife Meghan and Achie, but on Friday morning Prince Harry returned to Angola alone, intended to attack her mother, Princess Diana.
Harry wears a bright blue protective back provided by Halo Trust, which successfully inherited her mother's worship. Twenty-two years ago, Princess Diana had left a trace on a similar road and passed through an area buried deadly mines in Angola, which were left during the Civil War. This became one of the most iconic images of her short life.
On January 15, 1997, Queen Diana of Wales, wearing a protective back and mask, visited a mine area in the province of Angola, which was cleaned by the Lightning Trust charity.
Diana has been trying to eliminate this war weapons, but failed during the world, and she died just a few months after the International Mining Prohibition Convention was adopted in December 1997.
Twenty years later, the world still failed to get rid of the threat of the mines. Prince Harry exploded a newly discovered min, responding loudly and clearly to her mother's wishes.
Prince Harry said: “Mines are no healing of war trauma.Through shurry, we can help local communities achieving peace, while peace will bring opportunities.
Prince Harry exploded the latest detected mine in Angola.
Thomas Cook's Retirement Trusted Planned Expenses Rescue Agreement
Thomas Cook’s pension fund has started negotiating a deal with professional insurance companies to rescue the benefits of the bankruptcy tourist group’s pension plan.
Sky News that the hosting agency chairman Steve S. Stewart was negotiating with several companies about a break-up agreement that would let the majority of 1.4,000 members of Thomas Cook’s pension plan free of a significant reduction in pension payments.
Any transaction with insurance companies may involve expenditure cut, much smaller than 10% expenditure cut caused by transferring a pension plan to a pension protection fund rescue boat.
The discussion is still in a very early stage - even if successful - the agreement must wait until the Pension Protection Fund evaluates the Thomas Cook program.
Thomas Cook’s bosses are facing investigations on the cause of the group’s collapse.
The investigation could last for two years and if the Thomas Cook program actually introduced the Pension Protection Fund, the future expenditure for approximately 10,000 retirement beneficiaries would be reduced by 10%.
Several pension risk transfer experts, as well as at least a new “Super Fund” integration company, are negotiating an agreement with Thomas Cook’s trustworthy.
Four days after the oldest travel company in the history of Britain has been suspended, the news of trusted people’s efforts to ensure membership, which triggered an international return plan and led to thousands of people unemployed.
Thomas Cook’s deep bankruptcy triggered a fierce game of accusations, and both board members, government ministers and auditors need an explanation of their behavior in the months before the group failed.
According to the latest data, Thomas Cook’s four pension schemes are sufficient for funding with £100 million surplus based on the Pension Protection Fund.
They hold a total asset worth about £1.5 billion.
However, Sky News revealed last month that trusts asked Thomas Cook’s proposed rescue agreement to add more favorable terms, making the transaction complex.
Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy ended his 178-year payable transactions, pushing government bankruptcy services agencies, accounting regulators and an influential parliamentary committee to launch an investigation against Thomas Cook.
The ministers have established a dedicated group to deal with the crisis, which made creditors less profit after the group bankruptcy.
So far, less than half of Thomas Cook’s abroad customers have returned home.
Just hours before his bankruptcy, Thomas Cook sent a final request to his lending agency, requiring a reduction of funding demand by £200 million.
What’s the problem with Thomas Cook?
Negotiations ended Sunday evening, but no deal was reached, and Thomas Cook was forced to seek more than £10 billion new funding, which was also its last crazy battle.
Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 by a 32-year-old furniture woodmaker, a former Baptist missionary, who started a day train trip from Leicester to Laffburg, which requires only one priority per person.
Since then, Thomas Cook has become one of the largest holiday companies in the world, celebrating its 175th anniversary three years ago.
A spokesman of the Pension Protection Fund said: “Some bankruptcy cases, such as Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy, have been the reason why the Pension Protection Fund was established.”
“We provide financial security for the future of the pension fixed income program members, and the program members should be sure we will protect them.
Thomas Cook, a spokesman of the pension agency, refused to comment on Friday.
On the picture, a newborn cattle is using his nose and exploring a new home.
This baby named Stella was born early this month in the Cotswald Wildlife Park, Oxford County, and was the first female baby born by Monty and Ruby.
This little boy is healthy and is well carried out, you can see from the photo that it is curious about the environment around him and sleeping on a rice grass bed with his mother.
In 2009, the mother Ruby and another female animal named Nancy joined the Wildlife Park, hoping to join the first little cattle in the Monty's Netherlands Park.
In 2013, the next female infant named Astrid, Nathalie was the third female infant born 49 years ago in the park.
Jamie Craig, Director of the Wildlife Garden of Cotswald, said: “We have achieved huge success in the breeding of existing cattle.
“Stra is the sixth child of Nancy and Ruby’s family, and our Bull Monty has proven to be an excellent father.
"He is the perfect combination of only dominant birds and parents who are inhabitants.
“It’s satisfying that Ruby gave birth to a mother-in-law – which is crucial for the development of the breeding plan, and Stella will eventually be transferred to another group hoping she will be a successful mother.
Ruby has previously given birth to two male babies, Ian in 2015 and Alan in 2017. Alan is still in the park, while Ian is in the Turin Zoo in Italy.
When Alan was only a week old, he weighed about 11 pounds.
Circular births are considered to be extremely rare. Female reproducts only once every two and a half to five years, so the chances of successful reproduction are limited.
According to the park, female wheels usually need 16 to 18 months of pregnancy to produce a small wheels.
It is considered to be one of the longest pregnancy animals in land mammals, after only 22 months of the elephant.
The newborn bull can stand up within an hour after birth.After birth, the bull can try to smoke immediately, although in the first few days its legs may be slightly stable.
It will, under the eyes of the mother, smoke milk for about a year.
Their relationships are very intimate, the little bitch will stay with the mother under the protection of the mother for at least two years.The females will very actively protect their descendants, and if they are challenged, they will intimidate the opponents.
A non-voluntary solitary man Alex Minasyan told Toronto police he is a member of the 4chan website organization.
The man on the picture allegedly killed ten street people in Toronto, and he told the police he was a member of an online sexual abuse male organization.
A 26-year-old Alex Minasyan said he is a member of the 4chan website’s non-volunteer soldier forum.
After the attack on April 23, 2018, he is now facing ten murder charges and 16 murder attempts in Canada.
When asked about the dead, he told the police: “I feel I have completed my mission.
Following the incident, people have caused attention to the online world of loneliness, anger and horror.
Minasyan said he had been in contact with a murderer in California who was angry about the rejection of his wife.
He was accused of driving a rented bread car in a busy community in northern Toronto, where eight women and two men were hit and killed, with the age of less than 22 to 94 years old.
Minasyan has not presented a protest yet. His trial began in February, but the publication ban on him under the police hearing has been lifted today. The police interviewed hours after the attack occurred.
Minasyan said he had never given a girlfriend and was a man, he acknowledged that he used the truck as a weapon and said he wanted to launch more attacks.
“A few other people I meet online feel the same,” he added, “there are too courageous to be unable to take action to spread anger.
Minasyan calls himself "incel", the word abbreviation of "non-voluntary singles". The non-voluntary singles movement is an online sub-cultural group associated with the deadly attacks in Toronto as well as attacks in California and Florida. The group promotes the idea of hateing women that men have the right to have sex with women.
Sociologists and other scholars in the study group believe that “non-voluntary singles” have gradually become a popular language of anger for some men who are angry for women’s rejection and tend to generate the ideas of violent revenge.
On online forums, interested people sometimes use “chad” and “stady” as a dishonor, indicating men and women who are more active in sex respectively.
Minasyan said he discussed his sexual abuse on the 4chan website, the site is a place for extremists to express opinions and has been unknown.
U.S. House Fears Shooting Again and Ban Clowns Watching Clothes
The U.S. largest Independent House line banned audiences dressed in Joe to watch the widely-classified Clowns - telling the story of super anti-party death in the Batman movie. Although the cinema has banned audiences wear masks or painting face, security concerns remained.
Most U.S. House lines have banned viewers from wearing masks, painting faces or carrying toy weapons because a major shooting occurred in Colorado City when another Batman movie, Dark Knights Rise, was shown in 2012.
However, the Geographic Cinema announced this time that audiences who dressed Joe will not allow to watch a limited-level film Clowns.
“I want the audience to be more relaxed when watching movies,” Ted Mondoff, Director and Chief Executive Officer, told Hollywood reporters.
Headquartered in Los Angeles, the company has 52 cinemas in 27 regions of the country and is the largest professional cinema line in America.
Meanwhile, the US’s largest chain of cinemas, the US multi-sale cinemas headquartered in Kansas, repeated that the cinemas prohibited “masks, painting face or any objects that cover the face,” but welcomed audiences in the dress.
The prohibition of masks and fake weapons is more due to practical security considerations, but as the clown’s appearance is closer, people are concerned that it will trigger a simulation of shooting.The police said the police would “will wait hard around the cinema on the day of the premiere, while the Imperial Cinema of the second largest chain in the United States said that security measures are being implemented for “cooperation with NATO” development.
The U.S. Army even warned the soldiers to pay attention to “non-voluntary singles”, usually some men who are unhappy because they don’t get a date opportunity, who worship clowns and may imitate his cruelty behavior.
The clowns is directed by Todd Phillips and headed by Jacqueline Phoenix, recorded on October 4 and predicted that the film will re-create a ticket room record. The protagonist is a descendant of a person who is isolated and uncommon with the world, he becomes a killer fancy, green hair, white face, and the host of Batman.
The Clowns won the highest prize of the Golden Lion Prize after the premiere of the Venice Film Festival. This is a psychological shock revisioned from the same name comic works. Some film critics are concerned that the film may have a negative impact because the film sympathy against the protagonists and the violent scenes are too written. However, the film’s main creator team said that the audience of the film was able to clearly identify adults.

Romania invests billions in Black Sea military bases
According to the Times, Romania will invest €2.5 billion in modernization of the Black Navy bases to counter Russia's growing strength in the region. Documents published on the local news site show that the Mihail Kogrignihan Air Force Base, located about 200 km east of Bucharest, will comply with NATO standards. It will accommodate up to 10,000 NATO F-35 fighters. It is planned to build a military "mini-city" with children's gardens, sports clubs and hospitals.
The base has become a hub for NATO’s increased activity in the Black Sea, while the Black Sea has become a key area of tensions between Russia and the West. After Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin began using the deep-sea base in Sevastopol to carry out navy missions in Syria to increase its strength in the Black Sea. Russia also hindered the transportation of the region, captured three Ukrainian ships in the Red Sea last year.
Romania and Bulgaria, located on the Black Sea coast, formerly allies of the Soviet Union, joined NATO and the EU after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Times said they asked NATO to strengthen its forces in the region in response to Russia's action. In February, 500 American troops arrived in Romania's air base. The British Air Force's European Typhoon Fighter Command has been deployed and completed its deployment. Since April last, these planes have repeatedly blocked Russian fighter planes. Georgia, located in the eastern coast of the Black Sea, also felt concerned about Russia's ambitions. It is not a NATO member, but participated in NATO military exercises. NATO Secretary-General Jesse Stoltenberg said that NATO was joining Georgia "preparing." Ukraine has also participated in NATO exercises in the region and has been developing relations with the EU since 2014.
“New Berlin Wall” in Ukraine again scandal
Poroshenko wanted to win the support of President Trump, and the former was increasingly concerned that political opponents would stop his recovery, which cleared the way for Julian Nietzsche, he could press the Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Luenko (later dismissed) to ask for investigating Joe Biden and his son to help Trump recovery.
But it is still unclear how Trump’s administration hopes to help him reverse the trend before the two rounds of Ukrainian presidential elections in March and April this year. Anyway, he was hit and a disaster to Zelensky, whose officials soon became the new target of the Trump team to start fighting Biden.
Although Democrats hoped that Trump's president was bumped because of his past with Ukraine, the president and his allies have reacted with self-controled Ukrainian scandal. They reiterate a already revealed claim that Ukraine had joined the Clinton campaign team to reduce Trump's 2016 election chances, and claimed that, without almost any evidence, Biden used his vice president's position to prevent Ukraine from investigating his son.
Over the years, the Ukrainian people have been twice bored with the continuous use of their power and privilege in exchange for their own economic or political interests; today, most Ukrainian people are ignorant of the possibly the worst scandal of the Trump administration since President Richard Nixon’s overturning the White House in 1974.
Ukraine, which has been concerned by few Americans in the past, has now become the central stage of Washington, which has caused tremendous confusion in Ukraine. This feeling is also swallowed by pride that, after hundreds of years, under the shadow of the powerful neighbor Russia on the north, Ukraine is no longer seen as a dust of dead waters, but incredibly becoming one of the most powerful countries in the world.
This week, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin, under Porošenko, posted a thin message on Twitter, saying the prospects of “as a country leading to bombing the President of the United States” are not good.
Pakistan's brother Kander Baloch is sentenced to lifetime prison for homicide
Carndel Baloch, a famous for social media photos, was kidnapped in July 2016.
The brother of Pakistani social media star Carndil Baloch was sentenced for murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment, the country's most notable "honor murder".
Balohe has been renowned for her funny self-shot, not much according to Western standards, but it is considered to be provokative in Pakistan, a highly hated feminism, and she was murdered in July 2016.
A few days later, he said in a press interview that he did not regret everything he did, he acknowledged "of course" that he murdered his sister, and the behavior of his sister was "intolerant".
His lawyer Sadal Mahmoud told AFP that the court in the eastern city of Multhan has determined his party guilty and sentenced him to perpetual imprisonment, which is a noticeable judgment.
He said, “If the situation is permitted, he will be sentenced innocent by the High Court.”
Earlier, Baroch's mother, Anvar May, told AFP that she had hoped that his son could be released innocent.
“He was innocent, my daughter was killed, my son was killed,” she said.
Baroch’s murder became an international headline, and again calls for action against the spread of the so-called “honor murder”, which means a victim – usually a woman – was murdered for disregarding the social principles of paternity rights.
Women are burned, shot, murdered and murdered for their freedom to choose their husband or – in the case of Baloch – for crimes such as praising their gender to bring “shame” to their families.
Such murder is usually committed by close relatives. According to Pakistan Blood Debt and Revenge Act, they can seek forgiveness from the victim's relatives.
Three months after the murder of Baloch, Parliament passed a new legislation that states that anyone who murder in order to preserve honor will be sentenced to perpetual prison.
However, whether murder is defined as a crime of honour is determined by the judge, which means that theoretically, the murderer can claim to have different motivations, but can still obtain forgiveness.
In the case of Baroch, her parents initially insisted that they would not forgive their son.
But once they were sad about losing their son, they changed their mind, hoping he would be forgiven.
The international community’s resistance to the murder led the Pakistan government to take unprecedented steps to declare the government to be the heir of the victims together with their parents, however, which forces the case to continue.
Some of the most well-known behaviors of Baloch include performing a disconnected dance for the Pakistani team, as well as wearing a drop-rown dress on the Valentine's Day.
Her behavior brought some criticism and threats, but many, including young people, believe that Kim Kardashian's character could be seen as a bold and empowered political act that created a new situation for the country.
“Honor” murder is rooted in tribal social norms, which remain common throughout South Asia, and specifically regulates the behavior of women, although men may be victims.

A team of international astronomers using the Spareau, Keek and Twin Telescope to discover 12 galaxies that existed approximately 13 billion years ago. This is the oldest atomic group ever discovered. The largest of these galaxies is a submarine named 10 years ago by the Spareau Telescope, which is named after the Queen of ancient Japanese mythology. The findings suggests that large galaxies such as the atomic galaxies existed in the universe only 800 million years ago, representing only 6% of the age of now.
In the present universe, galaxies may contain hundreds of galaxies, but how these galaxies were formed is still a big question in the astronomical field. To understand the formation of galaxies, astronomers seek the possible origins in ancient universe. The galaxies are a density system consisting of dozens of galaxies in the early universe and gradually forming a galaxies group.
The leader of the team of astronomers, the Japanese Academic Revival Researchers at the National Observatory of Japan, explained: “The galaxy group is a rare and special density of extremely high galaxy system, which is very difficult to find. To solve this problem, we used the wide-screen of the Spru Telescope to draw large-scale maps of the sky and look for the original galaxy group.
On the space map drawn by the Sparrow Telescope, the team found a suspicious atomic galaxy z66OD, which is 15 times the density of the normal galaxies of that time.The team then performed subsequent spectral observations using the Keek Observatory and the North Twin Telescope to confirm that these 12 galaxies existed 130 billion years ago and are the oldest atomic galaxies known to date.
Interestingly, one of the twelve galaxies of z66OD was found in 2009 by the Spru telescope, which contains a large amount of gas. The team member of the Japanese National Observatory and the University of Tokyo said, “It is likely to be found atoms near such a massive body. However, we are surprised that the galaxies are not located at the center of the galaxies, but at the edge of 500 million light years from the center.” Ironically, the mythical Queen is said to have lived with the isolation.

A new book about the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi is coming to release, the author is familiar with her daughter Christine Pelosi.
The Times Book Publishing announced on Thursday, “The Way of Nancy Pelosi” will be released on November 26. The work of Christine Pelosi will tell how a mother of five children becomes the first female president of the House of Representatives, as well as her current leadership in the House of Representatives under Trump’s administration. According to the Times Publishing, the new book of Christine Pelosi presents her mother’s “professional and personal experience”.
Christine Pelosi is currently a Democratic Strategy Analyst with Camp Training and Camp Training 2.0.Pelosi’s sister, Alexandra Pelosi, is a filmmaker and journalist who has filmed a number of documentaries about contemporary politics.
Warren donated money for lemon water to an abortion charity
When Senator Elizabeth Warren bought drinks from two girls running lemon juice in August, she may not realize that the $10 she bought would be donated to an anti-abortion charity.
“Our daughters think (Warren) is friendly,” a Trump supporter, one of the girls’ father, Dan Michelle, told the Washington Freedom Tower, and told us we should vote for her.Our daughters told us she was a good person, but we didn’t recognize her politically... Because she claims women have the right to choose abortion, we said we should donate her money to an anti-abortion.
On August 8, Warren stopped in front of a lemon water bottle during a campaign bus trip in Iowa, with two 11-year-old children: Siena Michels and Audrey Bilings.
“Come to Harlan, Iowa, and take a cup of lemon before a bottle of water. When life gives you lemon, you have to make a major structural change!”Warren tweeted.
The two children were pleased to see a presidential candidate. After the photo was published, a girl named Michelle urged her parents to vote for the Massachusetts Senator in 2020. However, parents explained Warren's position on abortion. The girls and their parents decided to donate to the Life Education and Defense Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports anti-abortion legislation.
Michelle said, “My daughter told us that she wants us to vote for her.” “We talked about abortion and said maybe we should donate money to an abortion, and my daughter is totally in favour.”
Why it is necessary to re-classify herpes and Zika virus: the effects of biotechnology
Recent research suggests that people need to re-adjust the cognitive way of viral structures as their structures are actually more diverse than they were known before, these findings may have a significant impact on their classification, our understanding of how they are formed, evolved and infected hosts, and how designs respond to their vaccines.
In the 1950s and 1960s, scientists began to obtain high-resolution images of the virus, discovering the detailed structure of the viral shell; the shell is an external protective layer consisting of multiple copies of the same protein, which is used to protect the virus. Most of the shell of the virus are typical square-ball shapes, showing a twenty-sided parallel structure, like a twenty-sided shell.
The shell is a protective layer of the virus, and when scientists discover the structure of the shell, they suggest the shell of different sizes and carry different quantities of genoms, so the virus can infect hosts in different ways.
Why this is so important.
When designing drugs for viruses, scientists can now consider their different structural shapes to improve therapeutic effectiveness.
Two researchers at the Virus Information Institute conducted specialized research on the structure of the virus, theoretical biophysicologist Anthony Luke at the State University of San Diego and the other student physicist Rethon Dywalock at the University of York, concluded that many viruses have been basically incorrectly classified in the 60s, including common viruses, such as simple herpes and Zika virus.
Although we have obtained structural images of low-temperature electron microscope, researchers did not have a mathematical description of different viral structures.
Luke said: “We have discovered six new ways to make up the twenty-face shell. Therefore, many viruses are not only using two well-known shell structures. Now there are at least eight ways to design their twenty-face shell.
Researchers used the expansion of the equivalence principle to observe how protein packed twenty-sided body shells.
Their research results will be published in Nature Communications on Friday, September 27, which also suggests that viruses of the same spectrum will adopt a consistent twenty-seat shell layout based on the protein they compose, which provides a new approach to research on the evolution of the virus.
Biotechnology Applications
Structural biologists can now use this information to re-classify the structure of the virus, which will help reveal molecular and evolutionary relationships between different viruses.
It will also provide guidance on new molecular containers designed for nanotechnology and biotechnology applications, and will help scientists identify specific strategies for protein assembly in the shell.
Luke said: “We can use this discovery to target the assembly and stability of the shell to prevent the virus from forming a virus from infecting the host cells, or to decompose it after the virus is formed. This could help identify and identify antivirus targets of the virus that share the same twenty-seat layout.
This new framework accommodates previously isolated viruses, provides new predictions of the viral shell structure and identifies the common geometric patterns in the long-term evolution of viruses infecting all organisms from human to bacteria.
The new bluetooth also provides “a new perspective of viral evolution, showing new ways to evolve larger and more complex viruses from simple viruses on a time scale of evolution.”
Application of buildings
Geometric graphics can also be used in new architectural design and construction.
Inspired by the measuring rounds of the ground rounds designed by the well-known architect Buckminster Fuller, structural biologist Donald Kaspa and biophysicologist Alan Kruger introduced a geometric framework that has been classified viruses according to the geometric framework of the viral shell since the 1960s. However, with the progress of molecular imaging technology, the reconstruction of more and more three-dimensional viral shell, including herpes virus and zika virus, has gone away from this classic geometric framework.
Luke explains: “This study will introduce a more general framework than the classic Kaspa-Kruger structure. It is based on the local top-notch conservation formed by the proteins interacting within the shell. This method has discovered six new types of twenty-seat shell layouts, while restoring two classic layouts from the Kaspa-Kruger based on the Goebbels and the Measurement Multi-seat Caspa-Kruger.
Pastor for sexually abused boys in Wisconsin sentenced to 30 years in prison
A former pastor accused of sexual abuse of boys in Wisconsin was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
According to the Woso Daily Pioneer, 72-year-old Thomas Ericsson was sentenced to the highest prison sentence on Thursday for two allegations of sexual abuse of boys, respectively, in the late 1970s and early 1980s when he served as a pastor in the Catholic Church of St. Peter.
Four men testified to court on Thursday to complain about the impact of sexual abuse on their lives. One of the victims appeared publicly for the first time.
Ericsson apologized to the victim at court, saying he began to realize the impact of his behavior on the victim. At least 11 men claimed to have been abused while Ericsson was a pastor.
Ericsson was dismissed from priesthood in 1988.
Excessive consumption of this additives may damage the liver.
The cabbage is made from the inner skin of the cabbage tree, a widely popular condenser, is a spicy for various foods, and even itself has become a unique taste.
This condiment has some impressive health benefits, such as it can reduce the risk of life-threatening diseases (such as heart disease, cancer and even diabetes), so it is inevitable.
But first, don’t hesitate to argue that it is not too much, too much consumption is also harmful to the body. In this case, if the human body consume too much coconut, there will be some side effects. We should ensure safety.
It may increase the risk of developing cancer – although honey can help reduce the risk of developing cancer, it can also cause cancer significantly. According to animal studies, if consumed too much cannabis in honey can increase the risk of developing cancer. Scientists say, in the long run, cannabis can destroy our DNA and thus cause cancer.
It may be harmful to the liver – according to research, too much shampoo can also lead to liver toxicity and damage. This is based on several studies on the effects of the human body after too much shampoo intake.
It may cause oral ulcers – consuming too much cabbage will not only cause fatal conditions, but also cause oral ulcers. It is estimated that it is because cabbage contains cabbage, and cabbage is a compound that can cause an allergic reaction in the human body after a large amount of intake. However, only people who are allergic to cabbage can suffer from cabbage.
It may cause breathing problems – this is more common prevention, because the meat is thin, easy to inhalate, can cause cough and vomiting, and the meat is also stimulating the throat.
It can lead to low blood sugar – for many people, cabbage is beneficial to the body because it reduces blood sugar effectiveness is very significant. This is very good, especially for those with high blood sugar. However, too much intake reduces blood sugar in the body too low, which leads to a number of new health risks.
Tennessee abortion trial is waiting for judgment
In a 48-hour abortion waiting trial in Tennessee, a federal judge must decide which expert he should listen to.
In a four-day trial ended on Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee attempted to prove that the law requires women to go to the clinic twice at least 48 hours in a period of time to reflect on their decisions about abortion was beneficial for them.
Both experts agreed that some women seeking abortion actually have no idea, and some women who have abortion later regret their decisions. However, the difference between experts is that the proportion of those women seeking abortion is more or less, and the 48-hour waiting time in Tennessee has no effect on these women.
On Thursday, the state lawyers presented a study of Utah's effect on 72 hours waiting period.The study found that 8% of women who first visited the clinical consultation said they no longer wanted to seek abortion.
Anthony Biggs, a social psychologist at the University of California, San Francisco, was asked to agree that some women would change their idea of abortion or that they could not get their idea at the beginning. But she noted that the study did not prove that Utah’s compulsory waiting periods would change their mind, and it did not find it beneficial to women in other ways.
BIGS also confirmed that there is no evidence so far that abortion could lead to women to mental health problems. She said a national study compared women who succeeded in abortion before the expiration date with women who passed outside the door of the clinic rejected the expiration date, and found there was no difference in the ratio of both suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress.
During the cross-question, Beigs noted that the study did not track the mental health results of women who changed their minds after the waiting period, despite only three of these women found in the study. She rejected the testimony of Priscila Colman, professor of psychology at Boring Green State University, Ohio earlier this week, who said abortion was associated with mental health issues.
Coleman testifies that most scientific literature related to abortion has a political tendency to support abortion.
On Thursday, a gynecologist from Memphis City testified to the state that he joined a highly controversial network organization that attempts to block the effectiveness of abortion drugs.
Tennessee’s waiting period law has entered into force in mid 2015 and Pedrassa said since then he has seen many women who want to block the effect of abortion after taking abortion drugs.
The chief of the clinic has previously confirmed that the waiting period would bring women to economic difficulties and stress. The chief also said that two requests for clinics and patients were challenging to coordinate both patients and clinics, resulting in abortions being delayed to 48 hours far beyond the law, forcing some women to seek a surgical abortion, and thus the risk of complications is greater.
According to the Guterres Institute, a research organization supporting abortion rights, 14 states across the United States have issued laws requiring women seeking abortion to go to abortion clinics twice, while Tennessee is one of them.
When judging whether the waiting periods in Tennessee violates the U.S. Constitution, district judge Bernard Friedman had to determine whether it carried out excessive burden on women seeking abortion. Some subjective criteria led to some waiting period laws to be abolished, while others remain kept, depending on the real situation in the states.
On Thursday, after the two sides submitted evidence of their possession, Friedman said he would make a decision as soon as possible.
France’s chemical factory fire is destroyed.
As the smell continues to spread to large areas, French authorities and Normandy residents are cleaning the remains of a chemical plant fire.
An oil plant in Rouen was burned on Thursday and no person was injured, but residents near the two shores of the Seine expressed concerns about potential health risks and consequences.
Local administrative officials said on Friday that after almost 24 hours of effort, the fire was destroyed on Thursday night.
French authorities have warned that a special smell would disperse when the fire was destroyed, which could spread to neighboring areas.
French Interior Minister Christophe Castane said people with health problems should stay at home until Friday night.
The cause of the fire is under investigation.The factory is listed as one of the highest risky industrial sites in Europe.
Liquid gas investments recorded in 2019 and China reached the highest growth rate
Since the beginning of the year, the investment in liquid gas has reached $50 billion, the highest level in history, the Director of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Bilor, said at an industry conference.
“This year, the investment in 2019 for the first time broke the highest record (final investment decision) – $50 billion,” Billor said at a meeting of Liquefied Natural Gas Manufacturers- Consumer Meeting held in Tokyo, citing Billor’s comment.
Surprisingly, the driving factor of investment growth is the growing energy demand in Asia; China is expected to exceed Japan and become the world’s largest liquid gas importer.
“The largest growth comes from China. In the next five years, one third of the world’s demand for liquid gas will come only from China,” Mr. Beall said, adding that in five years, China will become the largest importor of the fuel.
And the growth of investment is not surprising; the United States and Canada have done most of the investments.
In a report published in December 2018, the U.S. Energy Information Agency said it is expected to double the U.S. liquid natural gas export capacity by the end of this year to reach 8.9 billion square feet per day. This will also make the U.S. third largest liquid natural gas exporter after Qatar and Australia. By 2030, the U.S. liquid natural gas exports will increase from 3 billion square feet in early 2019 to 17 billion square feet per day.
Canada currently has only one Liquid Natural Gas project – Canada Liquid Natural Gas – but its final annual production capacity could reach 28 million tons. The project costs $3 billion, led by Shell, with a few shareholders including Malaysian National Petroleum Company, Central Petroleum, Mitsubishi and South Korean Natural Gas Company.
At the same time, Qatar is also increasing efforts to maintain its first position in global liquid gas export competition. At present, Qatar and Iran have the world’s largest marine gas field – the northern gas field, Qatar has also lifted mining ban on the new drilling field, aiming to increase annual export capacity by 43% to reach 11 million tons annually.
According to the forecast of renowned global business information providers, global liquid gas demand is expected to reach 5.5 billion tons by 2030.
Viola Davis recording Jimmy Campbell's Live Show, exploding the real heart history of playing Michelle Obama
Viola Davis is feeling some pressure on playing Michelle Obama.
The actor said on Jimmy Campbell Live Show on Thursday: “I’m afraid of him.
Last month, it was announced that Davis will be performing First Lady in the entertainment time TV series modified by the series First Lady.David said the script was great, but she realised sharply that it wasn’t so easy to perform.
She told Cannon, “I don’t care about what I have achieved in my life, I have received an Emmy, an Oscar, and two Tony, but if I break this time, it would be a decisive moment in my life.
Davis said she was waiting for her public relations staff to call, “Don’t hang, I’m Michelle Obama – I’m killing you.”
Davis also takes into consideration the audience in the sixth season (final season).
She said, “Listen, I don’t want to make those who watch me crazy.
Judges are concerned about drinking choices during the night of teenage violation
A teenager violated the enemy and the judge sentenced him while expressing concerns about the choice of drinking before the teenager violated.
The 19-year-old Kylean Clefton hit a 17-year-old teenager who believes the latter was the culpable of having caused him to divorce with his ex-girlfriend.
The Royal Court of Oxford that Clefton had drunk alcohol in a fat lion bar in Oxford County, shortly before the rape occurred last March.
Judge Nigel Daley told Clefton, who had caused actual physical injury (abbreviated ABH), that alcohol "played an important role in the violation that night."
But he talked about the question of Clifton's choosing drinking: "Did you drink Coca-Cola and Italian tea? I'm surprised that you're not sick!"
Clefton from Charleston was sentenced to 12 months in prison, 12 months in prison, 15 days of reconstruction and 160 hours of “unpaid work” and paid £750 compensation.

Colombian President says Los Pelosos’ criminal group leader was killed
The top leader and founder of the Los Pelosos Criminal Group was killed in a Colombia State Police-led operation, President Ivan Duck said on Friday.
The group is one of the most famous criminal organizations in the Andes country, and the battle involved has crashed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in the eastern border areas of the country with Venezuela.
Luis Antonio Kintro, named Pacra, was once a leftist opposition who led more than 440 members of the group, the government said.
Parkla, 49-year-old, who was arrested by the police for terrorism and murder, was localized by police on Thursday in the Northern Santander province.
“Our goal is to completely break down the organization,” Duck said in a statement published in the United States that he visited the United States this week to attend the UN General Assembly.
Kintro is responsible for the killing of several human rights activists and community leaders, the statement added.
Duke has been criticized by some people of the international community because he has not taken any further action to stop murder activities across the country.
Another head of Los Pelosos was also arrested during the operation, the statement adds, but it didn't mention details of Kintro's death.
"How do you dare to do so?"Tumbery speech at the United Nations inspired Netherlands' climate change protesters
On Friday, thousands of Dutch youth strike at global climate change, blocking local traffic and questioning their leaders “How do you dare to do?” they cited the screaming of Swedish radical environmental girl Greta Thumberi in the United Nations speech.
On September 27, 2019, a protestant in the Hague, the Netherlands, taking a picture of Swedish radical ecological activist Greta Thumbell during a demonstration, calling on the government to take action against climate change.
The number of people who participated in the Hague protests exceeds expected, and the organizers estimated that the number of protesters was about 35,000. Police were forced to change the route of the protests, leading the protesters to places that could accommodate more people.
Tumberi, a 16-year-old, gave a passionate speech at the UN Climate Action Summit this week in New York. Last Friday, millions of people around the world have joined the climate protest campaign to promote the UN Climate Action Summit.
“When people continue to join the protest, the strike protests will have great influence, not only affecting the present, but also the future, and we can see people from all sectors participating,” said Demonstrant Randell Rustam.
Demonstrators walked across the city centre, screaming flags on one side, lifting up a photo of Tumbell on one side, with the tagged “for the beauty of Greta,” “Don’t be like a fool old old antiquity,” and “You die because you’re old, we die because of climate change.
“I understand their concerns and believe people have heard their calls,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Luther told reporters at a weekly press conference when the protesters were marching in places not far from him. “We have already proposed some huge expenditure plans to address these issues, but the implementation is flexible to create employment opportunities.
At the beginning of the Climate Action Summit, Trump’s brief speech shocked the whole world, which aims to mobilize governments and companies to break the paralysis of international community’s action on carbon emissions, despite decades of warning scientists about the impact of climate change, the global carbon emissions of last year still reached a record high.
“It’s all wrong. I should not sit here. I should go to school on the other side of the ocean, and you’re looking for our young people to hope.”
The Netherlands has 1.7 million inhabitants, and renewable energy generates less than 7 percent of its total energy in 2017, compared to 15 percent in Germany and more than 50 percent in Sweden.
The Dutch government pledged to half its emissions in 1990 by 2030 but only 13% reduction by 2017.
On Friday, Tumberi also participated in the Gattaon climate protests, where UNHCR’s leaders were taking a meeting in Montreal to discuss the air transport sector’s emissions reduction goals.
Suicide attacks are increased, the military situation is not optimistic.
This year, suicide rates among current soldiers have risen to historical highs, the continuation of the situation is very fatal, and the Pentagon officials said the situation is frustrating and is currently actively responding.
Data released by the Pentagon on Thursday showed that the suicide rate of the army, the Navy and the Navy's Navy and the total suicide rate of the army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army's army.
Earlier this month, the Navy three crew members of the George H.W. Bush aircraft fleet had completed their lives in a week later, which highlighted the difficulties facing both the officers in identifying a possible problem and finding ways to prevent suicide.
When asked about the suicide of the crew members of the aircraft, Defense Minister Mark Esper said: “I hope I can tell you that we have found the answer that could prevent the armed forces from happening suicide in the future.
The number of suicides in the U.S. Army has increased from 511 in 2017 to 541 in 2018. According to the Pentagon, the highest risk ratio population is young inbounders, with at least 60% of the cases they chose gun as a suicide method. The number of suicides in the army has increased from 114 to 139, the number of suicides in the Navy has increased from 43 to 58, the number of suicides in the Navy has increased from 65 to 68, while the Air Force has dropped from 63 to 60.
Elizabeth Van Vink, Director of the Pentagon Army Response Office, said: “Our figures have not evolved in the right direction, and she said that most soldiers are treated differently from civilians, and added: “It’s hard to be pleasant.
Military and defence leaders expressed disappointment and are determined to take more measures to improve the forces’ response capacity, train the soldiers how to respond to pressure more effectively, and encourage the troops to seek help when they need help. Van Vank said the army also is considering strengthening the training of forces in the safe storage of weapons and drugs. She said there are no uniform rules or regulations between departments that require blocking or taking other control measures, but some states or bases have their own limits.
She and the Director of the Office for Suicide Prevention, Karen Ovis, said it was difficult to identify servants who could be in pain or have suicide thoughts, sometimes suicide was suddenly impulsive decisions and almost no warning in advance. They said it was hard to find the cause of suicide because too many stress factors that cause suicide.
They also acknowledged that officers were unwilling to seek help initially because they fear that this would affect upgrade or security inspections.
General David Berger, Commander of the Navy Navy, said: “In addition to physical health, gun training, training and education, the Navy Navy must also be free to discuss the difficulties of life, mental health and suicide. We need to build a community to help and help make important decisions to become the Navy Navy Navy and Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy Navy
This year, the Pentagon for the first time included statistics of general marriages and family suicide in consideration. Van Vank said the latest figure was in 2017, but officials are working to improve the ability to collect family-related data.
According to the report, 186 families have committed suicide, 123 of which are spouses and 63 are families between 12 and 23 years old.
The vast majority (approximately 70%) are female spouses under the age of 40, while 70% of the families who died of suicide are men. About half of the suicide families are over the age of 18, and for those who are younger, most suicides are young people between 15 and 17.
Seth Mayes is laughing in Donald Trump's Tango and Cash impression
On Thursday, Seth Mayes, the head of the Late Night Show, brought a moment of relaxation for a very depressed week of mass shooting, he blamed Donald Trump, but he couldn’t stop laughing himself during the inscription.
The comedian referred to Trump’s visit to a hospital in El Paso, Texas, where the victims of a mass shooting occurred in the weekend were treated at the hospital, and his campaign still owe the city more than $500,000 due to a February political meeting.
Due to failing to pay on time, the event also generated a single deposit.
Mayes said: “This is Mr. President’s constant adjustment. I’m surprised that his president’s office’s office has not been flooded by a non-refunded hundred-view DVD.
Then he began to imitate Trump in 1989's popular film Tango and Cash, but he was soon uninterrupted.
After a bullet found in a woman's skull, a man dropped into prison.
A man in Georgia was sentenced to 25 years in prison for shooting a girlfriend because his girlfriend was to go to hospital for headache treatment and realized that he left a bullet in his head and survived.
According to media, 39-year-old Geranty Cane was sentenced on Thursday for a serious crime of possession of a gun during the attack of 42-year-old Nicole Gordon in 2017.
Gordon, suffering from severe headaches and memory loss, was examined by a doctor last year and the doctors found a bullet in her neck.
Gordon told the police that she didn’t remember her shooting, but actually remembered a struggle with Kate when her car windows broke and she also passed away. She thought herself was wounded by broken glass and she was well embedded in Kate’s mother’s house.
Women's Fashion Week T Show in Paris
As Ms. Gaga sang in her 2008 popular song "Roman Death", "Go, Go, Fashion Baby Gaga"
One editor said a male model remembered these words in his mind, and his T-table show made other models clearly discolored, and he served as a closing model for the spring 2020 series of John Gallia Nomagilla on Wednesday’s Paris Fashion Week.
This male model named Leon Damm, who was 20 years old this year, conquered the audience with a unique T-Taiff-cat footsteps, he lifted his head, pushing his feet back with strength forward, with sexlessness, while keeping a strong firmness in his eyes.
He was wearing a coat, white shorts and knee-length shoes, wearing a student hat and stylished a hot deal on the internet. In a cat walking video, when he passed through the fashion designer Anna Wintur, the latter seemed to smile on his face.
Many have been praised by this young German model, who had participated in the exhibition of Gil Sand, Fee and Korean Hard-Han men's brands, famous for his unique sense of fashion.
Actress and star Lisa Lina describes Lyon as her “souls special,” while fashion designer and singer Rihanna looked at him on the photo wall application software.
After the release of the show’s video, a fan wrote on the Lion’s page: “This video and departure was really outstanding. Another fan also said, “The Great Lion,” while the makeup artist and the great Hen Pat McGra made his performance make-up, as well as the make-up artist of the show, left him a sign of flash and flame.
The highest praise is probably from the agency editor Tim Blanks for fashion business reviews on a fashion site.
“You’re an unknown young man at the time of departure, but you’re already a hot star!” on Wednesday, Branks wrote in the title of Photo Wall Application Software, citing the classic phrase in the movie 42th Street.
He also added, “@leondame makes the cat’s footsteps strange @maisonmargiela I think they’re saying it’s true.
A geomagnetic storm will occur at the end of September.
According to the Space Weather Forecast Center of the National Atmospheric and Ocean Research Agency, geomagnetic disturbances are expected to occur from September 27 to September 29th. High-speed solar winds may cause moderate geomagnetic storms (G2)
The Russian Solar Activity Research Laboratory at the Levjev Institute forecast that the disturbance will begin on the evening of September 27, and reach its strongest on the next day morning to noon. The planetary index can jump to a level of 5 Kp.
Geomagnetic storms can affect people with cardiovascular system problems. Doctors warn that some people may experience heart pain, headache, headache and non-concentration. Magnetic disturbance usually also affects mental disorders.
If there is more serious disturbances, the electric networks will also be fluctuated.Satellite signals that provide navigation information are also weak.
A spectacular polar light will appear in the sky above the two poles, which is the most beautiful landscape of this phenomenon.
Sony and Disney are working together again to launch the third Spider-Man movie.
Disney and Sony now hate the ice release, and Spider-Man is back on the day.
The two companies announced on Friday that they will cooperate in filming the third part of the Spider-Man film, played by Tom Holland.
According to a press release published by both sides, the unnamed film will be released on July 16, 2021, produced by Disney-flagged Marvel Film and its president Kevin Figger.
Amy Paska was also going to make movies through Paska Films, just as she was directed in two of the previous films of Holland.
Figer said in a press release: “The journey of Spider-Man will continue in the Marvel film universe, and I am very pleased to be able to continue to work for this, as well as the whole of the Marvel film industry as well as myself. Spider-Man is a powerful idol and hero, whose stories spread around the world, deeply loved by audiences of all ages.
The agreement also allowed Spider-Man to appear in the future movies of Marvel.
Figer acknowledged that this collaboration made the flight-walking capabilities unique in the superheroes.
“Spiderman is the only hero who has superpower and can cross the film universe, so as Sony continues to develop its own Spider-Man universe, we never know what surprises the future will bring.”
It has been over a month since the end of the Spider-Man stop, and it is that the two companies could not reach an agreement on the continuation of the previous films "The Return of Heroes" and "Heroes Journey".
The end of the problem is that Disney, who holds this role, wishes to co-financing shares with Sony in the future movies, had reached an agreement before Disney purchased Marvel in 2009 and Sony owned the film copyrights.
Hollywood reporters pointed out that both sides have reason to cooperate with: The Hero's Journey is Sony's highest film ever made, while Marvel can maximize the promotion of the products and maintain creative control.
He was pleased with the end of the stagnation, also Holland himself, who expressed his pleasure on the Photo Wall application software.
EU and UK negotiating representatives work in Belgium to reach a Brexit deal
The EU’s top Brexit negotiating representative began talks with British officials in Belgium on Friday in order to reach a Brexit deal; there is currently about a month from the deadline to reach the deal.
Michel Barnier met British Brexit Minister Stephen Barclay in Brussels, and Barclay insisted that any agreement should exclude Ireland's "border protection measures." This "border protection measure" actually ensures the soft border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after the Brexit, has become the main obstacle to negotiations.
Barclays said, although the UK is committed to reach an agreement, he said less time remains.
“I think there’s a long way to go, I think it’s now the key moment for negotiations,” Barclays said.
The deadline for Brexit is 31 October, but a new UK law prohibits British Prime Minister Boris Johnson from completing the Brexit without a trade deal, and does not allow the British parliament to approve the Brexit before October 19 without a trade deal.
Last week, EU negotiating representatives said they were willing to accept an alternative border protection, but Ireland's representative Simon Cowenny said last Friday that London had not submitted a "serious" proposal.
“Unless there is a serious proposal as the basis for negotiations, the current huge differences will continue to exist.
The negotiating representatives also said “not much time” and “the British Prime Minister and his team are responsible” to make a serious proposal.
Johnson’s office on Friday said the agreement was still “tough heavy.”
“From the Irish perspective, we of course think a delaying out of the EU is better than a delaying out of the EU without an agreement,” Covney said, “but I think the reason behind the delaying out of the EU is sufficient.
EU President Jean-Claude Juncker said he and Barnier are making every effort to reach an agreement, and if he fails to reach an agreement, he was wrong in the UK.
Irish Prime Minister Valadca said he was pessimistic about the Brexit agreement, but he would urge British leaders to make a plan at the UK Brexit summit on October 17.
“The Brexit agreement is actually an international agreement,” Valverde said, “it’s not something that can be secretly modified or confused in late night.
Scientists' Confusion: Giant planets run around small stars
Scientists discovered in a classical solar system galaxy that is located 30 light years away from Earth, a huge tree planets run around a small red orphans, which completely reverses existing theory of planetary formation, and scientists were surprised.
Imagination of the galaxy GJ 3512b runs around the red orange, image published on September 26, 2019.
The stars are usually much larger than the largest planets that operate around them, but the stars observed are similar to the size of the planets, researchers said on Thursday.
This star called GJ 3512 is about 12% of the mass of the Sun, while the mass of the planets around it is almost half Jupiter (the largest planet in the solar system).
“Yes, it’s too surprising,” said Juan Carlos Morales, a astronomer at the Spanish Institute of Space Sciences in Catalonia, whose team led published the research in the journal Science.
“This discovery is surprising because the theoretical forming model suggests that low-quality stars usually have asteroids like Earth or small Pluto. But this time we discovered a geographic asteroid like Jupiter running around a very low-quality star,” Morales added.
Through the telescope of the Caratao Observatory in Spain, researchers discovered this wooden planet, which is mainly made up of gas. It runs around the main star along the orbit of the Asteroid, with a cycle of 204 days.
GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the Sun, but also smaller to even comparable to most of the larger planets, GJ 3512 is only 35% larger than Jupiter.
“They release less energy, so the radiated light is too weak, and their surface temperature is also low, approximately 3,800 degrees Celsius (6,380 degrees Celsius/3,527 degrees Celsius).
There is evidence that another planet is running around the red orange, and that there may be a planet being thrown out of the galaxy, which explains that the orbit of this type of trees is circular, Morales said.
The planets and the stars surrounding them are born on the same planets composed of interstellar gas and dust. According to the most accepted planetary forming model "core accumulation model", the galaxy originally formed solid particles within the planets, the gravitation of the planetary embryos can gather the gas around it and form a atmosphere.
Another relative model is called the gravity instability model, which could explain this unusual galaxy.
“In this case, the original planets around the young stars may be larger and lower than expected,” Morales pointed out that would make the planets unstable, resulting in some intense areas and forming blocks. These blocks can continue to grow until they shrink, forming planets.
School strike around the world calls for climate action
On Friday, children around the world started another wave of school strike calling for action against climate change, their first major action since the issue became the top topic of the United Nations World Leaders Agenda this week.
More than a year ago, Swedish teenager Greta Samberg alone launched the “Future Friday” movement like the spring after the rain, with millions of students walked on the streets of cities like New York, attracting the attention of African developing countries.
Some of the initial protests began in New Zealand, according to Samberg, organizers estimated a total of 170,000 protests across New Zealand. The protests were also held in cities in countries such as Italy, Finland, Nigeria, Austria and India.
Friday’s protest took place after a week’s UN climate talks held in New York, including Samberg’s speech, strictly condemning world leaders’ failure.
“You steal my dreams and childhood with your empty words,” she said on Tuesday, the eyes of the next generation look at you, and if your choices disappoint us, I can say we will never forgive you.”
Demonstrators referring to a report approved by the United Nations last year calling on governments to take measures to prevent global temperatures rise above 2.7 degrees, and scientists warned that this would have terrible consequences for human life and the Earth.
Samberg and her inspired young people said they won’t stop weekly class strikes until they see a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions leading to climate change.
During a strike on Friday in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, Orlando Adinec, the activist posted on Twitter photos of students wearing blue colleges clothes with a slide on top of the slogan “Climate change is really happening” and “We are less time”.
In August, hundreds of climate strike organizers gathered together in Lausanne, Switzerland, preparing for this week’s events and thousands of people marched in the city.
Thousands of people are expected to walk on the streets of Helsinki in Finland, where local media that schools in Helsinki would allow students to participate.
Samberg remained in North America after the UN visit and planned to participate in the climate strike in Montreal, Canada.
Serena Williams was sent $10,000 for suspect of damaging the Wimbledon tennis court
Tennis legendary, Seven Wimbledon Tennis Championship champion, Serena Williams, was fined with $10,000 for allegedly shooting a ball to ruin the London gym.
According to the United Nations and the U.S. cable TV news network, WINET hosts all-England clubs have imposed penalties on Williams for allegedly causing damage at the outdoor training competition on June 30.
The 37-year-old tennis star received a journalist interview after winning a quarter-final against Alice Rice on Tuesday, which she seems to be laughing on the fines.
When asked about the case of the fine, she said: “Then, I didn’t really think of ruining the field. I just throwed the ball.
Williams said she didn’t know how this would damage the stadium.
She told reporters, “I mean, if you can tell me how I was damaged, I would be very grateful. I’ve always been a person with inner desire of revenge. Maybe I’m very strong. but I don’t know.
Williams is striving for the eighth win-win champion titles, where she will be celebrating the 24th Grand Prix. In the single semifinals on Thursday, she will face the Czech player Pablo Strikova.
Last year, a judge of the US Open contest accused Williams of illegal communication with the coach during the game, and Williams defended it, and therefore received a fine of $17,000.
In the case, the court sent to Williams three violations: the first was that she received illegal instructions, the second was that she broke the ball because of emotional failure, and the third was that she called the other "theft" when she confronted with the court.
Many fans of Williams claim that the reaction of the trial was too severe to her, especially given the situation when male athletes were excited throughout the sport history.
“Do you know how many men do something much worse than this?” Williams told US Open Officers who entered the stadium during the game after she had a confrontation with the court.
Williams was not the only person who was sentenced at the Open Open this year, but her fine was the highest.
Italian oppositionist Bio Fannini said on Saturday after defeating the third round of the US player Tennis Sandgren, the phrase "should explod a bomb on the tennis court" and was fined with $3,000.
Australian athlete Nick Kirgios was charged with two fines for breaching sports ethics, one with a fine of $3,000 and another with a fine of $5,000.
The band suspended last night’s concert: Friday and Sunday’s performances are cancelled.
The legendary rock band "How Long People" is on tour in the United States. In Houston, Texas, Roger Daltray was forced to cancel the performance until half of the concert. The 75-year-old singer, face to a disappointed audience, said: "I think it's best to see the band has already sung eight songs but promised to return to the performance one day in the future.
After playing the 1982 classic song "Excellence Front", Daltre announced his resignation. He has always had a voice problem, obviously strictly followed the recommendations of his surgeon.
The British giant told the audience that he could not complete the show: “If I continue to perform for you, I would be injured. I thought it would be better to see you and get ... the last time I stayed in hospital for a month and I didn’t want to go again.
Peter Thomson explains the situation to the audience: “It seems that he can’t continue performing, I’m afraid...”
The band left the stage and originally intended the band to do the rest of the performance without Roger.
When he returned, Thomson said, “I’m really, really sorry.”
“It is obvious that before the performance he saw a doctor, and you know he sang well during the tour. I don’t know what it was.
“I’m really sorry that you couldn’t watch the show tonight... we miss one thing, it’s Roger’s performance and it’s bad.
The audience fully supported him, pleased with his 74, he explained everything that happened, and how the band wanted to return to fulfill their commitment to the performance.
Thomson said, “We will announce the date of our return as soon as possible. I’ll come to explain... we’re performing a day and resting a day. It’s because Roger’s surgeon insisted he’s going to rest for a day.
“I swear to you we’ll come back and we’ll not let the tickets you bought go empty. I love you and I’m sorry for disappointing you.
At the end of the show, both Friday and Sunday evening concerts in Dallas and Denver will be canceled.
Their next performance will be held in San Francisco on October 9, and the band will start their British tour in Manchester on March 16, 2020.

Police investigate a deadly car accident in the Los Angeles State Forest and have found the bodies
On Thursday afternoon, police were investigating a deadly car accident in the Los Angeles State Forest.
Police said a car was found under the Los Angeles Forest Road and the Grand Honga Canyon Road with a body inside the car.
Initial reports that the car may have been there for a while.
It is still unclear how the vehicle was found.
Is a nuclear-free world unavailable?
74 years ago, two nuclear bombs exploded above Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which killed hundreds of thousands.
Since then, as long as there is a conflict between the great powers, the threat of nuclear war will follow it.
Although there are various treaties trying to counter this threat, there are now around 14,000 nuclear weapons around the world.
Thursday is International Day of the Entirely Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, but the goal of the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons seems to be increasingly difficult to.
So, do countries have a political will to abolish nuclear weapons?
Meghan “move with care” and insist on doing royal duties while not “getting up” his pursuit
Meghan Markle decided to "move with care" and insisted not to "abandon" her pursuit while performing the royal duties, as a member of the royal family, she wanted to be an example of young and young girls.
The 38-year-old Duchess of Sachs said earlier this week during a visit to South Africa with her husband Prince Harry, at an event that inspired women entrepreneurs at the Cape Town Woodstock exchange.
The Woodstock Exchange is a UK-South Africa technology center that promotes skills development and market access by helping entrepreneurs, especially women, to gain skills, resources and support.
At the Women’s Entrepreneurs Association, the 38-year-old ex-actress met several women’s founders in industries such as technology, environment and fashion and praise their creative thinking “inspiring the next generation”.
In a dialogue with women’s tech founder, Meghan strongly advocated empowerment for young women and girls, expressing hopes to empower young men as well.
South African engineer, social entrepreneur, co-founder of engineering women and mother of two children, Nadia Musaji, said: “We recognize the importance of not only to educate girls, but to be the example of boys, we are influential women, but also to be the example of boys.”
We both have sons and we need to remember that we are not only the example of girls, but also the example of boys, not only our sons, but also the crowd.
She added that we didn’t feel any grade idea because of Meghan’s presence, because it was “women’s meeting, talking about the difficulties we face and the mission we need to accomplish to move forward, grow and change our society.”
Modis Modis, founder of the skill training company Simodisa, said that even though Meghan is a member of the royal family, she is determined to keep moving carefully without giving up her deeper pursuit.
“She talked about the responsibility of being a mother and a Duchess, as well as her inner desire to realize, not to give up pursuit because she was a Duchess,” Modice recalled.
You must be loyal to yourself.
She said the Duchess urged them to continue to cultivate their new ideas and tell them how they would continue to push and move forward, clarify that they do so to give an example to others.
Maddy adds that she didn’t mean to be a member of the royal family, but to do so when she faced challenges in everyday life, and she acknowledged that she felt a little “afraid of Meghan.”
“She dispersed an elegant attitude and accepted the task in such an elegant attitude,” Modiis said.
“As a founder, many of us have made amazing achievements, but a meeting with a member of the royal family is something scary.
Meghan also revealed that she the pressure of being a professional mother, acknowledging she felt as a member of the royal family and taking care of the children, Archie was a “stress” but “very exciting.”
Meghan told the CEO of Cape Innovation Technology, Laura Rosmarin, the mother of two children, “I am now a mother for five months.
“Sometimes you face something to eat, but when you meet some people and can positively influence them, you’ll say ‘Oh, it’s all worth it.
Meghan then went to the Mother-Heaven Institution in the city, which trained and hired women with HIV.
She brought Archi’s baby clothes, including a clothes printing “the future” and a baby clothes that he no longer had printed the word “inconquerable” and items that she donated as a mother’s friend.
Two parents were sentenced to six years in prison for putting a 5-month baby in a handbag and throwing into a garbage.
The body of a five and a half month old baby was thrown into a garbage bar and on Thursday, whose parents did not protest the baby’s death allegations, was sentenced to six years in prison.
Los Angeles County Prosecutors said the 34-year-old Adam Manson and the 32-year-old Cayenne Williams have not protested against the serious charges of abuse of a child, and have not recognized a special charges that allegedly caused the death of their son, Jackson Manson.
Manson and Williams both were initially not guilty of these charges.
Prosecutors said the two were found his son dead in the New Year’s evening when they were both taking drugs in a car hotel in south of Los Angeles. Prosecutors added they put the bodies of the child in a baggage and then thrown into a garbage bar near the Bodwin Mountain Clencho Square.
At the end of April, the police canceled the search after a few weeks of search for the Corona ElsoBrand waste storage, and the body of the child was not found.
Police said in a statement that they decided to end Jackson’s search with a “heavy mood” but noted that because they could not find the exact location in the trash cemetery, “there is no reasonable reason to continue the search.
Britain’s pharmaceutical supplies under no agreement leave are unclear.
The British government’s regulatory authorities said that if there is no agreement to leave the EU, the government still needs to do “mass” work to ensure the country has sufficient supply of medicine.
In a report published on Friday, the British National Audit Authority said the government’s additional rental trans-English Coast freight capacity may take place until the end of November (a month after the end of October 31). There are approximately 12,300 UK licensed drugs, 7,000 of which are from the EU, or through the EU, most of which are transmitted through the EU.
According to the “reasonably worst” situation predicted by the British government, drug shipping could be halfed on the first day of undeal Brexit, and it may take a year to recover. It is said that the time is “extremely urgent” to resolve the transportation problem by the end of October.
The report also stated that the drug reserves are "informed not complete", but the reserves are increasing daily. By September 20, suppliers that 72% of the drug have a six-week reserves.
“Without an agreement, the UK’s health departments will work in highly uncertain situations and have huge difficulties to fully implement the provisions,” the government’s regulatory authorities wrote.
Meg Cyril, Chairman of the Supervisory Audit Board, expressed “deep concerns” about the content of the report. She said she had seen the British government missing the deadline “numberless times”, but the situation was concerned.
“If the government collapses this time, it could lead to serious consequences,” she said.
Dr. Richard Tobert from the British Pharmaceutical Industry Association said, although companies are preparing for Brexit, “some things are uncontrolled by companies.”
He said that if the UK really wants to leave the EU without an agreement, the companies also need to know more about the relevant circumstances and learn how to use the additional freight capacity prepared by the government.
“The best way to protect patients is to ensure a deal is reached.”
Cleveland police have been labelled by the inspectors as "failed" in all aspects.
The police in Cleveland’s scandal has become the first police force to be inspected in all ways crowned with a “fail” label.
The Queen's Majesty Police, Fire and Rescue Services inspection assessed its overall work and three key areas, reviewing its ability to reduce crime, ensure public safety, efficiently operate, and how it treats public and employees.
The investigation suggests that special measures should actually be implemented against the forces, and police officers, police and criminal issues were consulted by the National Commission and asked them to ensure the implementation of a "significant improvement" plan.
If there is no improvement, the interior ministers can intervene to solve the problem.
A series of scandals have been disturbing the team, including Hartalpur, Redcar, and Cleveland, Stockholm and Middlesburg in the northeast of England.
Six police officers have been replaced over the years.
In 2012, former police officer Sean Price was fired for serious misconduct; after the journalists’ phone was illegally monitored, seven police officers were investigated with long-term complaints of racism in the team.
Recently, police headquarters said the police’s way of working “incredibly low efficiency” and the police had to share laptops and cameras with them.
British police inspector Phil Gomley said it was a “failed force” and the situation has been increasingly “serious” in the past two years.
Tyscow Mayor Ben Houn said the report was "the worst police force in the history of the state's investigation," "finally officially confirmed" the police forces "serious problem," and said the interior ministry is now needed to intervene.
He added: “There is no controversy. This is the fact that white paper black is described in this report.
“The results are the most painful and shocking part I have read.
Cleveland is one of the 15 forces recently inspected by the HMICFRS inspectors and the only unqualified forces in all fields.
Gomley added: “The forces do not have adequate priorities in prevention of crime. lack of strategic direction and the resources allocated to defence... failure to provide adequate protection to vulnerable groups such as children.
He said the senior leaders did not always show “ethical behavior” and “inappropriate behavior of the senior leaders in Cleveland is seriously affecting the effectiveness and effectiveness of the forces.”
He added: “This force does not constantly respect employees and does not communicate effectively with employees or understand employees; the process is considered unfair and insufficient understanding of employees and cannot support employees.
Despite the serious issue of the investigation, the force has actually received some praise for handling serious and organized crime, but it must improve its way in which it investigates crimes.
Police and Crime Commissioner Barry Ko Ping said: “I am very concerned about the concerned part of this report.
“The team’s recent performance was very bad.
He said he had been given the promise of the current police officer Richard Lewis that once he realized the mistakes, he would take “fast action” immediately.
The British Department of Internal Affairs has ordered Kobinger to respond to the report within 56 days.
Lewis said the report was like “setting a boundary” to the forces, adding: “Improvements have been made and I am fully responsible for promoting these obvious needs changes.In the five months of my office, I met outstanding police and staff at all levels, seeing a line of police efforts and determination committed to protecting life safety and protecting vulnerable populations.
Without great improvements quickly enough, the government could interfere, like the repair of prisons that collapsed.
But so far, politicians have never requested forced police forces to implement this measure, inspectors said.
Secretary of Crime, Security and Fire Keith Maltehouse said he encouraged the police officer to “take action quickly, solve these mistakes and monitor the position closely,” he added: “Transparency and accountability are key to build public trust in the police.”
In Manila Christ School: Several sixth grade boys in Virginia are accused of having caught black girls forced to cut their hair
A black high school student in Virginia accused three white boys of caught her and cut her shape.The incident occurred at the Manila Christ School, where Vice President Mike Pence's Lady Karen Pence was taught at the school.
Amary Allen, a 12-year-old student at this 12-year-old private Christian school, said that the boys catched her at the playground while they rested in the classroom and said her necklace was wicked and wrapped, and then cut her necklace.
Amary in tears told the Columbia Broadcasting Company WUSA-TV, “They constantly laughed and humiliated me.They say I’m ‘dirty’, ‘I should not be born.’
According to WUSA, one of the boys allegedly holds Amary's mouth, another boy holds her hands behind Amary, and another boy cut her neck with a knife.
Amary didn’t tell her family this until her grandmother found her hair was shorter.
“After they laughed and run, I just sit there,” Amary said.
The incident occurred on Monday, but the kid said she told her family until Wednesday because her grandmother noticed her hair was broken. She said she was afraid of being revenge after telling herself the truth.
Amary's grandmother, Cynthia Allen, said, "It's so painful. I hope the school can dismiss these students.
Amary’s family spends almost $12,000 every year to study for Amary, and the school follows well-known after Karen Pence was a teacher of art at the well-known anti-gay school.
The Maneli Christ School said in a statement: “We pay great attention to the mental and physical health of students and take zero tolerance policies to any form of harassment or violence. We are deeply concerned about these charges and are currently communicating with the victims’ families, collecting information and doing what we can to provide support. We also contact the law enforcement departments and ask them to investigate thoroughly, and for more information please consult the police offices in Falphix County.
Although the school adopted zero tolerance policy against fraud, Amary said the boys had tortured her before.
Amary's family met with school officials on Thursday and the investigation is ongoing.
Iran releases British oil tanker Stanna Aprio
Iran released a British flag-hanging tanker last Friday and two months earlier Iran had arrested it because it was suspected to enter Iran's waters in violation of international law.
Iran’s port and maritime authorities confirmed that the tanker named Stanra Aprio had left the port of Abbas at 9 a.m.
Eric Hannel, chairman and chief executive of the Swedish Petroleum Company (operator of the ship), also confirmed the ship has been released.
Eric Chanel tweeted: “The Swedish Petroleum Company and the British North Sea Administration confirmed that Stanra Aprio and his crew have been released.
On July 19, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard was arrested by the Iranian waters, due to the suspect of violation of international maritime law, which was entering the Iranian waters on Holmes Strait.
However, the arrest of the ship has been widely regarded as a revenge of Iran against the British army since the British army caught a tanker in the Gibraltar Sea, which is suspected to carry Persian oil to Syria in violation of international sanctions law. Despite the Trump administration's best to extend the detention time, the ship was released in mid-August.
According to the New York Times, Stanra Aprio was officially approved to leave on Monday, but remained in the port until the investigation of the ship's behavior was completed.
“The tanker has left Abas port and is going to Dubai to allow the crew to go on board for medical examinations and reporting,” Hannel said, “The crew family has been informed and the company is currently planning to return its important crew as soon as possible.
The tanker was the victim of the increased tensions near the Persian Gulf, where the US and Iran dropped each other's drones near the Persian Gulf and at least two tanker were bombed, and the Trump administration accused Iran of being responsible for this.
The Trump administration recently accused Iranian drones of attacking Saudi oil facilities and Tehran denied any association with it.
Prime Minister Modi tweeted Jacob Hillary as a true global politician, a friend of India.
India's Prime Minister Modi expressed congratulations to the death of former French President Jacques Chirac, saying India's congratulations to the death of a true global politician and friend.
Jacques Chirac, who expressed his support after a nuclear test in 1998 in India, died on Thursday at the age of 86 years. He served as president of France from 1995 to 2007.
“I have profound congratulations for the death of Jack Hirak. India congratulates the death of a true global politician. Indian Prime Minister Modi said on Twitter that as a friend of India, he played a decisive role in the establishment and construction of India’s strategic partnership.
India and France established a strategic partnership during his first visit to India in January 1998.
It is said that Jacqueline has been bad health for a long time.
Uganda: Government Launch Aids Oral Self-Testing Box
Uganda’s Ministry of Health has launched an oral HIV self-testing box designed to ensure that citizens (especially male citizens) are able to conduct HIV testing.
The aim of the program is to reduce the number of new HIV infected by 2020.
OraQuick oral HIV self-testing box, manufactured by Orasure Technology Company, is designed specifically for young people aged 18 to 24 years old, adult men and sex workers.
“Young people aged 18 to 24 are our current target population.Young people in this age are our focus and of course anyone over 18 should be included in the consideration range, we currently have no evidence of infection of minors as stipulated in the Constitution, but as more evidence arises, we will move towards this goal. For men, we will give the test boxes to their mothers and then give them to sexual partners, mostly sex workers, such as sensitive people,” said Jeffrey Tasi, Director of HIV Detection Services Technology.
Use is convenient.
The previously provided self-testing boxes need to detect HIV through blood, but the oral self-testing boxes can be tested through oral fluid.
The test box is achieved by detecting antibodies (the natural guardian of human body resistant to infections). If the human body is infected with HIV, the antibodies of the virus will be present in the blood and sputum. The test box is the object of the test is the antibodies in the mouth.
Data from the Uganda AIDS Commission show that an increase of 1,000 more HIV and 500 HIV deaths per week in Uganda also means an increase of 53,000 more HIV and 23,000 more deaths per year.
Dr. Diana Atwan, Foreign Secretary General of the Department of Health of Uganda, said the product was launched very early and will help human beings better fighting AIDS.
However, she urged men to take HIV tests seriously.
She added that 14% of the infected people still don’t know they’re infected with HIV and do more work to care for this part of the population.
“At present, 86% of HIV-infected people are aware of their condition, meaning the remaining 14% of HIV-infected people don’t know their condition. So the question now is how we should use this innovative technology. For me, in fact, it is so... how we now create need beyond the supply of the test box, especially for those 14% of patients who don’t get the proper care,” Dr. Dr. Atwan said.
However, health officials warned that food is strictly prohibited within 15 minutes before the examination.
Mr. Tassi said the related studies showed that there were no suicide cases, and the Ministry of Health was confident to avoid this possible tragedy because the detection belonged to voluntary behavior.
Dr. Atwan said, in addition to educating users through images and videos, government and private institutions (including all pharmacies) should also provide 24-hour free telephone consultancy services.
Research shows that HIV infected and non-infected people who were tested through the OraQuick HIV self-test box have more than 99% accuracy of the test results.
Qatar's athletes feel warm
At the opening of the World Cup on Friday, several participants have met their most challenging opponent: the warm and annoying weather in Qatar.
The moisture in Doha was depressing, and the day-to-day temperatures runs around 38 degrees Celsius, and athletes and field officials were discussing the weather in Doha, which is also a reason for their worries about some events.
Marathons and racing competitions are held at midnight, minimizing the adverse effects of high temperatures.
Although high temperatures will have a minor impact on the players in competing at the International Stadium of California because there is air conditioning in the room and the temperature isined at about 21 degrees, the relevant players still need to adjust the training arrangements because the training facilities are located outside.
“We are also from tropical climate countries, but there’s nothing more than here,” Bahamas coach Ronald Cartridge told Reuters.
“Here, you’re going out as if someone gave you warmth.I guess that’s the reason why you’re running midnight.
Field officials pledged to equip more medical and safety measures for marathons and runners.
International Sport Management Organization (IAF) said the women’s marathon competition, which was initially scheduled to start at midnight on Friday, will take place as scheduled, because temperatures are expected to be below 30 degrees or about 30 degrees.
The agency said its medical representatives have assured athletes that they will monitor the weather throughout the day and report to the teams, "to ensure the competition is running at an acceptable level of health risk.
Athletes who participated in the indoor competitions said heights shouldn’t have the impact on their competition performance too big, but they also recognized that the training was especially fatiguing.
“I’m all bright when training, because there’s too high moisture here, and I’m sweating,” said 400-metre bar player Ray Benjamin.
“It’s like I just washed the bath, but I think it should not be too bad because there is air conditioning in the room.
2016 Olympic champion and lead player Ryan Klaus said he had to warm the lead to about 38 degrees Celsius each time to prevent the lead to moist when training in high temperatures and moisture environments.
“The normal temperature of the pencil is far lower than the point of exposure, and once you get it out, it is moist, and still drops,” the American athlete said that it is worse than the rainfall... We have always overcome this situation.
European backbone jumping champion Amand Duplantis regularly attended training in the hot weather in Southern Louisiana, he said that wet weather has been helpful for training because after removing the water in his hand, “which makes the grip more tight.”
But for other athletes who frequently use adhesive spray enhanced traction, they are more difficult to catch the traction in these wet conditions, he said.
“I understand that people who often use adhesive spray will face some problems because the hands will become smooth and smooth,” Duplantis added.
Locker arrested, major prison security vulnerabilities are alarming
A Britain’s prison locker was arrested recently due to fear that the keys of the prison room would be copied, and taxpayers spent £500,000 to replace all the locks of the prison.
Due to concerns about some of the 1400 prisoners in prison’s key copies, Queen’s Majesty’s Prison Wanzworth told the police.
This suspicious security vulnerability will lead to replacement of 3000 locks, possibly locks in the prison, inside and outside.
Police arrested a 40-year-old man in the prison on September 13, who was suspected of a conspiracy of an inappropriate public service. The man from southwestern London, working at Government Facilities Services Limited, which provides maintenance services for 52 prisons in southern UK.
Police investigations raised people concerns that some traces of keys may remain in the glue before the real key copy is made.
However, prison officials stressed that they did not find any evidence that any prisoners had obtained the keys.
The Wanzworth Prison is a class B prison located in southwestern London, which can accommodate up to 1628 prisoners, and one of the largest prisons in Western Europe. The prison, built in 1851, was used to arrest convicted male criminals and arrested male criminals.
A spokesman of the Prison Administration said: “The Queen’s Majesty’s Prison Wanzworth has raised the security level of the door, because a security incident is currently undergoing special identity verification.
House of Representatives Warns Trump Stop Attacking Officer
"The President's today's speech constitutes a threat to witnesses and should be severely condemned, which hindered Congress's investigation.We condemned the President's attacks and urged our Republican colleagues to condemn, as Congress must make every effort to protect this informant and all informant. "The threat of violence from our national leaders has a terrible impact on the entire reporting process and also has serious consequences for our democracy and national security.
Trump said, “Now fully aware that our committee is looking for the testimony of the confident and of others mentioned in the “accusations of confidentiality” published today in the House of Representatives, and that our country’s laws prohibit any incurrence, threatening witnesses or otherwise pressing witnesses to prevent them from giving testimony to Congress.
“No officials who are aware of the Commission’s investigations – including the subject of the allegations of the informant – are not threatened by any threat, revenge or revenge, and all witnesses must be able to testify to Congress.
The statement was issued on Thursday, meeting this week with “accusations of accusations” in Washington, “accusations” alleged that Trump abused official powers in the upcoming 2020 elections “seeking the intervention of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky,” while the White House took measures to conceal the case.
There is no evidence that Joe or Hunt Biden were wrong.
Just before the prosecutors submitted a "proclaim of prosecutors" to parliamentaries, House of Representatives President Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday that Trump had betrayed his oath and announced the officially launching an investigation against the president.
Michelle Obama praises Meghan Markle for "inspiring" on Photo Wall Application Software
Michelle Obama sent a friendly letter on the Photo Wall application software on Thursday, expressing high praise to Meghan Markle, saying the Duchess of Sussex is “a thoughtful leader who breaks the rules and makes the world a better.”
The Duchess and Prince Harry are currently on a 10-day South African Royal Trip with his beloved son, Alch Harrison Mumbatton-Vince, who had attended a youth invitation earlier this week and met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
The former First Lady of the United States wrote enthusiastically: “Thank my friend, Princess of Sussex @sussexroyal, you are a thoughtful leader who is breaking the rules and making the world a better.
Michelle Obama added: “Whether to meet with our Obama Foundation @ObamaFoundation leaders or to help girls around the world seek education, she encourages many people.
Meghan, who has performed in Gold Dress Lawyers, was an interviewed editor of British Fashion Magazine, who interviewed Michelle Obama for the magazine’s September. The two ladies were happy to talk, and the former First Lady reviewed the experiences of her mother and the changes brought to her.
Michelle Obama said in an interview: “It has always been a master lesson for a mother’s mother.
As a mother, I understand that most of the time my duty is to provide children with space to explore and develop so that they become the ones they want to be.
Michelle Obama is well aware of its pressure under the global lightlight, and she gave some suggestions to the Duchess during an interview with the Good Managers magazine.
She said: “The pressure you feel from yourself and others can sometimes be very big. So my greatest advice is to give up something and don’t hurry to do anything.
She continued to say:
“I was worried about my daughters for the first few months of the White House, ensuring that they had a good start in school, and after I met new friends, I spent my whole heart in a more aspirant job.
Hero Moments: Police jumped on a busy speed to rescue a hit dog
It is a hero's moment when a police runs on a busy highway to rescue a wounded dog.
The video taken by Joseph Puglia's car recording shows that Joseph Puglia saw the dog jumping down the police car within a few seconds when another car hit.
A police officer working in the Phoenix Park, Florida, covered the wounded dog with an emergency coat, put him in his car and quickly sent to the nearest animal hospital.
Peggy told U.S. Radio News, “I feel a bit better until I saw the dog breathe.
Thank God, this dog survived the difficulty and only suffered a slight wrath.
The police said: “We gave him a pseudonym “Lucky,” I think the name is more suitable but it’s really a lucky dog.
This puppy was sent to a local animal rescue, and its rescue is known as a hero.
But Peglia insisted that he was just doing his job.
The police added that if the animal service center fails to find the owner of the dog, his family would be very happy to give a “lucky” house.
WeWork’s bankruptcy, the first open stock market puts a brake on non-profit companies
Boston (Reuters) – The leading companies in the U.S. stock market responded smoothly, especially when they are losing, which shadows the calendar of the first public development in the rest of this year.
Surprisingly, the sudden delay in WeWork’s first open shares, highlighting how the market’s trust in companies and investors looking for funding is being erosioned.
Peloton Interactive Inc (PTON.O) continued to punish Peloton Interactive Inc (PTON.O) on Friday, the next day it started trading, the fitness company’s stock price dropped to $24.74 to a drop of 4%. The company’s current stock price dropped 15% compared to Wednesday.
In the past, open market investors usually expect companies to make profit about 18 months after their first open acquisition. This time axis has been expanded because capital operators want to add fast-growing business to their portfolio.
However, recent transactions seem to indicate that the uncertainty in economic prospects is making investors more provokative against losses that they are willing to support.
Peloton reports that the company’s revenue has grown rapidly at 110% during the financial year that ended June 30, but the company’s operating leverage has also been negative, with operating spending up 147% compared to the previous year.
SmileDirectClub (SDC.O) has become the first to be listed in the US earlier this month. Data from the research company’s recovery capital show that the release price for the first open stock acquisition in three years will exceed the target range and will be recorded on the first trading day.
The average return rate for the first public acquisition in 2019 is currently around 9%, below 30% at the end of June and 18% at about two weeks ago.
In the United States, most of the attention in the third quarter was focused on a failed transaction—the first open collection of WeWork’s own company We Company’s plan.
The company was initially planned to hold its first public procurement in early September, but delayed the release plans to later in 2019, and then replaced the CEO and said it was reviewing the release schedule.
The entertainment and talent broker Endeavor Group Holdings (EDR.N), supported by Hollywood weight-level broker Ali Immanuel, decided to give up the first public shares in the last minute because of the severe market situation, the company had previously had a record of losses. Earlier in 2019, Yahoo Motor Company Advanced Technology (UBER.N) and Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) have not yet had a clear profit schedule, taking the lessons of both companies, and investors have begun to delay investing in companies with severe losses history, which would be a dialogue between bankers, board and senior management teams, they would say “these are isolated and uncomparable,” or say “our emotions have changed, we need to be more conservative and use different strategies,” said David Estirig, the U.S.
Jonathan Van Ness has just promoted a plan with Nancy Pelosi.
Star Jonathan van Ness appeared on Thursday in the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (California Democratic Party) discussing the Equal Rights Act.
The Equal Rights Act will provide non-discriminatory protection to individuals of gender minorities in terms of credit, education, employment, housing, federal financial assistance, jury services and public facilities.
The law will amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include gender orientation and gender identity in the list of protected categories.
Van Ness recently publicly admitted that he was infected with HIV, he first shared a video of his cats in the Congress building, and explained in the text that he had met with the House of Representatives to talk about the Bill of Equal Rights, co-life with HIV carriers and the acquisition of PrEP (a HIV-prevention drug):
He then shared a longer post depicting the scenario of the two-hand-save, urging his followers to courageously face Senate majority leader Mitch McKonnell (the Republican of Kentucky) and press the Republican senators to submit the Bill of Equal Rights to vote to the Senate:
Pelosi presented a Bill of Equal Rights on 13 March. The House of Representatives passed legislation in May. The bill has not yet been submitted to the Senate.
In August, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to fundamentally determine the legalization of anti-gender discrimination at workplace, and argued in a court-friendly meeting that federal laws concerning employer discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are not intended to protect individuals from being dismissed due to sexual orientation.
Earlier this year, Pelosi had talks with Van Ness, and three other “Pudder Savings” protagonists, as well as MP Alexander Ocasio Curtes, discussed the policy and promoted the bill.
On Thursday, Pelosi shared photos of her and Van Ness warmly holding his hands on the balcony, thanking him for the struggle:
David Edenburg is making a new documentary about animals and colors.
David Edenburg is 93 years old this year, but this iconic natural master is still unold.
He launched the innovative Nippon documentary, Our Planet, and after a great success, the popular star will return with another series: The Color of Life.
This time, the father of the two children will explore how animals use colors in their lives through a high-tech camera dedicated to the show.
British Broadcasting Company revealed that the star's goal was to show a "colored world invisible with blank eyes", which sounds really attractive.
Although fans look forward to the release of the series soon, it seems we all need to wait with patience because it will appear on our screens by 2021.
But we are sure it is worth waiting.
Earlier this month, at a famous ceremony held in London, David won the TV Selected Magazine's Lifetime Achievement Award.
So far, the career of this national treasure character has had a history of 60 years, bringing laughter to millions of people.
When collecting his medals, the reporter enthusiastically said: “Truly, what I do is not always so fun, and sometimes people hear something they don’t like!
But it is an honor and great joy.
The TV Selection magazine tells the winner: “Sir David Eddenburg is still working, studying and doing programs, he is not only a British hero but a global idol.
This week, David was once again praised with a polar exploration ship named after his name.
The star character, along with Prince William and Princess Kate, attended the appointment ceremony held at the Barkenhead Camellard ship plant in Mershed County.
“The world is facing a variety of difficult problems, which are not news for anyone of you, and the most aware of this are the young people of today who will inherit the world.”
Difficult problems require a lot of research and facts can be solved.
This is what this amazing exploration ship will do, find facts, seek the law of science to address the problems facing today, and in the future there will be more and more people to do so.
The Colors of Life is expected to be broadcasted on the UK Broadcasting Company’s second edition in 2021, while it will retain global copyright.
Murdered Parliamentary Joe Cox's husband said not to get political scores using my wife's name.
Jeremy Corbyn criticized Boris Johnson last night by posting a video of a murdered parliamentary, after Joe Cox's husband said his wife's name could not be used to get political points.
The video of the Labour leader drafted a piece of Miss Cox’s night worship after her death and was entitled: “Boris Johnson doesn’t care about our street violence.
Critics say Corbyn is using Joe Cox’s murder to obtain “expensive political score,” while Joe Cox’s husband Brendan Cox said Labour leaders attribute hate speech to “simple political issue” was “mortal.”
Mr Cox said: “Jeremy was right, the best way to respect Joe is to defeat hate and division.
“But Jeremy is wrong to attribute hate speech to a simple political issue of the political party. While Joe is an enthusiastic Labour, some things have to be beyond the party’s policy.
Cox also shared a post saying Joe Cox’s name is “not just a political point,” and he was entitled “this.” Thank you Mr. Corbyn’s video begins with him talking about Mrs Cox was murdered three years ago by an extreme rightist in the elected district of West York City, and people reacting strongly to Corbyn.
Speaking about Miss Cox, Johnson and Senator’s clip, Corbyn said: “The Prime Minister knows these words will promote violence and have serious consequences.
He continued to criticize Johnson and call on the establishment of a Labour government.
Corbyn added: “Many are deeply concerned about Boris Johnson’s speech, which is being transmitted by the extreme right.When women’s parliamentaries faced with death threats, Johnson did not look at them. It’s embarrassed that former Labour Parliamentary John Woodcock shared this video and said: “You can really be silent.
At the same time, the Conservative Parliamentary and Trade Minister Nathan Zahavi said: “You use Joe Cox in this way is a big mistake, because her family has clearly asked not to do so.
“If you’re a bit fair, Jeremy Corbyn, you’re going to put this video down before the British parliament had a debate on a few speeches this week, Johnson said in this debate that the “best way” to honor Mrs Cox is “to complete the UK Brexit.” Joe’s sister Kim Lydbitt calls for a reduction of extreme speeches, calling it “bad to Joe’s children.”
Joe's sister spoke to British Independent TV: "I'm talking publicly about some things about Boris Johnson's spectrum - I just think this way is not favorable to the progress of the situation. I can say what I think is right and what is wrong, but I'll try to do it in a cautious way."
Labour Parliamentary Ivit Cooper's daughter publicly said yesterday that she was concerned about her mother's personal safety, given the way people talk about politicians.
House of Representatives accused Trump of border wall, but he plans to use a vote right
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives tried again to overthrow President Donald Trump using emergency power to attack military bases projects (such as schools and targets) to pay the cost of his long-term promise to build a border wall.
The bill was submitted to Trump with 236 votes for and 174 votes against, but he would reject it, just like he rejected a similar measure in March.
The Senate passed the bill last week, but more than ten senior Republicans condemned Trump.
Friday's vote was different as the government recently published a list of 127 military construction projects, a total of $3.6 billion, which would be canceled to pay for the construction of the border walls, including many of the Republican elected areas and states.
Brazil says oil leakage in its northeastern beaches is not due to its own
On Thursday, the Brazilian Environmental Protection Authority - the Brazilian Environment and Renewable Natural Resources Agency said by an analysis of massive oil leakings on its north-east beaches showed that the leaked raw oil was not domestic production.
The agency said in a statement that they have been investigating the leakage of oil on several beaches in northeast states since September 2, where local media published several photos of turtles covered with black oil-produced floating.
Oil pollution spread across the northeastern coast of Brazil, with a total length of over 1,500 kilometers (932 miles), has impacted local wildlife and polluted landscaped beaches in many of the country's popular tourist destinations, including Fortuna Beach in Sierra, and Maragói Beach in Aragos.
Brazilian State Oil Company - Brazilian State Oil Company said in a statement that a molecular analysis of the crude oil proved that the leaked crude oil was not produced or sold by the company.
It is usually necessary to be tested before exporting raw oil to ensure that it meets the standards of the refinery that receives the raw oil. Raw oils from different oil fields can be identified according to a range of chemical components, including sulfur content, nitrogen content, acidity and adhesivity.
Brazilian Petroleum Regulatory Authority - Director of the Brazilian National Petroleum Administration, Decio Odone, said the agency believes it could be a tanker leaked oil far from the coast of Brazil, but added that this possibility has not yet been confirmed.
Some turtles were polluted by oil and were sent to rehabilitation centers after rescue in northern Rio de Janeiro.The bodies of other animals were also found, the Brazilian Environment and Renewable Natural Resources Agency said, but not revealed the specific number of animals or deaths.
Brazil’s National Oil Company said in a statement the company, although it was not related to the leakage of oil, is also involved in cleaning work, with about 100 employees helping cleaning the beaches.
Scoda provides voice digital assistant for drivers
Scoda will launch a digital assistant that can be launched via voice instructions. In a Wednesday announcement, the Czech car manufacturer said drivers could use the phrase "Good, Laura" to launch the digital assistant.
The system supports six languages and can execute a range of tasks, including navigation to destination and searching for music. The system will initially be built in the Kamiq city SUVs and compact cars Scala. According to the Scoda Annual Report, since the acquisition by the Volkswagen Group in 1991, the Scoda brand has delivered 1.2 million cars worldwide in 2018.
The virtual voice assistant launched by the company also reflects the efforts of other automotive manufacturers. For example, some BMW cars are now equipped with “smart personal assistant” that can be launched using buttons, calls or “Hello BMW” phrases. Drivers can use voice instructions to start the seat heating function, obtain tire pressure information, and adjust the temperature inside the vehicle.
On Thursday, CBD Automotive’s senior internet car expert Jack Palmer sent an email to CNBC channel, saying: “The voice is the ideal tool of interaction for cars.
“If you can receive most of the drivers’ orders via virtual assistants without touchscreen and buttons, then the current common problem of drivers’ disturbance would be significantly reduced,” Palmmer adds that the automotive manufacturers already realize that they are struggling to integrate their solutions with consumer electronics companies such as Google, Amazon, or collaborate with them.
The actions of companies such as Scoda and BMW indicate that the way people interact with cars may change.Auto analyst Hannah Cessione from market intelligence company Inmort told CNBC via email, a recent report focused on why 40% of American consumers who own cars 'wish to use personal digital assistants in cars' she added, "This creates more opportunities for the future development of the digital assistants."
Ghana: World Dog Disease Day
On Wednesday, Akra held an event to celebrate the 13th World Dog Disease Day, which actively urges pet owners to vaccinate their own pets to protect the safety of their lives.
The theme of the event is "Vaccination: Elimination of Pannabis", organized in cooperation with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the Agricultural Veterinary Office.
The aim of the event is to emphasize the important role of mass-scale dog vaccines in eliminating Ghana's catastrophic disease.
Mr Abbe Hil-Gabriel, deputy general director and representative of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Ghana in a speech at the conference pointed out that strongly enhanced vaccination and keeping migrating animals away from human beings (especially children) can be reduced to the maximum.
According to the Global Strategic Plan for Zero Death by 2030, “500,000 people die from Pneumatic Disease each year, 40% of which are children living in Asia and Africa,” he called for comprehensive measures to address this situation to protect children away from Pneumatic Disease.
Mr. Hill-Gabriel said most traveling animals are infected with puppy disease, which again reflects the need for Ghana to further expand the “Joint Anti-Puppy” strategy (i.e. zero deaths by puppy disease by 2030), which requires pet owners to vaccinate animals with concomitant diseases.
He stressed that Ghana must initiate a five-year exercise and vaccination program to raise public attention and eliminate the risk of human suffering from pineapple.
He noted that through the Ghana Pathology and Prevention Action Plan (2018-2030), we have developed a comprehensive roadmap for gradual elimination of Pathology, hoping to eliminate this tropical epidemic that has never been adequately respected by 2030.
Mr. Hill-Gabriel promised that the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization is prepared to cooperate with other relevant units in the prevention and control of the gender disease in Ghana.
The World Health Organization’s representative in Ghana, Dr. Owen Kalova, stressed that psoriasis is a epidemic disease that needs to be controlled to save lives.
He explains that through the strategy of “Zero Death by Human Paneology by 2030”, he supports the development and implementation of national plans for the elimination of Paneology, including the “health integration concept” and cross-sectorial cooperation.
Dr. Calva pointed out that 99% of human-common diseases such as pineapple are transmitted to humans through dogs, and he adds that “healthy unity” methods to control and ultimately eliminate human pineapple are very suitable.
Dr. Asyeddu Baa, Director of Veterinary Services, has regreted that psoriasis has become a global burden.
He said, “While pineapple cannot be cured, infection can be prevented by vaccination, so eliminating pineapple is possible, and all animals owners must ensure that they are vaccinated for their animals.
Dr. Baa said, although the use of appropriate sustainable control strategies can completely prevent pineapple, due to lack of funds and lack of cooperation, the mortality from pineapple will continue to rise and the epidemic will increase.
He added: “It is urgent to have sufficient resources for the animal sector to prevent the spread of pineapple in dogs to prevent this disease.
A 12-year-old girl who made the world silent
At the age of 16, Greta Tumberr established her position as a global spokesman on climate change, but 27 years ago, long before social media popping, another girl had already condemned the United Nations leaders on the world stage.
Her environmental movement has been unavoidable since Greta Tumberr organized in Sweden for a student strike against climate change; and her angry and passionate speech at the UN Climate Action Summit on Monday pushed her environmental movement to the top; she violently threatened politicians to steal her “dreams” and “children” with a “free talk” while humanity is witnessing a “growing extinction catastrophe.”
The New York Magazine describes her as “the Holy Virgin of the World Against Climate Change,” while the Guardian compares her speech to the meaning of the United States President Lincoln’s Gatesburg Speech.
In turn, in 1992, the media also appreciated Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang Zhang
We came here just to tell you adults that you have to change your way of life,” she started her speech, just like Tumberi told the attendees, “We won’t let you hide these responsibilities easily.”
As Trump told the United Nations Climate Summit, “a huge extinction catastrophe is coming, and you know all day only the fairy tales about money and economic growth,” Zhangzhou told national leaders, “Losting my future is far from as simple as election falls or floating in stock markets.”
And the focus of the two girls communicated was on the irreversible fate argument, I’m now afraid of standing under the sun because the ozone layer was empty. I’m afraid of breathing the air because I don’t know what chemicals in it,” said Zhangzoo in a 1992 speech. Again, in 2019, students strike, highlighting the slogan “You die because you’re older, I die because of climate change.
The environmental problems called Zuclear malaria reflect the world in the early 1990s, when ecological issues were focused on abuse, ozon layer consumption and species extinction. But after several years of intervention, humanity has successfully solved these problems. Due to the milestone prohibition of chemicals, the ozone consumption was significantly slowed, and the global forest coverage was also significantly increased, increasing area equivalent to the total area of both states of Texas and Alaska.
Mr. Zhumous himself later established a environmental intelligence center and worked for the Special Advisory Group of the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan in the early 21st century.
What will then be the future of Tumbeli?In fact, it depends on how you look at the example of Zhang Zhang. On the one hand, nothing of her most concerns happened. On the other hand, governments are still fighting environmental issues and at the same time accepting the insult of children.
Assuming that the world we still exist in 27 years later (the world will disappear unless humans reduce carbon emissions to zero in the next decade), this radical environmental girl is likely to look back on her long career in the United Nations and NGOs that began with this famous speech.
At that time, another worried child may be making a wicked warning about the issue of acid rain in the Mars colony.
Scottish National Party may support Jeremy Corbyn as a temporary prime minister to stop undeal Brexit
The Scottish National Party has said it could support Jeremy Corbyn as the temporary Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to prevent undeal Brexit.
As relations between parliamentary members and the prime minister's office increases, Nicholas Starking suggests that the Labour leader can be supported as the deputy prime minister before the general election.
Mr. Corbyn called on conservative traitors and opposition members to support his leadership of the temporary government in August, but the action has been resisted, especially by liberal-democratic leader Joe Swinson.
Based on these proposals, the opposition party attempts to stop Boris Johnson by a “unbelief vote” and then form a joint government, seeking a delay to prevent Britain from the EU on 31 October.
The program failed to obtain cross-party support at the time, but the Scottish National Party’s top members were concerned that Mr. Johnson would ignore the law if no deal was reached before October 19, forcing him to delay the UK’s leave from the EU.
Scottish National Party leader Nicola Starking suggests that a delay can be secured by appointing Corbyn, as putting Johnson in charge of manipulation is a "confident idea".
In response to a tweet from a proposal to appoint a Labour leader or another temporary prime minister, she said: “I agree with this practice.”
Unbelief voting, the opposition united by someone-centered, the only purpose is to ensure the delay and then immediately conduct general elections.
Everything is at risk, but let Johnson go to office, force not to reach any deal, or even to reach a bad deal, I think it’s undertaking.
Both senior Parliamentary members Harith Haman and Ken Clark have been nominated to lead the joint government, but senior sources of the Scottish National Party insisted that they must be talented leaders of the Labour Party.
The source told Independent BBC Robert Peston, “We will have to elect a new Prime Minister through a ‘unbelief vote’ so that we can request a delay of Brexit and a general election, which is becoming increasingly clear.”
Trying to find a compassionate and ethnic united candidate is too complicated, especially now we have a candidate.
A spokesman of the Scottish National Party said the party is committed to stop an undeal Brexit and "from the dangerous and undemocratic current Prime Minister as soon as possible."
The spokeswoman said: “If there is political will, the political parties are now possible to unite to ensure that the delayed letter does not fall into the hands of Boris Johnson and his beloved, who have determined to find a solution to avoid the Bannon Act, but sent by the temporary Prime Minister, the temporary Prime Minister will take office only within the necessary time of sending the letter, and immediately after the election will be held.”
We are still open to all choices to accomplish the goal to stop undeal Brexit and stop Boris Johnson.
Even with the support of the Scottish National Party, this will be a decisive vote for Mr. Corbyn. There are 288 Conservative Parliamentary Members and 10 Democratic Unitary Members, so the opposition needs to pull some of the 34 independent parliamentary members.
The Labour Party believes the plan is “the simplest and most democratic way to stop undeal leaving the EU.
However, the Liberal Democrats believe that a temporary government led by Mr. Corbyn needs support from former Conservative Parliamentary members and traitors, so it is not possible to get the necessary support in the House of Representatives.
Angels Conservative Parliamentary Courtney Hale said: “This report confirms many long-standing suspicions that Scottish National Parliamentary Parliamentary Party would be very pleased to support Jeremy Kobin as Prime Minister of Britain.
There is no doubt that Kobin's insufficient position on the second independence referendum (in short, indyref2) is a decisive factor for nationalists.
If he became prime minister, he has already opened the doors to the re-establishment of the 2014 referendum.
Only the conservative government can stand up to support those who have voted “opposition” in a event that should be a hundred years.
Accused of sexual harassment, more than 50 students were banned from participating in sports teams
“People just expect guys to do what they should do on vacation.
However, according to students’ response, the behavior of some students this year was very flameful, especially during a game where members of the football club were provocated by their teammates to provocate women while their friends tried to “stop” them from doing so.
Allan Sutherland, President of the Sally Student Council, said: “We have realized that this behavior is unfair and as the investigation is conducted, under the student discipline regulations, any student accused of “serious” mistakes will be transferred to school investigation.
The school has officially sentenced three students and has personally investigated the behavior of the football team.
A student was dismissed from school for three unfair sexual behavior or harassment and a sexual assault.
Meanwhile, two other students who were accused of harassment were sent final warning and asked them to apologize.
One student was banned from entering the university campus at a certain time, and another student was banned from participating in organized social activities.
The University’s Men’s Football Club said they have “sincer apologized for the behavior of its members in Croatia.”
Matt de Grood should not be punished for psychiatric pollution.
In 2016, Matthew de Grood, who killed five people at a family party in Calgary, was convicted of non-criminal responsibility for his actions.
Now, in 2019, a hearing will decide whether he should be allowed to have more freedom, such as uncontrolled exit. The decision will be made in the next few weeks, so during this time we will consider whether it is a good idea. There are different views on this issue: on the one side believes that, given his past violent behavior, calls should be prevented from happening again, while on the other, believes in the power of change and recovery.
First, let’s look at the more pessimistic side. De Grode actually killed five people during a psychiatric attack. This was an unpredictable violent attack. He suffered from psychiatric disorder, which is why he was convicted of non-criminal responsibility, but has since been looking for a psychiatric and taking drugs. His psychiatric Santok Ray had said before the examination committee, “If Matthew de Grode repeatedly committed law, it would be serious about the consequences. Despite he felt progress, there is still the risk of attacking others again. But is this reason enough to keep scared?
As long as De Grood continues to take drugs, the risk of re-crime is not great, why are people so worried? I think people have made this fear greatly for psychiatric patients, especially those who have sclerosis. Some mental illnesses have become less terrible, such as emotional and anxiety disorders. But other diseases, including sclerosis, are still highly contaminated. This is largely because many people describe psychiatric patients as dangerous persons, with a voice in their head telling them to kill.
This situation has actually occurred, but it is rarely, and this is probably why we remember this. In fact, most psychiatric patients are nonviolent and they are more likely to be victims of crime or violence than executors. In this regard, if the fear of re-crime is more based on the prejudice of psychiatric patients rather than the practical possibility, insisting on depriving degrad some freedom seems irrational.
I don’t think DeGrod should never be regulated by anyone. It is regulated through a similar system of false release to ensure he still is taking his drugs and drugs effective. He argues that he or other psychiatric patients are still accepted as an isolation unless absolutely necessary. This would make psychiatric patients, especially psychiatric patients, unable to be integrated into society; thus they will continue to be contaminated and the idea of them as dangerous criminals will be permanent. The court considers him not criminal responsibility, why should he treat him as a prisoner, rather than as a person who has been sick and now recovered?
Hungarian Prime Minister Orbán defends the country’s candidate to Member of the European Commission “a solution in hand”
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said he had "handed" several solutions after Hungary's candidate to the European Commission was rejected.
According to Reuters, Romanian Social Party politician Rovana Plombo, appointed by the Ministry of Transport, as well as the EU-East-Extended nomination Commissioner and former Hungarian Minister of Justice, Raslo Trotsky, were informed that their nomination hearing could not be held due to incompatibility in the financial reports.
“I strongly believe [Troatsani] is the most suitable candidate of the European Commission,” Mr. Orbán said in order to say he’s guilty, that he helped the government and me... protect Hungary from immigration harassment.
This is very embarrassed for Orbán, who recommends Trolley, and Orbán has continued conflicts with Brussels on issues such as immigration policy.
Meeting a baby on the flight: Japanese Airlines launched a service to avoid crying baby seating
Japan Airlines has launched an online booking tool that can show the seats of children in step-by-step, and therefore long-distance flights disturbed by crying babies may not exist again.
When passengers between eight and two years of age have a selected seat, a child ID will automatically appear on the selected table, reminding other passengers who have not yet selected seats.
Sunlight quickly pointed out that the new feature could not guarantee passengers could completely avoid the noise of crying babies.
If passengers book a flight through a third party, or participate in a trip group, or change a plane at the last minute, the icon may not appear, according to Daily Mail’s website.
Airline and other airlines have not yet invented a way to predict the seats planned for passengers and passengers whose seats are completely inclined while eating on the plane.
Nevertheless, the event has won some of the appreciation of users on social media.
“Thank you @JAL_Official_jp for reminding me of where children were planning to scream on the 13 hour trip,” businessman Rahat Ahmed wrote on Twitter that would really have been forced to implement the whole cabin.
However, some people also urge travelers to remain tolerant.
“They’re babies, we’ve been too.We need to learn to tolerate, otherwise soon we’ll need a picture of the common situation in life,” one user wrote.
Pompeo accuses Syria of using chemical weapons in May attacks
U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo spoke during the UN Conference on Thursday, the United Nations said the United States had determined the Syrian government used chemical weapons in a attack earlier this year.
Pompeo said U.S. officials have determined that the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad administration has used chlorine in the attack on May 19 against opposition armed forces in Idlib.
Pompeo said in a press conference: “The Assad regime is responsible for countless violents, some of which have risen to the degree of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
U.S. officials said in May that the reports they received corresponded to the chemical attacks in northwest Syria, but did not give any exact conclusions at that time.
In April 2018, the United States, Britain and France launched air attacks on Syria in response to suspected chemical attacks that killed more than 40 people earlier the month.
“It’s different in some sense because it’s chlorine... but be aware that President Trump actively protects the world from chemical weapons attacks,” Pompeo said.
He also said the United States would provide an additional $4.5 million to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to finance investigations on other Syrian alleged use of chemical weapons.
Pompeo also calls on the Assad government to release thousands of unfairly detained prisoners, including missing US journalist Austin Tise, who was supposed to have been imprisoned for seven years by the government.
He is just one of the few American citizens who are detained in Syria and we call on the Syrian regime to release them all.

Mike Pompeo said the Syrian government used chlorine chemical weapons in the May attack
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday the United States had come to the conclusion that the Syrian government had used chlorine chemical weapons in the fight against rebels in Idlib in May this year.
Pompeo said at a press conference held at the UN General Assembly in New York: “The Assad regime is responsible for countless violents, some of which have risen to the degree of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
“Today I announce that the United States has reached the conclusion that the Assad regime used chemical weapons on May 19.”
The U.S. said in May this year, the United States received a large number of reports that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's armies suspectedly appearing certain chemicals in the northwest area of fighting anti-government; however, the U.S. has not reached a clear conclusion whether the Syrian government used chemical weapons.
In April 2017 and April 2018, the Trump administration had bombed Syria twice by the Syrian government forces suspected using chemical weapons.
Father still reminds him that the suspect of shooting his son a year ago will eventually fall on the web one day.
A 20-year-old boy was killed in Long Beach for a year, but the victim's family did not give up the hope of the murderer's web.
The victim's father Guy Alford said, "I hope I can change with you, son, I hope I can change with you."
Alfred returned to the crime scene a year after his son Guy Alfred III was shot, a Jack fast food chain in a box near the 52th Street and Atlantic Street.
He said, “Some people know some things and they need to tell them.
Unpublished security videos show that Alfred stopped the second car behind him after parking at the car restaurant. Then three criminal suspect dropped out of the car. One of them went to the driver seat of the car located in Alfred and shot to Alfred. Four people on the car jumped the car and ran away. Then the criminal suspect returned into his car and left the car.
Orford said, “Wherever this species is, he will be caught.
The sad father said he didn’t know who wanted to hurt his son, and he didn’t know who was in the car when his son was shot.
“They ran out of my son’s car, as in the video, and where did you go? have you come back to try to help him or do anything?

Police are still investigating the fatal shooting, and Alfred said he himself did not give up.
He said, “This problem will be solved, I can assure you.
Olford personally offers a $2,000 prize bonus to look for traces that could be arrested and condemned.We strongly recommend all who can provide information about this crime call the Long Beach Police Department.
Britain’s Brexit is difficult.
If Johnson attempts to escape the commitment to demanding a delay, then waiting in Brussels for his will be humiliated in the EU court. This would calm the emotions of European officials, they likely agree to do so. Mainly because spending more time looking for solutions that could reduce the threat of "undeal Brexit", which would hurt both economies.
However, European diplomats also see that Britain’s political stagnation has led to britain’s lack of delay in making decisions. Parliament members can stop disputes, limit Johnson’s actions and seek delay, but all the consensus they can reach is just that. Parliament has three times rejected the hardly reached Brexit agreement with the EU. This is something that another member has the right to decide unless elections are held.
Even if the elections are held, the prospects remain sad, as European countries want to solve the chaos caused by the Brexit through a friendly scheme. The Brexit policy of the opposition Labour Party is painfully distorted and almost impossible to understand; while the middle liberal democrats proposed to cancel the Brexit, which is also considered too extreme. The longer the Brexit is pulled, the more disadvantaged to the EU's peaceful operation.
If a viable agreement plan is placed on the office table at the European Commission’s headquarters in Belémon, Brussels might be somewhat optimistic.
Johnson has frequently criticized the proposal of the former Prime Minister to prevent Ireland from returning to the harsh border and protecting the EU single market, but he has not brought any convincing alternative. Officials said many of the UK's proposed alternatives are not specific enough, lack of operationality, and are difficult to implement before the UK's leave of the EU on 31 October.
Furthermore, Johnson’s weakness would make his EU 27 countries’ leaders more unwilling to eliminate the focus on the Red Line, despite the British minister Michael Gov, responsible for the “no-deal Brexit” claiming they are “adjusting” backup scheme.
Johnson was attacked in the UK Brexit debate for incorrect speech, the ideal result is that a series of attacks on him would bring the corner closer to the end. Europe has no choice but to negotiate with the current British government while trying to maintain the solidarity between the remaining 27 Member States, therefore, Europe must still strive to make the UK a maximum surrender, but the longer the time is, the harder to accomplish. If there is a chance to reach an agreement again with the British parliament, the EU should take advantage of this opportunity.
But it’s more like a football game with 27 players in the defence, while the other player attempts to pick up the ball home.
The EU is well-known to develop rules, establish a "red line" and insist on implementation, but the unilateral implementation of its will is short.
The UK’s Brexit is difficult.
For the first time catch the black hole swallowing and scattering the stars.
For the first time we capture the image of a huge black hole that swallowed and broke the stars.
Researchers published an article in the Journal of Astrophysics said that the star is almost as large as our Sun, a distance of 3.75 billion light years from us, can see it turning and spinning up under the role of a super-massive black hole gravity.
The star was then swallowed, and astronomers called this rare cosmic event a wave breakdown event.
The U.S. Space Agency’s Planetary Search Telescope and the Sunrise Exoplanets Detection Satellites – for the first time captured the detailed timeline of the event from the beginning to the end.
Astronomers used a global network telescope to detect the phenomenon before observing the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanetary observation of the exoplanet that was designed to search for remote planets.
Thomas Holian, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institute of Science, who led the study, said: “This is actually a combination of reasoning and luck, sometimes it’s necessary to drive science progress.
When a star adventures too close to a supermassive black hole, it is absorbed into the center of most galaxies, such as the galaxies of the Earth.
The black hole's powerful gravity divides the stars, some of the stars' matter is thrown into space, the rest of the matter is injected into the black hole, forming a set of hot, bright gas in the process of digestion.
Mr. Holly added: “In particular, we are able to measure the speed of the star brightness, and we also observe rare planetary temperature decreases and brightness.
British Commerce Commission will investigate Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy
The British Civil Aviation Agency said it plans to operate 72 flights after the Thomas Cook Group’s collapse, taking 16,000 passengers back to the UK.
The aviation regulator said more than 40 percent of passengers have been taken back during the largest return operation of the peace period launched on Monday.
Meanwhile, the British Parliament's Commercial Committee has launched a bankruptcy investigation against Thomas Cook, trying to question the management issues regarding executive wages and accounting policies.
Thomas Cook is the world’s oldest travel agency, closed this Monday morning, with hotel owners, tourist attractions and resorts around the world.
“Unfortunately, the UK’s old-marking tourist company is closed, whose chief directors must face public audits and be responsible for their behavior before the company is closed,” said Rachel Reeves, chairman of the British Commercial, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee.
The hearing will start at the end of October.
“The directors are pleased to receive the opportunity for this clarification of the facts to prove their behavior is always in accordance with the greatest interests of Thomas Cook’s customers, employees and stakeholders,” a member of the company told Reuters.
Why the Times reveals detailed identity of reporters?
The Times released a reporter's exclusive details on Thursday, which led the Democratic Party to launch a bomb investigation against President Trump this week. The article says the reporter was a CIA official who had previously served in the White House and was very specialized in Ukraine issues.
Many readers (including national security and intelligence workers) have criticized the detailed information published by the Times, saying that the action could put the reporters’ lives in danger and could turn away the desires of those who want to report.
We expressed the concerns of these readers to the executive editor of the Times, Dean Bakquet, and Barquet responded in a discussion with the Reader Center:
Because the information provided by the reporters triggered a milestone bombing process, the President and some of his supporters threatened the credibility of the reporters. The president himself called the reporters' accounts as "political hacking behavior".
We decided to publish limited information about the reporter, including his work in a non-political agency, and his complaints are based on deep knowledge of the White House, as we want to provide the readers with information that allows readers to make their own judgment on whether the reporter is credible.
China says it has not triggered any war and has not invaded other countries’ territories.
On Friday, China said it was not intended to trigger a "war or conflict" or "invasion of another country" territory, avoiding mentioning the 1962.
“China has always been committed to resolving territorial issues and maritime border disputes through negotiations, consultations,” a official white book published by China on October 1, in the four days of celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party.
“Chinains world peace through practical action.In the past 70 years, China has not initially triggered any war and conflict, and has not invaded any other country’s land,” the White Book of the New Age of China and the World writes.
While emphasizing the “peace rise” of China, the White Paper does not mention the bloodshed war with India in 1962 and large parts of China’s occupied territory, especially the region of Akshin.
The Central Indian border dispute involving the actual control line of 3488 kilometers is still unresolved.China also claimed that the state of Arunachal is part of the southern Tibet, while India said the opposite.
So far, the two countries have held 21 rounds of special representative talks to resolve border disputes.
In addition to the war in 1962, India and China also had a military confrontation in Doctram in 2017, when the Chinese People's Liberation Army attempted to open a road in a corridors near the "Chicken Cock of India" and connected to the north-eastern states of India, where Bhutan also claimed to possess the area.
Finally, the problem was solved by diplomatic means and both sides withdrawed the army.
In 1979, a major military conflict broke out between Central and Vietnam. China claimed to have the sovereignty of the entire South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan expressed opposition.
“China and 12 of the 14 neighbor countries have fully solved the problem of land border and set a sea borderline in the Northern Gulf of Central and Vietnam,” the White Paper says, noting that China has initiated reduction of military personnel by “more than 4 million” since the opening of the reform in 1978.
The Chinese army with two million officers remains the largest army in the world.
Extended seasons bring flooding and chaos to many regions of India
The seasonal wind season in India has been broken for almost a month, with an unprecedented amount of rainfall caused buildings to collapse, and many crops began to collapse.
Seasonal winds in northern India are usually weakened in early September, but the average rainfall this month is 37% higher than normal.
Many parts of India are still suffered by unprecedented flooding disasters, with a recent storm occurred in the western town of Puna, where storms on Wednesday and Thursday caused several deaths and the collapse of buildings caused serious damages.
The houses are flooded and people walk in front of the water on the streets flooded by knees, which usually only can be seen when the winds are strongest.
Other cities, such as Calcutta, Leicester and Heidelapa, have also experienced severe rainfall. Houses have been severely damaged due to continuous rainfall in northern Arkanda.
The season is too late. Many areas have lack of water, farmers are prepared to face possible drought disasters.
It is uncommon that the prolonged seasons cause farmers to hurt their heads to rain so much every year, and that caused my vegetables — bulbs, beans, beans and tomatoes I have harvest — broken out,” said Prakash Mehra, a small farmer in Northern Arkansas Birmertal.
For consumers, the late and late seasonal wind leads to an increase in the price of oatmeal, and oatmeal is an important ingredient in Indian food. In cities like Delhi and Mumbai, oatmeal prices are 80 rubles per kilogram (about £1), and usually 20 rubles per kilogram (23 pents).
The next great festival is the Ten Victory Festival, held on October 8, where the Indians raised a huge comic portrait of Robona, and Robona was a character in the Hindu poem "Romoeina", holding a thick skull, and laughing with evil mouths.
Burning Robona's portraits symbolize evil, but these portraits are made of paper, and if the season continues, Robona might laugh until the end.
Julian Assange: Private Security Companies 'monitoring the founder of Wikipedia for Central Intelligence at the Ecuador Embassy'
Julian Assange lives in London, a Spanish private security company hired to protect the Ecuador Embassy in London to monitor the founder of Wikipedia for U.S. intelligence agencies.
The Spanish National Journal reports that the Spanish private security company is suspected of providing the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency audio and video of Assange’s meetings with his lawyers.
The company is undergoing an investigation by the Supreme Court of Spain.
Assange himself personally filed a criminal proceedings accused the company of violating his privacy and the confidentiality of his contractor-lawyer's privilege.
The National Journal said the Spanish private security company failed to respond to the request to comment on the matter.
In April, Assange was later expelled from the embassy after Ecuador was transferred to British authorities.
During his release in 2012, Assange entered asylum in the Ecuador embassy in the UK, facing the risk of being extradited to Sweden due to allegations of sexual abuse; Assange said he was worried that he would be extradited to the United States if he renounced Wikipedia activities.
In June, the United States officially issued a request for extradition of Assange, which was accused of 18 charges, including computer misuse and unauthorized disclosure of defence information.
He was accused of arresting former U.S. intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.
Assange was previously imprisoned for warranty in violation of Swedish extradition requirements, and was currently imprisoned in London’s Belmasch prison, which was expected to be released last week, but was also arrested for waiting for a U.S. extradition hearing held in London in February 2020.
In May this year, Swedish prosecutors re-established an investigation on Assange's allegations of rape, and Assange has denied the allegations.

Why do we need Gandhi?
When we celebrate the 150th anniversary of a extraordinary person’s birth, the leaders of the world’s two largest democratic countries should obey the principles he practices.
Mohammad Karamshand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, dedicated his life to moral, nonviolence, tolerance and social justice, and left a precious heritage to the world. He had a profound influence on the two of the greatest national movements in the United States.
Howard Thermann and Benjamin Mas, these American activists had travelled to India in front of Gandhi, so Gandhi’s influence on civil rights movement began long before Martin Luther King accepted his ideas.
As Caesar Chávez backed his political awareness, comes from a story of his 11-year-old story about the story of “This half naked man without a gun conquested the power of the British Empire,” which later followed Gandhi when he led the Farm Workers’ Movement.
Gandhi has the same influence outside the United States, for example, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai and climate change activists both view Gandhi as a lightlight.
However, President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi appear to be uninterested in his thoughts, in addition to the oral congratulations to Gandhi in a large joint open meeting recently held in Houston. Both are activists of left-wing populism with lack of compassion or tolerance in the rule and have successfully initiated voting groups of white and Hindus in their countries, while encouraging division and social opposition.
Modi has become a member of the Nationalist Organization - National Volunteer Organization of India since the age of eight, the former member of the Organization Nathram Godson murdered Gandhi on January 30, 1948. In fact, Modi's ruling party - National Parliamentary of the Indian People's Party has been greatly appreciated for the murderer of Gandhi in recent years.
Modi’s government has demonstrated an anti-Gandy action in many ways, abolishing the autonomy and status of the state in the Muslim-majority provinces of Cheshire and Kashmir, and implementing local blocks; not welcoming mostly Rohingya refugees who flee from Myanmar’s extreme persecution.
Moreover, Moody's government has also caused social turbulence by establishing a national registration of citizens to establish a prison camp in the state of Assam in the border area, surfaced to capture non-native citizens from Bangladesh, a neighbor of a Muslim majority, but that could lead to 2 million people being prived of voting and imprisonment.
Trump’s policy is also a good idea. The travel ban imposed by the U.S. government on Muslim majority countries is just a response to Islamic terrorism, which is also the factor that Modi’s policy is often considered. His cruel compassion towards refugees is a sign of the pain of the Indian government on the Rohingya, and the U.S. detention camps established by the Modi regime. Trump’s behavior of racist hatred is in line with the painful speech of some of the members of the Modi’s Cabinet.
At the recent joint meeting of the two leaders, there was a moment worth learning.In the event, the majority leader of the House of Representatives Stanley Hoye quoted Gandhi's definition of democracy "democracy can give the weak and strong equal opportunities."
It is the 150th anniversary of Gandhi’s birth, and if Trump and Modi could remember Gandhi’s advice, they should have performed much better during his term.
White House Statement: Trump nominates Peter Gain as Head of the Federal Emergency Administration
On April 3, 2019, at Mount Washington, U.S. Congress, President of the Federal Emergency Administration, Peter Gain, gave testimony at a hearing on the agency’s budget request for the 2020 fiscal year held by the Senate Grant Committee’s National Security Group Committee.
US President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gain as the head of the Federal Emergency Administration, the White House said in a statement.
The current vice-secretary of the Federal Emergency Administration, Gain, has served as the vice-secretary of the agency, the agency responsible for supervising the government’s response to disasters such as hurricanes and wild fires.
Since Brock Lane's resignation in March, the agency has not yet been headed by Senate approved.The senior department of the agency - the Ministry of Homeland Security identified Ron's violation of the use of buses used to return to Washington and his home in North Carolina, after which Ron resigned as director.
Earlier this month, another deputy candidate Jeffrey Bayad's nomination was withdrawn because background investigations found he was suspected of participating in a bar battle attack.
Gena’s nomination was unexpected. He also needs to obtain a majority of votes in the Senate to approve the nomination, and he can be appointed as a director.
The White House said he had worked in the emergency management department at Rod Island before serving in the U.S. Navy in 2018.
A man who was attacked was burned at his house’s door.
A man was burned at his house’s door and police believed it was a targeted attack.
The 48-year-old man was burned out of his home in the western Lancashire, Skalmersdale, which was allegedly gasoline.
The man has been seriously burned and is currently in the hospital, it is critical but stable.
Around 1 a.m. on Thursday, police received a police call to the man's house to investigate the murder attempt.
Polyn Stobles, inspector responsible for the investigation, said: “The incident is bad and the man is still in hospital and it is very bad.
“We are conducting a series of investigations trying to find the responsible.
“We are trying to verify the motivation of the incident and we are convinced that the incident is targeted and I want to emphasize that I think the incident is not a threat to a larger community at the moment.
“I want to know the killers who have fallen to report to us.
“Does your relatives behave suspiciously when they’re home, smell of smoke, gasoline, or have inexplicable wounds?
“We need someone responsible for this terrible incident.
Vulnerable Democrats Cause Pelosi's Worry About the Bullet
During the meeting, several members expressed their position: Democrats should continue to focus the investigation on the Ukraine issue—accusing Trump requiring the President of Ukraine to investigate potential 2020 political opponents—instead of other possible illegal cases described in the report by Special Advisor Robert Mueller.
Pelosi said at a press conference on Thursday morning that the vast majority of Democrats agreed with the strategy that the “accusation of secrets” was “current focus”.
Leaders want to maintain unity within the party by continuing to focus on the investigation of the bullet, while focusing on mild members who have recently joined the proceedings. MEPs said the issue of Ukraine is also more clear and easy to explain to the public. They also believe that the investigation led by the intelligence committee is smaller and progress will be faster, probably within a month or two.
Parliamentary Angie Craig from Minnesota just joined the Democratic Party, said earlier this week that she supported a bulldozer investigation because Pelosi and Democratic leaders heard most of the opinion of the parliamentaries during previous meetings.
Craig said, “I have always been not willing to drive investigations from the perspective of I want to be restricted, I want to look at the correct procedure and want to make sure we have all the facts—the procedure will allow us to do that,” she added, supporting a small-scale investigation led by the House of Representatives’ Intelligence Committee.
Democratic Parliamentary Matt Cartridge from Pennsylvania told the U.S. cable TV news network that he currently won’t vote in favour of the bombardement terms.
Cartridge said, “I don’t vote now because we haven’t seen all the facts yet.”We have to assume people are innocent, right?
The Democratic Party will soon hear from voters that they’re pushing the bombing process, and they’re planning to return to their two-week elections in early October. This is a large group of members from the conservative region who heard their voters’ personal feedback for the first time since they called on the bombing process earlier this week, and sometimes negative news.
But Michigan Democratic Parliamentary, Dan Kildi, said that choosing a pause at this time would be beneficial.
He told reporters: “I don’t really think anything better than preparing the boss before pushing the bombing program,” he said, “In fact, it’s a good time we have the opportunity to go back and understand the views of the local people, explain to them what we are doing, then go back and move forward accordingly.
Although the members have returned, the process may be faster.
Judgment Commissioner Jamie Raskin, a supporter of the investigation, said: “I think everyone is intended to complete this work in 2019.
The Democratic Party of Maryland told reporters on Thursday night: “The issue of illegal behavior and corruption in the White House is always consistent within the party, and our job is to reduce such behavior and issues through a series of state-sensitive bullet terms. “We need a series of provisions to ensure legal cases are convincing and tell the public a consistent story. If we do the work correctly, then it will be a unified action of the whole country.
Anthony Brindisi from New York, a new member of the Democratic Party, who refused to call for a bombardement investigation and told the U.S. cable TV news that he suspended comments on Trump bombardement.
Brindisi said: “While I found many of the statements in the confidentiality reports are disturbing, there is more information.”We have to talk to some of these officials who have already listed the reports here, and checked the report to go to Hong Kong.
According to the U.S. cable TV news network, more than half of the U.S. House of Representatives expressed their support for the bullshit investigation. However, this includes many Democrats who, although they expressed their support for the bullshit investigation, are still waiting for the results and then decide whether they will eventually vote for Trump. Even if the House of Representatives can vote through the bullshit terms, the Republican-controlled Senate will be faced with "blowshit", which is one of the many reasons for the issue to trigger political disagreements within the Democratic Party.
Trump discussed former Vice President Joe Biden during a telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky on July 25, and approximately three days after that, the number of people supported the launch of a bombing investigation (more than 75 members of the House).
Trump officials say lawyers have transferred Ukrainian call records to security systems
A senior official of the Trump administration on Friday admitted that the lawyers of the White House ordered to transfer President Trump's telephone records in July with Ukrainian President Zelensky to a highly secure system.
Apart from the allegations in the reporting telephone, other actions taken for transfer records are not yet clear.
Trump administration’s disclosure reports complained and announced to the public by the House of Representatives’ intelligence committee on Thursday, the complaint said the White House officials said they were “instructed” by the White House lawyers to delete call records from computer systems that usually stored phones.
Reports claimed that notes are usually stored in different levels of confidentiality systems. Reports also said that, according to the White House officials, "not the first time" to put the president's notes in this system to protect political sensitive information rather than national security sensitive information. The complaint claimed that the White House attempts to "limit" people's contact with the call records.
“In a few days after receiving the call, I learned from several U.S. officials that senior officials have intervened in order to ‘lock’ all the records of the calls, especially the White House’s intelligence room’s routine calls,” he said.
The White House released a non-secret version of the call record on Wednesday. The memorandum is not “verbal records,” but “records and memories of the calls from the relevant person, showing Trump looking to help investigate the family of Biden.
"Other thing is that Biden's son has been a lot of rumors, and Biden has ended a prosecution, and many people want to find out that, if you can do something with the Justice Minister, it's best."
During his office of vice president, Joe Biden urged Ukraine to dismiss his high prosecutor Viktor Shuking, who was investigating the corruption case of the Ukrainian gas company "Brisma Holdings" and the younger son Hunt of Biden was the director of the company. Biden's allies insisted that he intervened because of corruption.
But the complaints of the reporters said Trump sought foreign aid in the 2020 election campaign. However, the reporters admitted in the complaints that these complaints were based on second-hand information.
The White House lawyers demanded that the instructions to modify the record were defined as “hidden facts” by the Democratic Higher Level.
House of Representatives, Democratic Republican Nancy Pelosi, from California, announced this week an official bombing investigation against the president on the development of Ukraine, calling the action "covering" and said it would be part of the bombing investigation.
Meanwhile, Trump’s lawyer Jay Sequel has undermined the importance of keeping record details.
“It’s a hidden thing, think about Seculo on Friday in the Fox and Friends show that Mr. Trump should not protect the conversation with the President of Ukraine? It’s a secret and should not be hidden, it’s a document.
Ukraine scandal: Pelosi says Bal is independent; former U.S. officials support investigation
House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, accused US Justice Secretary William Bal on Friday of being “indifferentially” protecting the President in a controversial call with President Trump with Ukrainian leaders, which also triggered an investigation.
Before the California Democrat issued the above statement, an intelligence officer who refused to disclose his name filed the charges to the U.S. intelligence agency inspector Michael Atkinson on Thursday.
During a call on July 25, Bar and Trump's lawyer Rudolf Julian was mentioned several times. The prosecutor said the White House officials were very concerned about it and they tried to "lock" the call records.
Pelosi told Microsoft National Broadcasting on Friday, “Ball has become very indifferent,” I think they’re going to do is to hide the truth. I think the Department of Justice is so indifferent. Well, it’s been a while. Now it’s just going to make things worse.
After Trump acknowledged the cease of providing military assistance to Ukraine, Pelosi announced a formal bullet investigation this week.The aid was finally approved, but the House of Representatives wondered whether the aid had anything to do with the case of Mr. Zelensky's investigation had been working for the Ukrainian gas company for five years.
The same Friday, almost 300 former U.S. foreign policy and domestic security officials signed a letter supporting the bombing investigation. The alliance said Trump’s actions were “serious concerns about national security.”
“We are pleased to the members of Parliament, including President Pelosi, that they guide us on this necessary path,” he said, “President Trump appears to have exploited the power and resources of the country’s highest positions to invite more foreign forces to interfere in our democratic process.
“It will also represent an effort to obey the US national interests – and the interests of our closest allies and partners – to the President’s personal political interests.
Trump denied any misconduct with the call. On Friday, he condemned the complainant and again said his conversation with Zelensky was a "perfect conversation".
He tweeted: “It sounds more and more like the so-called disclosure, in fact not a disclosure.”In addition, all the second-hand information has been proved inaccurate, maybe there is no other person, disclosure or spy to provide this information to him or her?” a party detective.
The complaints of the secretary indicated that Vice President Pence also had an interaction with the Ukrainian leader who also met Zelensky in Poland earlier this month. He said he hadn’t discussed Joe Biden or Hunt Biden.
Chinese defendants are buried in hospitals calling for a thorough investigation of the truth of torture
One Chinese human rights activist was arrested and killed after requesting Chinese leader Xi Jinping to leave office, and several human rights activists called on to investigate the real cause of his death.
In July, 38-year-old Wang Yi made a petition outside the door of the Lake-Nan State Security Hall, asking Xi Jinping and Chinese Prime Minister Li-Jong to resign and implement a popularity system in China. Police later accused him of "suspect of a bullying," which is defined as ambiguous, and many different politicians have been imprisoned as a result.
King's mother and lawyers revealed that he had died on Monday. King's wife, Qiyama, received a police call, claiming his husband died in a military hospital in Baghdad, while King's guard office was located exactly in Baghdad. Police did not explain the cause of his death in the phone.
According to the Chinese human rights organization "People's Observatory", Xiang Xiao later saw the bodies of Wang Yi, and found that his mouth and ears had blood traces, and his face was blue.
The Chinese Network of Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) issued a statement: “The Chinese government must investigate the case of human rights activists who suffered torture and death during their detention and prosecute criminal responsibility against the executors of torture and extraditional execution.
According to Free Asia Radio, Zhujiang said the police had asked her to accept her allegations of the accidental death, but she rejected it.A police officer of the Balang City Police Office said he could not comment on the case. The mother of Zhujiang told the Guardian that the authorities issued more than 2 million yuan (about $220,000) compensation to their families.
“It does not fully investigate the truth of the matter, nor pursue the criminal responsibility of the parties, but just give compensation so that the victims can not really wash the innocentness of snow and prevent torture,” said Francis Ive, Chief Research Officer of the CHRD.
Particularly the victim's families have been actually held hostages and may be forced to no longer ask for investigating the truth of the incident due to the receipt of compensation.
Other Chinese human rights activists have also suffered similar events, such as the lawyer Joshua, who died in the custody in July last year, as well as the Uighur ethnic scientist Muhammad Saleh Aghi, who died last year.In 2017, the Nobel Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who was still imprisoned (11 years in prison), died of cancer because the authorities refused to treat it; in 2014, the human rights activists tried to attend a UN meeting on the human rights situation, which was arrested and later died.
According to the CHRD, the authorities have been arrested by the family of King Mushua since the week. King Mushua left two young children. Other people involved in the case were also under pressure by the authorities. Wednesday, human rights lawyer Shenyang and activist Chen Yuan Yuan were controlled by the special police of six bombs while discussing King Mushua’s case in the hotel room. The police released the two on Thursday.
King M.M. began military operations in early years for forced demolition; he was previously arrested by the police and claimed to have been tortured.
In 2018, after he asked Xi'an to resign his office, he sent a message via the internet saying the police had infiltrated his house, ordering him to write a letter of repentance and a warranty to stop such activities.
“They didn’t think about how they tortured me in these years, even three days and three nights, they tortured me with an electric needle for two hours and hurt me with blood, and I would not surrender.
Pets without dogs will be charged with a fine of $2700
If the owner is unable to provide basic material such as housing, food and water, they will be charged with a huge amount of local fines. If the owner has banned the dog for 24 hours, the pet must be allowed to activate freely within the next two hours, otherwise they will be charged.
The region is Australia’s first jurisdiction to recognize animal perception capabilities.
“Modern animal welfare is concerned about how animals respond to the environment where they are mentally and physically,” Action Party City Service Minister Chris Steel, also advocates of the bill, said at a press conference.
Hong Kong police said the number of students arrested during protests has increased
Hong Kong police said on Friday, 1,600 people have been detained in anti-democracy protests since June, with 29% of students, on the weekend, police urged young people to take the right way when they plan to hold larger meetings.
Police Department of Public Relations said, despite returning to class after summer holidays, only 207 high school students and college students were detained this month, compared to 257 people detained between 6 and August.
Shevchenko said the number of teenagers involved in violent crimes has increased, and some have already been accused in court, including a 16-year-old who recently was accused of firefighters, who could be sentenced to lifetime imprisonment once convicted; a 13-year-old girl who was accused of using the Chinese flag, and some other who attacked the police and carrying dangerous weapons.
“The form is alarming,” she said at a press conference, “it is alarmante to see these young people violate the law at such a young age and there may be criminal records. We urge all young people to reflect on their behavior and hope that education departments and parents can help our young people regulate their behavior.
Since June, young people mainly protested against the extradition law, and the government has now agreed to withdraw the bill. But since then, the protest has attracted more participants, snowball-like evolved into a larger movement against the Chinese government, opposing the protesters said Beijing side is silently violating Hong Kong’s autonomy; Hong Kong was a British colony, whose sovereignty returned to China in 1997, when the Chinese government promised to implement Hong Kong’s autonomy.
The protesters expanded their demands, including directly elected Hong Kong leaders and independently investigating police violence against protesters.
Thousands of people held peaceful protests on the city centre square on Friday night, alleging the police abuse of power, sparking anti-police marks and screaming democratic slogans. The Hong Kong government said that a police supervision agency will investigate the police complaints, criticizing the supervision agency has no authority and no real investigation rights.
Police approved a large assembly of the Civil Rights Front on Saturday in the city center of Hong Kong to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the umbrella movement, which during the umbrella campaign in 2014, demonstrators occupied Hong Kong’s main streets for 79 days, demanding universal vote.
On Sunday, the protesters will also gather “anti-totalitarian” gatherings in Hong Kong and many city organizations around the world against Chinese tyranny they condemned.
Shevchenko urged protesters to stop manipulating peaceful protests, as they had previously gathered their practices, such as casting gas bombs, triggering streets fire and destroying public facilities. The police used tear gases, high-pressure water guns and other measures that led protesters to complain about their excessive use of force.
The Civil Human Rights Front also planned to hold another large demonstration on October 1 where people are concerned that this bloody end-of-the-counter conflict may cause the ruling Chinese Communist Party to be embarrassed as the Chinese Communist Party is leading Beijing to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic.
After removal panic, the nests strengthen the control of coffee beans
The world’s largest coffee company said in a statement on Friday that the company found grass glutamine residues close to the maximum limits of grass glutamine residues in some green coffee beans products.
The wheat is a key component of Monsanto’s herbal removal plant. In the United States, the jury has determined that those who claim their cancer is caused by exposure to the wheat glucose can receive huge compensation. The owner of Monsanto’s company Bayer said that this wheat removal is safe if it is used properly, as the US Environmental Protection Agency also believes.
One of the world’s largest merchants, Newman Coffee Group, said the ginger is one of the few substances that are monitored in the coffee they bought. Nestlé purchased some coffee beans from the Newman Coffee Group. Now it’s too early to predict the impact of Nestlé’s strict control policy on the Newman Coffee Group, a spokesman said.
Nestlé’s decision to increase the frequency of checking has little impact on the global coffee supply chain, and the spokeswoman said it is not a new process, we just strengthen control,” the spokeswoman told cable TV news network commercial channel.
Nestlé will start implementation from suppliers from the world’s largest coffee producers such as Indonesia and Brazil.
“Our farmers will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve herb management practices, including the proper use of herb remedies and other herb remedies,” the Swiss company said.
In Nestlé’s powder and liquid beverages business, brands like Nestlé Coffee and Nestlé’s Nestlé’s sales reached 216 billion Swiss francs in 2018. Nestlé reached an agreement last year to sell Starbucks-packed coffee and tea beverages worldwide.
Can Garlic Cause Cancer?
According to the Environment Agency, weapons are used in more than 100 species of food crops. Scientists from the Organic Food Industry Environmental Organization say some of the popular breakfast cereals have a dose of chemicals that exceeds their prescribed child safety doses.
Nevertheless, the Environmental Agency said herbs are not carcinogens and are not harmful to public health.The Environmental Agency said in a statement in April that ecological risks include the harm caused by transplanting insects and problems with herbs resistance.
But this did not prevent thousands of people from filing lawsuits against Monsanto Company, who claimed that they or their relatives have had cancer because they were in contact with Monsanto.
Earlier this year, a jury ruled Bayer paying a couple of California’s $2 billion in damages due to claiming that they have been using landda for more than 30 years in their properties and their couple have been diagnosed with non-Hochkin lymphoma over four years consecutive.
A 2015 study by the World Health Organization of International Cancer Research found that, based on “limited” human cancer proof and “full” animal cancer proofs, grain glucose could be “cancered in humans”. However, a joint group composed of the World Health Organization and the United Nations FAO later found that grain glucose is less risk of cancering through diet.
A man killed his ex wife and six family members arrested in Texas
A Utah man was sentenced on Thursday in Texas for the murder of his ex-wife six members of his family, likely to be sentenced to be sentenced to death.
The Harris County Jury ruled that the 39-year-old Ronald Haskel was charged with the murder of six members of the Star family in July 2014, including his parents Stephen Sta and Katie Sta, his 13-year-old Brian, 9-year-old Emily, 7-year-old Rebecca and 4-year-old Zack.
Harris County Prosecutor Kim Oog said in a statement: “We thank the jury for the attention of every evidence in the case over the past few weeks.”
Police said Haskel went from California to Spring in Houston suburbs to attack his ex-wife's sisters, sisters and five children in the house.
The couple and their four children were shot in the head, and the fifth child was 15 years old and survived the difficulties.
Prosecutors demanded a death sentence for his murder, but the jury will decide whether Haskel should be sentenced to death or lifetime imprisonment.
According to the U.S. National Broadcasting Corporation in Houston, KPRC, in the hearing, the defendants argued Haskel’s mental disturbance and heard a voice that kills the six people. After reading the sentence on Thursday, he lifted his head down.
Doug Darlem, a defence lawyer of Haskel, said: “I think he might be punished as everyone expected.”
The trial process starts on Monday.Hasker’s defensive lawyer Neil Davis III said his team will work “off him from death. This is our job,” according to KPRC reports.
Television reports that the trial is expected to last about two and a half weeks.
Cassidy testified during the trial that his family was sitting. According to KPRC, she seemed to pray before reading the judgment on Thursday.
At the 2014 family commemorative ceremony, Cassidy thanked for the support of the community and said his parents, two brothers and two sisters “will see them again one day in heaven.”
Haskel was figured as a Federal Express driver when he went home to Sta, and obviously went to find his ex-wife, Katie Sta's sister.
Police said he was forced to enter and capture Cassidy.A few minutes later, when her family returned, Haskel banded them and asked to tell the ex-wife's fall. They said they didn't know they were all shot in the back head.
Cassidy was injured until Haskel left and was able to accuse him to the police. She told the police that he was planning to drive to her grandparents' house to kill them. But the police tracked his tracking, after 20 minutes of police tracking and 3 hours of confrontation, he was arrested.
Scotland banned smoke products and e-cigarette advertising because of the US mortality.
Ministers are considering the prohibition of the advertising of electronic cigarettes and smoke products.
The Prime Minister has confirmed that he will consult the initiative “in the next few months”.
Nicola Starking said that if there is evidence to support action on further sales of such products, her government would take action "no hesitation".
Meanwhile, there are reports that diseases associated with nebulating products have taken two deaths, with 11 deaths.
Dusting products (a mixture of nicotine, water, solvent and fragrance for absorption) are considered to be an alternative to smoking and can help stop smoking, but their safety is not fully determined.
But in the United States, more than 500 people have suffered from a mysterious lung disease due to smoking e-cigarettes. officials say hundreds of new cases have been in the last week.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, Florida and Georgia announced the first deaths. At present, 38 states have records of this disease, eight of which have deaths.
While most patients have use of products containing hydrogen cannabis (a psychoactive compound in cannabis), patients who died on Wednesday in Georgia were to only “absorb a large amount of overdusting products.”
More than 100 officials in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating the cause of this mysterious disease and warning citizens not to smoke e-cigarette products, especially refined or purchased by “street” before they take advantage of more situations.
After the emergence of smelled products leading to deaths, the Chief Minister confirmed that the Scottish government is “throatly” monitoring the developments in the United States and elsewhere.
She noted that, so far, they have not seen any reports of deaths in Europe caused by bullying products.
"We have been cautious, so in Scotland we have adopted the most strict regulatory approach in Europe.
The European Tobacco Products Directive restricts the advertising of electronic cigarettes and ensures that electronic liquids do not contain known harmful ingredients.
The directive also restricted the concentration of nicotine in e-cigarettes.
“In Scotland, we also launched a retail registration and mandatory age verification program and funded the trade standards department in all parliamentary regions to ensure retailers comply with regulations.
“In the next few months, we will have a full prohibition of advertising and promotion of smoke products.
She added: “It is important to emphasize that we all need to remember that these devices are relatively new products, so we need to continue to study their impact.
This is probably one of the reasons why e-cigarettes are not yet popular in Scotland.
“We continue to take all necessary steps, based on the best evidence, to ensure that there is no potential harm to people.
“While we have implemented the most strict management system on these products, if there is evidence that further action is needed ... we will act without hesitation.
Cambodian court accuses exile politicians of rebellion
A Cambodian court accused seven senior opposition leaders of planning a armed rebellion that plans to end self-deporting and seek a regime change through massive peaceful protests.
The Qingdao City Court also warned that anyone who support Cambodia’s opposition to shut down the government plan would be at risk of long-term imprisonment.
If the conviction is established, the opposition leaders who end the exile return may be sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison, and their supporters may be sentenced to 5 to 10 years in prison. Citing the spokesman of the Department of Justice, Xi Marlin, that even participating in meetings or expressing support online could be seen as a conspiracy to overthrow the government.
The political struggle has been increasing since opposition leader Sansy announced plans to end more than three years of exile life back to their homeland on November 9, seeking "reestablish democracy", and the court alleged Thursday will continue the latest round of the political struggle.
November 9 is the Independence Day of Cambodia, where Cambodia disappeared from the French colonial rule in 1953.
Earlier this week, Sanshi tweeted: “I will continue to call on the Cambodian people and the armed forces against the Hunson regime until the Hunson regime will restore the right of opposition to participate in national political life, including real elections.
Last year, the court dissolved the Sunshine opposition party in order to ensure Hunson continues to rule with more dictatorship for 40 years.
The opposition wanted to initiate a powerful election challenge in July 2018, which was widely viewed as a political motivation, and Hunson-led Cambodian People's Party fears it's missing in the election.
The Hunson government seems to be worried about the opposition leader’s planed return to home, although the practice seems unrealistic, Sanchez called on a large number of Cambodian workers in Thailand to return home with him.
Officials have sworn to arrest him once San Francisco arrived in Cambodia, but there are speculations that Cambodia might just prevent San Francisco from entering, and if the airline is officially informed of the ban, San Francisco could be banned from boarding a plane flying to Cambodia. Neighbors are not likely to allow San Francisco to enter Cambodia from their territory.
However, the government has strengthened the arrest of San Francis’s supporters, with reports that opposition organizers have recently been attacked.
At the end of 2015, San Francisco was sentenced to two years in prison for criminal conviction, and he emigrated abroad in order to escape from imprisonment.
During the repression of all against the Hunson regime, the co-founder of the opposition Gansoka was arrested at the end of 2017, and other senior members of the party were expatriated abroad. Gansokain was accused of betrayal for establishing links with a United States democratic organization and is currently in severe imprisonment.
This year’s Turner Prize Awards will be exhibited in Maghite from tomorrow, and the UK’s Brexit will also set up the agenda.
Colombian artist Oscar Murillo’s work “Extreme” depicted the scenery of people looking at the North Sea, but they look at the North Sea and the opposite European continent was covered by a black shell, which revealed only a small part of the distance through a curved line on the tape.
This work is one of the four surroundings, an annual art prize established in 1984 to artists born in the UK or UK but living elsewhere.
The designer Fio Napari explains that Murillo’s work focuses mainly on the current political and socio-economic situation in Britain. The group of paper wallpapers represents the workforce of globalization, while the black wallpapers represents “the dark moments of British and global contemporary”.
She added: “I think it’s a wider meaning to block the sight, in fact to block the sight of any distant sight. There’s also a position to block the light. But I think there’s still a line of hope, there’s a curved line on the tape, and you can see the ocean on the horizon.
At the same time, Helen Kammak’s video work, A Long Voice, explores the roles of women who were neglected in the Northern Ireland/London Delhi civil rights movement in 1968, which also involves a wider global class, ethnic and gender struggle in the late 1960s.
All the works will be exhibited in the Turner Contemporary Gallery in Maghite from September 28th to January 12, 2020 and the 2019 Turner Prize winners will be announced at the award ceremony on December 3.
The prize was named after the 19th-century British landscape artist Joseph Malod William Turner, who had been awarded to Grace Perry, Damien Hester and Director Steve McQueen, “The Twelve Years of God”.

U.S. sends forces to Saudi Arabia and deploys air defense systems to stop Iran's attacks
U.S. officials said on Thursday that the United States was sending a patriot missile force, four ground radar systems and 200 support forces to Saudi Arabia to stop Iran’s increasingly violent actions.
The Pentagon said a Saudi missile defense system and two other patriot missile forces were ready if needed.
Pentagon spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said: “Other countries in the region have called for attention to the situation in Iran and we hope they contribute to international cooperation and enhance Saudi defense forces.
Last week, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he would deploy more troops to the Middle East as a "defense" measure to help protect Iran's attacks.
Asper said the deployment was the first step towards addressing Iranian increasingly violent actions in the region, including drone attacks on Saudi oil facilities this month, and he called on other countries to strengthen action to condemn the attacks.
Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed responsible for the attacks on September 14, the world’s largest oil processing plant and an important oil field, but the United States and Saudi Arabia directly condemned Iran.
“It is clear that the weapons used were produced by Iran, not launched from Yemen,” Esper said on Friday, noting all signs that “Iran is responsible for the attack.”
The aim of deploying armies and resources is to “send clear information to the US supporting our partners” and to provide “free flow of resources,” Esper said.
The Secretary of State said the U.S. calls on other countries as well as "stand up to condemn the attack" and contribute to strength.
Meghan Markle is “Never invited” to return to “Metal Dress Lawyer”
Allan Coleman said he had "never invited" the British Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle to return to the show, eventually playing Rachel Chan.
After the Great End of Metal Dress Lawyers' broadcast in the United States, Corling was asked in an interview with the U.S. Hollywood News Front whether it was initially “what” to invite the former permanent actor to “take up” in the big end.
“Now we have finished the big end, I can tell you,” Coleman replied.
“I thought to invite her, and I thought to use audio materials (we have to think of a way in this regard), but at the end I didn’t start talking because I felt “I want to respect her new life, I can’t put her in a position that must be invited.”
“We decided not to let her fall in such a situation, so I never opened my mouth.
At the great end of the Golden Dress Lawyers, Duchess of Sussex appeared in the picture of Montichi.
Since 2011, Meghan has played Rachel Chan in this New York-based law drama, until the last episode she performed last year.
In the last season of her performance, Rachel's screen husband Mike Ross (Patrick Jones Adams) came to visit her from Seattle and was asked how she was near.
“If I tell you how good she has been, you probably won’t believe me,” he replied.

Germany reports symptomatic cases of the Nile virus
Authorities that the first case of human cases of the Sinir River virus spread through mosquitoes occurred in Germany, and climate change clearly accelerated the spread of the virus.
The National Centers for Disease Control and Tropical Medicine in Germany said on Friday the patient had a concomitant cerebral infection but had recovered after hospital treatment.
The Nile virus originates from Africa, but has been spread to the north through the birds and mosquits. In recent years, the South and Central Europe have been broken several times.
Jonathan Schmidt Channassit, from the German Institute of Tropical Medicine in Bernhard Nottes, said: “With climate change, the summer has been extremely hot over the past two years, it has obviously accelerated the spread of the Syneus virus in the north of the Alps because of the climate change.
Less than 1% of patients infected with the virus have a risk of cerebrospinalitis or cerebrospinalitis.
After prostate cancer surgery, it is good.
One major study found that men undergone prostate cancer surgery are in good condition without radiation therapy.
The examination of patients receiving surgical treatment is the largest experiment so far, with the results of the experiment that could relieve thousands of patients from suffering treatment, which could also produce painful side effects.
The Royal Mastern Hospital conducted a study of 1,400 men receiving prostate cancer treatment.
Half of the patients received immediate radiation therapy, a standard therapy so far to prevent the recurrence of the disease. The rest of patients were monitored and radiation therapy was given only when there are signs of recurrence of the disease.
Five years later, scientists found that the incidence of the disease was almost no difference in the two groups of patients, and those who did not receive radiation treatment were a little better.
The non-progressive survival rate was 85% and the standard care group was 88%.
Considering other factors, the data was adjusted, the difference between the two groups was approximately 1%.
This study, funded by the UK Cancer Research Center, found that patients receiving radiation therapy are twice more likely to have worsened urinary impotence than patients who were not receiving radiation therapy, and urinary impotence is one of the main side effects of prostate cancer treatment.
A year after surgery, 5.3% of patients receiving radiation treatment had worsened the condition, while only 2.7% of patients receiving standard care had worsened the condition.
The radio claims that the host of the WWL radio show, Louisiana, Seas Dunap threatened to prosecute anti-gay tweets, but the tweet was sent by himself, in a similar way with the case of Julie Smolitt.
A radio host in New Orleans said he received an anti-gay tweets sent to him on the radio's Twitter account.WWL host Seas Dunap was an open gay who said on Wednesday he intended to accuse the radio mother company because he has been working in a hated gay and hostile environment for many years. On Thursday, things have occurred a strange turn, and New Orleans police officer said that the threatened tweets received were not from anywhere else, but sent by Dunap's phone.
The controversial tweet was released earlier this month, and Drap also hosted his show as usual. According to the Columbia Broadcasting Company WWL-TV, the tweet released the next day, he announced a vacation.
Durap said in a statement that 14 people have access to WWL Twitter accounts, claiming he was not the only one who used the account.
And his lawyer Megan Keiver said he decided to participate in the lie tests and thus eliminate the hypothesis of himself being the initiator. According to WWL-TV reports, Drap has not yet presented the proceedings, but he said it would soon start in a statement.
WWL Radio is a branch of Columbia Broadcasting News Agency, but intended to spread its own, WWL Radio said in a statement it had investigated the tweet and decided to handle the matter to law enforcement personnel.WL Radio said in a statement: “WL has completed an investigation on this extremely disrespectful, unauthorized tweets sent by its Twitter account on September 10, which was directed to Sice Drap.
“We think the next most appropriate step is to be handled by law enforcement agencies.The investigation is currently being carried out by law enforcement agencies and we are uncomfortable to comment on the specific circumstances of the investigation,” WWL said in a statement.
The New Orleans Police Office revealed their investigation on the tweet, and in Thursday’s police report, the story turned back: the terrible tweets allegedly were sent from Drap’s private phone.
The chairman of the radio, Seas Dunap, once said he was working for years in a frightened and hostile environment. He threatened to be prosecuted after he claimed to receive an opponent tweets sent by a radio Twitter account.
According to NOLA.com, WWL accused Drap of threatening the radio for purely money.WWL claims that the 35-year-old radio owner said he was going to follow a tweet and then ask for more than $1.8 million in compensation. According to the police report received from NOLA.com, WWL notes that Drap was facing personal financial problems when he threatened to be prosecuted.
These accusations were submitted by WWL’s senior vice president Kevin Cassidy and his mother’s lawyers who attempted to spread. The police offices are still trying to confirm these accusations, but have listed the case as a possible chantage nature. Louisiana’s definition of chantage is “sending threatening information to others in order to obtain anything valuable.

This 54-year-old actress talked about Michelle Obama in the American TV series "First Lady" at the Jimmy Cocktail Show on Thursday!
Davis said she had ever met Michelle Obama but didn’t know if the former First Lady knew she played the role.
“I’m very nervous,” said Davis, “I don’t care what I’ve done in my life—I’ve got an Emmy, an Oscar, and two Tony Prize—but if I get bad this time, the impact on my life would be huge.”
She said in a joke: “It’s like ‘You raised a great child, but you’ve broken Michelle Obama.”

Jack Miller's death: Third man accused of drug trafficking
The third man has been arrested and accused of drug trafficking, linked to the death of singer Mike Miller.
Steven Walt was suspicious of selling fake testosterone pills that contained phentermine, which last year Miller led to accidental death due to overdose of cocaine, alcohol and potent opioid drugs, and he held phentermine before his death.
Walt was accused of being a drug source by another man, Cameron Petite, who had sold the drug to Miller.
The 36-year-old Ryan Reeves, who was arrested this week in Havasou Lake City, Arizona, is accused of being Walt’s “runners” for giving the drug to Petite.
Walter was released for a drug case in 2005 and is currently detained.
Miller was a Pittsburgh man, his real name was Malcolm James Miles McKomick, and Miller honestly discussed his depression and drug addiction in the song, which won him some of the big cards fans at the Hip Hop.
After Miller’s death, she posted a video full of love about him on her photo wall page and launched a song “Thanks you, the next”, which was deeply committed to Miller.
In recent years, some musicians have died from opioid abuse and overdosis across the country, and Miller is one of them.
Prince died in 2016, when he took a false medication containing phentermine, which looked like a replica of a pain-free drug Vicotine.
In 2016, guitarist Matthew Roberts also died of drug overdose, containing phentermine and hydrocarbon in his body.
Women in Walmart have no evidence of innocentness.
In a supermarket in Walmart, Mexico City, a woman accused of stealing into a shop took extreme means of self-sufficiency, standing out in a supermarket without hanging, keeping the supermarket security watched.
Earlier this week, a Mexican city’s Tea-Aquarium store shot the picture of a supermarket security guard was going toward the suspected steal woman, which was at the time near the supermarket exit. However, when she was arrested, her reaction left the security outlawless.

According to a report published by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 26th, Iran has begun using advanced decoctions to accelerate the production of concentration of uranium, further violating the 2015 nuclear agreement with the world powers.
According to a comprehensive foreign media report, the IAEA report notes that advanced aerospace machines of Iran’s Natanz Nuclear Facility are “accumulating or ready to accumulate concentration of uranium.”
Since US President Trump withdrawal from the nuclear deal last May and imposed sanctions against Iran, Iran has progressively violated the restrictions of the 2015 nuclear deal with the major powers.
According to the agreement, Iran can only extracte nitrogen with the first generation IR-1 discharge.
Other subscribers to the agreement, the UK, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to rescue the agreement, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.

Women hopes to win the World Cup in advance!
On the 27th day, in a match against the Dutch female, the Chinese team was pulled back to a city in the case of winning the two positions, eventually won nine victories in the 3:1 rally of the Netherlands.
The World Cup’s race is close to the end, and although the crown is looking forward to, the Chinese women’s team is still uncomfortable against Serbia.
With the first two stages of the Dutch competition, the Chinese female team performed strongly as usual, respectively, at 25:19, 25:16 in the first two cities, until the third stages, the team encountered failure.
The Dutch female team increased the aggressivity of the ball in the backward situation, the Chinese team first was shocked, and the girls attacked hardly, and the mistakes began to increase, eventually pulled the opponent back to the city at 21:25.
In an interview, Syeong Pong also stated: “Third place, because we were wrongly sent about eight points.”
Of course, the Dutch women's strength was not allowed to be low, and the Chinese women's team was prepared hard before the race, although losing a position, but everything is still in the control of Franco, "With the team to win a match is normal, playing five positions is also normal, so we told the team to focus," Franco said.
The fourth stage, the teams have actively adjusted the state, Zhang Jin opened the fire force at the attack end, the single team got eight points, and the team won a great deal.
To date, the competition of 11 rounds remains only two rounds, and although one hand has touched the championship Cup, the warning alarms of the Chinese female in the competition against the Dutch team: the more crucial moments, the more you can go.
In another match on the 27th day, Russian and American ladies filled with five positions, the American ladies failed to get all three points from the opponents, so that Chinese ladies can get a crown in advance if they have all three points in the match against Serbia.
A variety of situations are developing towards the favorable situation for Chinese women.
However, although the Serbian team has a short number of six main forces, this does not mean they will easily give three points to the Chinese team.
From the form of the current score list, the Serbian team has been basically without medals, which means that they can "most up" in the competition against the Chinese women's class, lay down the boxes to shock the opponents whilst the Chinese team is under pressure to win the crown, and the situation may be reversed.
Furthermore, the replaced Serbian team is also not a “personally cut off” sheep, previously with the Dutch team, both sides of the 5th World War, and the Serbian second team eventually 3:2 reversed the Dutch dominant front, thus the depth of its front was seen.
Before the start of the third phase, Mr. Wang also said the two teams are not good to face: “The game in Osaka will be very difficult and we still need to be seriously prepared as usual.”
Today, the corner of the crown has swallowed, and the competition has actually entered the "white-heating phase".
In terms of strength, Chinese women are above the opponents, only the final need to stop, and also see if women are able to play normal levels and free themselves in the competition field.

However, if the hero is walking around, it looks as ordinary as you are like me.
Yu-Jongping, divided into research of rice, cultivated good varieties throughout the heavens, allowing billions of nations to have no more hunger, and great, this Yong is usually like an old farmer who loves to go on the fields; Yu-Jongdong, Yong is a chief scientist who has made China's "heaven's eyes" angry, a man, a lifetime, a pot, doing only one thing in his lifetime, wraping a cold head in the deep mountains of Guangzhou, and the old man in his residence; Yu-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong-Jong
They, praying goodness, live simple, simple and obsessive, just as they are immersed in the strangers unthinking and their self-sufficiency profession, they will easily survive, without the name of Liso, the rich glory.
Like the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an is the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, and the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, and the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, and the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, and the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an, the Holy Qur’an.
Behind every “Sunetian monk”, every baby’s heart, there is a home to whom I do.
The home is responsible not only on the shoulder of the hero, but also on the hand of millions of people.
One time, a high school student was crazy by the internet, “When a hero passes, there is always someone who is sitting on the streets ... I don’t want to be a hero, I want to be a person who is sitting on the streets.”
In fact, when the hero and the hero are praised, there is no contradiction.
Those who praise on the road also transmit heat and light, and themselves are also a lighting agent.
Ordinary like you like me, there are always mystery throughout your life, some moments, a day of moon, and also shaping the appearance of a hero.
Shanghai’s Higher Judge Zhu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu Phu
It’s a mistake between the heroes, a hero is to give another hero.
Swedi monkeys have a small temple cabinet, Yu-Longping has a wide water rice experimental field, South Yin East has “Heaven Eye”, Chen Yong has a stage, Chen Yong has a speech ... ... Can you become a hero, not only based on your own efforts, you need a better environment and positive motivation mechanism.
For example, “Chinese eye” seems to be a myth.
In the 1990s, China’s technology industry was still hard to climb, and novelist Liu Yohyun has not yet started writing “The Three Body”.
The most coveted “eye” at the time, was the one-way radiotelescope in the valley of Puerto Rico in the U.S. Puerto Rico—Aresibo, a diameter of 350 meters, was considered to be the world’s most “uncompassable”.
The Chinese radio telescope at the time was less than one ten in diameter.
And South Yin Dong, enjoying world-class research conditions and wages in Japan, insisted on returning home, bringing back a almost crazy idea: to build a new generation of radioelectric “Big Telescope” in China, to receive more messages from outside space!
China's big money is playing stars?
The homeland trusts South Yongdong, the “Heaven Eye” project is opened.
The election took 12 years and it took 9 years to end up.
The 500m diameter of “Eyes of the Sky” was opened, and China became an unprecedented, “the world’s unique great science engineering.”
Therefore, the “Eye of Heaven” is great, the South-Yin-East is great, with a large, standing high-looking republic is great.
With the confidence of the country, the good will of the people, the South Yin East has a mission to become the spirit of the country’s people.
There were young genius and white-haired heroes, and there were people on the streets lightly praised, such a country was beautiful and harmonious.
Garbage Classification Education First Gillin Kindergarten Environmental Philosophy Catching From Dolls
On the 27th day, a kindergarten in Gilin, in Gilin, held a waste classification education, teaching children how to distinguish recyclable waste and other categories of waste.
This is the first time that waste classification comes into local children’s education classes.
Earlier, the nine departments of the province of Gilin jointly launched the Gilin province’s Programme for the classification of waste management of land-based urban life.
Based on the compulsory classification trial of life waste in 2019 in Long-Jung City, the province decided to conduct life waste classification work in ground cities.
The city of Gillin is one of them.
We wish to realize the effects of the family-driven by children, childcare-driven society and advocate the environmental philosophy through this event.
Hello Fanchi International Children's Garden Executive Director of the event said.
The same day, the gardener read the environmental initiative hoping that the classification of waste should start with children.
After performing the low-carbon baby dance, the group played a small game of waste classification.
Instructional teachers also issued the “Recyclable” label “Other waste” that suggests children stick the label to the trash pot and record small videos after home.
Li Li Liang said the kindergarten has always advocated low-carbon, green environmental concept and regularly opened environmental lectures.
The garbage storage offices in the park also set classificable garbage boxes, which marked the garbage categories above.
Teacher teaches children what can be recycled.
According to preliminary statistics, in 2018 the city of Gilin province produced about 546,52 million tons of residential waste, all of which entered the residential waste processing facilities.
Of these, the sanitary filled 329,29,000 tons, burned 209,23,000 tons, taking a comprehensive use process processing of 8,01 million tons.
After years of effort, all municipal counties of the province have the ability to handle life waste without harm.
In the previously launched “Progressing urban life waste classification work programme” in the province of Gilin, it expressly requires a deep implementation of activities such as waste classification into campus, teaching materials, classrooms, and other activities, to enhance the interaction between students and parents, to the effect of “educating a child, affecting a family, leading a community, educating a new generation.”

Hirac died Political Heritage
On the 26th day, the former president of France, Jacques Chirac, died at the age of 86 years old.
In the moment of a big change in the world for a hundred years, the many political heritage that this French politician left during his rule is still worth our praise.
Hillary has served as president of France for 12 years in a very personal appearance.
He both inherited the desholistic independence and independent diplomatic spirit and firmly supported European integration, as a representative of the pursuit of the "European Dream".
He also strongly advocates multilateralism and multilateralism in the world, as a politician with a strategic perspective.
This is why French media classified him as “the outstanding representative of France on the world stage”.
One of the political decisions of Hillary Clinton was against the U.S. ruled Iraq war.
Under his leadership, France joined Germany to overcome U.S. pressure and went on the front of the war.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to increasing terrorism activities, making the world even more dangerous.
The later revealed that Hillary’s warning was very correct.
In the moment of Europe’s integration, the unilaterality of the United States is increasing, followed by the past, Hillary Clinton has no doubt a strong revelation of strategic thinking and decisions on international politics and global affairs.
Hillary is also a French politician who makes the Chinese feel familiar and friendly.
He is one of the supporters and creators of the "Golden Decade" of China relations with China, and since he was elected President of France in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of China relations with the strategic perspective of politicians.
In 2004, China established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and China's bilateral dialogue entered a new phase.
During Herak's reign, the bilateral trade between China and France has grown rapidly, and the cooperation of the two countries has made breakthrough progress in various fields of aviation, nuclear energy, and rail transport.
The Chinese Year of Culture initiated by Hirac has created a new model of cultural exchange in the history of China.
Herak’s love for Chinese culture was especially impressive throughout his life.
According to his Chinese diplomat, Hillary could back some of the poems of White and Duo, and even accurately judge the history of Chinese copper equipment.
“Do not see the pyramids really have come to Egypt, do not see the Chen’s really have come to China” — the golden phrase comes from Hirac.
Hillary Clinton said in an interview with New York Times: “The West is concerned about the political and social development of China, the ecological issues arising from China’s economic growth, and the political position of China at the international level.

Hong Kong Special District Legislative Assembly Opposed U.S. Harbor Law
Hong Kong Special District Legislative Assembly issued a joint statement on 27 that expressed strong opposition to the Foreign Committee of the House of Representatives of the U.S. Congress on the adoption of the 2019 Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.
This statement by the Association of 40 delegates stated that the right to Hong Kong currently enjoy is granted by the basic law of the Hong Kong Special District, includingining the status of free trade ports and separate customs zones, in various fields of economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, sport, and trade, and implement bilateral and multilateral agreements with different countries and regions in the name of China Hong Kong, trade, cooperation and development relations with different countries and regions around the world.
These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislative body.
Hong Kong has since been strictly adhering to international agreements, international rules, law and business ethics, in cooperation with different countries and regions, participating in many related fields and successfully and witnessed.
The statement stated that the U.S. Senate's Foreign Committee's two Chambers' Act's action was not necessary, just to respond to the calls of its port agents, as a means of brutal intervention in Hong Kong's internal affairs and to fight political funding for its agents in Hong Kong.
Parliamentary committee expressed profound regret and strongly opposed the action of the U.S. House.
The statement pointed out that Hong Kong is an important trade partner of the United States and the largest source of trade passage.
Hong Kong’s excellent rule of law, fair and free business environment, and clean society make it a good choice for American businessmen.
As the United States passed this bill, in addition to fighting the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself, it will also frozen China-American relations, without any benefit and harm to themselves.
The statement stated that Hong Kong will, as always, implement the “One Country and Two Systems” policy without hesitation, continue to enjoy the rights granted by fundamental law and effectively fulfill its obligations.
Whether in the past, present or future, Hong Kong will continue to contribute to the international community and international trade.
According to the European Times, France’s two houses will discuss migration policy reform next week.
France’s President Macron recently stated that France cannot “accept everyone” but at the same time will try to “accept it properly”.
Macron is trying to find a cross-way in immigration matters, slowing down the upcoming debate shock.
In a recent interview during the United Nations General Debate in New York, Macron said he hoped to have a real "double-double" program on immigration policy, seeking a balance between humanitarian and efficiency.
Macron said: “If France wants to be able to accept (immigrants) properly, it will not be able to accept everyone.”
Macron listed the four focus of the immigration policy: granting asylum as soon as possible to refugees in need of protection; more effectively promote immigration integration; accepting and protecting all immigrants entering French territory; more effectively reinstaller those who are not eligible to stay illegally in France.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the “National Health Assistance” (AME) system has been the most discussed issue in the past.
Macron said he hopes to be able to "evaluate" the system, but not to cancel it, but to impose certain restrictions on it.
After Macron’s speech, the leader of the “National Alliance” of extreme right, Le Pen wrote on Twitter that Macron’s expression was “free talk”.
Right-right Republican member and Senate President Rachel also said they should discuss immigration policy in a “softening” but “facing reality” way and indirectly criticize Macron.
Left Socialist Parliamentary Walau said France should “accept more and better” on migration issues, and criticized Macron’s “manipulation” on the issue.
The new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act has been issued for a year, which has caused conflicts within the ruling party, but has not yet been able to calm the right-wing opposition party.
In the next 2022 elections, the issue of immigration policy will again be the focus of the extreme right attack, and Macron needs to take action on this issue, but at the same time puts the risk of angry leftists within the ruling party.
The French National Parliament’s lower House will discuss immigration policy as of September 30, and the Senate will be discussed as of October 2.
There are signs that China’s A shares are welcoming “re-buy” and many listed companies have taken out “real gold and silver” back-buy shares.
According to the statistics of Eastern Wealth of the financial data service provider, as of the 27th of 2019, the total amount of re-acquisition of A-shares listed companies has exceeded $10 billion (Yuan, below), much higher than the same year's data, creating a historical high in the amount of re-acquisition of A-shares.
In this regard, Shanghai Mikoun Information Consulting Limited Liability Company CEO Xi Jinping said that the overall estimate of the A stock market this year was lower, re-buy shares at a relatively low price, favored the listed companies to improve the efficiency of the use of funds, and also reflected the willingness of the listed companies to initially manage market value and full cash flow status, favored to boost investors' trust.
Furthermore, the continuously improved shares recovery system also encouraged the listed companies to actively take shares recovery.
For example, early this year, the Shanghai Securities Exchange and the Shanghai Securities Exchange released the implementation rules for re-buying shares of listed companies, providing detailed rules and guidelines for re-buy shares of listed companies.
According to media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented the re-buy plans, mainly focus on the construction industry, real estate industry, information technology and electronic equipment manufacturing.
In addition, with regard to the amount of rebuild payments, six listed companies have rebuild more than $1 billion this year.
Among them, the first is the Ely shares, which rebuilds more than $50 billion.
What impact will the company’s rebuy of shares have on the market?
Zhejiang, Vice President of the Chinese People's University of Finance and Finance Academy, said in an interview with the Chinese New Company Reporter that the re-achievement, on the one hand, indicates that the listed companies have stronger economic strength and better financial situation, have the ability to maintain stock price stability, trust to investors; on the other hand, that the listed companies and its holding shareholders are responsible for the company, market and investors.
The first is based on good operating performance of the company, and the latter requires the listed company and its own shareholders to have higher qualifications.
These are the most basic elements for the capital market.
The re-buy of the company’s shares contributes to boost investors’ trust and supporting the stock prices of the listed company.
According to the estimates of the Eastern Securities Survey, according to the total estimated number of shares re-buyed by A-shares listed company since the beginning of this year, as well as the calculation of the comparative price of the re-buyed shares, this year the increase of funding brought to the A-shares market is expected to reach $1500 billion.

King Berry, Shenzhen, born in February 1943 and participated in the work in 1967, later served as Secretary of the Village Party Committee, Secretary of the County Committee, Mayor and so on.
In 1986, Mr. King Bean was Secretary of the Shushin County, when Shushin was the poor district of Shushin.
During the five years of Suzhou’s office, King Beer’s heart, concentrating strength has done three things: one to promote vegetable industrialization; two to develop Suzhou’s Salt Beach; three to build a base for industrial turn, allowing Suzhou’s people to push their pockets and raise the backbone.
Shushch farmers have food traditions, and have learned food lessons.
In the early 1980s, the wholesale crops of the shush farmers were not sold, and they were broken in the land.
King Berry's research found that the key to catch vegetables is to make good circulation.
Shushlight first built the vegetable wholesale market, pulling the beginning of developing market economies.
The members of the party should lead, break down, all losses are held in the district.
In 1989, with the support of King Beyonce, 17 members of the party, including Triangle Joo Village, built 17 winter-warmed vegetables store, which built 17 “two thousand homes” at that time.
Subsequently, a promotional group was established in the countryside, under the mobilization of King Beyonce, King Beyonce guided tour throughout the countryside; in the first year, more than 5,000 vegetable grounds were promoted, after which vegetable grounds were pushed to the entire countryside and nationwide.
For thousands of years, 1.6 million hectares of land in the north of Southeast, except salted beaches, are shaped by the beaches.
The lives of local people are very difficult.
South Sudan has a large vegetable store, what about South Sudan?
King Berry organized tens of thousands to take place in the assembly battle, camping on the Desert Beach, one of them for four hundred and fifty days.
The leadership officers in the King Bay and County lived on the workplace, pushing the car as civilians, a dining room, the people saw them all stretching their fingers and admire their eyes ... At that time, Suzhou developed 150,000 acres of baking, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and developed a "collective baking" on the salt beach painted.
In July 1986, King Bean took part for the first time as a council secretary of the council of the Utah City Industrial Conference.
During the meeting, a "Digital Comparison Table of Industrial Economic Comparison" was submitted, first viewing the total industrial production value, life is good, ranked fourth.
But if the raw salt is removed, the pure industrial production of life light remains only $1.19 billion, ranging in the third number.
King Bear, with a group of more than 70 people, ran to the outdoors "change brain".
In less than a year back, the entire council invested $1.5 billion, up to 77 projects.
Since then, every year we organize a “Group” to Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai.
There is a lack of business, there is a lack of entrepreneurs.
King Berry headquartered the theme conference panel: Openly elected managers in the entire countryside, 40 “professional talented people” emerged and were pushed to the industry line.
In 1991, Suzhou entered the National 100-Jong County rankings, and King Bean appointed Vice Mayor of the City of Yuan.
He left, there were more than 200 million vegetable storage, 1.2 million acres of cotton, salt fields, and baking, 4854 enterprises, more than 100,000 “million households” and a staff recognised by the people.
On September 26, the Secretary of State and Foreign Minister Wang Yi headed the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of China and the African members of the Security Council at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
The meeting was attended by the Foreign Minister of the Cote-Dive of Africa, Tano, Foreign Minister of Equatorial Guinea Ojoño, South African Foreign Minister Pandor and Nigerian Foreign Minister Kara and Tunisian Foreign Minister Jihinavi.
King Yi submitted four recommendations on strengthening cooperation between the Central African side in the Security Council.
First, with the strength of unification.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilaterality, the direct consequences of the fundamental principles of international relations are challenged, the role of the United Nations is shocked and the interests of large developing countries and small and medium-sized countries, including African countries.
To address this challenge, it requires central African hands, shoulder and strength for solidarity.
In the Security Council, three African countries spoke with one voice, focusing not only three votes, but the whole continent of Africa.
China and Africa stand together, not just four votes, but will lead other countries to follow, influence and shape the agenda of the Security Council.
Since 2018, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council to fully use this coordination mechanism.
Secondly, the dispute is resolved by consultation.
China has always advocated the political solution of hot-spot issues, Africa has a good tradition of consultation, and the experience of successful African regional and sub-regional organizations.
Many of the complex issues on the agenda of the Security Council are especially hotspots in Africa, mostly in colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.
We must jointly use Chapter 6 of the United Nations Charter to play the role of the United Nations in the field of mediation, and so on.
Thirdly, by self-sufficiency.
Africa’s nations and peoples are best aware of Africa’s issues, and Africa is also capable and wise to solve its own problems.
When dealing with African hotspots, the Security Council should focus on listening and respecting the will of Africa, the role of regional and sub-regional organizations should be played and encouraging and supporting in-life solutions from Africa.
China wants to strengthen coordination with Africa and strongly advance capacity building for Africa’s autonomous peace action.
Fourth, based on development.
China and large African countries are developing countries, and we need to insist on making economic society development in the first place, supporting each other the path of development of their choices.
China is willing to build close relationships with the UN 2030 Agenda, the UN Sustainable Development Agenda, and the strategic development of African countries to help the African countries improve their development capabilities and eliminate the roots of conflict.
We are committed to encouraging the United Nations to increase the investment in Africa’s development.
The Congo Ebola epidemic has broken again, China has and will continue to provide human and material assistance as possible, and will be willing to coordinate actions with African countries, mobilize the United Nations, WHO, etc., to play the role of the United Nations Special Mission for Stability in Congo.

Zhang asked how the baby was a 32-week premature child, while the parents were not able to cover the package for the child, the early autumn morning had a cold sense, he frozen white skin, no crying, and the limbs were paralyzed.
Liu Chan rushed to the driver to treat the baby’s wrap belt, Zhang went out of the driver’s room, quickly opened the package, packed several layers of heating the baby with the inside treatment towels and the package of the package, and cleaned the breathing path to the newborn (as picture), and then held the baby up to the 12th floor of the newborn pediatric hospital.

The Director of the Son reminds that when a pregnant mother has abdominal pain, water breaking, redness, etc. phenomena, should go to the hospital immediately.
If you are in the house or on the road, the mother should try to sleep as flat as possible, you can put a carpet on the back of the shoulder, and so on, to prevent the baby from breeding off the back of the head, the baby should be heated immediately after the birth, and as soon as possible to bring the doctor.

Onyel has a low punishment rate among the NBA players.
The new regulation states that two players can get two points in penalty, three players can get three points in penalty, and the perpetrators can get one point in penalty.

Trudeau is “completed” and can he succeed again?
This time Trudeau pulled out the “big cave” that was just Trudeau himself a bit.
Recently, the Canadian media has revealed several old photos of the current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which Trudeau dressed himself in a black image.
This is considered to be a obvious racism act, which sparked a wave in Canada.
After this happened, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, Canadians have no way to buy bills.
Trudeau moves the stones and knocked his feet.
As political critic Riley and others pointed out, since the emergence of the “anti-Black Face Movement” from the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been highly accused the opposition party or the party who have different opinions in this regard of “great injury” and repeatedly stated “who commits this mistake should be immediately dismissed.”
Simply put, this time Trudeau pulled out the “big cave” which Trudeau had taken out a little bit.
Trudeau is the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, a young and beautiful, who just had a “political idol” swing when he left.
He was originally a “political amateur”, who, after becoming the head of the Federal Liberal Party, played an unexpected beautiful battle in the 2015 federal legislative elections – the Federal Liberal Party seated over half in the Federal Lower House and obtained a precious separate parliamentary power.
At the same time, Trudeau presented a number of dumb philosophy and philosophy, such as “Ethnicity and Gender Equality”, “Eco-Environment”, “Economic Revival”, emphasizing the elimination of corruption and “the wind of injustice”.
However, during the five years of rule, he had almost every aspect of the above, “High and Low”.
With regard to the issue of “ethnic and gender equality,” he had previously “no-proportionate” on a series of issues concerning the indigenous people, which led indigenous groups and leaders to move the tent of protest to the gate of Congress on the 150th anniversary of Canada’s establishment.
In terms of eradication of corruption, at the end of last year, Trudeau was involved in the buried “Roman’s Events” in the beginning of this year.
It was revealed that a major violation of a private fraud against the construction company “Lanvanish” in their home country, pressing the departments and officials responsible for the search, requiring the latter “heft your hands”.
Furthermore, Trudeau was rewarded with officials who disclose the fraud—the previously mentioned King Di, the former Canadian Prosecutor General, who was the first to disclose the fraud and directly handle the case.
Despite the case itself, the suspect is difficult to clean.
Many observers point out that Trudeau's five-year reign was a collapse, mainly due to his own "cave", while the largest "cave" was not more than the "cave of the tigre head", "self-feeding fruit" and "width than the law, severe than the lawman."
Canada’s most authoritative Angus-Rede poll showed that since 2015, Trudeau’s supporters have gone from over 60% to more than 30%, while opponents have gone from less than 30% to more than 60%.
Although other opposition parties and their leaders have performed as badly, even if a significant proportion of voters still want to vote for the Federal Liberal Party, they are now unbelievable of the federal Prime Minister and the leader of the ruling Party.
On October 21, the new federal legislative election in Canada is coming to start, and can Trudeau continue to repeat the winning drama five years ago?
The answer may be in one word: hard.
Whether from the competitive level of enterprise, the level of consumer experience, or from the level of regional aviation integration, the level of development integration of Kyoto, have a profound impact and positive significance.
On September 25th, Beijing Shanghai International Airport officially launched its flight.
The newspapers from the Beijing City Change Commission informed that the capital airport is in a super-satisfied state of operation, and the opening of the Qing International Airport will improve the capital air service capacity.
After Shanghai, Beijing became the second city in China to have two airports in the same city, with Shanghai Rainbow Bridge International Airport mainly serves domestic aviation affairs, and Pushong Airport is mainly similar to international shipping aviation, the future capital airport and Qing airport will also provide more detailed services in the diversification of domestic and international aviation operations.
Airport transportation, from the perspective of business development, has a more beneficial impact on the capital airports.
The passenger consumption of the capital airport in 2018 has reached 100 million passengers and is the top of the country, but in comparison with rapidly growing business demand, there is still a significant lack of traffic, especially a larger gap in international routes demand.
In order to better serve domestic and foreign passenger tourism, travel etc. needs, adapt to Beijing’s increasingly open, urban development trend with international interconnection, Qing International Airport is positioned as a major international hub airport, planned in the future to meet the annual passenger consumption of 100 million people, a cargo consumption of 4 million tons.
Therefore, the two airports are not duplicated, and they also have enough market space for different customers respectively.
From the economic level of accounting, the transit of the Daesh International Airport will obviously form a double-win effect, relieve Beijing air operational tensions, accelerate the growth of passengers and cargo consumption, and build an increase of cakes for the capital aircraft dual-nuclear operation.
From the user point of view, with the transit of the airport, the future does not need to focus on traveling to the capital airport, but also reduce a number of issues brought by the route over the center, such as the extension of passenger’s arrival speed, the indirect increase of the aircraft and passenger’s stay at the airport, increasing the airport operational load, reducing the load of transportation through the capital airport, in fact also improved the passenger’s travel experience.
According to the media calculations of various transport routes and costs to go to large international airports, such as departing from the south five ring to Kyoto, directly to the high-speed up to the high-speed airport, if you drive 50 minutes can arrive, the oil money comes back around 40 yuan, the high-speed fee 15 yuan; while choosing the route of transportation with the metro of Kyoto airport line, the route is limited to 20 km, 30 yuan, the ticket price is divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan three pounds; citizens can also travel to Kyoto City, from Beijing west station to Kyoto airport station only more than 20 minutes.
Overall, the citizens go to the airport with a variety of transport means to choose, and the costs and time are also within a more reasonable range.
And from the point of view of trend development: the location of the airport is the transport center of Kyoto, so a bit away from Beijing city area, but increased radiation to the Northern River and Tianjin, facilitating more people to travel, is important for the economic development of the Northern River and Tianjin.
In the future, passengers will be able to enjoy more international airline services offered by the Qingdao International Airport, which can be seen from Qingdao airport’s transportation planning.
The transportation facilities at the Daing airport are perfect, in addition to the new airport line directly to the Daing airport, there are several highways connected to Daing airport and surrounding areas.
Just as city passengers can go to Guangzhou White Cloud airport via highways Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Guangzhou,
From this can be seen that the transit of the international airport, not only increased several runways and several planes, but also from the competitive level of the company, the level of consumer experience, or from the level of regional aviation integration, the development of Kyoto, have a profound impact and positive significance, not only concerns the long-term layout and development of the Beijing shipping industry, providing diversified options for the travel of the large residents of Kyoto, promoting the quality of Beijing shipping industry services further improving, more favorable to promote the development process of Kyoto Shipping integration, stimulating the economic development of the area surrounding the airport.
Therefore, for traveling to the airport, we need not only to calculate the small bills of the individual, but also to calculate the big bills of the overall development.

The 2019 Vietnam Economic and Social Affairs Forum held in the province of Zhejiang
Vice-Director of the Economic Committee of the Vietnam Parliament said earlier this year, Vietnam’s economic and social development has shown many new shapes and continued to grow.
The forum focused on the highest economic and social issues of the months before 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the forum, representatives exchanged opinions and views on four topics, including the situation of economic development in 2019 and the impact of partial self-trade agreements, some of the outstanding issues in the Vietnam economy in 2019, the outstanding issues in the Vietnam social culture in 2019, and forecasts and recommendations on Vietnam economic development in 2020.
Representatives are generally believed that global economic growth will slow down in the first months of 2019, risks and challenges will increase.
The frequency of trade between the major economies further reduces global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated that despite the global economy full of uncertainty, where 70 percent of the world’s economies are in a stagnation of growth, Vietnam’s economic development has still achieved many pleasant achievements, macroeconomic work smoothly, inflation is effectively controlled, the consumer price index in the first half of 2019 increased average of 2.64%, the lowest increase in almost three years.
GDP grew by 6.76% in the first half of 2019, although lower than 7.05% in the same period last year, the increase remains higher than the level of the same period in 2011-2017.
During the forecast of Vietnam's economic development trends in 2019-2020, the vice-director of the National Economic and Social Forecasting Centre of Vietnam said that the Vietnam economy showed higher growth in 2019 in the context of global economic turbulence.
By 2020, Vietnam’s macroeconomy is expected to remain basic stable, the implementation of all self-trade agreements will promote trade development, economic structure adjustment, business environment improvement work will be further reinforced, and Vietnam’s foreign export activities will show a decline due to the impact of trade friction.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring forecast warning mechanism, initially seek trade relief measures against Vietnam export goods, seek opportunities to expand new export markets, facilitate exports of various goods such as agricultural water products to foreign countries.
At the same time, controlling inflation rates at a reasonable level, thus promoting the development of the supporting industry and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic and organic agriculture.
Liu Zhejiang, Director of the Consulate Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, held an invitation meeting on 26th April in the city of China, celebrating the 70th anniversary of the establishment of New China.
According to Liu Zhejiang, China has been actively involved in international affairs, contributing more Chinese wisdom and Chinese programmes to improve global economic governance, promote global joint development, made a significant contribution to world peace and development, as well as bringing real interests to Cambodia’s economic development and civil well-being.
As the world’s second largest economy, China contributes to the world’s economic growth of more than 30 percent, especially China’s “One Belt and One Way” initiative, and the cooperation between various provinces and provinces of China continues to deepen.
He said this year is the year of the opening of the 61th anniversary of the establishment of Central Cambodia, the two countries have fraternal friendly relationships, and the cooperation between Central Cambodia will be the driving force of local economic and social development.
The Governor of the province Dishah has greatly praised the great achievements of New China in the past 70 years and congratulated the achievement of the friendly cooperation between the two countries.
Dishah expects the two sides to continue to work together to promote Chinese Cambodian friendship and cooperation, to strengthen mutual trust and improve the living standards of people.
Disah said the friendly relations between the province and the province cities of China are attractive, so far have established friendship with the 28 province cities of China, the large cultural performance project “Ungoku Smile” and “Ungoku Prince” land, the Ungoku-Guangxi Agricultural Exhibition Park, the Ungoku New International Airport Project, the Government’s Special Training Classes, the Ungoku Particulars to China study scholarships, rural clinics, Chang Changing City District Road, Bangalore Recovery Project “Light Line” cooperation has accumulated, and the Ungoku people became direct beneficiaries in the friendly cooperation in Cambodia.
Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Defence of Cambodia Kenwanson, President of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the Cabinet of the
A decade of China's "cloud up" testimony in the small town of Nakhchivan - Nakhchivan Net
If we take the 2009 local website forum as the starting point, the 2019 Cloud Live Conference held in Hangzhou 25 to 27 has passed a whole decade.
From the concept of cloud cloud to the practice of cloud, big data and cloud computing have been one of the core technologies to support China’s economic development, social management and public service over a decade.
At the New Energy PV Battery Workshop in Zhejiang Hain, a new “collega” equipped with Alibaba Artificial Intelligence recently, next to the quality prosecutors.
It is 24 hours without interruption, the recognition speed is more than twice the artificial, and the test accuracy is stable at more than 95%.
According to the company’s head, the “quality inspector” with a camera has concentrated more than 40,000 defect samples, with the back cloud computing capacity, it can quickly convert infrared images into binary languages and will place defective battery classification.
The company is just a shortcut of the transformation of today’s cloud computing assisted manufacturing industry.
The Ministry of Industry and Information in 2018 printed the Company’s Cloud Implementation Guidelines (2018-2020), presented by 2020, aiming to significant improvement of the company’s cloud awareness and positivity, significantly improving the cloud ratio and the depth of applications.
The founder of Ali Cloud, Wang Yi, said today, data-centric cloud computing has built a bridge to the digital economy of data as key elements and opened the way.
Meanwhile, over 10 years, the size of our cloud computing industry has not steadily expanded.
The White Book (2019) of the Chinese Information Communications Institute published in July this year shows that the total market of China’s cloud computing in 2018 reached 962.8 billion, a growth of 39.2% compared to 2017.
In addition to being a key technology to support industrial transformation and the development of the digital economy, the invisible “cloud” also unconsciously changed urban management and social life.
This year, the “City Brain” that appears for three consecutive years, is still attractive.
The city brain has now become the center of city management from traffic management tools and related cooperation applications have been expanded to 23 cities worldwide.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the city brain can be achieved through powerful computing capabilities, allowing new city management services functions such as “pay before parking”, “real-time perception of hospitals,” “tourist lines design”.
In the field of government services, using “one cloud” to interact with “one thing”, “on the office”, “on the office”, “on the office”, and cloud computing facilitated the supply of government services in both sides.
Currently, Zhejiang has built an unified public data platform throughout the province through government over clouds.
As of September 11, the platform has covered more than 57 million permanent residents in the province and more than 15 million legal units, collecting 1908 million data in the category 3066 management.
The average monthly calls and data shared between the government departments of Zhejiang has reached 12 million times, and the data flows more than once calls on the ‘cloud’ may mean the crowd managed to run less.
Be careful with plastic tea bottles!
A recent Canadian study found that a package of plastic tea could release billions or even billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than the amount of microplastics one’s estimated consumption year round, but there is no evidence that the consumption of plastic particles could be a threat to human beings.
Researchers from the University of Margill, Canada, found that putting a plastic tea bag into a glass of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius), the tea bag releases approximately 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.3 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than the amount of microplastics that a person estimates to consume throughout the year.
According to a study published early in 2019, people eat at least 50,000 plastic particles each year while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.
The study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, and researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montreal shops and cafés, opened the tea bags, wrapped in almost boiling water for five minutes after cleaning, and then analyzed with electronic microscope and spectrometer.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag releases more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, “a lot higher than other foods before.”
Most of the tea bags are made of natural fiber, but many of the natural fiber made tea bags brands still use plastic to cover their mouths.
Some of the brand’s tea bags are no longer made of paper, instead using plastic, and these plastic tea bags are being tested by researchers.
Plastic particles are small pieces of plastic, and researchers defined these microplastics sizes ranging from 100 nm to 5 cm, primarily produced by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in the air, soil, rivers and deepest waters around the world, which can be found in water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
Researchers first discovered plastic particles in human sputum samples in several countries in different regions of the world in October 2018.
To test the potential toxicity of plastic particles in tea bags, the Canadian research team put waterproof into contaminated water and found microplastics affect the behavior of these waterproofs and cause them to develop deformations.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence so far that the consumption of plastic particles could pose a threat to humans.
However, the WHO stresses that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and how they affect humans.
Researchers suggest that these tea bags release large quantities of plastic particles, which may be in contact with boiling water, and even when the “eating grade” plastic is heated to more than 40 degrees, they may break down or penetrate toxic substances.
Guterres said climate emergencies are the biggest threat to the survival of small islands.
There, a natural disaster will erode the results of the development of a generation.
The disasters in Barbuda, Dominica and Bahamas, which have been affected by storms since this year, have demonstrated this.
Approximately one-quarter of people in small islands developing countries live at a sea level of 5 meters or less.
Migration can seriously affect their social and lifestyle and even cause issues of sovereignty and ethnic identity.
At this Monday’s climate action summit, the small island countries jointly committed to achieving carbon and 100% renewable energy by 2030, thus bringing the world in the right direction again.
Guterres said: “The climate crisis is accumulating new injustice over the old injustice.
Although small island developing countries have made a small contribution to global warming, they have paid the highest price.
Because these countries are in a middle-income position, many countries also fall into an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world has to take action, and it is time to make major decisions and make huge investments in small island developing countries.”
Today’s High Level Conference adopted a political statement calling for helping small islands developing countries manage the risks of disaster, investing in climate-adapted infrastructure and approaches to transition to renewable energy; calling on international institutions to help small islands developing countries, debt accumulated middle-income countries, get funds.
Small islands developing countries are at the forefront of the world’s life line — the ocean.
The latest special report published this week by the Intergovernmental Committee on Climate Change confirmed that the ocean has already suffered the severe consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, many regions may have occurred every year some extreme sea level rise that occurred once in the first century.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to become inhabitable without a large amount of funds in adaptation.
Pollution, excessive capture and oxidation caused huge losses.
Over the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, and plastic pollution has been tenfolded in the past 40 years.
Demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is reducing resources, includingining fishing fields in many island communities.
Small islands also face high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are strongly dependent on some external markets, making them exposed to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also trying to deal with the safety impacts of illegal trafficking of people, weapons and drugs.
Guterres said: “The problem can be solved anywhere by solving a problem in the most challenging environment.
The efforts of small island developing countries to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, experience lessons and examples available to the world.”
He stressed that small islands developing countries are a special example of sustainable development.
They require long-term attention and investment from the entire international community.
The Ministry of Finance said the financial system is sufficient.
India’s finance minister, Sitalamann, said the current liquidity of the financial system is sufficient and the economic growth of India is expected to restore in the second half of this fiscal year.
West Hamman made this statement after a meeting with representatives of private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks and institutions such as India.
West Ham didn’t explain where these speeches were targeted.
Previously, some of the Indian and foreign media have blamed the continuous decline in India’s current round economy for the liquidity tension of non-bank financial institutions.
West Ham as an example of a drop in car sales, denying liquidity tension as the main cause of sales decline.
Zithalman pointed out that the decline in automotive sales was mainly due to cycling factors.
West Hamman expects India’s economic growth may recover in the second half of the financial year, under the impulsion of festival consumption.
India’s annual shopping season starts in September and will last until the end of the year.
Markets expect that shopping consumption will greatly promote India’s economic growth.

On 26th of local time, Japanese Prime Minister Abe Yong congratulated the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China through a video.
Japanese Prime Minister Abe: Good night everyone, I am Abe Abeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeye

“Some senior farmers in the workplace are estimated to account for more than half.
Where are young workers now?
There is no way to use so many “olders” in the workplace.”
Recently, the phenomenon of many older farmers (over the retirement age) on the workplace has been impressed by Yuki, a long-term engineering contractor in the construction industry.
Recently, the high school where you have performed the rainy pollution processes, and there were a lot of farmers in the campus, and if you were carefully observed, you will find that there are a lot of older farmers here.
Elderly farmer’s out-of-working work is not “unbelievable,” but because of “unbelievable”, with “must have to do so” irreversible and difficulty—whether they spend money on solving their own pension and health issues or helping children, drives these elderly people who originally should be “unbelievable” to continue their hard work.
An elderly farmer’s “old dependency” was not as easy as we could imagine.
Educating children, nurturing elderly, reading for children, helping children build build cars, helping children get home jobs, educating grandchildren, when these farmers have completed the “life task”, the money pockets have been empty and even a lot of debt, mostly lack of wealth accumulation.
In order not to attract children and to build more wealth for themselves, many farmer workers insist on “doing until they do not move.”
Many of the new generation of agricultural workers of “after 80”, “after 90” or “after 00” refusing to engage in difficult conditions, high-traffic-intensity secondary industries or low-end service industries, resulted in structural “employment poverty,” which lack of attractive work, providing opportunities for older agricultural workers.
Due to the lack of a long-term skill, physical capacity and labor capacity also decreased, many elderly farmers are working with high intensity, low income, high-risk and guaranteed less work.
Being able to do a day for a day, be able to earn a little more, the survival difficulties of the elderly peasant workers behind the “unbelievable” cannot be ignored and neglected.
Solving the problems of lack of wages and wages, healthy labor protection, reducing safety risks, increasing labor income, improving the survival of elderly farmers, in addition to their “self-saving”, also unable to leave the public sector’s institutional protection and humanitarian care.
Scientists point out that elderly farmers are unlikely to rely on their home land to solve problems such as retirement and healthcare, and they have to get rid of their homes through other ways.
Understanding the indignation and strength of elderly farmer’s “unbelievable” will help us better understand the love and pain of elderly farmer’s.
Seeing the backdrop of elderly peasants, listening to their pleasures, thinkers attempt to make them return to the villages truly realize the "old dependency", requiring public sectors, markets and society sharing responsibilities in good interactions, requiring multilateral cooperation.
Chemezov said Russia will not export this system in the next five years, because "the first supply of its armies will be exported."
This practice is entirely in accordance with international practice.
The main producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure their defence needs first and then process export orders.
Earlier, the Russian Aerospace Force Deputy General General Yuri Grehov said the development of the system is about to be completed.
The S-500 system was developed by the "Diamond-Ante" air defence of Conchane.
It is a new generation of air defense systems that adopts the principle of working to destroy ballistic and air dynamic targets.
The S-500’s main role is to block medium-range ballistic missiles, which can block missiles with a range of less than 3,500 kilometers.
Furthermore, according to some data, the S-500 can also destroy high-speed ultrasound cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of drones, five times higher ultrasound speed missiles, and even targeted near space.
These weapons can also be combined with other air defense systems into a unified network, especially the S-400 system, which is very important from the defense point of view.
Sergey Chemezov expressed special attention to the S-400s.
He said the system is currently in great demand in the world, but the Russian army also needs it, including in the Arctic region.
The S-400 air defense system operates in the Arctic Air Defense Force.
According to reports on September 15, the work of the Arctic Air Defense Force on New Zealand’s S-400 air defense missile system has been completed.
This is not the militaryization of Russia in the Arctic region.
The Russian Defence Ministry said this is entirely a process within the transition plan of more advanced defence instruments towards the strategic direction of the north.
Russia's Northern Fleet news agency said: "With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, controllable airspace in the Arctic region has increased significantly."
Most importantly, according to the military’s assessment, the system was successful in the Northern and Arctic regions.
The Air Force officers have been trained on the new system and prepared to enter the fighting operations.
It was previously equipped with the S-300 remote air defense system, and now it remains a part of it.
When it comes to the air defense system, it must have weapons that can destroy various air targets, whether it is a target of high-speed flight outer level or a "leaked fish" close to protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph (Triumph) system developed by Cochrane’s Golden Diamond-Ante is designed for attacking strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high-speed ultrasound targets and other air attack weapons.
The weapons can attack air dynamic targets within 400 kilometers and hit ballistic targets flying around 4.8 kilometers per second within 60 kilometers.
Russia will never hide its deploying air defence forces in the Northern Arctic to ensure the air security of the North Seaways.
Recently, the first 12 sets of "Tor" - M2DT" air defense missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic region, they were sufficient to form a air defense camp to strengthen the air defense system in the Arctic region.
The Russian Defence Ministry said that the Arctic Tor forces will be expanded to a full-scale construction in the future.
In addition to the new S-400 remote systems deployed on New Zealand and the Cora Peninsula, as well as the short-distance system "Pantsir-SA" deployed in the extreme northern region, these advanced air defense weapons strongly protect Russia's polar sky.
Enemy planes, helicopters and drone missiles will be hard to break this defense.
According to the idea of the Russian government, the flagship store will become the platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complex and long process of opening themselves.
As an operator of Russian goods store, the Russian company focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
China’s largest trading platforms such as Tmall, Kyoto (JD), 1688, Pinduoduo, Hand Q (ShouQ), Multifunctional Instant Communications Software (Wechat) all have online shops and have its own online platform Epinduo.com and Russian retail chain shops.
The Russian Export Center will cooperate with the Russian company to develop stores marketing strategies and participation standards and select the company’s products on the virtual shelf.
The store is scheduled to open by the end of this year and launch products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to data from the Russian Export Center, the Chinese e-commerce platform has reached a billion monthly visits.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have seen stable growth since 2014 and have exceeded $1 billion in 2018.
Currently, Alibaba Group will also open trial stores for sale of goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the global import strategy framework.
According to Alexei Kojevnikov, the new store will list the goods of companies that sells at least more than 500 million rubles.
To be honest, the sales of 500 million rubles above my expectations is not enough.
We all know that the attitude of Chinese consumers towards Russian goods is quite positive, regarding our products as high quality and green environmental products.
Kovaevnikov said the competition between Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is intense and continues to intensify.
“Our ambitious goal is to launch 500 companies through this store within three years.”
At the same time, the platform will also offer products of Russian companies in the Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, Professor of the Basic Laboratory of Trade Policy at the Russian Economic University of Prague, said: “This is a political project representing the image of both sides, because the Russian export center is a state-owned and not a private institution.
“I have not seen Russian products very competitive on a large number of markets.”
He believes the project is likely not actually implemented, but it will help strengthen the relations between the two countries.
Andrew Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Center, said during the Eastern Economic Forum that the product information of more than 170 Russian companies has been published on the largest international wholesale platform Alibaba.com, which can be purchased in China and other countries.
Furthermore, there is a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, a training project for Russian enterprises by experts from the University of Abu Dhabi, whose first seminar was held in July this year.
At the second China International Import Exhibition in Shanghai in November this year, the Russian Export Center will also participate as an organizer of industrial exhibitions and commercial projects of Russian enterprises.
Large exhibition will be held in a 1000 square meters exhibition, which will also be the center of organizing commercial project events, agreement signing ceremonies, interviews and talks with Chinese enterprise representatives.
Approximately 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural companies.
Russia's Export Center's news agency said: "In addition to the agricultural exhibition, we must have a business meeting, which is to arrange the establishment of direct contacts between entrepreneurs.
“This is another direction of our efforts to support and ensure that dozens of special meetings are arranged for them.”
In addition, the exhibition will also host masterclasses, cooking competitions and a Russian culinary exhibition for Russian famous cuisine for the project "Exploring Russian cuisine Shanghai Station".

New York Times: We are firmly not going on our own way.
The White Book of the New Age of China and the World, published on 27 December, answered: “In the past 70 years, China’s development has been successful, and it is essentially because under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have found the right path of development of the characteristic of China’s socialism and have continuously followed this path.
China is the choice of history, the choice of the people.
Since modern times, in an environment of weakness and inner anxiety, a generation of Yin-servants seeking and following on the way to seek the rescue of the country.
However, “the constitutional monarchy, the reconstruction of the Empire, the parliamentary, multi-party, the presidential system have thought, tried, and the results do not succeed.”
Until with the Communist Party of China, with the New China, the Chinese people gradually opened the way of socialism in the practice.
This path from China is the path to the happiness of the Chinese people, the path to the resurrection of the Chinese people, and the same path to the development of China with the world.
It is because China is on the right path that can do its own things, to become the second largest economy in the world, the largest contributor to global economic growth, to continue to benefit the world by its own development.
As the White Book pointed out, China’s development path, in accordance with China’s state and adapting to the requirements of the age, will show more and more bright prospects for development as the time progresses.
Back to the past, the Chinese people know how easy it is to find the right path; looking around the world, the Chinese people appreciate this right path more.
Chinese people understand the logic of South Orange and understand that suitable for others is not necessarily suitable for themselves, but only suitable for themselves is the best.
It is with this road confidence and strategic capabilities that China has created a world-renowned miracle.
In the process of turning forward mankind, “The End of History” was once called noise.
Today, the success of the socialist path of China has declared the end of the “historic end”, the collapse of the “Chinese collapse” and the failure of the “socialist failure”.
China’s success, boosted developing countries’ trust in achieving the rich nation, expanded the path of developing countries towards modernization, providing experience and guidance to the world’s nations and nations who both want to accelerate development and want to maintain their independence, on the path of compliance with their national status.
The world is rich.
China has always respected the right of countries to choose their own path of development.
China does not “introduce” the foreign model, nor “export” the Chinese model, but will firmly not move its own way, realize its continuous development, strengthen the governance and political exchange with the countries, and make the desirable contribution to the joint achievement of good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that a foodworks supermarket boss dismissed a 66-year-old woman by SMS because he was preferred to hire employees from Asian backgrounds, the boss's practice was violently criticized as "shameful".
The committee said the way Mr. Gail Ayton’s boss who worked at Wagga Wagga’s store for more than 20 years had treated employees “extremely unfair” and could violate the anti-discrimination law.
Mrs. Ayton told the committee that Mr. King took over the store in 2016, and he was always “wishing to kick me off” because she wasn’t a Chinese.
In this case, Vice President Peter Sams conducted a search on the Internet to find “some of Mr. King’s recruitment ads previously posted on various Australian Chinese employment forums.”
Among the job requirements listed in these positions, one said “Asian First Lady” and the other said “Asian First Employee”.
The third post says he is “more predisposed to be foreigners (the original article).”
Mr. Wang dismissed Ms. Ayton in April through a text message later said it was due to her lack of work and a small amount of cash that was allegedly seen from $5.10 to $30.
However, Mr. Sam said the reason for Mr. King’s dismissions of Ms. Ayton was weak and lack of evidence.
For three years, she missed only one class time, with a total of a few Australian dollars.
He said Ms. Ayton was dismissed “that’s actually nothing to do with her behavior or behavior.”
“I think, with the support of evidence of Mr. King’s recruitment ads, the real motivation of the prosecutor to dismiss her is that he would rather hire employees with Asian background.
In accordance with Article 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. King’s behavior is superficially illegal to violate the Anti-Discrimination Act and/or dismissions of applicants.”
Mr. Sams said that, given Mr. King's "heldful hearing" treatment of Mrs. Ayton, he considered it not appropriate to restore her position.
He should consider paying compensation to Mrs. Ayton, who was a temporary worker with $26 per hour.
Considering the possible violation of anti-discrimination and labor law, Sam said he would submit his decisions and documents to the board head to consider whether Mr. King's actions should be transferred to other institutions to investigate actions that could violate state or federal laws.
Mr. King did not give Mrs. Ayton any chance to respond to the alleged reason for her dismissation.
“I think the prosecutors have taken unfair and prejudiceous procedures to dismiss the applicant, Mr. King “will wait” for the opportunity, he believes that this would ‘prove’ the end of the employment for the applicant is legitimate.”
“He’s wrong... The prosecutor completely ignored any natural and fair treatment given to her when he dismisses the applicant, and shockingly, he’s disgraceful and extremely unfair deceit.”
Mr. Sams said, although Foodworks is a small business, “but it must be honestly said that any good employer will not dismiss employees in the extreme unfair and deceptive way recognized in the case.”
He said, “It is embarrassed and unfair.”

Approximately 800 million people have been celebrated to China tourism supplies
Approximately 800 million people will visit the next 11th Golden Week!
Large data from several tourist platforms show that the demand for tourism consumer markets in China is double prosperity.
The National Festival Tourism Report forecasts, according to the National Festival Tourism Statistics of the past year, domestic tourists are expected to be approximately 800 million during the national holiday this year, and there will be more than 7.5 million exit tourists.
Currently, tourists from more than 500 cities book a group trip, free trips, custom tourism, local entertainment and other products through the platform, which involves 100 countries and regions.
According to the Chinese Institute of Tourism, last year the national holiday hosted 7,26 billion domestic tourists, an increase of 9.43%.
This year’s national holiday will not only increase the number of visitors, but consumption upgrades will also become the “major melody” of national holiday excursions.
Relationship reports that national holiday domestic cross-provincial tourists cost more than $3,000 per person, increasing compared to the same period last year, because visitors generally chose to experience better products, such as high-rated brand hotels, no shopping tourists, fine small groups, exclusive cars, etc.
The bookings data show similar trends, with the use of comfortable models throughout the domestic long line, the "private group" for less than ten people is more popular than the previous year.
Spring Autumn tourism data show that its consumers prefer heavy experience, heavy service, and heavy differentiated “from slow line”.
Flying pigs data show that the number of tourist reservations in the four lines and below cities in China has grown the fastest, with the same rate to reach 30% increase, reducing the consumption of residents in more regions of the country.
Personalization is a major feature of the 11th Golden Week tour of this year.
Transportation data show that national holiday car rental orders are expected to increase by 60% compared to the same, short-way self-driving trips in the surrounding public lines are continuously popularized; the number of private groups’ registrations is increased by up to 155% compared to the same.
Sharing joy becomes the main purpose of people’s leisure.

According to the age of visitors, “after 80” and “after 90” account for more than five percent of the total number of visitors.
It is worth noting that, unlike the greater growth of exit travel in the past Golden Week, the domestic tourism markets performed more "colored" this year.
Flying pigs data show that the number of people booking domestic travel lines for the national holiday this year has increased by 42% compared to the number of national holidays, increasing faster than exit trips.
Industry analysis, while demand is growing, promotes tourism supply side reform across the country, providing tourists with a greater “curriculum”.

World’s oldest hairdresser died at 108 years old, cut off 96 years old.
Anthony Mancinelli, an elderly world-record-accredited hairdresser in New York, 108 years old, never retired to have a daily haircut for a guest, but he died on 19th day from a complication of undercarcinoma, saying goodbye to his 96 years of haircut life.
According to CNN, Mancini emigrated to the United States when he was eight years old, he helped cleaning the floor at a hairstyle shop and began taking a knife to serve guests at 12 years old, thereby mitigating economic pressure at home.
Mancini had a primary school at the time, but later did not graduate.
Mancini's son Robert reveals that his father loves work and people from all over the world like him, but his father was diagnosed with cancer in February this year and he was not able to work for physical factors six weeks before his death, but that was not retirement, because he's planning to look good and he's going to cut his hair back.
82-year-old Robert says he has now to find a new hairdresser after his father’s death, because he has been helping his father to cut his hair all his life.
In the year, the company re-acquisition of more than $10 billion creates historical New High-New Wave Network.
In order to stabilize the company’s stock price and maintain the company’s image, listed companies have started frequently rebuying shares over the past two years, hoping that the company’s value is underestimated to the market, thus stabilizing the stock price and enhancing investors’ trust.
Eastern Fortune Choice data showed that the funds used for re-buying shares of the listed company in 2017 amounted to $79 billion, increased to $510 billion in 2018, and since 2019, the total re-buy of the listed company has exceeded $10 billion, creating a new high in order to re-buy funds, and far beyond the previous year.
In terms of the purpose of the re-buy, the company's re-buy shares appear to be the same as the growth of large shareholders, but there are great differences in implementation of the entity, funds sources, re-buy uses, the interests of the shares themselves, etc.
Xiang Xiang, CEO of Shanghai Mikoun Information Consulting Limited Liability Company, said in an interview with the Securities Journal, that the Opinion on Supporting Revenue Shares of Listed Companies, launched in November 2018, revised issues of existing system such as a narrow range of shares, complex decision-making processes, insufficient stock system, as previously started to encourage listed Companies Revenue Shares from the perspective of policy, therefore the phenomenon of Revenue Shares has increased significantly in that year.
In January this year, the stock exchanges and the stock exchanges officially published the Rules of Implementation of Securities Revenue of Securities, which launched these policies, expanded the sources of Securities Revenue of Securities Revenue Fund, adequately simplified implementation procedures, guiding improved governance arrangements, encouraging various Securities to implement share incentives or employee holding plans.
After the appearance of the opinion, the listed company performs the operations of the rebuy of shares, with more applicable circumstances, the rebuy process is simpler, and the rebuy of shares is also greater.
Re-buy shares at relatively low positions, it also benefits listed companies to improve the efficiency of using funds, thereby increasing the profit level per share, increasing the net asset return rate, and reducing the pressure on the company’s profit index.
Compared to the growth of large shareholders, the importance of re-buying shares of listed companies is greater, and it also reflects the willingness to initiate market value management and cash flow of listed companies.
Xiang believes that underestimated stock prices are the main factor in the rebuy of listed companies, and the company’s stock prices are no longer able to reflect the company’s future development prospects, so such companies are worth the attention of investors, but cannot blindly invest and need to focus on the financial statements of such listed companies as well as the specific operating situation.
Listed companies with massive recovery behavior show at least the company's development confidence and financial strength.
A listed company’s enthusiasm for recycling increases gradually, also normalizes the recycling behavior, data shows that almost a thousand listed companies have already performed the recycling of shares this year, and leading companies in various sectors have become the main power of recycling market.
China Peace recently revealed re-acquisition progress said the company has aggregated 5759 million A shares through a concentrated price trading method, accounting for 0.315% of the company’s total shares, a total amount of funds paid at $50 billion (excluding transaction fees), and the re-acquisition shares will be all used in employee holding plans, including but not limited to the long-term service plans that have been reviewed by the Company’s Shareholders Assembly.
Illi’s share has paid $57.92 billion for the re-buy of shares, and has recently been adjusted to the use of re-buy shares, converting from the original plan “re-buy shares will all be used as a source of share incentives for the later implementation of share” to “the total re-buy of 1.83 billion shares, of which 1.52 billion shares are used to implement share incentives, and the remaining 3.49 million shares will be used to cancel to reduce registered capital.”
Illi shares said to cancel some of the re-buyed shares would further improve the return level of each share and significantly improve the return of the company’s shareholders.
TCL Group released on September 25th announcement of re-acquisition progress showed that the TCL Group total re-acquisition of 3.59% of the company’s share costs $16.5 million.
TCL Group’s board office told the journalists that re-buy shares would be used for employee holding plans, to encourage shareholders or to convert corporate bonds issued by listed companies to be converted into shares.
TCL Group adheres to the established operating strategy, continuously improving competitiveness and sustainable health development.
Based on the trust in the company’s future development andining the interests of investors, combined with the performance of the company’s shares in the second-tier market for almost a year and a comprehensive consideration of the company’s operational and financial situation, the company plans to recover company’s shares using own funds, self-funding and other funding methods.
Jandron, Chief Economist of the Open Source Fund, said that the operations of the listed company's re-buy shares, on the one hand, can reduce the number of shares circulated on the market, increase the earnings per share of the listed company, is an important advantage for the stock price of the secondary market; in addition, the listed company is willing to initially extract real gold silver, re-buy shares from the stock market, which greatly raised market confidence.
Revenue of domestic listed companies has gradually increased in recent years, especially performance shares, is a very good way to boost investors' trust through re-buy shares and is also a practice worth trusting and encouraging.
The General Committee of Lake Nanjing, the Secretary of the City of Nanjing, Huangzhou, and the four main headquarters of engineering machinery manufacturing, — Jinhong, Li Qian, Liu Qian, set a "small goal" around "Nanjing from engineering machinery to intelligent manufacturing" — — three-five years later to build a world-leading engineering machinery industry group.
Construction of the world's leading engineering machinery industry group in Nagasaki, using the modern word now, is to build "the strongest surface".
As a city in the province of the Inland, Nagasai cries this magnificent speech, where does it come from?
Because of the power of hegemony.
The four engineering machinery enterprises participated in this dialogue, one hand, covering the entire area of heaven, underground, sea and land: the smart light aircraft of Mountain River, the heavy-duty concrete transportation pump of China, the whole ground heightening machine of three heavy-duty, the iron construction tunnel shield, its "hard strength" can be referred to as single-step under the sky, the Grand Vision Hero.
For some time, China had no speech right in the field of engineering machinery manufacturing.
When switching to the world, Chinese enterprises "introduce" "go out" dual-wheel drive, using the "One Belt and Road" initiative, multi-procedure, acquisition, merger, establishment of factory etc, gradually became the foundation of the global engineering machinery industry.
Among them, three major economic indicators of heavy machinery, China Union heavy machinery, iron construction heavy machinery, mountain intelligence etc., their production value, market occupation rate, sales etc., have been significantly leading the same type of enterprises.
It is driving time by the camera.

In the lake of the global industry, who lives and lives well is the hardness of talking.
Earlier years, the global engineering machinery industry encountered cold winter, many international renowned engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises fell down, but Long-Sha’s engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises took the “cat winter” as “winter swimming”, self-driving pressure, self-driving, transforming through industrial structure, transforming from manufacturing to intellectual, not only passed the past, but also body bones stronger.
For the stars of the moon,
Developing the advantages industry requires both the company’s positive action and the government’s positive action.
The reputation of the “Engineering Machinery Capital” is that the entire industry chain from the up to the down, built a number of associated industries, and significantly reduced the cost of the company’s development, manufacturing and sales by optimizing the business environment, improving the package service, simplifying the approval process.
Good business ecology allows engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises to come.
History has pushed Nanjing to the front of the building of the leading level of global engineering machinery, when I do not wait, when Yin does not allow.
Whether the government or the enterprise, or the related productivity researchers, should take advantage of the opportunity, step up, bite objectives, continue to drive, and contribute to the construction of the manufacturing powers.

Sheveli is a resident of Shayong Bay village, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City, Shayong City.
His left neighbor's right side is shepherds, but adhered to the traditional methods of breeding, shepherds are poor quality, and bars are small.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor masses in the village joined cooperation, and everything began to change.
Havilly spent the whole day in research and cultivation, because he was constantly in his heart.
The people who enter the stock are poor, they all hold the sheep to the cooperation, if they can share the red and sell the price at the end of the year, but they are looking forward to him.
Well under the guidance of the technicians, he gradually learned to prevent the disease, mastered the science of feeding, and became a "good way" for a few farmers in the village.
The cooperation is a standardized cooperation with 16 sheephoods and 1,400 lakes.
The co-operative head of Yuan said that outside of the standardized sheep cabin, there are many gates.
“The sheep is thick, easy to feed bacteria, the sheep should not stay in hot and wet places, the sheep shelves must be built in the three-sided circle, and also must be equipped with a wind turbine to ventilate the heat spread.”
In order to prevent the disease, it is also necessary to regularly disinfect the sheep’s spray, and to use the sheep three to four vaccinations in a quarter.
“Little Sheep” in addition to living well, it is also necessary to eat herbs made of a mixture of grain, wheat, grain, and so on, and have sufficiently wide “playground” to expand muscles.
The cooperation adopts an approach to hosted breeding, guiding local farmers to bring good lakes here, unified breeding, management, sales, achieving good diversification, scientificalization, standardization and integrated breeding.
Today, 140 poor households with sheep shares, with more than $6,000 per household per year, and four archive cards for poverty aiders work in the cooperation.
From “Full Mountain Breeding” to “Precision Feeding”, from “Local Feeding” to “Artificial Fertilization”, from “Seeing Body, Touching B Over” to “Being B Over” ... In the Happy Holidays, sheep breeding is not only a transformation of feeding, the pattern of “Collaboration + Farmers” has also changed the scene of once “peeding sheep on the mountain, sell sheep in the market”, overcome the weak dispersion of traditional farming, and the poor days of farmers became better because of the modernity of sheep breeding.
If the market price is weak, the local Dongxiang Enterprise Gongong Zongjiang Farm Development Co., Ltd. will acquire under the market protection price of $27 per kilogram to help farmers spread market risks.
Qingdao, General Advisor of Qingdao Agriculture Development Ltd, said the company has led more and more poor people to the idea of “According” by providing loans guarantees, sheep supply, order breeding, offer purchases, unified processing, etc. to the poor.
At the festival, at least 8,200 poor families achieved a stable increase in revenues through “united” chicken breeding, good breeding, scale cultivation, slaughter division and market sales.
In the Northern Shinjang City, there is a mistake of landscapes and weapons are rich.
Currently, there are 913 meat-scale farms and cooperatives throughout the city, feeding more than 5 million, and two processing lines of 1.3 million meat-scale cattle massages have been built, the sheep is becoming the "leading sheep" in the country's industry's poverty reduction.

Research: U.S. National Health Nutrition Index Slightly Grow But Still Challenge
According to the U.S. Daily Telegraph, a recent U.S. study shows that the U.S. government’s health diet index has grown moderately in 16 years, from 56 to 58.
But if the fullness is 100 minutes, it is not worth celebrating.
American citizens are still facing “significant challenges” in the diet.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Wang, a nutritional researcher at the University of Tufts, Massachusetts, said Americans still consume too many foods that could cause heart disease, diabetes, obesity, which are the most common diseases in the US citizens.
The study was published 24 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study is based on the U.S. government’s health survey conducted between 1999 and 2016.
The authors wrote: “Despite noticeable improvements, significant dietary challenges still exist.”
These challenges have been to include reducing American citizens’ intake of foods that contain saturated fat, hot dogs, cattle, butter, etc.
Studies found that people’s daily diet intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended 10% intake limit.
The biggest improvement in the American national diet was the reduction of sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but intake remains too high.
Officials believe that the intake of added sugar in daily diets should be less than 10%.
For the reasons for reduced sugar intake, researchers believed to be linked to decreased in people’s drinking sweet juice, but Zhang emphasized that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods such as tomato sauce.
American adults have a slight increase in the intake of fruits, nuts, wheat and other whole grain categories foods.
However, data from 2016 show that these foods still share less than 5% of their daily diet.
Although people’s salt intake was slightly reduced, and the reduction in drinking juices led to the intake of low-quality carbohydrates, Zhang said they still account for up to 42% of their daily calories, many of which come from fine processed white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on a personal health survey every two years, which allows adults to remember the food they have eaten in the past 24 hours.
These health surveys have been asked this question twice every few days since 2003.
The government published U.S. Resident Diet Guidelines suggests people adopt a “healthy diet pattern” to reduce the chances of developing chronic diseases.
The guidelines pointed out that people should consume more nutritional-intensive foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, as well as seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs, and seed foods that can provide protein.
During the study, the number of people with diabetes among the U.S. has almost doubled, more than 7%, and the rate of obesity has also increased over the years between the study — about 70% of Americans now have overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the main cause of death in American citizens.

“Other big data, such as e-commerce, time and space data, can help us better design a region, an industry’s activity and landscape.”
Xi Jinping said, while solving risks, big data technology will also help improve wind control capabilities.
China Railway Tunnel's deepest record has been renewed
After more than 1,200 days and night construction, the construction of the Grand Riyang Railway Gogong Tunnel 1, the construction of the Grand Riyang Railway Gogong Tunnel 1, completed on 27 September, the depth reached 762.59 meters below the ground, broke the deepest record of the Chinese Railway Tunnel, which was created in a massive flood.
A total length of 34.5 kilometers, the High-Rigong Tunnel is located in Yuan, and the tunnel crosses the High-Rigong Mountains along the west coast of Yuan, is the longest single-hole tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel crosses 19 cracks, with a maximum depth of 1155 meters, as it covers almost all tunnel construction may encounter bad geological and significant risks, the High-Rigong Tunnel is known as the "Geological Museum" of Tunnel Construction.
The fence is the most important assistant fence of the High-Rigong Tunnel, and the shoulder increases the operational area of the workplace to realize the "long tunnel short hit" and later railway operational ventilation.
The 1st floor was successfully excavated to the bottom of the floor, marking the High-Rigong Tunnel officially entered the level tunnel construction, after excavation and replacement of equipment, the floor can add 4 workplaces to the bottom floor and accelerate the excavation speed of the tunnel.
“The floors are all on the ground floor, because of the floors of the floors are more breaking, water can not stop, flowing constantly from up to down, basically how deep the floors are the water pressure.”
The General Engineer of the Dary Railway Project Department of Central Railway Tunnel Office said that during the construction of the flood, there were several risks of flooding, collapse, and the construction team invited experts to put the pulse on the site, more than 20 times researching the processing process.
“When the water flow within the fountain is the maximum, it reaches more than 300 square meters per hour, more than 700 meters depth of the fountain, and water pressure is equivalent to 700 meters depth of the sea.”
“If you don’t take out water in time, you will flood 10 meters in an hour, we spend almost 85% of our time to clean water, and 15% of our time to dig.”
In order to overcome geological difficulties of the number 1 river rocks in the direction of saving development, flooding water, river rocks and so on, the tunnel construction adopts a combined systemic water treatment measures for "exploration, casting, excavation" to reduce construction risk.
After several improvements, the 1st floor construction formed the mechanized flow line of water lines, such as excavation system, excavation system, suspension system, suspension lifting system, etc., and achieved the entire process of mechanization of the operation of the construction process, and accelerated.
Finally, after more than 1,200 days and night construction, the cave successfully completed the excavation of 762.59 meters depth.
A total length of 330 km is an important component of the Central Myanmar International Corridor and is an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the construction of “One Belt and Road”.
After the construction of the car, Dali to Reli’s travel time will be shortened from 6 hours of the current road to 2 hours, which will greatly improve the transportation mode in the West region, promoting China and Southeast Asia’s economic cooperation and staff-friendly.

This year’s ‘11’ is full of time, to go to the ‘Kart’ astronomy, the children’s theatre, to about a few family weekends to the Tender Museum with a tent camp, and to arrange some trial experience lessons.”
Theoretically, the evolutionary path of consumption of residents evolved from surviving consumption to developing consumption and enjoying consumption, where a significant part of consumption enjoying consumption is a service-class consumption.
With the continuous development of our economic society and the increasing level of residents’ income, people are increasingly focused on consumer needs at the spiritual level, traveling and traveling is a good way.
Especially on the “11” national holidays, the time is more abundant, people are more pleased to travel and consume, which can satisfy both the mental level of consumption needs as well as a reflection of the upgrading consumption of residents.

Inventing the month in the circle of friends, it is actually mid-Autumn today.
Wash a set of vineyards sent by friends, leave half to Boo, the rest is put in the favourite small pot and ends out to see the moon.
And Nana was sitting on the ground, and I ate the wine she ate the skin, and I swallowed the seeds of the vine with the power of a far away.
The moon is hidden in the clouds, and the moon is in the clouds, and the moon is in the darkness.
In my mind, various poems about the next month, I prefer to like this clearly: every three-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-f
Per we have given the moon a lot of emotions, for what I’m talking about now, in fact, that God’s word to God, Caesar’s word to Caesar is the best.
The moon is the moon, and the moon is the moon, the moon is the moon, the moon is the moon, the moon is the moon, the moon is the moon, the moon is the moon, the moon is the moon.
After eating the vineyards, this pack of cold moon is cold.
Nana had a small swallow at his feet, stood up, placed Nana’s little coat on the side of her small house, and Nana was gladly lying on it.
Open the door, crying: Is the bathing water burned?
From the window of the bathroom is not visible to the moon, only feel the color of the moon, turn off the lights of the bathroom and pull off the glass.
I didn’t eat moon bread or drink.

The United Nations awarded the Earth Guardians Prize for the “Mark Forest”
With a hot voice of praise and the music of recovery, the head of the “Mark Forest” project and the user representative of the “Mark Forest” came to the stage, receiving the 2019 United Nations Earth Guardians Prize from the hosts.
The 2019 Earth Guardians Prize ceremony was held in New York, USA, where hundreds of millions of people participate in the “Mark Forest” project, which has been awarded the “Inspiration and Action” prize, including the “Motivation and Action” prize.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Plan had announced the award winners list at its headquarters in Kenya’s capital Nairobi, but the people who attended the award ceremony were still excited.
In an interview with the New York Times, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Inoise Annoise, said “Mark Forest” is an exciting innovation that allows hundreds of millions of people to act to understand the environmental challenges facing humans and what humans can do for the environment.
It connects people and the environment using technology to allow each individual to participate in the action to protect the Earth, which will have a huge impact.
The “Mark Forest” launched in August 2016 by the Chinese Monkey Financial Services Group (called “Mark Gold”) on the payment platform, users accumulating “green energy” on their mobile phone by recording their everyday green travel in the “Mark Forest” and paying for water electricity online.
Each user who raises a virtual tree, “Mark Forest” and public interest partners will plant the next real tree in deserted areas.
As of August this year, 500 million “Mark Forest” users have reduced the cumulative carbon emissions of 79.2 million tons, planting 1.2 billion trees in deserted areas.
In the Earth Guardians Award awarded that day, Costa Rica was awarded for the national environmental efforts, and the award-winning Costa Rica President Carlos Alvarado praised the contribution of the “Mark Forest” on the site, “which inspired so many people to participate in the green action is impressive.”
The President and Chief Executive Officer of the World Guard Award is a confirmation of the “Mark Forest” project.
Technologies and open platforms make it possible to participate in low-carbon life, which belongs to all participants.
Fujian said the “Mark Forest” has affected 500 million people in the past three years and the aim of the “Mark Forest” in the next three years is to drive a billion people worldwide to participate in low-carbon actions.
While fighting desertification and protecting the environment, they also explore how farmer’s income is more derived from green water in Blue Mountains.
In addition to providing jobs through trees, we also want to help farmers increased income through agricultural products development projects, e-commerce platforms, etc.
The digital-based public-benefit environmental model created by “Murches Forest” also succeeded in getting off the sea and used by other countries.
In June this year, the Philippines’s largest electronic wallet, GCash, launched the Philippine version of the “Mark Forest”, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon life.
GCash will cooperate with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and Environmental Public Interest organizations, planning to launch 365,000 trees in the Philippines within a year.
The Earth Guardians Prize is the highest prize in the United Nations environment, which is awarded once a year.
The “Murf Forest” award was awarded by China’s Green Innovation Project for the third consecutive year, after the construction of China’s Sichemlin field, the “Kil Village Demonstration, Wuhan Village Removal” project, the “Inspiration and Action” award from China.
Economic friction affects the U.S. economy’s “scores”.
The U.S. economic "score" for the second quarter of this year showed a significant decline in private sector investments and exports and a significant slowdown in U.S. GDP growth compared to the previous quarter.
Analysts point out that trade friction and its uncertainty are the main cause of private sector investment and export declines in the second quarter.
The final amendment data published by the US Department of Commerce showed that the U.S. GDP in the second quarter increased by 2% per year, parallel to previously published amendment data, but significantly lower than 3.1% for one quarter.
Data show that consumption growth is a key factor in supporting US economic growth in the second quarter.
Personal consumption spending, accounting for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, increased by 4.6 percent during the period and pulled economic growth by 3.03 percent.
In addition, government consumption spending and investment pulled economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investments in the second quarter dropped 6.3% compared to the previous quarter, pulled the economic growth of 1.16 percentage points in the period; exports dropped 5.7% compared to the previous quarter, and net exports pulled the economic growth of 0.68 percentage points in the period.
Barry Knap, managing partner of the U.S. Ensayde Macroeconomic Consulting Company, said private sector investments not only failed to maintain the pace of growth last year, but also have seen a significant decline due to trade friction and increased uncertainty impacted corporate trust.
Knap believes that under the influence of policy uncertainty, U.S. corporate capital expenditure is expected to remain in a decline next year.
Analysts believe that despite consumer growth has formed strong support for the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are increasingly signs that trade friction and uncertainty resulting in has affected consumer confidence and has a negative impact on the U.S. consumption prospects.
Richard Coutin, professor of economics at the University of Michigan, said in a recent survey, 38% of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, a new high in a year and a half.
For future U.S. economic movements, analysts generally believe the U.S. economy will continue to slow down.
But experts say that if economic friction is alleviated, the performance of the U.S. industrial sector and financial markets would be improved.
British economist Catherine Burch, global economist, expects the future U.S. economy will continue the trend of gradual decline since this year, with growth to a lower level than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandy, Chief Economist of Moody Analysis, predicted that the U.S. economy will grow by 2.3 percent this year and further slower to 1.6 percent next year.
Alan Hahn, investment manager of Pattern Investment Company, noted that the company's most concerns are the economic trade disputes and the uncertainty resulting in, if the economic trade disputes can be resolved, uncertainty will significantly decrease, and the industry sector will perform much better than it is now.
Matt Miley, a stock strategist of Miller-Taback asset management company, said economic friction remains the “first problem” and also the main reason for the significant volatility of the US capital market this year, and whether the trade friction can be solved properly, will be key to affect the U.S. capital market movements in the rest of this year.
Parents from 0 to 3 years old and parents can leave 10 days a year.
The protection of women’s legitimate rights is a manifestation of respect and safeguarding human rights, and an important sign of the progress of social civilization.
On September 27th, at the 15th meeting of the 12th General Committee of the Ninjago Autonomous Region, the Regulation on the Protection of Women's Rights of the Ninjago Autonomous Region was adopted.
This is a local regulation issued by the first province of Ningxia, a comprehensive system for the protection of women’s legitimate interests, which will be officially implemented from November 1, 2019.
It is known that the Regulation was revised on the basis of the 2007 Ningxia Implementation of the Women's Rights Protection Act in the People's Republic of China, and is divided into chapters 9 65 including General rules, political rights, cultural education rights, labor and social security rights, property rights, human rights, marriage family rights, legal responsibilities, and Annexes.
In the Regulation, Ninja encourages exploring the implementation of couples’ parental leave, which is still the first in the country.
In April this year, the State Office issued by the Guidelines on the Promotion of the Development of Child Care Services for Children under the age of 3 had a relevant description of the parental parental.
In the process of revision of the Regulation, Ningsha proposed innovation “incentivating the user units for couples who have children in accordance with the laws and regulations, to give both couples a parental leave every ten days each year during the age of 0 to 3 years of their children.”
At the same time, the Regulation emphasizes anti-sexual harassment and protection of women minor.
Article 43 of the Regulation adopted the latest legislation in the current Civil Code of Personality Code of China, which simplifies the components of sexual harassment, the subjects and mechanisms of anti-sex harassment.
Article 44 of the Regulation is explicitly prohibited by violence against frequent sexual abuse of girls and requires educational institutions to perform relevant educational, protective and preventive work to become a new mark for protecting girls in local legislation.
With regard to the right of women to know and process the common property of the married family, Article 35 of the Regulation clearly specifies the right of women to know the common property and the obligations of the property registration agencies and entities concerned to provide a solid institutional support for women’s rights.
In addition, addressing the problem of gender discrimination in employment, Article 26 of the Regulation not only prohibits direct discrimination, but also orders the prohibition of indirect discrimination, and absorbs the latest experience in joint negotiating practices, enhancing the punishment of violations of gender discrimination and stronger protection of women’s legitimate rights.
In recent years, the Joint Public Prosecutor’s Office, Civil Affairs and other departments have been significant in promoting and introducing social professional forces to participate in marriage family conflict mediation and anti-family violence.
The Regulation summarizes and enhances this in several articles, encouraging the mobilization of social forces, gathering social resources together to protect women’s rights, and requiring people at the level of countryside to provide stable, institutional guarantees and support through purchasing services.

By the end of 2018, two provinces of Zhejiang and Yuanuan were essentially completed, allocating state capital of $158 billion and $185 billion respectively.
In addition to the trial provinces, other provinces also have successively carried out pre-transfer preparatory work, laying the basis for the next step of transfer implementation.
According to a joint printed announcement before the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Social Security, the Ministry of Human Resources, the State Finance, the Tax Directorate General and the Board of Directors, the work of the Central and Local Assembly of the Social Security Fund was fully launched in 2019 and is fundamentally completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on the same day specified the implementation of the full implementation of the transition work.
The conference emphasizes the need to be realistically efficiently implemented.
“According to the progress arrangement, the transfer work must be completed by the end of 2020.
Working time is hard, work is hard.”
Liu Kuan said the regions and departments need to be carefully organized and closely arranged to ensure the implementation of the processing work as requested; steady progress of the work, accurately determining the content of the processing policy; strengthen communication coordination and solve questions in time.
State funding for real social security funds — starting from the start point of the “filled social security funds” and the purpose is to provide strong support for pension security.
However, the writer believes that this was not a simple stock "physical transfer", but that launched a "matematical addition".
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, Human Services, State Finance, Tax Directorate, and the Board of Directors jointly published the Notice on the full launch of the work of the Social Security Fund, which clarifies the schedule of the National Social Security Fund, namely the central and local transfer of the State Capital Fund, the work of the Social Security Fund was fully launched in 2019.
After the publication of the documents, departments such as the Ministry of Finance were implemented soon.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10% of all shares of business banks and agricultural banks to the Social Security Fund, with the total value of the two shares exceeding $11.5 billion.
In accordance with the provisions, the social security funds such as the asset entities as a financial investor enjoys the right to profit, disclosure and information of the share in state ownership.
Workbank, Agriculture Bank said in a statement that this change in interests will not lead to changes in the bank’s owners and actual controllers.
In this regard, it is believed that a similar state-owned share shift is not a simple change in share-ownership, but that can trigger a series of effects of “additional operations”.
The first step of the “additional result” of some state-owned enterprises is naturally able to represent all people owned by state-owned enterprises, and developing results are shared by all people.
After years of reform development, state enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and areas in our economy, with the overall profitability is stronger and more stable.
In addition, the company has continued to do the best.
On July 10, the Permanent Meeting of the State Government decided that this year fully launched the work of the Social Security Fund for the transfer of part of the state-owned capital.
The Ministry of Finance subsequently said that it will be prepared to fully launch the work of the social security funds with the relevant departments, according to the implementation of the State’s Permanent Meeting, to fully reflect the basic pension insurance system’s intergenerational fairness and public sharing of the results of the development of state-owned enterprises.
The second step of the transition is to enhance the sustainability of the Social Security Fund and further strengthen the basis of the pension social security system.
With the age of the population, our social security funds are facing pressure, and this time as a transferred entity, the state funds mostly have continuous profitability and decrease capabilities, not only able to effectively supplement the social security fund, but also provide a source of living water to the social security funds.
The estimates show that every transfer of 3.8 percentage of state-owned capital can support a reduction of one percentage of the payments percentage for the corporate basic pension insurance.
The third step of the “additional result” of the transition is to increase the stabilizer for the capital markets.
The way the transfer entity to obtain profits at this time is "divided as the main, operating as a supplement".
The Social Security Fund, as a financial investor of state-owned capital, is actually primarily based on obtaining equity dividends.
However, social security funds, as a valuable investor in the capital market, have a stronger capital operating capacity.
For listed assets in state-owned capital, the Social Security Fund participates in holding shares, will further optimize the corporate legal governance structure, facilitating the level of operations of the company, having a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the Social Security Fund, as a target of investment, holds an increase in stock weight, contributing to further enhancing its influence on the market and plays the role of a “stabilizer” in the market.
In addition, it is also favorable to fully exploit the “value detection” function of institutional investors, guiding investors’ reasonable investments and value investments.

Iran confirmed developing advanced decoction machine to further suspend implementation of Iran's nuclear deal
According to the Central Agency, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on 26 September that Iran has once again violated the Iranian nuclear agreement using advanced decoctions.
It is that Iran is gradually breaking the restrictions of the Iranian nuclear deal in response to U.S. President Trump withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal in May 2018, restoring and strengthening sanctions against Iran.
Iran has suspended two other promises in July to keep the storage of concentrated potassium under 300 kg, as well as the purity of concentrated potassium not exceeding 3.67%, and further action is now taken.
Under the nuclear agreement, Iran has only installed about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 disconnectors in Natanz to accumulate uranium concentration, and only allowed Iran to use a small number of more advanced models for research, but does not produce uranium concentration.
If Iran succeeded in developing more advanced decoctions, it would be able to produce concentrated potassium at several times faster, possibly for the production of nuclear bombs.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, “On September 25, the agency confirmed the Iranian development and development of advanced decoctions of Model 2 and Model 3 ... are accumulating or ready to accumulate potassium.”
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency submitted the report to member states on 26th, and a diplomat responded: “They are busy with (Natanz concentration) facilities.”

The first 100-degree self-driving taxi team starts test operations
Yesterday, Century announced in Nagasaki that the self-driving taxi team Robotaxi test operations were officially launched.
The first 45 Apollo’s “Red Flag EV” Robotaxi team, developed jointly with a Red Flag, began testing in the open test route in the Long-Sand part.
From the same day, ordinary citizens can log in Apollo’s Application to become seed user and have the opportunity to try the experience.
A experienced passenger said he was sitting in the back row of the vehicle, clicking on the front screen of the passenger seat and launching the vehicle’s auto-driving journey with one click.
In the vehicle, for the safety of passengers and current policy requirements, the vehicle is tested to equip a safety member in the driving seat to maximize the safety of passengers.
During the course of driving, the vehicle can perform intelligent shifts according to the road situation, can also judge the driving situation of the surrounding vehicle and automatically avoid situations such as near-distance supercar.
During the experience, the passenger area screen shows real-time trails of pedestrians, cars, and even some traditional blind areas on the road.
Even if the vehicle is blocked, information such as red-green light changes in the front and waiting time can be seen in advance, all the vehicle's status can be seen.
No driver has heard on TV before thinking it is far away from us, but it feels magical today to find it in our lives.
We expect it to truly enter the lives of the people in the future.
In June 2019, Apollo obtained 45 portable test licenses issued by the Gongsha City Government.
Currently, Shanghai's auto-driving test open road, the road manager of Shanghai's artificial intelligence technology city, Meiji Lake, Ocean Lake, Grand Wang Mountains, High New District etc. the entire length reaches 135 km, the sample area reaches 70 square kilometers, is currently China's longest road miles, the largest area, covering the scene most complex, road synergy infrastructure with the most advanced smart driving sample area.
By the end of 2019, the Apollo Robotaxi team will cover approximately 50 km of the trial route in Nagasaki, and it is scheduled to cover the 135 km of the route currently open in Nagasaki in the first half of 2020.

On 27 afternoon Beijing time, the Chinese women's team hosted the ninth match of the 2019 Women's World Cup, the opponent for strong Dutch women's team, finally the Chinese women's team 3:1 defeated the Dutch women's team, welcoming the Women's World Cup nine victories.
However, after-match coach Ranjing continues to express dissatisfaction with the team’s performance in the third place.
“The third side strengthens the balling aggressivity, and some of us (the first generation) are less than one who can’t get the ball, and we are mistaken very much.”
“Fighting with the team, making mistakes so much, it’s hard.”
He said in an interview after the race.
“We told the team to focus, we are not attacked, we need to improve the adjustment, and we need to defend each other.”
Mr. Wang also commented on the performance of Xi Jinping, saying she had some difficulties in the attack, rather hurry, too wanted to kill the ball, and the action would deform.
I hope she had a little patience, “We all give her protection.”
China’s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
White Book: China’s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
China’s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
The White Paper says that as China’s integrated national and international influence rapidly increases, some internationally concerned that China would go the path of “the power of the country” and some have presented the so-called “China threatening theory”.
This has both cognitive misleading, deep-rooted prejudice, and the mental imbalance of power to eliminate, and the intentional distortion of the preservation of their own interests.
Realising the nation’s wealth, national revival, the happiness of the people is both the dream of the Chinese people and the common dream of the people of the countries.
“China’s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.”
The White Book notes that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, China's technological innovation injects new drivers for world economic growth, and the role of the stabilizer and power source of the future Chinese economy is more accentuated.
Today’s global economic growth is insufficient, and a stable Chinese economy is increasingly important to the world.
China’s economy is moving from high-speed growth to high-quality development, new types of industrialization, information, urbanization, agricultural modernization accelerates progress, economic structure depth adjustment, industry optimization continues upgrades, new economic growth points are constantly emerging.
“The McKenzie Global Institute’s research reports that by 2040, the integration of China and the rest of the world’s economies is expected to create $22 trillion to $37 trillion in economic value, equivalent to 15% to 26% of the global economy, and strengthening cooperation between the rest of the world and China will create huge economic value.”
The White Book emphasizes that the Chinese economy and the world economy have undertaken structural changes and deep integration.
Economic operations more stable, higher quality of growth and long-term growth prospects of China are beneficial for the global economic development in the long term.
Considering China's economic development as a "threat" and "challenge", trying to pull China out of the global industrial chains, supply chains, and value chains, making China "deconnected" with the world economy, both impossible and harmful.
The White Paper points out that the full-scale open to the outside creates more opportunities for countries to share "China interests".
China has the most potential consumer market in the world, China is the most attractive investment destination, a larger scale “go out” to benefit more countries.
“Openness should be bilateral, mutually beneficial, not one-way, and one-way beneficial.
Mutual benefits can last for a long time.”
The White Paper says China is committed to continuing to expand imports, expand market access, improve business environment, strengthen intellectual property protection, and other countries should also expand its openness, take appropriate initiatives and try to improve their business environment.
Only if the parties act in the opposite direction, they can create an open, inclusive, universal, balanced, jointly win-win development environment, jointly make the “cake” of development the larger, forming a community of interests that are mutually beneficial.
The White Book notes that China provides more public products to the international community.
Includes promoting high-quality co-construction of one belt and one way, building multilateral dialogue and cooperation platforms, actively participating in international and regional affairs and actively implementing external aid.
“China has grown to the benefit of the international community, and never forget to return to the international family, providing more better public products to the international community.”
Andrei Slepniov, Director General of the Russian Export Center, recently in a written interview with the New China Reporter, said that Russia is willing to strengthen cooperation with China in the economic area, further optimize export structure and promote diversification of Russia's exports to China.
Slepniov noted that forests, machinery and chemical industry occupies a relatively large proportion of Russian exports to China, while exports of agricultural products are also important, including oil products, meat products and dairy products, as well as grain, fish and sea products, and so on.
In recent years, Russian exports of non- raw materials and non-energy products to China have also shown a good stability of development.
Speaking of Russia’s optimization of export structures to China, Slepniov said Russia has set up a task to expand the exports of high-tech products to meet the demand for imports of high-tech products from countries and regions in the world, including China.
Russia will further improve financial and non-financial support measures to promote further growth in the number of high-tech enterprises.
Slepniov said Russia is willing to export construction technologies and high-tech construction materials to China and develop cooperation with China in pharmaceutical and aviation manufacturing.
Russia has a great cooperation potential in urban environmental development.
He stressed that Russia’s products in many fields have “quality advantages and competitive in terms of prices” compared to similar products in the West.
Speaking of the two countries' goals to $20 billion bilateral trade by 2024, Slepniov said that agriculture, machinery, chemical industry and forestry will play an important role in achieving this goal.
Russia intends to promote supply diversification in these fields and promote exports of deep-processed products.
He stressed that Russia is intending to push its exporters into the global value chain, where China is one of the directions of development.
Russian manufacturers in agriculture, metallurgy, oil and chemical fields are fully capable of participating in this process.
Currently, the two countries need to further deepen cooperation between the companies, “the establishment of more Russian-Chinese joint ventures and joint development of exports to third countries.”
Slepniov said the Russian Export Center is taking a number of measures and services through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Import and Export Bank to support Russian products to Chinese exports.
At the same time, the Russian Export Centre will continue to deepen cooperation with China's related sectors to facilitate the entry of Russian goods to the Chinese market and develop new types of export products to China.

Make Chinese citizens “go out” more confident — Visit the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Consulate Headquarters
Wherever you go, your homeland is behind you.
On 25th, the Prime Minister of Foreign Ministry's Consulate Protected Public Interest Short Film, which ended the Short Film, caused the noise of a wide range of internet users.
Foreign Ministry's Consulate Head of Foreign Ministry, Tue-Ei, said in an interview with new news agency, the short film aims to make people feel the emotions and temperatures of “diplomacy as a people” and to make Chinese citizens feel that, regardless of what they are in the world, Chinese diplomats will stretch their help and give help, strength and hope.
Peace abroad is not a small issue, a general concern.
In the past 70 years, the number of Chinese citizens have increased dramatically, from “not a million a year” before the reform opening to today’s hundreds of millions of people annually; at the same time, Chinese citizens are more secure to travel abroad, and consular protection and assistance work is also expanded from overseas to various groups such as China, visitors, foreign students, business workers.
According to statistics, since the party’s eighteenth anniversary, our organization has implemented more than ten major actions to evacuate or transfer Chinese citizens abroad, and have evacuated more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and turbulent areas.
Approximately 500,000 cases of all kinds of aid are accepted and coordinated, involving one million Chinese citizens.
In dangerous moments, the homeland can take you home; wanting to go on a “thinking-to-go travel” is no longer a dream.
By the end of August, China has signed a visa exemption agreement with 14 countries covering ordinary passports.
Moreover, more and more countries unilaterally provide Chinese citizens with facilities for entry, such as visa-free or landing visa.
Thailand, Egypt, 42 countries and regions are unilaterally granted landscape visa to Chinese citizens with ordinary passports, and 15 countries and regions including Indonesia are unilaterally allowed visa-free entry to Chinese citizens with ordinary passports.
In addition to visa-free and landing visa arrangements, visa application for Chinese citizens is increasingly convenient and the procedure is increasingly simplified.
By the end of August, China has reached an agreement or agreement with 41 countries to simplify the visa procedure.
These include the agreement between the United States, Canada, Israel and Argentina with each other, the issuance of a 10-year valid multiple visa agreement between business personnel and the UK with each other travel, business and family visitors.
The UK and Belgium jointly launched the “Visa One Station” service, with France, Italy and Singapore, respectively, shortened visa acceptance time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours.
For business people who are frequently overseas, multiple entry and convenient connections with APEC business travel cards are not a good choice.
Holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining five-year visa to 16 economies around Asia-Pacific, which is important for business people, especially private enterprises.
Currently, China is the first place in APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreement to encourage more countries to take visa facilitating measures for Chinese citizens, to further transform the outcome of diplomatic work into human rights initiatives, and to constantly improve the ‘gold content’ of Chinese passports.

The stars disperse light and heat, which is because the energy generates when hydrogen atoms combine (or fuse) together to form heavier elements.
Scientists are currently committed to creating a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
However, this is a difficult problem to solve. It takes many years to see a practical fusion reactor built.
Due to the effect of surface tension, steel needles can float on the surface of the water.
The cause of surface tension is the strong attraction between the water molecules, which is greater than the attraction between the water molecules and the air molecules above.
The water molecules form a layer of invisible outer skin on the surface of the water, which allows something like needles to float on the surface of the water.
Modern sliding shoes are double sliding, with a hole between sliding and sliding. The sliding slides have better grip on ice (even when bending).
Because the bottom of the knife is slightly curved, when the knife is distorted towards one side of it, the side of the knife in contact with ice is curved.
In this way, the iceberg can turn. The iceberg bends to the right, the iceberg bends to the right. The iceberg bends to the left, and the iceberg bends to the left.
They need to eliminate the excess energy from the light to return to previous energy levels.
They do this by sending a small light particle known as “photons”.
Scientists call this process “radiation radiation” because the atoms are stimulated by strong light, causing the emission of photons, and light is also a kind of radiation.
The next image shows the situation in which the atoms emit the photons. Of course, the photons are actually much smaller than they appear on the image.
The photons are even smaller than the matter that make up the atoms!
After hundreds of hours of use, the lamp was finally burned and the lamp was not lighted.
Then you need to replace the lamp. When replacing the lamp, you need to operate carefully.
First, make sure to turn off the switch of the lighting lamp or turn off the cable.
This is because when the lamp is also partly connected to the plug, when you are in touch with the inside of the plug or the metal bottom of the bulb, the current will flow into the plug (the connection of the bulb metal bottom of the plug) and you will get a severe electric shock.

The teeth of the triangle can not only bite the leaves, but also bite very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that the triangle is eaten by steel, and steel is a very common plant in the White Age.
These plants look like a small palm tree, the crown of the crown is made up of wrap-like leaves.
Before eating the tree, the triangle dragon removes the leaves with its powerful mouth.
Other scientists believe these plants are poisonous, so dinosaurs are unlikely to eat them, even now trees and other animals such as chicken (the descendants of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How much will the gravity affect me? if you stand on the surface of the gravity, your weight will be lighter than on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 pounds) on Earth weighs about 36 pounds (16 pounds) on a wooden guard.
The sun cannot stand above the shell like the Earth.The entire sun is made up of gas, fire, and other ion bodies.

Let’s first explain the plans of Italy: Italy is essentially belonging to Germany and Japan’s “small brothers”.
The country's army and navy were both weak, despite the construction of four new ships shortly before the start of the war.
Italy's main target is African countries. To capture these countries, they need a military base so that the armies can travel through the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
For this, they had to withdraw British bases and vessels from Egypt. In addition to taking these actions, Italian vessels shouldn’t have any action.
Just like the UK, Japan is an island country.
The submarines are a vessel designed to run under the water and the submarines stay under the water for longer.
Submarines were used during World War I and World War II. Their speed was slow, and the scope of shooting was very limited.
At the beginning of the war, they floated mostly on the sea level, but with the radar development and improved precision, the submarines were forced to divide under the water so that they could not be discovered.
German submarines are known as U-type submarines. The Germans are very good in navigating and operating submarines.
Because the Germans were successful in submarines, they did not receive a large number of submarines after the war.

Learning to create interactive media requires conventional traditional skills, as well as tools to be mastered in interactive courses ( storyboard production, audio and video editing, storyboard design, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to re-evaluate the assumptions about media production and learn non-linear thinking.
The interactive design requires each component of the project interconnected, but can also exist as an independent entity.
The disadvantage of the focusing lens is that to a certain focus range, the required focus complexity and the number of transparent lens components is far greater than the focusing lens.
As the lens manufacturers reach higher standards in the production of lens, this is no problem.
This allows the focal lens to take photos compared to the quality of the fixed focal lens.
Another disadvantage of the focusing lens is that the maximum light circuit (speed) of the lens is usually smaller.
This makes cheap focal lens difficult to use in poor light conditions without a flashlight.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie to a DVD format is overscanning.
Most TV shows are made for entertainment.
For this reason, the edges of the screen you see on the TV, including the top, bottom and side, are cut off.
This is done to ensure that the image can cover the entire screen. This is called “excess scanning”.
Unfortunately, when you create a DVD, its boundaries are likely to be cut off, and if the headline in the video is too close to the bottom, the headline will also appear incomplete.
This traditional medieval castle has long inspired people’s imagination, combining the images of the horse backbone, the party, and the spirit of the Knights of King Arthur.
Even standing in the ruins of thousands of years, people can easily remember the voices and smells of a war that has already passed, they can almost hear the collision of a stone on a stone, and smell the smell of fear coming from the cave.
But does our imagination have a real basis? why first build castles? how were they designed and built?
As a typical architecture of that time, the castle of Muxloe was a real castle, rather than a fixed house.
Its large glass windows and thin walls cannot resist a strong attack for a long time.
In the 15th 1980s, when Lord Hastings began to build the castle, the country was relatively peaceful and only needed to defend a small group of robbers who walked around.
The balance of power is the system of European countries seeking to maintain the sovereignty of all European countries.
The idea is that all European countries must manage to prevent a country/region from becoming strong alone, and therefore, governments often change allies in order to maintain balance.

The Indian River Civilization is a bronze age civilization, located in the northwestern subcontinent of India, covering most of the modern Pakistan, as well as some of the northwestern India and northeast Afghanistan.
Civilization of the Indian River Bay has prospered, and this civilization has become famous for it.
Although some scientists argue that this civilization exists in the now-drying Saraswati river, it is exactly the same as the "India-Saraswati river civilization", some call it the "Civilization of Halapa" - the first site that was discovered in the region in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire promoted the progress and development of medicine.
Emperor Augustus began recruiting doctors and even formed the first Roman medical team for post-war medical use.
Surgeons are well aware of a variety of sedatives, including melatonin extracted from the seeds of melatonin and melatonin extracted from the seeds of melatonin.
In addition to blocking blood flow using blockbands and arteries, they have been skillfully able to rescue malignant patients through the limbs.

It can be customized to read and can also use more or less colors according to the need.
“Attention deficiency” is a nervous system syndrome with three typical limited symptoms including impulse, distraction of attention, overmotion or excess energy.
This is not a lack of learning skills, but a learning barrier; it affects 3% to 5% of all American children, and it may be up to 2 million.”
Children with multiple dynamics have difficulty focusing on work, such as doing work, but they can focus on doing things they like, such as playing games, watching favorite cartoons, or writing sentences that don’t add point symbols.
These children often get into a lot of trouble. Because normal methods cannot stimulate their brain, to stimulate their brain, they "do dangerous behaviors, struggle, challenge authority."
Attention Deficiency Disorder (ADD) can affect the relationship of sick children with their peers because other children are unable to understand why patients behave, write and understand why their maturity is different.
When the acquisition of knowledge and the ability to learn changes as described above, the basic rate of acquisition of knowledge also changes accordingly.
The way to obtain information is not the same. Stress is no longer present in personal memories, but the ability to remember text becomes more important.
The Renaissance has made significant changes from the way learning and knowledge is fundamentally transmitted.
The place where primitive humans differ from other ancient animals is that they are no longer moving bodies with their hands, carrying heavy things, and wandering in the woods.
The size and length of the shampoo legs are similar, reflecting the fact that the hands are used to weigh weight in the finger back walk.
Man’s hands are shorter than the feet and the bones of the finger.
Two to three million years ago, hand bone fossils have undergone changes in the characteristics of the hand, from moving to operating.
Some people think that often doing artificial inspired and clear dreams is exhausting.
The main cause of this phenomenon is that clear dreams extend the time interval between rapid eye movements.
The shorter the rapid eye motion period (REM) is every night, the less the frequency of sleeping in this state and recovering the mood, the body may have problems.
It’s just as tired as watching TV every twenty-three minutes.
Its effect depends on the frequency of your brain sleeping awake every night.
The Italian situation in North Africa was almost not ideal from the beginning. On June 10, 1940, less than a week after Italy declared war, the 11th Light Rider occupied Capsburg, Libya.

The competition was carried out on the grass, the grass around the hole was cut shorter, known as the fruit corners.
Per the most common type of tourism is what most people think about when they think about tourism: recreational tourism.
This means people go to a completely different place for relaxation and entertainment from their daily lives.
Beaches, theme parks and campings are usually the most frequently visited places for recreational tourists.
If a person visits a particular place is to understand its history and culture, then this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Visitors may visit different landmarks in a specific country, or may focus on visiting only one area.
Seeing this activity, the colonists also asked for increased assistance.
Forces supporting the front positions include the New Hampshire 1 and 3 of 200 people, commanded by Colonel John Stark and Colonel James Reed (also later became general).
Stark's soldiers stand the defence fence station along the north end of the colonial position.
At the backdrop, the mysterious river flowing along the north-east of the peninsula opened a gap, and they quickly built a short stone wall, stretching the wall to the small beach on the north end of the coast.
Gridley or Stark placed a wooden plate at 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the bar and ordered not to fire before the official army passed.
The United States plans to launch synergy attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadward will launch an attack on the British Guard of the city of Biden, transferring the enemy's attention to block any enhancement forces.
General James Wayne, a 700-military crossing the Trenton Passport, occupied the bridges on the Gulf of the Assembly, blocking the routes of the enemy's escape.
The main forces of 2400 people will cross the river 9 miles north of Trenton, then divided into two groups, a group commanded by Greene, a group commanded by Sullivan to start the attack before the dawn.
Switching from a quarter mile to a half mile race, speed becomes less important, and endurance becomes an absolute important factor.
Of course, to become a top half-mile runner (when run in two minutes), you need to be fast enough and develop endurance at any cost.
During the winter, the workout for the top half of the body can be fully prepared for the running season.
Only proper nutrition practice is not enough to create excellent performance, but this can significantly affect the overall health of young athletes.
Keeping a healthy energy balance, adhering to the habit of effective supplementing water, understanding the various aspects of the reasonable use of nutritional supplements, can help athletes improve performance and increase exercise pleasure.
Medium running is a relatively low-cost exercise; however, participants have a lot of misconceptions about the number of equipment needed.
You can buy products as needed, but most products have almost no actual impact on performance.
Athletes may think they tend to a product, although this product is not useful.
Atoms can be regarded as one of the basic components of all matter.
According to the simplified Pol model, it is a very complex entity that contains a central atomic nucleus surrounded by electrons, which are a bit like a planet running around the Sun.
The atomic nucleus consists of both particles of neutrons and protons.
The protons have positive electricity, the neutron does not carry electricity. The electron has negative electricity.
To check the victim, you must first inspect the site and ensure your safety.

Studies found that depression, fear, and the feelings that catastrophizing the disease played a mediator in pain and disability in patients with back pain.
Only the influence of anxiety and mindfulness, rather than the influence of frustration and fear, can be performed regularly regularly weekly structural exercises.
People who participate in regular training need more support in the passive perception of pain to help them distinguish between chronic pain and discomfort from normal physical exercises.
The visual or visual ability depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, i.e. the eyes.
There are many types of eye structures, and their complexity depends on the needs of the organism.
Different structures have different functions, sensitive to different wavelengths and different intensity. They also require different processing methods to understand input and require different quantities of input to the best effect.
A population refers to the collection of certain species of organisms within a specific geographic area.
When all individuals in the group are completely identical in a particular type of character, it is called single type.
When an individual shows several variants of a particular nature form, they are multidisciplinary.
The marriage and construction of the army worms are also divided into different stages.
During the migration phase, monkeys walked at night and stopped during the day to camp.
When the food available is reduced, the worms will encounter a migration period. At this stage, the worms will build a temporary hole that is replaced daily.
This pedestrian cross-country behavior lasts about 17 days each time.
The word cell comes from the Latin “cella”, meaning “small room”, originally created by microscopists who observed soft wood structures.
Cells are the basic component units of all organisms, and all organisms are made up of one or more cells.
In fact, cells have such a fundamental and critical position in biological research that they are often referred to as “the basic units of life”.
The nervous system keeps blood flow smooth by sending nervous pulses to the whole body, thusining the balance in the body.
These nerve pulses can be transmitted to the whole body very quickly, allowing the body to be free from any potential threat.
The area of the dragon storm attack is smaller than other severe storms, but can destroy everything on the way.
The dragon wind can raise the trees roots, break the wooden plate on the buildings and throw the car into the sky. Two percent of the dragon winds are the most intense and can last for more than three hours.
These monster-like storms, wind speed up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
For thousands of years, humans have been producing and using larger mirrors.
However, the first real telescope was manufactured in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two transparent mirrors to make the distant objects look both close and large.
Avidity and selfishness are always with us, and the essence of collaboration is that short-term selfish behavior can always bring more benefits when most people benefit.
Hopefully most people will realize that, in the long term, collaborating with others is the best option.
Many people dream that humans could one day migrate to other planets and explore other worlds.Some people wonder what the universe is; some people believe there could be alien or other life on other planets.
But if this really happens, it is likely that it won’t happen again for a long time. These stars are very dispersed, “neighboring” stars are billions of miles away.
Per one day, your descendants will live in alien worlds and guess what kind of life their ancient ancestors had.
Animals are made up of many cells.The animals are digestive in the body after eating food. Most animals can move.
Only animals have a brain (but not all animals have a brain, for example, watermelons have no brain).
There are images of animals in every corner of the earth. Some of them excavate underground caves, some float in the ocean, and some float in the sky.
Cells are the smallest structural and functional units in various organisms.
The word cell comes from the Latin cella (that means a small room).
Observing organisms under a microscope, you will find that they are made up of small squares or small balls.
British biologist Robert Hooke saw some small squares hidden in soft wooden cages using a microscope.
They look like a room. He was the first person to observe dead cells.
Elements and compounds can change matter when chemical changes occur.
Gas nitrogen still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen density is greater, but the molecule remains the same.
Another example is water.The compound water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atoms.
Whether it is gas, liquid or solid, its molecular structure is the same.
Although its physical condition may change, the chemical condition remains unchanged.
Time is around us and affects everything we do, but it’s hard to understand.
For thousands of years, time has been the subject of research by religious, philosophy and scientists.
The time we experience is a series of events from the future to the present to the past.
Time is also the way we use to compare the duration (length) of events.
You can record the passage of time by observing repeated cyclic events. Cyclic events refers to what happens regularly again and again.
Today we use computers to process images and videos.
Complex animations can be built on computers, and this type of animation is increasingly applied to TV and movies.
When recording music is often processed with a complex computer and mix the sound together.
For a long time in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, people thought the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maori, who hunted a large bird called a terrible bird.
Then the theory established this point of view: the Maori migrated from Polynesia on the “big boat” and took New Zealand from the Maorians, and established an agricultural society.
But new evidence suggests that the Moriorians belong to the mainland Maurians who moved from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands to develop their own unique culture of worship and peace.
There is another tribe on the Chatham Islands, which are the Maorians who have passed from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriorians. Some small conflicts have occurred, and finally Morians have been exterminated.
People who have participated in decades have helped us recognize our advantages and enthusiasm, while honestly assessing difficulties and even failures.
When listening to stories that others share their individual, family, and organizations, we have a valuable understanding of the past and of some people who have a good or bad influence on organizational culture.
While understanding history does not mean understanding culture, it can at least help people understand their place in organizational history.
When summarizing success and failure, individuals and all participants will have a deeper understanding of the organizational values, mission and drivers.
In this case, reviewing previous entrepreneurial behavior and achieving success can help people stay open to new changes and new directions of local churches.
Such success stories relieve people’s fear of change while creating positive tendencies for future change.
Assembly thinking patterns are skills to solve problems by combining different ideas or fields to find solutions.
This thinking pattern emphasizes speed, logic and accuracy, as well as distinction of facts, reapplications of existing technologies, and collection of information.
The most important factor in this thinking pattern is: the right answer is only one. You just need to consider two answers, right or wrong.
This thinking pattern is not associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People of this type of thinking have logical thinking, are able to remember patterns, solve problems, and also perform scientific tests.
So far, humans are the best species to read the thoughts of others.
This means we are able to successfully predict the perceptions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge or desires of others.
In these abilities, understanding the intentions of others is crucial. We can understand the two-dimensional issues that physical behavior may be expressed through this ability.
For example, if you see someone broke a car window, you are likely to think that this person steals a car from strangers.
If he lost the key of his car and tried to open the door of his car, it might be different.
The magnetic synthesis is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic synthesis (NMR), which was discovered by Felix Broch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Persel (from Harvard University) in the 1930s.
In this vibration, the magnetic fields and radio waves cause the atom to emite weak radio signals.
In 1970, PhD and research scientist Raymond Damadian discovered the basic principle of using magnetic synthesis as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was approved, the world’s first patent in the field of nuclear magnetic synthesis.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the manufacture of the first “full-body” nuclear magnetic resonance scanner, he called it “non-sensitive”.
Transitional communication allows people to have time to think about the reactions of others and to respond.
This allows students to learn at their own rhythm and control the rhythm of transmission of teaching information.
Furthermore, due to flexible working hours, time restrictions are less likely to be implemented. - Brummer, 1998
Students can use the Internet and the World Wide Web to access information at any time.
Students can also submit the question to the teacher at any time of the day and expect quick answers within a reasonable time without waiting until the next interview.
Postmodernist learning methods give people absolute freedom.There is no method of learning that is a good method of learning.
In fact, nothing requires specific learning. Learning behavior occurs when the learners experience the presentation of knowledge.
This is what we have now revealed in all our experiences with DIY, displaying information, and learning as main content television shows.
Many of us find TV shows that we are watching tell us a certain process or experience, but we never participate or apply this knowledge.
We will never repair a car, we will not build a fountain in the back yard, we will not go to Peru to explore ancient remains, we will not repair neighbors’ houses.
Thanks to the subsea light cable and broadband satellites connected to Europe, Greenland’s networks are connected and 93% of the population have access to the Internet.
Your hotel or tenant (if you live in a private or private house) may be equipped with Wi-Fi or connected computer. All accommodation points have a bar or a place with public Wi-Fi.
As mentioned above, although the term "Eskimo" is still acceptable in the United States, many non-American citizens in the Arctic region, especially for Canadians, believe that the word has a degradation meaning.
Although you may hear the word Greenland people use, foreigners should avoid using it.
In Canada, native residents of Greenland called themselves In-Newts, and in Greenland they called themselves Kalaalleq (replicated as Kalaallit), meaning "Greenans".
In Greenland, crime and bad behavior against foreigners in general is almost unknown. Even in cities there are no “crime high-quality zones”.
Cold may be the only real danger for those who are unprepared.

Researchers from the University of Princeton and the University of Upsala, Sweden, that the new species evolved only two generations, despite the fact that the process takes longer, due to the breeding between the local characteristic Darwin nests and the outdoors.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into seeds, used to be rounded and folded. It can also be tapped or shaped into pieces.
It can be made very thin, adhesive to other metals, and due to achieving so thin, it can sometimes be used to decorate hand painting in a bookbook known as "colored hand copies".
This is known as the pH value of a chemical substance. You can make indicators using red-glass juice.
The color of the milk juice will change depending on the acidity of the chemical substances.
The pH value is represented by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the measured chemical.
Hydrogen ion is the proton of the lost electron (because the hydrogen atom is composed of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders to mix them and then wrap them into a ball with a clean wet hand.
The water in your hand reacts with the outer layer, forming a layer of something like the outer shell, it feels very interesting.
Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, the two cities have a drainage barrel almost every household, which is connected to a precision wastewater treatment system.
The remains of the drainage system have been found in houses on the Greek island of Crete and the city of Santorini.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persian and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were all part of a mixed public bathroom for men and women.
If you call someone far from a thousand miles away, you will be using the satellite.
After the satellite in space received a call, it almost immediately reflected it back.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere causes some light and vision distorsions.
To send a satellite or telescope into space, it takes a giant rocket over 100 feet tall.
The wheels have changed the world in incredibly ways.The biggest contribution to our wheels is to make our transport more convenient.
With it, we have trains, cars and many other means of transport.
Below are more medium-sized cats, which are eaten by medium-sized hunters, which are eaten from rabbits, sheep to turtles.
Finally, there are many small cats (including distributed pet cats) that feed a lot more small hunter, such as insects, toothbrushes, pets and birds.
The secret to their success is the Leicester concept, each cat is responsible for a special job to prevent them from competing with other cats.
The lions are the most obvious cats-cats-cats of population properties and live in large groups known as the lions.
The lions are composed of a single-three adult male with only relatives, as well as up to thirty females and infants.
As sisters and daughters in the family, women are usually close relationships with each other.
The behavior of the lions is very similar to the wolves or dogs. These animals are amazingly similar to the behavior of the lions (but different from other large cats), and these behaviors are also very fatal for their hunting.
The tiger is a all-power athlete who climbs (although the climbing ability is not very strong), swim, jumping away, and can reach five times the strongest man.
Tigers and lions, leopards and American tigers belong to the same species (leopards). These four large cats are the only cats to cry.
The tiger's wrath is not as deep as the wrath of the lion, but more like a word of angry crying.
The cats like to eat small animals. If the conditions allow, they catch monkeys, snakes, teeth animals and birds. The cats of cats are almost much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe American cats are tracking and searching for animals to catch by smell and scenting traces of hunters on the ground.
Their night vision is strong, clearly visible in darkness, and act secretly.The way of catching is first integrated into the surrounding environment, and then pushing to the hunting.
When a small group of creatures (a small group) separates from their main populations (e.g. cross mountains and rivers, or they arrive on a new island so that it is impossible to get back easily), they usually find the environment they live different from before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so new species will need different characteristics or adaptability to become a powerful competitor rather than those they needed before.
The original populations have not changed at all and they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
Over time, new species begin to adapt to new environments and they begin to become increasingly different from other species.
Thousands or even millions of years later, the two species eventually appear quite different so that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process "species formation", that is, the formation of new species. Species formation is an inevitable result of evolution and also an extremely important part of evolution.
Plants can produce oxygen that humans inhale and absorb carbon dioxide called by humans.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through cooperation with light. They can also provide cooling.
We make homes with plants, we make clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
He was the top chasing of that time, and he was not afraid of anything except the same.
It is covered with more than 70 kniv-like teeth, and there is a line on it. This means anything you encounter with it is not possible to escape.
Its tongue may be crossed, and we are uncertain about it. Its food includes turtles, large fish, and other dragons, and even eat people.
It will attack anything entering the water; even giant dinosaurs like the Dragon are not its opponents.
Although most of the Romans’ food is common to us, they actually have some strange or unusual party dishes, including wild pigs, beefs, beefs, and an animal called a sleeping mouse.
Another difference is that the poor and women are sitting on a chair to eat, while the rich people like to gather together to celebrate parties and to eat on the side.
Centuries later, food imported to Europe from America or Asia could not appear in the diet of ancient Romans.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes and cocoa, and no ancient Romans had eaten corn.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods and viewed it as the residence of the gods.
People will offer sacrifices to God, and the priests will satisfy God’s needs through rituals and celebrations.
Each temple has a courtyard open to the outside, and a home where only priests can enter.
Some special pyramid-shaped towers, known as the Pyramid Tower, were built as part of the temple.
The tower is God’s special holy place.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house is not so important.
Most of the lives of the Hebrew family were spent outside.
Women cook in the courts; the store is actually an open closet towards the streets. They built houses with stones.
Canaan has no large forest, so wood is very expensive.
Greenland people smoke rarely. According to the Northern Sphosachah recorded that the red barber Eric was deported from Iceland for murder, he navigated west to discover the land and then named it Greenland.
But regardless of what he discovered, the Eskimo people had already lived there at the time.
Although all belong to Scandinavia, there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the film National Treasures, you might think the back of the Declaration of Independence was painting a treasure picture.
However, the fact is not the case. Although the back of this document is written something, it is not a treasure picture.
The original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776 is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
While no one can determine who the author was, this large sheep paper document (size 293⁄4 inches multiplied by 241⁄2 inches) was alleged to be rolled up and stored when it was just written.
Therefore, it is possible that this symbol is just added as a label.
Normandy landing and subsequent battle liberated northern France, but the south is still not liberated.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French. These French reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940, not against the invasors, but cooperating with them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied forces invaded southern France, the attack was called the Dragon Horse Operation.
In just two weeks, the US and Free France armies liberated southern France and moved to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a group (social) of people who live and work together.
The word “civilis” comes from the Latin “civilis” (meaning “city”) and related to the Latin “civis” (meaning “city”) and “civitas” (meaning “city” or “city”), which also somehow defines the scale of society.
Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge to generations, the traces of culture are preserved, and the culture is able to spread fairly.
Culture of ethnic minorities often does not leave relevant historical evidence disappear, and is not considered as such civilization.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Federal Regulation (the Congress was its only component).
Congress has no authority to tax, and because there is no national administrative or judicial department, Congress can only rely on the state government to implement all laws, while the state government often does not cooperate.
It does not have the power to abolish taxes and tariffs between states.
These provisions must be consensus of all states to be amended, and the state approach to the central government is so slow that their state representatives are frequently absent.
Italian national football teams and German national football teams are the second most successful teams in the world, won the World Cup of Football in 2006.
Popular sports projects include football, basketball, basketball, waterball, sword shooting, basketball, bicycle, iceball, skateboarding basketball and first-level equation racing cars.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions where Italians will participate in international competitions and Olympic games.
Japan has 7000 islands (the largest is Benchui Island), making Japan the seventh largest island country in the world!
Due to Japan’s abundance of islands, Japan is often referred to as “Lean Island” from a geological point of view.
The western knowledge of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century. European marinees that traveled at the time called the island "Ilha Formosa", meaning beautiful islands.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan region, beginning to change the way the indigenous food produced, and hired Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugar plants.

In 1895, after the defeat of the Middle Agreement (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Mao Treaty, giving Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, and Japan ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu is composed of three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the House of Three Window.
To help visitors better understand the original appearance of the group, most of the buildings on the edge of the group were reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was repaid, and the repairs continued until today.
For example, the most common statistical image photography format in the world is the 35mm format, which is the film size that dominated at the end of the film film era.
It is still in production until today, but more importantly, its long width is applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual size of the 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm tall, so the format is actually a bit confusing.
Therefore, the width ratio of this format (except for 12 to get the simplest number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format series) are the same or relatively close to this long-width ratio.
Frequently abused and ridiculous triangular methods do not lose as a simple guidance when creating dynamics, but also keep the image in order.
It notes that the most effective location for the subject is to divide the image vertically and level into the crosspoint of the lines of three parts (see example).
During this period of European history, the already rich and powerful Catholic Church has been closely monitored.
Despite different languages and customs in Europe, Christianity has linked them together for more than a thousand years.
From the king to the civilians, it’s all-inclusive power that affects everyone.
One of the main beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate pain and poverty, and the Church’s monetary funds are specially established for this purpose.
The central collectivity of the Church has existed in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has made many to question whether they have adhered to this faith.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostility, Britain began implementing a maritime blockade against Germany.
They cut off the supply of military and civilian goods for life-related deaths. This strategy proved to be effective, although such blocks have been violated in the past two centuries, which has been generally accepted by all over the world under a number of international agreements.
Britain is in international waters to prevent any vessels from entering the entire waters, and even a threat to neutral state vessels.
Because the response to this strategy is limited, Germany expects a similar response to its unlimited submarines battle.
In the 1920s, the main attitude of most citizens was peaceful and separatist.
After witnessing the violent cruelty during the First World War, the countries desire to avoid repetition.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job in Edison in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he carried four cents, a collection of poems and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor, his previous manager, to Thomas Edison.
Each of the different periods of ancient China was characterized by; every period of China or every dominant family of the sub-heaven was a distinct characteristic kingdom.
Similarly, the period of calendar change was a period of instability of the separation of small nations, the most famous of which was the period of three countries of up to 60 years, which was between the alternatives of the two generations of Han.
During these periods of turbulence, there was a violent war between the roads to fight for the throne.
Three countries are one of the bloodyest times in China's ancient history. Thousands of people died for fighting for the highest power of the luxury palace.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of measurement units, the transition from authoritarian to republic, nationalism, the belief that the state belongs not to the only rulers but to the people.
Furthermore, after the revolution, the official appeal was open to all men, which gave the most ambitious and successful people the opportunity to fly to Yellowstone.
The army also, because the low level of the army is no longer based on grade, but based on talent.
The French Revolution also encouraged the oppressed working classes in many other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond the dust life. He had often been to meditate in a cave on the mountain Noel (Light).
The cave itself was not only preserved by the test of the time of residence, but also given an extremely vibrant image of Muhammad’s spiritual intentions.
The cave is located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even knowing its existence is not easy to find. Once you enter the cave, it is completely isolated from the world.
There is nothing to see except the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains. In the caves there are almost no sight and noise from the outside world.
The pyramids of Giza is the only building that remains unstable among the seven great wonders.
The Great Pyramid was a masterpiece of Egyptians of the third century BC, and it was one of the many great pyramids that expressed respect to the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Highlands (i.e. the “Giza Pyramids”) in Egypt’s Death Valley include several pyramids (which are the largest), several small tombs, several temples and large lion statues.
The Great Pyramid was built to commemorate the Pharaoh of Huff and built several smaller pyramids, tombs and temples to commemorate Huff's wife and family members.
The “up-arrow” symbol is like the letter V, and the “down-arrow” symbol is like a scratch of a book or a square missing at the bottom.
The upper indicates the start of pushing the arks from the top, and the bottom indicates the start of pulling the arks from the roots of the arks (i.e. where the hand holds the arks).
The upper arc usually produces more soft sounds, while the lower arc produces stronger, stronger sounds.
Please make your own label with a pencil, but remember that the printed signals are musically meaningful, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the scared King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antoinette and their two children (11 years old Mary Teresa and Louis Charles), and King's sister Elizabeth, were deported back to Paris by a group of women from Versailles.
They returned to Paris on a car with a group of people surrounded them, screaming and threatening the king and the queen.
The tyrants forced the king and the queen to open the windows of the car completely.
On the face of the scared queen, there was a violent whistleblowing the head of a royal guard, who was killed in the Versailles Palace.
The expenses of war when American imperialism conquered the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to pay most of their expenses, as well as interests on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine Government through the Wall Street Bank.
Of course, the high profits obtained by the long-term exploitation of the people of the Philippines became the basic profit of American imperialism.
To understand the Temple Knights, you need to understand the background that encouraged the establishment of the Temple Knights.
The times of events are often referred to as the Middle Ages of Europe’s history, the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
Before the Middle Ages, it was the early Middle Ages, and then the late Middle Ages, and it was traditionally believed that the late Middle Ages ended about 1500 years ago.
Technical Decision Theory is a term that covers many kinds of ideas in practice, including theoretical impulsion, theoretical necessity, and a strict definition of human fate is driven by the logic behind the laws of science and its performance in the technology.
Most interpretations of the technological decision-making include these two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself is far beyond cultural or political influences, and the other is that technology, in turn, produces an inner “influence” on society without restrictions of social conditions.
For example, someone might say that cars will necessarily promote road development.
However, a national road network for only a few cars, which is economically impossible, and therefore new production methods are implemented in order to reduce the ownership costs of the cars.
Higher Volkswagen storage will also lead to higher traffic accidents, which will drive the invention of a new medical technology to repair injured injuries.
Romanticism has a strong cultural decision on color, which comes from writers such as Goethe, Feith and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, geography-related customs and cultures emerged, which are much better than laws arbitrarily imposed because they are harmonious with the place in which society is.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople is considered to be the fashion capital of the European feudal era.
Its reputation as a luxury center began around 400 AD and continued to around 1100 AD.
Its status decreased in the twelve century, mainly because gifts, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than offered by the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th - 11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, dressing was deeply influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slowdown of cultural exchanges, Western fashion may be behind 25 to 30 years.
As the Middle Ages went to the end, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own style. One of the greatest advances was that after the crucifixion, people began to wear clothes with nozzles.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agricultural activity carried out in order to produce only food that needs farmers and their families.
Self-made agriculture is a simple and usually organic system that uses local seeds stored in the ecosystem, combined with crops wheels or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers are engaged in self-sufficient agricultural production.
Ascultures bring together individuals who feel themselves ignored by social standards, and ascultures develops a sense of identity among them.
Due to the age, race, class, location and/or gender differences of members, subcultures may be characterized.
Attributes that make Asian culture different from them can be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of multiple factors.
Members of Asia-Cultural groups often symbolically use unique styles of behavior to demonstrate their membership identity, including fashionable clothes, behavior and black speech.
To explain the importance of socialization, one of the most commonly used methods is the use of the cases of a few unfortunate children. These children do not get socialized with the help of adults during their growth due to being neglected, suffered from unfortunate or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called "wild children", meaning wild children. Some wild children are banned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because parents refuse to accept children having serious intellectual or physical defects.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or left home.
Others are said to be passive animals; some live alone in the wild.
If a wolf is fully grown up by non-human animals, their behavior (in the extent permitted by physical conditions) will be very similar to the animal, for example, showing fear or indifference to humans.
While project learning methods should make learning easier and more fun, the foundation learning methods are even further.
Based teaching is not a learning method, but a means of helping people just learn to use a new computer program or start a new project.
Stitched teaching can be performed online or offline, in other words, teachers are a form of stitched teaching, just like a reverse needle assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is integrated in software to question, suggest and explain programs that may be difficult for students to handle alone.
Children are parenting for a variety of reasons, because they are neglected, abused, and even chanted.
No child should grow in an environment without education, without care, without education, but in violation of the desire.
We believe the childbirth system is a safe area for these children.
Our childbirth system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
The childbirth system should provide all the necessary necessities that its indigenous families are missing.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The clear characteristics of the Internet enables it to add additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “communication” are considered to be an important motivation for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
When studying the audience’s response to the website, Emmy and McDonnell (1998) also used “personal engagement” and “persistent relationships” as a new motivation factor.
The use of video has brought significant discoveries to interpret micro-expressions (face motion lasting several milliseconds).
Specifically, it is said to be possible to judge whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting the microscope.
Oliver Sacks said in his paper "President's Speech" that people who can't understand language due to brain damage are still able to accurately judge whether the speaker is honest.
He even suggests that this ability to understand human behavior may be a common part of animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century shows that there are two types of genetic variations: visible and hidden.
Mutations add new genetic variations, while selected removes the variations from the expressed genetic variations pool.
Due to separation and restructuring, variations come back to change between the two library of each generation.
On tropical herbs, elderly animals have a digestive system similar to humans, and existing plant resources are hard to satisfy the demands of elderly animals for amino acids.
Furthermore, if this is not possible, it will lead to serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, which ultimately lead to death.
The most easily accessible vegetable resource should be protein in leaves and coconut plants, but older animals like us are hard to digest this protein unless it is cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (myrs, worms, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a large amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
Overall, we should not be surprised if the way our ancestors solve the “protein problem” was different from the methods used by chimpanzees on tropical herbs today.
Sleep interruption refers to such a process: deliberately wake up during normal sleep, and fall asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This is easy to do, using a relatively quiet alarm that allows you to wake up without being completely awakened.
If you find yourself being re-installing the alarm while sleeping, you can place the alarm on the other side of the room and force yourself to go to bed to turn the alarm off.
Other biological rhythm-based choices include drinking a lot of liquids before sleep (especially water or tea—known to be beneficial for urine) and forcing yourself to get rid of eczema.
The degree of inner calmness of a person is opposed to the degree of physical and mental tension.
The less stress, the more positive the life is. Everyone can find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach the scope of understanding, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's doctrines, but it has been expanded through the universal love of Buddhism and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple; it includes the methods of Qadarini yoga, meditation, and the love of the universe.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini’s energy is awakened through yoga positions, breathing exercises, speech and visual images.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is the yoga. By visualizing different gods, purifying energy paths, activating the roll holes, thus achieving the limits of understanding.
Germany was the common enemy of the countries during the Second World War, which facilitated cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. As the end of the war, the institutional, procedural and cultural conflicts made the two countries separated.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became an enemy and the Cold War began.
The war lasted for 40 years, and the agent armies fought hardly on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
On September 17, 1939, Poland's defence lines were already invaded, and the only hope remaining was to withdraw and repair troops along the Romanian Bridge.
However, more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army entered and established positions in Belarus and Ukraine after violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet Poland Nonviolence Treaty and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, invading the eastern regions of Poland.
So far, shipping has been the most effective way to transit masses of people and goods.
In traditional sense, the mission of the Navy is to ensure the country retains the capacity of transporting personnel and goods while interfering with the ability of the enemy to transport their personnel and goods.
One of the most notable modern example is the North Atlantic battle during World War II. Americans attempted to cross the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy, mainly controlled by U-type submarines, is trying to stop the transportation.
If the allies failed at that time, Germany was likely to conquer Britain as much as the other European countries had conquered.
Sheep appears to be raised for the first time in the Zagros Mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to feed them, eat and use their milk, meat, hair and skin.
Home cows are usually grown in crowds in mountains or other shepherd areas, they are usually cared by shepherds (mostly children or teenagers), and shepherds are similar to the more widely known shepherds humans.
Britain built a truck route in the 16th century.
Although the Mala Trail was just made of parallel wooden panels, at the time, for a slightly harsh roads, these cars could make the truck's horses run faster and pull more.
Early, the trailpad was introduced for fixing the railway. However, people gradually realized that if the railway is placed on the railway, the railway is more stable.
This has become a common practice, but iron coils will make wooden wheel wheels more seriously damaged.
Finally, the wooden wheel was replaced by the railway wheel. In 1767, the first full railway was created.
The first known way of transport is walking. Two million years ago, with the appearance of straight people (Homo Erectus, meaning straight people), humans began to walk straight.
Their ancestors had no habit of walking straight.
Two-foot-specific phenomenon was found in ancient southern monkey fossils that were about 4.2 million to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two-foot seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, join environmental campaigns, and even become environmental activists, reducing future disasters to a certain degree.
In many cases, this is very similar to symptom therapy. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problem and eliminate it completely.
It is obvious that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the excess of population and the luxury lifestyle of mankind make the problem even more serious.
The handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary-General Charles Thompson was approved by the Continental Parliament on July 4, and was subsequently sent to a printing plant outside of several districts.
150 to 200 copies were printed in a night, which is the now known Dunlap broadsides version.
On July 8, John Nixon publicly read the document for the first time in the garden of the Independent Hall.
One of the letters was sent to George Washington on July 6, and Washington read the letter to his army in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The remaining 25 pieces of Dunlap broadsides were the earliest version of the file.
Many archaeologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and survived today, which is what we call the “birds”.
Many people think they are not dinosaurs because they have wings and fly.
But there are many places where birds are similar to dinosaurs.
They have spots and nails on their feet, producing eggs, and walking with two rear legs like the Dragon.
Today, almost all computers used are based on information processing binary encoding.
Binary numbers can only represent one of the two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and such numbers are called binary numbers, i.e. "bit" in the computer term.
Poisoning within the body may not appear immediately, symptoms such as vomiting are common and therefore cannot be immediately diagnosed.
The most powerful indicator for the consumption of a drug may be a container that is opened on the spot, containing drugs or household toxic chemicals.
Check the label on the poison to get specific emergency instructions.
Insecticologists have officially referred to this type of insects using the word “bug”.
This term is derived from people’s familiarity with the smell, and the smell is an insect that is very adaptable to the parasites of humans.
Hunting and insects are herb-resistant insects, adapting to living in the host's herb or houses.
There are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple hyperthyroidism (MS) in all parts of the United States, which has become the main nervous system disease in middle teenagers.
Multiple hardening is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed by the brain, spinal cord and visual nerves).
Studies found that women are twice more likely to develop multiple cardiovascular dysfunction (MS) than men.
A couple may think for their own interests, or for their children, and therefore decide not to give birth.
These couples may have an adoption plan for their children.
In the process of adoption, parents ended their rights as parents so that another couple could raise children.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through scientific methods. In fact, this method can provide guidance for most scientific research.
Experiment is an experiment used to eliminate one or more possibility assumptions, however, experiment is not the only way.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
The views of Aristotle on all fields of science, including psychology, were accepted one by one.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West got away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the physiological rhythms and behavioral rhythms observed by researchers often depend largely on the intrinsic cycles generated by the biological clock and its presence.
Cyclic rhythm is not just a simple reaction to external cycle signals. This rhythm is recorded in most organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clock is a self-maintaining mounting device that will last a cycle of freely running for a while even without external indication.
Hershey and Chase’s experiment suggests that DNA is one of the main signs of genetic matter.
Helmy and Zeus use anesthetics or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, one of which marks the DNA of the microorganisms with radioactive phosphorus, and one of the proteins that marks the microorganisms with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can produce a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are genetic cells.
Only mutations of genital cells are inherited to the child, while mutations of other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural landscape tourism attracts visitors who are interested in natural areas who come to observe natural landscapes including wildlife.
On-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, observation of birds, visiting parks and researching ecosystems.
For example, visiting, photographing, and understanding of the Red Chipper in Biroa.
Every morning, people drive out of the small town to work, and the workplace with the people who have been washing their shoulders is exactly where they left.
In this dynamic traffic traffic, everyone is in some way connected and supported with a private vehicle-based transport system.
Today, science shows that this massive carbon economy has no longer been able to keep stable the biosphere that supports human evolution in the past two million years.
Everyone is a part of society and uses the transportation system, and almost everyone complain about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do traffic systems cause such complaints? Why do they fail every day? Are the traffic engineers not working? or have a more fundamental reason?
Traffic study involves the movement of drivers and vehicles between the two points, as well as the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, researching the vehicle’s flow is difficult because it is impossible to make a hundred percent certain prediction of the driver’s behavior.
Fortunately, the driver's behavior is often within a reasonable consistency scope; therefore, traffic often has a certain reasonable consistency, which can be expressed rigorously in mathematical ways.
To better represent traffic, a relationship has been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) traffic, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects are the first animals to fly in the air. Flight ability makes them easier to hide from enemies and find food and spouses more effectively.
Most insects have an advantage that they can bend the wings along the body backwards.
This allows them to have more small space to hide the fishermen.
Nowadays, the only insect that can’t bend the wings backwardly are cranberry and cranberry.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristax said that the solar system rotates around the sun.
Some people think he was right, but many people have the opposite opinions; they think the solar system is running around the Earth and the sun (even other stars).
This seems logical because the Earth doesn’t feel itself moving, isn’t it?
The Amazon River is the second largest and largest river in the world. Its water volume is more than eight times the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some river ranges up to 6 miles in width.

Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since ancient times, because these elements can be found in natural shapes in nature and are more easily mined using original tools.
The philosopher Aristotle suggests that anything is made up of one or more of the four elements of earth, water, air and fire.
This is more like four states of matter (in orderless): solid, liquid, gas, and so on, but he also proposed theory that they are transformed into new matter, forming what we see.
The alloy is basically made of a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements on the element cycle table.
Elements such as calcium, potassium, etc. belong to metal, and elements such as silver and gold, of course, are also metal.
There are also alloys containing a small amount of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and all matter is made up of small particles known as atoms.
The atom is so small that the sentence at the end of the sentence can contain trillions of atoms.
So, when the pencil comes to life, it has become the hearts of many people.
Unfortunately, with the appearance of a new way of writing, the status of the pencil is becoming less and less used.
People now write information on a computer screen and never need to contact a pencil.
People can only guess what the end of the keyboard will be when the updated product appears.
The principle of the work of a fragmented atomic bomb is as follows: combining one atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons requires energy.
It’s a bit like pushing a bullying small trunk up the mountain. Again split the atomic nucleus, and then release some energy.
Some atoms contain unstable atomic nucleus, which means they are likely to break down with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the shell.
The near side of the shell is about 70 km thick and the far side is about 100 km thick.
The shelves under the dark side are thin, and the shelves under the ground are thick.
Because the shell is thinner, so the near side may have more dark parts, and the melting rocks are easier to rise to the surface of the ground.
The core of the motivating content theory is looking for factors that identify or generate interest.
These theories suggest that when people mature to a certain degree, certain needs and/or desires are internalized.
These theoretical researches why some people want to do what they do, and what things in the environment they are going to make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are, respectively, Maslow’s Demand Level Theory and Herzegovina’s Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors occur when managers start to lead past colleagues; one is that they try to maintain a "intimate relationship" with team members.
This type of managers are difficult to make uninterrupted decisions, and there are also difficulties in implementing disciplinary measures, performance assessment, assignment of responsibilities and pursuit of responsibilities.
In another extreme situation, this person becomes an individual completely different from before, feeling he/she has to change everything the team has done and put the results on his own.
After all, the leaders are the ultimate responsibility for the team’s success.
This behavior often leads to differences between the leadership and other members of the team.
Virtual teams need to stick to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are small differences.
The virtual team members often serve as the corresponding subline team contact points.
They tend to have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may arrange meetings for different time zones, and local management may not understand that.
The presence of a truly “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109), is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible Team" means the management team that each member should report to him. It set standards for all members.
Why does an organization take so much time to build a learning-type organization? One of the objectives of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used among the functional departments of an organization, creativity and creativity occurs.
Therefore, in the process of joint efforts to overcome barriers, an organization often introduces new innovation processes to meet the needs of customers.
Before organizations can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, sharing knowledge and conducting organized learning.
The Angel (2006) explains the continuous body program as a way that can help organizations higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research. Therefore, it shortened the scope of research and made research more accurate.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior can support research by scientists.
We’ve already known that different types of brain injuries, trauma, diseases and tumors can affect human behavior and cause certain mental functions to change.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and study the structure and work processes of the brain, which have never seen before.
This provides a lot of information and material for us to build a simulation model that helps us understand the processes in which the brain works.
Artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction colour, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science, researching the behavior of machines, learning and intelligence adaptation.
Research in artificial intelligence (AI) involves automation of tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and measurement, responding to customer diagnosis and customer issues, and handwritten recognition, voice and face functions.
All of these have become independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now commonly used in economic, medical, engineering and military fields, and some home computers and e-game software applications have already built-in AI systems.
Field exploration is an important component of any teaching activity. Usually, teachers are happy to take students to places that buses cannot reach.
Virtual field exploration is a high-tech solution. Students can watch the artwork of the museum in the classroom, visit the aquarium, or enjoy beautiful works of art.
Sharing the field exploration in a virtual way is a good way to review the journey and share experience with later classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their state trip every year.The website is re-designed every year, but older versions are saved online to be used as a clipbook.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Although the grammatics and puzzles used are often complicated when students start blogging, the appearance of readers usually changes this situation.
Students are often the most challenging readers, so bloggers begin to try to improve their writing levels and avoid being criticized.
In addition, blogging is also “forcing students to get more insight into the world around them.” To satisfy the interests of the audience, students are encouraged to become smart and interesting.
Blogging is a tool that can inspire collaboration and also encourage students to extend their learning beyond traditional school lessons.
"Using properly blogging," can help students become better in analyzing and thinking; by positively responding to web materials, students can find their own positions in the context of others' articles above and be able to express their views on a particular issue (Oravec, 2002)."
