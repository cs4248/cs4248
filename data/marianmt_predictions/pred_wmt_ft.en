Is there any way to punish him?
In case something like this ever happens again,
Or how long before the restaurant is ready? Can you ask me?
The students sing the lead at the Great Academic Annual Conference. The results of the research have opened the mind - Xinhuanet
Use air to wash hands, judge disease with breath, and search for haze sources precisely. At the opening ceremony of the 2016 annual academic conference of Zhejiang University last night, a series of brain holes in academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements were students, and the research covered a wide range of fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education. Students began with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions of application value, some of which have won national and international awards.
Biological Sensors: Your Home Medical Doctor
Dr. Zhang Diming, Dr. College of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the end of a smartphone, which is only half the size of a smart phone.
"You just need to breathe lightly, and the device will be able to test the health of the body initially from the composition of the gas that you exclaimed. "
Zhang Diming said that the sensor was connected to the smart phone and the health report would be shown on the phone when the gas came out.
Smart handrings that can detect health conditions in the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature, pulse, etc.
And this biosensor uses this new type of material, graphene, which is aimed at chemical elements, and has a keen "sweet sense" that allows it to reflect body health conditions more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgery Lamps: Doctor's High Capable Eye
In addition to smart phones, smart surgery lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won the silver prize at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Inventories Festival this year.
M.A. Zhulining and Shen Junfei, students of the Academy of Photoelectric Science and Engineering, opened new thinking in the shortcomings of traditional operating lamps, and invented smart LED surgery without a shadow lamp.
"The early detection and removal of many diseases are not in place and are related to the lights used by the doctor's operating room. "
Shen Junfei said, for example, the doctor could not see all the oncological tissues in time for the early cancer examination, and then the cancer cells would spread.
This smart surgery lamp has four lamps, which enhance the difference between different tissues under light by regulating the spectrum.
During the operation, doctors can at any time regulate the size, brightness, spectroscopy, homogeneity of colors, and no visibility rate according to the needs and personal habits of the operation.
This smart surgery lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Shao Zhenfe Hospital, affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical School, and Zhejiang University Medical College Children Hospital, and has received better feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: save water and be cool
Common people wash their hands with water, rub some soap at best, squeeze some handwashing fluid, and students such as Li Qingzhang have invented a "air washer".
As long as we stand on the handwasher, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a cylinder.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet of water and combines it with water.
In this way, we can wash our hands! "
The coloring reaction and bacterial residue experiment proved that the effect of washing hands through this method is the same as that of ordinary handwashing methods.
The device simply needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which will guarantee the level of cleaning and save 90% of water. The whole process will be completely energyless and energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Summit of Global Major Challenges, the invention won its only gold prize in many of the world's leading schools.

A certificate - first aid certificate - that makes sense to me
This is one of the skill certificates that I think is important in addition to my driving license!
Generalization: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue in case of an emergency, i.e. rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is actually a period of time before the ambulance arrives after the accident, which is the most critical.
This is the time to need first aid.
If I actually had a heart attack, a brain hemorrhage, and a breath stop, then our window of life was only four minutes and gold four minutes!
So people around them know how important first aid is!
When someone falls next to us, we can save him with our professional knowledge instead of standing there and doing nothing and doing nothing. This sense of helplessness is terrible.
"In China, our official data is that three million people die accidentally each year, and the most dangerous is a cardiac arrest.
On average, 15% of the country can be saved.
Seventy-eight percent of casino hotels in Las Vegas can be rescued, less than 1% in Shanghai and Beijing."
This was said by Lu Lei, the founder of the first reaction.
If a man has a cardiac arrest, he has no breath, he has no heartbeat, and there's nothing in you to choke.
It is necessary to breathe artificially and press the chest pressure to bring people back to life.
I found that few people still have this awareness to learn first aid, but it was too late when it happened, so I called on everyone to learn this skill so that we could react in time when facing a sudden state.
Maybe save one's life!
First aid certificates can be signed up at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students have concessions.
PS: The last map records the goals to be achieved by 25 years old. The addition of the first aid certificate to the target list was also a few months ago, but it was done!
Then we have to go to the other certificates that we want to do, and we're going to go to the dive certificate. We also saw a dive first aid certificate in the Xiaohong Book. It seems that the first aid certificate is still necessary for the examination. Therefore, the first aid certificate is still useful

Of these, 13 yuan of shrimp dumplings is just one!
Never tried.
What, #NAME # doesn't write?
13 yuan for one?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# leaked food, and this time, just one shrimp dumpling for me?
Because it was valid when I entered code earlier.
To begin with, I personally believe that "Four Seas" is an all-round piece of crap, in all senses.
But you're going to say whether the film has a bright spot or not, and it's not like it's at least a fun choice.
There are a lot of bad movies, so that you can sleep in the cinema, and you can count the angry ones after reading them. For the audience, The Four Seas is like a monkey on the frown mountain, and it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience, Han Qin really has a great talent.
What's most painful about this film is that it's as if it's made in a history novel. It's hard to be famous. It's as if it's like a dress on a pony brother.
Even after reading it, you'll wonder if there's an implicit metaphor for the director, but when you think about it, it turns out it's actually a piece of shit.
Let's begin with some of the facts that I find difficult to understand.
The man's main residence is supposed to be on a small island south of China, where his grandmother lives.
Her grandmother wanted to watch the snow, and then the scene arranged for a big man in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to watch the snow.
The old man was sitting in the van from south to northeast watching snow?
He and his father are very relieved.
Then the old man died.
How did the hostess and his brother get a licence to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can't one of the mountain roads be closed by the small party gangsters on the island?
The truck carrying steel in the middle of the road then stopped by the side of the road and couldn't even find the truck driver around.
It's too obvious.
Why would a yakuza party, which is unable to write letters and is suspected of breaking the law, become an auxiliary police officer?
Why didn't you call the police in the face of the loan loan loan loan, and the police specifically asked if there was any difficulty in the film?
A grown man knows how to use smart phones but doesn't know how to open a door with a card in a hotel. Then make arrangements not to find a hotel owner and sit outside the room for a night?
I feel pain when I think about these inexplicable scenes, which are rife in the whole film.
In addition to the plot, what's worse is the subject matter of the movie, or the fact that it has no subject, is an abominable sew.
At the beginning of the film, you'll think he wants to make a comedy. More than 20 minutes later, you'll guess it might be an inspirational film. Half of the time, you think it might be a drama film that shows how young people live in small towns. After watching, you don't even know what
For most people, it's actually very familiar with all kinds of films. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcycle player, then inspire + comedy and tell the audience how a gifted rookie moves forward to success.
If you want to make a love film, then tell the truth about the relationship between the young people and the waitress in the town who like to ride the motorcycle.
If you want to reflect reality, at least you can't show anything that is contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yoon Cheng's new motorcycle has just been burned and can sing), he can't even open some brain holes that Kennedy can't even see.
As for the fact that the female master is not retarded and can behave like a 5-year-old in some ways, I really don't know whether this is the reason for acting or what the director wants.
I also don't understand why Han Xian, as a racer, is so keen to add car crashes to his own movie.
Is it supposed to be in spring festivals for the sake of crowding out viewers?

Inspection of the production and processing equipment of the concrete module of the well
Chengzhou Yiying is the producer of the domestic concrete inspection module brick machine equipment, the block construction machine, and the specialized machinery of the wall wall module machinery, from semi-automatic to fully automated production line.
Through many years of practice and development, the quality is too hard, mainly producing hydraulic, mobile and fully automated well inspection series equipment and supporting devices.
Inspection of the production and processing equipment of the concrete module of the well
Inspection of the production and processing equipment of the concrete module of the well; features and advantages of the equipment of the wall brick module of Zhengzhou;
Iixin inspects the new construction materials of brick-blocking equipment in wells that are broadly applicable to underground municipal structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, gas, etc.
For example: All types of inspection wells, rain vents, grooves, septic tanks, small constructions, bridges, etc. in drainage, water storage facilities.
The advantage of using concrete modules to construct inspection wells is that the upper and lower sides of the module are all condensed chute structures, and a chain of chain formation is constructed in combination.
Well wall wall resistance is much better than the construction form of flat friction structures.
The module is a medium-air structure, the vertical holes are connected after the configuration, the horizontal holes are consistent, and the puncture core is poured into it. It forms the current concrete net structure, which serves as a secondary refill and waterproofing function.
The vertical and horizontal parts of the modules have inserted chutes, which increase the overall strength of the structure with horizontal sleep and vertical intruding.
In addition, inspection wells and drainage wells constructed using concrete inspection modules are not easily collapsing, sinking, leaking, and so on. The machinery performance of the well walls module is stable, simple operation is simple and sized.
Concrete inspection of the smart control equipment of the brick machine of the module: data entry, output device tactile liquid crystal displays the entire process of monitoring the machine operation, achieving the ideal human machine dialogue, automatic analysis, density operation, safety logic control, and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall module uses single tank hydraulics, transports, double tank hydraulics, and transports.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the effects of host vibration on hydraulic systems, thereby ensuring the reliability of hydraulic system work.
Concrete inspection of the building block device layout box of the module brick machine has increased, and the storage container door has closed, automatically transports the palettes, all independently of the hydraulic system, thus reducing the wear and maintenance of machinery.
Concrete inspection module brick machine equipment is based on imported computers and appliances, sealed hydraulics are used, and the general security equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical stimulation platform of the wall wall module of the well uses a whole plate steel, and the desktop line cut is scalable, so that the filling box is free to swing and be guided to reduce fully the mechanical wear and tear.
To reduce the battery load, fill the material and encrypt the amplitude in two pairs, adopt integration, full synchronization, and vibrate to ensure that the positive effect is achieved.
The mechanical stimulation machine and automatic computer control amplitude of the wall wall module adjust the amplitude according to the price ratio of the raw material, without wear and tear, thereby prolonging the useful life and reducing costs.
The automatic mechanical control and manual control function of the wall wall module.

Chongqing Middle School Piloted Modern Apprenticeship
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the municipal teaching committee that from this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent development model at 60 middle-level schools. Students who have been trained in the pilot will also have apprenticeship status. After admission, the pilot enterprises will be pre-recorded as unit employees.
Municipal teaching committee requires that the procedures for admission to middle-level schools and employment in enterprises be regulated, that the dual status of students and associate employees of middle-level schools and enterprises of apprentices be clarified, and that apprentices, schools and enterprises should enter into tripartite agreements for apprentices who have reached the age of 16 and who have not reached the age of 18, in accordance with the principle of
Pilot schools are encouraged to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and jointly conduct pre-service and transition training for enterprise employees.
Pilot schools need to reform the talent formation model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent development programmes, jointly develop professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation programmes.
The pilot is based on the culture system as a pilot cycle, and the duration of the student's internship in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent development programme, and the replacement internship usually lasts for six months.
In the practice of enterprises, an enterprise class management model should be implemented. Depending on the characteristics of the different professions, a teacher may bring two to five apprentices to form study groups to ensure that students are skilled in the skills required for each rotating training post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 until August 2019, we identified 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects with approximately 50 people each, with a total of about 3,000 students (apprenticeships).
In accordance with the principle of piloting and implementation, step-by-step promotion from point to face, explore the establishment of long-term efficiency mechanisms for the joint enrolment, joint development and integration of students in schools and enterprises, effectively upgrade student job skills, and improve the employment rate and quality of

South African Doctor: Omikron is powerful but mostly mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the Omician mutation of the new coronary virus is milder than that of Delta, although the spread rate is faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of Omikjung mutinies in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors from Haodun Province in South Africa reported that the symptoms of the new coronary patients they currently treat are mild, such as physical pain and cough similar symptoms to the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, head of the organization, said he visited dozens of patients every day, but no patients needed hospitalization.
"They were able to control illness at home, and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said. "
He said that this included the elderly and those with health problems, who were more likely to be seriously affected by the coronary virus infection.
In contrast, he said, during the previous wave of Delta outbreak, the new coronary patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many will be hospitalized in a few days' time. "
Other doctors shared similar experiences within two weeks after Southern Africa first reported the transformation of the toxic strain of Omicium.
While it will take weeks to collect enough data, doctor observation and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the findings of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30% of the new coronary patients who have been hospitalized in recent weeks are seriously ill, which is half of the previous wave of severe disease; the average length of hospitalization has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent coronary cases
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports: "At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a milder disease. "
He added: "It's still early, and we need to get later data.
Normally, hospitalisation and death take place late, and we only have two weeks to enter the outbreak. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effects of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta is still the world's leading new coronary virus strain, the case of Omicron is emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the centre of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases discovered in Haoden Province in the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests showed that more than 90% of cases were in Omikium variants.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been delivered!

Education assessment: What do you need to save an abducted child?
If it is similar to the famous public service ad advert, "No buying and selling, no killing", then in a good environment without the demand for "kidnapping", the prevention of group treatment and the fight against kidnapping by the entire population make trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Children's Missing Information Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has been online.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on children missing and to find the abducted children in a timely manner.
I heard that App was called "combined", and it was quite warm.
The new technology means are not only a name for "culture", but also full of affection, but also well-utilized, practical and effective.
The primary goal of kidnapping and law enforcement is to find the abducted child and protect his personal safety and freedom.
Second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention, and legal education, can list many "big words".
However, priority should be given to the safety of the victim until the case of trafficking is solved.
As a matter of priority, under the eager "resort" objective, the controversial and controversial topics such as "whether or not the trafficking of children should be carried out under the death penalty" can be postponed and carefully discussed; however, it is not possible to rescue the abducted children.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are used to stay away from the crime scene as soon as they can.
The delay of one minute in the search for abduction may keep the child away from the parents and increase the difficulty of the case being solved by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic move to come up with an effective way such as a "reunification" platform that will directly help to solve cases and find children.
After all, "trafficking" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
Fighting crime, safeguarding children's and parents' rights and interests, from the soundness of legislation to the guarantee of justice, and the closeness of law enforcement, do not need to implement the care of "child care and support".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be done better from home to society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three persons rested at a train station, and their parents fell asleep before they woke up and found the child was gone.
A two-year-old cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, he or she should have at least a considerable sense of protection.
Both parents take turns to rest and place their children under secure protection, which is the least way to prevent their abduction.
From the other side of the police's fight against trafficking and crime, the buying side of the child should also be watched and punished.
Individual wrongdoings tend to be just one link in a long long chain.
According to China's Penal Code, the mandatory penalty for the crime of trafficking in children is 5 years; in particularly serious circumstances, it can be carried out to the death penalty and confiscated property.
The crime of trafficking in children clearly falls under the heavy penalty under the general trend of "light punishment" when the starting point is high and the maximum penalty is heavy.
However, there are still a number of trafficking cases every year to date.
It is evident that some people lag behind in raising their children and have a low awareness of the law.
The legal education of this part of the population should be followed up simultaneously.
For the crime of trafficking to be effectively controlled, it cannot be done through strict official law enforcement alone.
If the "market" of kidnapping is widespread, the traffickers' profit is incompetent, and the methods of trafficking are constantly innovative, creating a situation of "fight" with law enforcement officials, then the campaign of kidnapping is bound to fall into an inefficient mud.
Therefore, breaking down the concept of backwardness and popularizing the common knowledge of the law will also help tackle the crime of trafficking and buying and selling children.

Yes, a rider has been replaced.
He's been waiting for a long time.
The restaurant always said it was in the process.
Waited for hours.
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories, Virginia Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil, with five levels.
First-time olive oil, or what is called natural olive oil, is the fat obtained directly from fresh olive fruit, which is mechanically cooled, filtrated and treated to remove alien matter.
There are three levels depending on acidity:
Extra Virgin is the highest-level and highest-quality olive oil and a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, and the plant fragrants of the dilamental people are not more than 1% acidic.
Quality olive oil (Fine Virgin): The acidity is slightly higher, but not more than 2%, and the taste is pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin: The taste and taste are good, and the acidity is not greater than 3.3%.
The refined olive oil is the olive oil derived from the refining of the primary olive oil, which is more than 3.3% acidic, or becomes "secondary oil".
The refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: The refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of primary olive oil to reconcile the taste with color, with acidity of less than 1.5% and transparent gold yellow.
Olive impurity oil or olive slag oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): olive oil extracted from the slag and refined by solution.
The acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olives are like grapes made of wine, and olives from different production areas and different olive varieties produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place for olives to grow:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and temperature for oil olive growth, sunlight, air moisture and precipitation conditions.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be planted sporadically in suitable living areas.
Places of production of major production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., are similar to their climates, as well as Argentina, Peru, South Africa and others, far south latitudes.
The pick month of olives:
Between March and June of each year, the olive trees bloomed fruit, and the fruit grew from July to October and matured. The fruit turned from green to red, purple and eventually black.
November to February is the fruit harvest season (the freshness of olive oil is important).
The nutrient component of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in rich unsaturated fat acids, i.e. oilic acids and acidic acids, as well as vitamins A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered the best oil for human nutrients in oil found so far.
At the end of the democracy summit, Biden said the fire of freedom will never be extinguished
The online Democracy Summit, convened by U.S. President Biden and attended by leaders from 110 countries around the world, as well as civil society and the private sector, ended on Friday (10 December).
Biden said in his closing speech that the fire of freedom burned in everyone's hearts in the world and could never be extinguished by a authoritarian regime.
He also said that the second global "Democracy Summit" was planned for next year.
Tang Feng, a representative of the Taiwan government and member of the government and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activists currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said, "We know how difficult the work before us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge because, as I said before, as this summit showed, the democratic world is everywhere.
A totalitarian regime can never put out a small fire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires a concerted effort by society as a whole.
He said: "As leaders of government, it is our duty to listen to our citizens, strengthen the shield of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability and governance, be more resistant to the forces of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good. "
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were, respectively, defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting power, as well as countering digital powerism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Guterres, said in his opening address on the same day that the cause of democracy faces global challenges, especially those posed by emerging digital technology.
He said: "It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions, as well as democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of populism, indigenousism and extremism in all their forms, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution. "
The Hong Kong Democratic and Human Rights Actor Luo Quansheng addressed the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding participants of the continuing concern of the human rights situation of Chinese minorities such as Hong Kong and Uighur and Tibetans.
He said: "The world has long accepted the rise of China without creating a mechanism to hold them accountable.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure the revival of democracy is our primary task. "
Ron Chousheng also called for the free world to unite against the threat posed by the CPC.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, some of you may not want to lose the Chinese market, and some of you may not have recognized the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change. "
Tang Feng, a member of the Taiwan Executive Council, issued a "State Statement" via video during a round-table discussion on "combating digital dictatorship, affirming democratic values", stressing that Taiwan is at the forefront of fighting dictatorship and power.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the new crown epidemic through transparency of information and building mutual trust.
He said: "As democracy flourished in Taiwan, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of global confrontation against authoritarianism, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the period of the epidemic, powerful governments in various parts of the country rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the outbreak without sealing the city, and we can defeat false information without falling behind. "
As the "Democracy Summit" went on its second day, the U.S. Treasury announced the imposition of sanctions under the law on 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea and other countries found guilty of gross human rights violations, as well as the imposition of investment restrictions on a Chinese company found using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why the delivery time is constantly delayed
Turns out #NUMBER#
Anyway, I won't scream anymore.
I don't want to eat it.
I'm sure to complain.
You can't deliver it. Why didn't you say so earlier?
I waited so long for you.
No, I didn't get the call.
Please inform him to send it back to our company.
I don't want to wait another minute #NUMBER#
One meal waits an hour and a half.
#PS_ORG# has not been delivered
I want to cancel the order.
Why didn't you cancel it?
Hello. The saliva chicken from the restaurant is born.
I wanted to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to hold on to it, so I wanted to find a practicer at a similar price first.
In fact, prices tend to be proportional to the degree of friendship. If it cannot be distinguished, then the expensive normal conditions will be more friendly than the cheap shoots. Such "entry shoots" are industrial garbage.
They're very low-intensity, they hit the beat, they're very vibrating, they can't hold a hard ball, and it's hard for them to drive.
Their logic and subterranean language are -- it's so hard to learn from tennis, you know you can't learn from it, you know you can't afford to buy expensive things, and you can't play twice, so you won't fight again. So you don't feel
When you really can tell what's good and what's bad, it means you've made progress. Then I'll buy expensive ones from you. I'll make twice.
It is recommended that the flowers should have a similar price, buy a better second-hand bat, and choose a Prente or Dunlop. These two brands are famous enough. Therefore, they can't sell the price. The new 500s and 600s are fine. The second-hand 200
It's kind of friendly to newcomers, but it's hard to get along as soon as they pass the newcomer phase, but most people, especially girls, can't get through the newcomer phase.
The order has repeatedly delayed delivery time
May I help you follow up on this?
Postponed
Thank you.
So, actually, I already had credit?
Do I need to reschedule next? Did I forget about that one?
Hello, order the food of the restaurant, but there's a lot of food missing from the delivery, and the saliva chicken is born.
#PS_ORG# said for no reason that I wanted to take it myself. Please cancel.
The only thing I'm asking for is delivery. There's no such thing as taking care of myself.

Hello, how long before the order arrives?
She's finished already.
Your rider's phone is #PHONEUMBER#, named #NAME#
Please give me a reasonable answer.
Yes, but your rider is very problematic. Please handle it properly.
Can you check if you're still on the way? If you can, it's best to deliver.
OK, if you don't have it, return the money you ordered.
In fact, there is a lot to be said about girls who are slightly fat wearing clothes and matching them.
Fat girls can't wear skirts that are too short or too long, are about the length of their knees, just to cover their fat thighs.
If the dress is short, it shows the obesity of the legs.
Being too long gives people the feeling of being short and fat.
If you wear the top, bottom, and bottom, it looks like you've grown up naturally. It looks like the upper body, skirts, and stockings have different colours, and it looks like they've grown.
In fact, many of the dark-coloured clothes are the labels of the little fat girls, which the author knows very well, and the dark colors are the good way to cover up your fat body. The noble black skirt is also the preferred choice for the little girls.
Putting on dark-coloured clothes, especially black skirts, makes you feel thinner.
If your legs are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too carefree.
The more popular, the better, the less colorful.
To avoid being obese when people pay attention to your legs and feet.
For a slightly fat girl, you must tell her the trick of wearing clothes and matching them.
Do not wear tight skirts for the little girls, and if the tops are not too short or stuck in the skirts, it's uncomfortable to see them. If the legs are thick, you should wear black stockings or mesh stockings (Oxy)
Of course, the chubby girl is also suspicious on short skirts.
Fat girls wear short skirts and should choose the shirts the same color as the skirts, which will increase your fat body's height.
Short skirts with heels make your legs look longer, but it's the most in the summer!
If you're a fat MM with a thin leg, you're recommended to choose a gorgeous short dress.
It will not only cover up the belly, but also show your virtues.
The A-word skirt will be thin, more suitable for a fat girl, and the top will have to choose a tight one, and the level will become thinner.
Simple white T-shirts are coupled with short skirts, and the fat MM can try as well.
Little fat girls are also able to wear fashion.
As long as they master the rules of dressing and matching, the little fat girls will also be the focus of attention.
After changing the dress mix, we also need to exercise more in our lives to get rid of the labels of the little girls a day earlier.

The League played a role in driving the young Beijing hockey movement, fueling the enthusiasm for winter Olympic hockey, and laying the foundation for the development of Beijing hockey in the post-winter Olympic period.
The girl raised money for her sister as a target: "It's okay to think it's a flesh wound." - Xinhuanet
A girl in Wulin Square, Hangzhou, stood in front of a big board with the words “human meat targets, ten dollar arrows”.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl as an "earball target" to raise money for her sister" swiped the circle of friends.
Photos show that a girl standing in front of a bigger board slightly taller than the human being at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, with the words "human meat targets, ten dollar arrows" on the board, may shoot with bows and arrows when the passersby pays.
The behavior provoked online enthusiasts.
Last night, the chief of propaganda of the lower city division of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the reporter of the Beijing newspaper that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an aggressive move to raise money for her sister, but that such actions were not worthy of promotion. After warning, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girls' street "balls and arrows" were warned to raise money
A long-haired girl stands in front of a big board with black ink with the words "human flesh target, ten dollar arrow" in her online photo. She has her bank account and WeChat on another board in front of her.
The image became controversial when it was posted online.
Some online friends believed that the move was a "gagging act with the eyes" and many others sympathized with it.
"We discovered what happened when we patroled the side of the square around 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and there were already a lot of people watching. "
During an interview with the local media at Tianhai Police Station near the incident, the civilian police said that the girls in the stands were two, both of whom were about 20 years old, and dressed young and handsome.
Among them, the girl who works as a "human target" has been crying, begging for the roadman to play the game; the other girl helped to drink, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia and is in urgent need of surgery fees, so please help.
"We contacted local police in Guizhou to learn that the girl was collecting funds for her sister's treatment of leukemia. "
Last night, the chief of propaganda of the lower city division of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the reporter of the Beijing newspaper that the girl was named Ji Ji Jianli and raised funds for her sister Ji Ji Jia Yan.
However, because treatment still requires more than 300,000 dollars, it was not possible to raise funds in good ways to do so.
He said that during the whole process, two girls, one of whom was responsible for the shooting, were not involved, and no arrows were found during the whole process. It was only someone who watched and took pictures and sent them to the microblog.
Later, the police were certified by the security department, and the bows and arrows used did not fall under the control category.
The person in charge said, "This kind of eye-to-eye fund-raising is not promoted."
She left the station after being warned by police officers of the station.
Heating effects: Good, lighter: easy to look at material quality: satisfactory and always high value for money.
The new machine is very good.
The performance is stable, the four excursions will be fine and worthy of recommendation.
The Golden Shadow Knight Dragon Game is a fine game. It's a good job, and it's a good job. Don't worry about the brand!
The price of the Golden Shadow Knight Dragon is still not very expensive.
Personally, it feels that the Golden Shadow Knight Dragon is really good, and the effect of the game is really good: the game works well, it can play most games, my chickens are full-high, the frame rate is stable, the flow rate is very smooth, the lol is unspoken, and the CSgo is
Heating effects: The radiation effect is good, the fans are strong, the work is quiet, and the game is still not too bad.
Appearance material: The look is cool, the game's coolness shows the effect: the screen is clear and the game is 1080 is enough
It's really nice to buy notebooks. It's mostly designed, and it's cheaper than you think, and it's nicer than you think. The red on your ass is a beautiful wine color. It's not so cheesy, it's much higher than expected
It took two years to reach out to Lungi's Nightrider two years ago, and the price is higher and the quality is too hard!
Friends around me recommend that they buy the product!
This series of three machines has been purchased to date!
It looks beautiful, and it's well configured.
He bought it for his nephew, who wanted to wait for the 418 bank event, so he bought it ahead of time, so it's a bit regrettable that he didn't catch up with the big bank event.
However, the price is high, and the logistics is fast. Take some time to follow the evaluation.
In the new original, a game laptop with an overpriced character has been designed in a very good design style and has been installed in Windows11 and office 2019
Show effects: A child is bought for 3D rendering, the software is self-loaded, the child says it can be used without problems, and the computer can perform 3D design work.
For his son, he said it was good.
Computers are good, especially for customer service. It's good to ask if you don't understand. It's recommended for purchase.
It's not bad. The quality of playing games is real.
What's the hottest thing in 2021?
There's no doubt it's the Tokyo Olympics.
You think only healthy Olympics can win prizes?
In the previous period, the article "Look at it! The Olympic project where the project manager can hit the gold medal" was hot. It mentioned that the project manager could definitely take the lead on many projects: moving bricks, going on business, staying up all night is the daily work of the project manager,
The day-to-day irritation of project managers is also reflected in a punctuated article, which represents a lack of commitment to the current project management effort.
Those involved in project management are also gradually choosing to take some action to get themselves out of the difficult situation at work.
A growing number of project management practitioners are upgrading their project management capacity through learning, as measured by the number of registered PMPs (international certified project management professionals) that rise each year.
According to China’s 20-Year Development Report on Project Management (1999-2019): As of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP examinations nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of valid witnesses was about 420,000 through PMP certification, the number of valid witnesses was about 300,000, and accounted for
The number of PMP holders has increased year by year over the past 10 years, which means that more project managers realize that it is no longer desirable to do things by simply reproducing the old experience. The rapidly changing working environment allows us to learn and stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can project management be assured by the PMP test?
Many project management beginners said that by studying relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, the relevant knowledge points such as the ten major areas of project management and the five process groups can be systematically captured, but the real project management work can still be lost.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following issues: project management perceptions are not in place, they rely solely on personal experience, project management theory is empty, and they don't know how to do it; there is no systematic project management process system support, work cannot land, project predictions are
Thus, with more than 10 places devoted to product innovation and R & D management, many outstanding enterprises have been helped to develop a large number of key R & D talents such as product managers and project managers, and have obtained the Chinese Tianhua summer consultancy with the Special Training Camp of R & D project managers
The online course "Research and Development Project Manager Special Training Camp" is a way of online debris learning that combines the actual war cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and take the path of your own project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and fewer inputs to promote the development process of project managers and bring efficient operational outcomes to enterprises.
There is no basis for saying that it would be useful to see how other cadets will evaluate the course: the course will not only be conducted in depth and light professionally by the expert team of China’s Tianhuaxia (formerly the R&D management team), in conjunction with advanced international project management methodology theory and the real business scene of many well-known enterprises.
It also provides scientific and practical management tools and methods, and has a rich template form to help participants translate what they learn into specific jobs after class.
There's only one order for a shrimp dumpling?
Why are there six of them?
Jieshin’s “Double 12” Eve advocates rational consumption to consumers - Economic Watch - professional financial news website
This year’s “Double 11” Carnival National Network paid the transaction amount of 1.77 trillion yuan, which is higher than that of previous years.
Once again, consumers benefited from the live feed and delivery of the varied and full-scale red package. On the one hand, this popular consumption trend exemplifies the growing strength of national consumption and, on the other hand, has to calmly think about the impact of consumerism on society as well as on the contemporary
On the eve of the arrival of the "Double Twelve", Tzeixin Consumer Finance Co. Ltd (hereinafter referred to as "Jeixin") launched a rational consumption advocacy alerting users, especially young people, to develop good consumption awareness and habits, and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the "Investigation Report on Consumer Financial Literacy" released by the People's Bank this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, our inhabitants perform well at the level of financial consumption, but there are significant differences in different aspects of financial behaviour and skills, and there is a need to further upgrade the level of basic financial knowledge.
The level of financial literacy among the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one year olds and one year olds" will continue to be the focus of sustained attention in financial education; the report on the status of China's young indebtedness issued by Nelson and the report on China's youth consumption issued by
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jie Xin has always worked to help build a happy life for ordinary people with high-quality and thoughtful services, advocated for consumers to develop good and correct consumption perceptions, and responded positively to regulatory calls to raise the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, through practical actions.
Over the past few years, Jie Xin has constantly carried out comprehensive and diversified financial literacy activities for young people, including university students, and helped young people to develop rational consumption concepts and plan consumption demand by launching innovation and practice competitions and other forms of latent migration in cooperation with the country's top
On the occasion of the arrival of the Second World Congress, Jiaxin reminded all consumer friends to establish a reasonable sense of consumption and correct monetary perception, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid consumer lending error, so as not to affect individual letters and future economic life.
Consumption must be planned in advance and repaid in a timely manner.
If overdue, the overdue records will be recorded in individual credit reports, which may have adverse effects on future economic life such as car purchases, home purchases, etc.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, we should also choose the formal institutions and channels and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate.
In the future, Jie Xin will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated financial products to bring consumer services that are more relevant to the needs and diversity, constantly help the general public raise the level of financial knowledge, help consumers develop the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and become consumer financial partners that consumers can rely on

Vietnam People's News Network - Gulf Cooperation Council to meet common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Ben Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first time that Crown Prince Mohammed has visited Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in 2017, which led to a crisis in Gulf diplomacy.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations while having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, and the Gulf countries signed an agreement to move from the United States and Kuwait to "united and stable".
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar through their appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab States resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar from the demands that must be united for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, with the aim of meeting common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land passage between two neighbouring Gulf States.
The corridor connecting the two countries for a distance of 725 km will facilitate the travel and integration of the supply chain of the citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, with enterprises in both countries signing 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincided with negotiations between Iran and the world's major powers to salvage the Iran nuclear agreement known as JCPOA, an agreement condemned by the Gulf Arab States for not being able to resolve the issue of Iranian missiles.
The Gulf States have always regarded Iran as a "competitor" for a long time, and have regarded Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf States believe that there are shortcomings in not resolving the Iranian missile problem and not taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
In the context of the failure of the major Powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf States in nuclear negotiations with Iran, Saudi Arabia has engaged in direct negotiations with Iran.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows down economic growth in GCC countries.
The forthcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since the dispute between some member countries and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the GCC unification, and to propose measures to enable its member countries to cooperate fully to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

The car that our team brought to us this time is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship, Murcielago's replacement model -- Avantador LP 700-4!
The price is nearly 2 million RMK, 10 thousand RMK per year, 4x4 driving, and why is it called LP7000?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
The data says 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, and probably the editor's Myvi reached 30km/h at 100km/h.
The low body of the car, the loud scissors door, the huge vents all around the car, and the glass's endless 6.5 v12 engine have perfected the Ramborgini style.
You don't have to say too much about the car fare. It's fine to google yourself and make up a few explanations that Google doesn't necessarily give!
Too much attention. Everyone is watching wherever they go. It's very uncomfortable! (It's kind of cool.)
1km oil money is around RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all)
Get up and get out of the car and practice it or it'll be a little awkward.
The engine sounds too loud and deaf after getting out of the car. (It's still cool though)
The car is too big to park in a normal parking lot. It's afraid to be knocked down by the next car when it opens!
It's a little lonely because there's no rival on the road.
Don't get me wrong. This video overrun is not for sale. Sorry!
Friends who want to film for your car are welcome to contact us!
More car information you don't know is on The Car Guide/People's Autobot
It's worth millions of dollars involved in a car accident!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe their friends know Chiron is one of the most expensive overruns in the world, and the price of Portsche 911 is also million!
A few minutes ago, millions of sports cars were hit abroad, 9/11 and millions more overrun Chiron!
Look at the results, it makes sense!
Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the time resonance with the spirit of the time - Xinhuanet
The spirit of the university means a series of school concepts and values developed by a university over a long period of time in the course of its development. It is the spirit of the university.
From ancient times to present, the spirit of universities has been crucial to the political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological, social development, and even the progress of a people.
From the birth of the world’s first university in the modern sense, the university has taken on a unique mission that is different from that of other social organizations. For our university, the spirit of the people’s dangerous autumn has been deeply affected by traditional culture and changing times, advocating the idea of
At present, the trend towards information and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly evident. At the global level, education competition, science and technology competition, and talent competition are increasing. As an important "supply side" of higher education, its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the General Programme for Integrated Promotion of the Construction of World First-class Universities and First-class Studies demonstrated the confidence and determination of our country to move from a large country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, and made a higher demand for university development.
How do we strive to make the world’s most popular class in a relatively short period of time, speed up the construction of a number of world’s leading universities and a number of world’s leading disciplines on the basis of still a certain gap, and achieve a "crowding overcarrying"?
In addition to firm self-confidence in goals, path confidence, and ability confidence, the university should fully exploit three advantages: first, it should achieve a significant improvement in academic level and quality by continuously introducing outstanding academic talent abroad, learning from the best experience of world first-class universities, and second, it should
It is particularly important to realize that building world-class universities cannot afford to have a single face, and that schools must show their personality and identity while taking advantage.
The characteristics of schools must be both common Chinese characteristics and reflect their unique goals, school traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on highlighting three special features in our schools: first, to highlight the characteristics of innovative entrepreneurial development, build an integrated parenting environment for science and education integration and school enterprises integration, and form a whole chain of entrepreneurship education ecosystems; second, to highlight the
In this process, it is particularly important to maintain the spirit of the university and keep the spirit of the university in line with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the “Creating for Innovation” school training, the common values of “Careful Learning, Sider, Clearness, Truth”, and the common values of “Heine River, Qingjin-Hy
This is an important guarantee that the school adheres to the right course of school, and constantly accumulates the high cultural level and the strength of spiritual cohesion, and is rich in content and far-reaching.
Among them, the "Heinar River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and tolerance, reflecting the heart of "the talent of the world for me" and manifesting itself as drawing on the high-quality ideas of the world's famous school providers; "The spirit of enlightenment" emphasizes the spirit of
This series of spiritual ideas and values pursue the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
"The deaf listen to the silence, and the obvious see no form."
The Chinese University of Higher Education should build further on the overall picture of socialism with Chinese characteristics, take a deep grasp of the age and historical mission of higher education, and speed up the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, upholding the humanistic care and independence and allowing the spirit of the university to interact with the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation, thus providing an inexhaustible impetus to achieve the country's prosperity and national revival, as well as the common ideals of mankind.

The encryption community came up with a new concept at the NFT.
In 2021, a block chain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in South-East Asia, where some residents who lost jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a steady income.
"Axie Infinity" is a game of pets at the bottom of the block chain technology, which brings together a variety of methods including NFT, and is currently the highest transaction amount NFT project, which currently stands at more than $3 billion.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, pushing the King's Glory.
On August 6 this year, Axie Information officially stated that it has over 1 million live users.
The passion of Axie Infinity sends a new "pallytoearn" model to more people. By helping with block chains and smart contracts, players no longer have a single role and can participate in the governance of game ecology in addition to having fun and economic benefits from the game
This primaryity is not awarded by the game maker, but guaranteed by block chain technology.
Seeing a news about the share price of friends, my biggest feeling is the choice of enterprises on the track, i.e. the choice of industries that point to investment targets, first, the choice of industries that grow in space, at least 100 billion market sizes; second, the choice of industries that will grow well in the future,
The extent of the track refers to the size of the market, the length of the track refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or bumpy refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
To the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The strategy lies in "do the things right," which means doing the right thing.
And the strategy lies in "do the right thing," which means doing the right thing.
The strategy lies in finding direction, and the strategy lies in landing, and there is space for strategic thinking above most of the tactical thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), it is possible to think about whether to continue deepening in the current area or extending in the horizontal area (strategy thinking); for example, to raise the retention rate of customers (tactical thinking), it is possible to think about how to increase the retention rate of core and high-value customers (tactical thinking)
Twelve years after birth, Bitcoin reached several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small country in Central America, defined Bitcoin as the legal currency, which was the first time Bitcoin became a national or regional currency.

The full visual wedding dress photo base (Hebei Shop) has not yet had a branch for the time being
The wedding dress front guard and the make-up artist are also the top of the list. The technique and angle of the film is a profession, and the shot is very effective.
Very creditworthy sellers also have a good service attitude.
The make-up is excellent, the team service is good. The trip was fun, the professional team was good, the sellers were good, and the friends were happy.
Thanks to photographers and cosmetics, I have a unique wedding picture.
Thank all the staff who took wedding pictures today and look forward to the film.
Filming the wedding dress is a physical effort, especially by the photographer, who runs and jumps.
The make-up artist has helped me design a face fit for my face. The photographer's big brother deserves to be commended for being funny when he shoots it.
Thanks to my photographers and cosmeticians, I can still see how beautiful I can be in my lifetime.
The woman's eyes are beautiful and well-looking, and she is a good wife and mother, so she can support her family logistically.
The groom has earned a lifetime of happiness and beauty.
The wedding dress picture is really good quality, like online saying, I'm handsome and beautiful with my lover, and we're satisfied.
The seller's service attitude is also warm.
This trip not only admired the beauty, but also took beautiful wedding pictures, and also met the photographer's best friend.
The wedding pictures are beautiful. Blow-blow photographers and make-up men, you're really super-super-professionals.
Thank you very much for your patience and guidance. I love the pictures.
The moment I saw the wedding photo, I didn't recognize myself.
As long as photographers choose well, you can also have wedding photos comparable to stars.
It's more important to take a wedding picture that both the photographer and the makeup artist are praising the beauty online. Fortunately, I met.
After seeing my wedding dress picture, I found out that I was also "deception."
U.S. Asian group complains about discrimination against students at three Ivyu famous schools, including Yale - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian groups in the United States submitted complaints to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting the discrimination of Asian applicants in the admission process at Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Educational Coalition, which led the petition, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The group's president, Zhao Woohong, said at the launch meeting that the number of Asian applicants who met the conditions for admission to the U.S. Famous Colleges has multiplied over the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in these three U.S. schools has remained essentially at the same level.
Many studies show that these colleges, in the process of enrolling in so-called "comprehensive examination", "have a long-term continuity and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants".
Zhao Woonon said that studies by scholars such as Sanders in 2014 showed that Asians had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups compared to the number of applicants in these three colleges.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also showed that Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest rate of admission for Asian students in all Ivy League schools, and Yale University and Brown University had implemented a de facto racial quota for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Woonon told Xinhua reporters that they expected the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice to launch an investigation after filing a complaint, and after establishing the facts, take measures to prevent these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions.
They also expect that the complained college will proactively pay attention to this issue and change the admission policy for Asians.
At present, three institutions of higher learning have not responded to the complaints.
The Asian Education Union was founded in 2015, when it complained of discrimination in admission to Harvard University, but was not accepted by the U.S. Department of Education on procedural grounds.
This time, in addition to the U.S. Chinese group, it includes the American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani education groups.

In September 2020, Mr Lu learned from the house broker that the plant was located in Yao Qin Town, Yu of Zhejiang. After looking at the building on site several times, Mr Lu decided to buy the plant.
In December of the same year, after consulting with the family of the owner of the house Lin regarding the details of the purchase of the plant, Mr Lu made a down payment of RMB200,000 through bank transfer on the same day.
"If the buyer doesn't want to buy the plant, the deposit goes to the seller. If the seller doesn't want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned double to the seller. The parties agreed to sign the contract within one week.
However, subsequently, the parties failed to reach agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the sale of the plant and the manner of payment, which delayed the signing of the purchase and sale contract.
Considering that the parties were unable to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, Lin had returned the down payment of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu a few days later.
It was hard to see the house, the deposit was paid, and the money was ready, so the seller had to sign the contract "come to the door," but the seller didn't sell it, which caused Mr. Lui to be helpless and angry.
To that end, Mr. Lu had sued Lin Xiao Xiao’s People’s Court.
After trial, the court held that the parties could not ultimately conclude a formal contract, that they could not simply blame the defendant, and that it should reasonably be assumed that the consultation was not possible. Therefore, the down payment penalty should not apply in this case, and the defendant should not bear the liability of double
After the first instance judgement, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the sentence.
[Counsel's reminder] Do what is necessary to exercise due diligence in the course of the transaction.
When signing a contract, as a buyer, you must exercise the necessary due diligence obligations, such as verifying the owner's information, whether or not the house is occupied, and specifying the exact time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the parties during the performance of the contract.
(Voice of Germany in Chinese) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, the spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Leader's Democracy Summit", which was "an ideological drawing, instrumentalizing, weaponizing,
The Chinese government believes that "the United States has long imposed its own political system and philosophy of values, pursued "democratic transformation" and imposed arbitrary unilateral sanctions, and instigated a "color revolution" with disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long become 'weapons of mass destruction' for the US intervention in other countries. '
The summit was a move by Biden to honour his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting took place via video, and 111 leaders from countries around the world, including Taiwan, were invited, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for having problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States was not in a position to host such a summit.
At the international level, and in the United States, there are doubts, for example, that some leaders with authoritarian tendencies such as the Philippines, Poland and Brazil have been criticized for having been invited to attend the summit, some doubting that the true intentions of the Biden government were not for the sake of democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
German Chancellor Scholz, who has just taken office, also participated in the video democracy summit
The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on Saturday said that " Today's US-style democracy is very sick, and issues such as money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social fragmentation, race conflict, and the division of wealth and wealth are growing." American democracy is a "rich game based on capital
President Biden said in his speech, "As leaders of the government, it is our duty to listen to our citizens, strengthen the shield of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, better defend against the forces of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not supposed to be, "I think it is a defining challenge of our time that we must constantly update each generation. "
Biden added that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy at a time of persistent and worrying challenges."
The United States, for its part, promised to launch a year-long action following this democracy summit, with an initiative of $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve its democratic system before the entity democracy summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all implement our commitments and report on our progress next year. "

Juni's red-coded whiskey is made of approximately 35 different types of Scotch, which has the characteristics of strong yummy aroma and traditional Scotch, with sweet and smokey flavour in the fragrance.
The entrance is fresh with vanilla and strong sprouts of smoked wheat.
The wine can be consumed directly with ice or mixed with the favorite drink.
Red whiskey has entered the country, and in order to adapt to Chinese tastes, red whiskey + cola or snowy or new Queens have become a long-standing fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to being moderate and acidic, bring joy to the eyes, join the drinks, and have the effect of diluting the taste.
Red whiskey + sliced lemon + sugar (and sugar ) is the most authentic and traditional drink.
The real red square is a bit sour, adding sugar to the sour taste that can be middlened in it, and the lemon brings fresh flavour to the wine. Of course, the sweetness can be adjusted according to the personal taste.
All three are the best drinking methods for red-card whiskey, and it is hoped that the introduction by the editor will help if you try to use it as a reference.
Educational reflection: How the university exam will allow the Xinhua Network to benefit the Xinhua Masters and the Xinhua Dynasty (Xinhua Network) and the Xinhua Dynasty (Xinhua Network)
Three Lanzhou Transport University students wrote letters to the school's leadership, reflecting confusion over the university examination, and raised the challenge of making the examination more difficult, changing the subject type of examination, and allowing the examination to truly reflect the student's actual level of demand.
Indeed, university examinations have long been a "hot topic".
On university campuses, students come from all regions and cities, with varying levels of competence, combined with different levels of study, and learning varies greatly.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings for people with so many characteristics to test.
Of course, if the test topics are single and repeat rates are high, and the topics are too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who do not have merit may be able to perform a concentrated strike before examination, and if they think of other ways, it is possible to achieve a double effect.
As a result, “learning scum” can generally pass without input, and even get high scores; “learning master” can never drop out, work and take notes are good, and the test is not much higher than the “eccentric state of affairs”.
In this way, Lanzhou’s transition student reflects that the problems in the university examination are not without cause. It is believed that this situation does not exist only in Lanzhou.
In this sense, we would like to commend the three students who wrote directly.
In fact, it is clear to all those who have gone to university that it is not unusual to make a raid to prepare for the examination, to find ways to "take" the test from the teacher, to try to define the scope of the examination, and to obtain "privileged counselling" before seeking the examination. Even the
In my view, as a teaching quality assessment guide, measuring the qualification of a university examination lies in the teachers' overall control over teaching and learning, as well as the scientific propositions based on it.
After entering the undergraduate phase, the specialization started to be broken down, and many professional courses were based on basic knowledge.
Needless to say, whether or not to fully master the basic knowledge points of a discipline is part of the university examination.
While undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of disciplines, from the point of knowledge, there is not much room for change, and it is basically fixed.
As teachers say, "The basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago is still being studied, and is still a priority. "
However, the knowledge points remain essentially the same, and do not represent a single examination title and a repetition of test topics.
In many universities, the examination will generally be part of the problem group, and then the examination will be made by senior teachers of the discipline. The examination will also be attended by all teachers who are responsible for the section, so that the duplication of the test will be overcome to some extent.
However, it is necessary to develop a set of test topics that are consistent with the teaching and learning reality. Depending on the student’s overall learning situation, it is difficult to present a normal distribution of topics. It is also necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation and a comprehensive analysis of the student’s learning level, so that the
The examination is the baton of university education. With what kind of examination, students will have the corresponding preparation programme. In the long run, it will affect the success of university education.
For the student's advice letter, Lanzhou University attaches great importance to it and has deployed a programme of rectification throughout the school.
The teaching units are required to organize the teachers to conduct the examination and final examination against themselves, develop the test papers and related system, and strengthen the supervision and inspection of the test papers and the audit process, fine-tune the evaluation of achievements, and strengthen the comprehensive examination of all course and teaching components of the curriculum.
Institutional solutions to problems such as the single type of test topics and repeated topics are the subjects that university examinations have to face. The corresponding systems need to be put in place. However, kung fu is very expensive in the day to day, and teachers need to have full knowledge of the teaching situation, not only to eat the teaching content, but also
If it's not possible to change the location of the branch for me, can it be changed to delivery?
So I don't have to pay more, do I?
Colleagues' orders have been delivered
We can't finish it.
Where's GPS? Has it arrived yet?
Mrs. Kim's wedding dress photo (South Street) has not yet had a branch for the time being
Before the photograph was taken, because we weren't scheduled, we changed the time twice, and Lanlan, the consultant, patiently helped us with the time.
Later, a good weather weekend was chosen.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether it's a consultant, a cosmetician or a photographer, are amazing.
It was my first official make-up in my life. I can't believe it. I'm going to look so good one day.
Xiaojie and another girl (I'm sorry I can't remember my name) make-up is super patient and natural.
The view was taken in River Bay City. Fortunately, the weather was good. It didn't feel cold. During the photo shoot, the make-up artist kept an eye on our clothes from time to time, and the headdressing was slightly bad.
The photographer was also very funny, and it was fun to take pictures all day long.
When the photos were selected, because there were many cases online that didn't want the guests to delete the photos, but when we picked the pictures, it really didn't mean anything, and there were 24 of them in the package, none of them.
The photos were fixed today, and Lanlan sent them to me. Two of them I didn't feel so good about. They immediately helped me repair them.
If you compare the pictures taken by your sister, I think we're really happy with them, and that's what I want.
With all due respect, we recommend that Mrs Han King take the wedding dress photo!
Set price: RMB3999
Mrs. Kim is grateful for your sincere wishes for happiness and great future!
How much is this?

Sabah 3,200 newborn babies have no paper for birth due to special anti-false paper
The Sabah National Registration Bureau said that due to the use of special anti-false paper stocks, it has not been possible to issue birth paper to the newborn child since early October. To date, the number of people affected has reached 3,200.
However, Kerouaminus, the director of the Bureau, promised that all babies who had applied for birth paper had their data on the system, and that they would be re-released when counterfeit paper arrived next week.
He explained during a press conference about a 10-month report on the printing of Sabah newspaper paper by an online media.
He said that the problem had arisen two months ago, and Shalagan faced the same problem.
"One reason for this is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-false paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in China. "
He explained that Sabah paper used anti-false paper differently from other regions, so it could not borrow stock belonging to other states.
Kailu'aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-false paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th to carry out some printing work.
"The Bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, return to Sabah to carry out the final printing immediately, and it is estimated that it will be able to deliver them to the applicant for another 2 working days (20 December). "
"We will notify the applicant to go to all local stations to pick up the paper. "
He added that Sabah has sent a total of 24,801 papers to date this year.

Super convenient, like opening on a computer, solves the problem of my computer's lack of hard disk
The brand new solid-state move hard disk today. Mobile solid-state hard-disk computers cannot be read. Mobile solid hard-disk computers are not recognized but can be read using U-disk computers.
The machine's hands are light and look at the atmosphere and beauty.
It was used for one afternoon, and the heat was very good. It was hardly hot, it was fast, and 99% of users were killed in the opening second.
The battery is also strong, waiting for nine hours, and there should be no problem in using four hours. In any case, the price of this quality machine is very happy, and the other functions will be supplemented later.
Nice look.
With regard to performance, it will be evaluated over a period of time.
The machine is fast, bigger than you can imagine, and the grooves of the effects are rendered. Like it, it will wait a while to review it.
Not bad. The machine's serial number was checked in Hong Kong** and its quality should be OK.
** It's not big, it's heavy, it's not really big, it's just a little bit bigger than 15.6 inches, it's really stable, it's not like it's Catton, it's loveful of fans, it's
It's good stuff, it's cheaper than the official flagship shop, and it's got a backpack. I think it's nice.
The shopkeeper service was good, reminding me to update Bios and open it in time. **
Worth it!

Credible sellers carefully check the appearance of the entire machine, and all interfaces, without any traces of refurbished or used, are indeed brand-new American machines with the same configuration as pages.
I forgot to send a backpack, and immediately reissued a backpack for me. Although it was not the original backpack, the service follow-up proved enough to be a conscience seller.
If any friend has to buy a notebook, then buy back.
Appearance material quality: Appearance atmosphere displays effects: screen resolution is possible, clear, lighter: more qualitative, after all, the heavier things feel better.
The radiation effect: I've just started trying and I'll re-evaluate it later.
Keyboard typing is pretty good, and a mouse and converter have been sent. This configuration is still very cost-effective compared to the state business. In general, it is cheap and beautiful, and the machine performance will be evaluated after a certain period of time.
The screen is really comfortable!
It's easy to use it. Take some time to follow it up!

48-hour negative nucleic acid and "buffer zone"
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporter Dong Rufeng, Gu Tiansheng) The State Council's joint anti-pneumonia disease control mechanism issued a notice to strengthen the prevention and control of the new coronary pneumonia outbreak in port cities, requiring people who leave land border crossing cities (except those with ports in Hong Kong and Macao) to hold them within 48 hours
According to the notification, the time frame of the above request is from the date that provincial and district cities determine the scope of the port city and announce it, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notification also suggested that a conditional port city could study setting a buffer zone for outbreak prevention and control in the jurisdiction.
The relevant head of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health and Health Commission said that for some border-crossing cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy.
It is hoped that the implementation of the zoning differential management policy will be transformed from a prevention and control spillover line to two lines of defense. It is hoped that the border will move ahead, reduce the risk of overflow of the epidemic, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of disease prevention with minimum social impact and minimum social costs.
Recently, there have been a number of home-grown concentrated epidemics in China, all of which are imported via port cities.
The said notification pointed out that it revealed a number of problems such as the untimely monitoring and early warning of local outbreaks, the non-implementation of closed loop management of high-risk jobs, the regular detection flow of nucleic acid in form, the lack of availability of cold chain items, the irregular
The notification requires that efforts be made in nine areas from improving the border city disease prevention and control mechanism, improving the disease surveillance and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the completion of the short control plate in the port city, without relaxation, scientific precision, and proper prevention and control work, and
The notice stressed that the border cities should synchronize the research and simultaneous deployment of the prevention and control of the epidemic with the work of the protection of human life, publish and open the hotline for the protection of human life, regularly check the emerging problems of the supply of basic living materials, prices, etc., and promptly resolve and proactively respond to the
According to the notification, the port cities referred to therein include open land, water routes, aviation ports located in counties (municipality, region, flag), local cities (state, state, union) and directly under the Central Government, with the specific scope determined by the provinces (autonomous regions,

Oil pipe video from 20 years of bloodthirsty killing in the U.S. Army - Xinhuanet
(video source: pipeline)
On December 11, a micro-record film called "The Killing Machine" in a pipeline platform attracted widespread attention.
The film described the war launched by the United States in Afghanistan in the name of "combating terrorism", forcibly exporting U.S.-style democracy through war, committing various crimes against humanity after 20 years of militarism, bloodthirsty, and indiscriminate killing of innocent people.
Misuse of drone strikes on hospitals, schools, and other civilian places to distort humanity and set up a homicide team.
Over the past 20 years, United States troops have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military has set up a "black cell" to inflict all kinds of torture and physical humiliation on "suspects".
A crime against humanity stirs up hatred among more Afghans.
As the video says, the U.S. war on terrorism is "fearing back and forth".
The war did not give the Afghan people hope for peace, democracy and prosperity, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Let's stick to the video, let's tell the truth about the United States in the name of "anti-terrorism", the bloodthirsty killing, and the false face of U.S.-style democracy!
Unwittingly, I saw the following article about why the customer wanted the logistics company in the insurance area to make cans from the perspective of business and the preservation period. Although the canner was deeply processed and not part of the operation of the insurance logistics company, the following text might explain why the customer wanted to do so.
I went to many milk powder manufacturers to contact many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the bags are exactly the same as the powdered milk and their raw materials, and there is no difference.
Then people will certainly ask: Why is the package quality period one year and the listening quality period two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between a bag and a bag so large?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, start from this point of view, believe that the quality of the raw materials is much better because they are different.
In fact, the raw materials are just as good as what everyone thinks is expensive.
There are consumers who, after eating it out of their mentality, say that the taste or taste of the costume is different!
Now I'm going to tell everyone why I'm so expensive. Where's expensive?
Why is the price difference so large for their same raw materials?
Because when pricing, the majority of manufacturers consider that it is difficult for consumers to accept a bag price if it is too high, which means that the manufacturer produces very low profits, or no profits, so how can the manufacturer survive?
So they have a big increase in the price of their suits to guarantee their profit space.
So most manufacturers push for ears instead of bags.
And how do you expect so many manufacturers to pay tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars for advertising each year?
As you can imagine.
As society develops, the market’s promotion costs, such as market promoters, mall display costs, product gift costs, advertising costs, etc., are also increasing.
So the manufacturers are constantly adding new items, as well as listening, and their prices are constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product as market costs increase.
The main aim is to obtain higher profits, but the cost of increasing their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There is also a portion of brands that, in order to promote their own products, do whatever it takes to connect with doctors at hospitals, and they will assist in the promotion of their products, drawing profits ranging from $30 to $80 from one ear to 80 yuan.
The relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such operational methods and methods, which in fact harm consumers.
It is recommended that the milk powder that buys the bag should be placed in the can, so as to save costs, and increase the preservation and sealability of the powder, which has no effect on the children.
Also, let's not think that the quality period of a listening package is longer than that of a bag. If it is the same as that of a bag after a package is opened, it is simply said that it is not easy to save it after a bag is opened, and it is easy to

Don't scare people down on the starting line - Xinhuanet
When visiting the book market, the fire of successful books can often be felt.
Many of today’s successful books promote the “best principles” – that is, to assume or suggest that you can “do” and then tell you what you need to do.
It's tantamount to saying that it crossed the "how" link, which is really the most important and fundamental.
That's why all these books share a common feature – either doing what you can best, or doing nothing at all; either 100 or 0; or you can climb a mountain or you can just stay put.
This "best principle" allows anyone to admit "right" but 99% of people will be scared to the start line.
Because this theory promotes a path of "repute with determination, re-establish yourself, and bring about a 180 degree transformation," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who follow the rules, follow the old rules and reject change, you should shout "you want to change" in his ear, which is no doubt an act of self-deception and deludement against the cow.
The vast majority of people would be timid in the face of the word "transformation" and it would be difficult to make a determination; or it would be a moment of impulsiveness to take the "transformation" determination and bravely take the first step, but often the good
Mr. Ma's famous "From Tomorrow" echo is one of the most eccentric classics of this "universal humanity".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that it is too high a threshold, which tends to exceed the capacity limits of ordinary people and allows the vast majority of people to "sigh at the door."
Perhaps the "second best principle" is a way to make it possible for more ordinary people to embark on a relatively successful path.
The core of the "subprime principle" lies in "drawing the threshold" – which encourages a theory of "making small gains and winnings" that if it can't be 100, it can only do one: because 1 is always greater than 0; if it doesn't get to
Anyway, as long as you do something, it's better than not.
As the threshold has been significantly lowered, there is a greater chance that ordinary people will stick to it, and the chances of success will increase if anything is to be done.
It's just a little bit longer to follow the path of success of the “secondary principle”.
All in all, the "best principle" can ultimately inspire, in fact, a minority, despite its appearance as a flag of success for all, and the "second best principle" can effectively inspire more people and benefit as many people as possible.

Xinhua Network (Xinhuanet) has an increase of 0.71 million tons this year in the net of bare wall resources in Qinghai Lake
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11, (Reporter Joo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) Reporter learned from the Qinghai Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results showed that the amount of bare wall resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71
The pristine name Qinghai Lake is the "cooking fish", which is a uniquely precious species in the Qinghai Lake, and plays a vital role in sustaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked walls in Qinghai Lake fell sharply due to human-made killing and the increasing degradation of the naked-carrying water environment, with only 2,592 tons of bare-wall resources in the Qinghai Lake in 2002.
In 2004, the Naked Wall of Qinghai Lake was listed as a endangered species in the "Red List of Chinese Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the sealing of lake breeding fish, which prohibits any unit, group or individual from going to the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and Lake Area to fish for the naked wall, and prohibits the sale of the naked wall and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificially growing and releasing flows, cleaning up the main river channels of the Qinghai Lake entering the lake, and designing a scientifically sound "crossing of fish channels" and other measures, the stock of bare walled resources of the Qinghai Lake has increased year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, said that, to date, the bare wall of Qinghai Lake has implemented nearly 180 million tails of artificial breeder circulation, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of the bare wall of Qinghai Lake.
Qinghai’s trijiang region is an important ecological barrier and water cover area in China and Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the trijiang region and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and preserve the biodiversity of the Qingzhou Plateau, Qinghai has issued successive circulars on the prohibition of fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has constructed a comprehensive

It's been an hour. It hasn't even been delivered yet.
It was too long to see an article writing an official holiday.
Give the unknown man Cope a shot.
Most girls suddenly go through their first holiday at one of the 13-15 years of age, closing at about 50 years of age.
Then, in the case of healthy health, there will be one visit every month on a more regular basis.
But it's not regular enough to predict accurately. About a week's margin requires preparation in advance and sometimes bad luck turns over (and suddenly a few days ahead).
Time, blood, and pain vary from one person to another, some for three days, some for a week; some for less, some for some for a Bleed; some for a lack of reaction, some for the ambulance, some for pain, and others for pain, which changes with time, does not mean
The menstrual period was uncontrollable, and 24 hours of blood would be shed in the days leading up to the end. All that could be done was to use sanitary towels or tampons to prevent blood from spilling into clothes and chairs.
The pain is mainly due to the glandin secretion. The physiology period has just begun before it can be reached, and then the pain can effectively alleviate the pain of the month. Eating after the pain has begun is useless.
Pre-physiology is easy for diarrhea due to uterus hemorrhaging and glandin being released too much.
If it's about the cycle, it doesn't matter if it's diarrhea. It's basically menstruation in two days.
Sanitary towels should be replaced every two or three hours, or they can easily breed bacteria, remove sleep time, and worst of all is 6 times a day, 7 days a month, 42 pieces, possibly 50 pieces, if prepared in advance, not just one per month.
(Modified here, tampons don't have to be changed regularly, probably once in five or six hours, up to eight hours)
The menstruation hormones can be violent, and the ovation period can be unstable because of the changes in the hormones in the body. It's bad luck, and the body is tripping itself.
However, the official crime rate data shows that the ability of women to control emotions is still very high, and there is no excuse for emotional problems.
It's not just blood, it's got a loose endomelet.
The end-of-menstrual end-of-life end-of-life end-of-life end-of-life end-of-life end-of-life end-of-life end-of-life end-of-life end-of-life end-of-life end-of-life end-of-life end-of-life end-of-life end-of-life end-of-life end-up
Menstruation is not convenient. For decades, every few days of every month is bleeding 24 hours, and there is pain in the stomach, so who wants to?
But one can be born because his mother comes through menstruation to prepare you for the first time in the world to live in a house for 10 months, thanking your mother for the healthy manner in which she has passed through menstruation.
In the past, a lot of women had been crushed, and the society had brainwashed women and said that they were dirty and ashamed. Everyone thought that was the case, but the times had changed.
If someone feels sick about menstruation, sick about the preparation of women's bodies for the birth of life, shouldn't say it in public. The girls should stand up and stop thinking like this, never experience it, never experience it in their lifetime, and never know men, then don't
Finally, let's try the tampon. It really works.
It's a winter holiday. It's more disappointing to send the mistake.
We'll order another meal for the kids.
I hope the shop must examine the product during all its busy work.
Was the battery leaking in the foot bath?
The choice of the right foot bath can play a good role in health care. Today, U.S. and U.S. editors will answer the question and hope it will help their friends.
As people’s health awareness increases, the tubs are increasingly popular with consumers, and a large number of different types of products are emerging in the market, giving consumers plenty of choice from a hundred-thousand-thousand-thing to thousands of yuan.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared to traditional household electricity, the sale of household electricity in health care such as the foot bath is hot, but there are no specialized industry standards in the foot tub, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in the electrified water!"
Mr Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father to make a present for his birthday, but he felt the soles of his feet numb.
Mr Li initially thought it was the vibration of the tub. I didn't think that the vibration function had been turned off. My father still felt numb on the soles of his feet.
Mr Li was surprised to find that the water in his foot bath was electrically charged when he tried the pen.
Later, he contacted the merchants, and the merchants took a good attitude. Mr Li was still upset despite falling out of the tub.
Because he found that there is now no clear and detailed industry regulation on what kind of temperature, what kind of people, what kind of materials are meant to be harmless, etc., of this long-precedented foot bath.
In general, however, there will be no electricity problems on the foot bath, but it will not rule out that a few products were not strictly shut down when they left the plant.
So, at the time of purchase, you choose a split tub.
Hydropower is separated and there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can take any type of pen.
Opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Expo - Looking at the Headline - Hunan Daily Network - Huasing Online
On December 10, Hunan Daily (a media reporter, Zhang Sangwu Xiaoling, correspondent, Liu Xiaoling, photographer), this morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Expo and the Newized Red Tea Promotion will be held at the Hunan International Fair Center to showcase the tea industry
The Deputy Director of the General Council of Supply and Marketing Cooperation of the People's Republic of China, Huixiang, and the Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Tunghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a great announcement at the opening ceremony: The source of Lake Red is new, and the rise of red tea has injected a new impetus into the "five coloured tea".
In recent years, provincial committees and provincial governments have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, advancing the construction of the hundreds of millions of tea industry, and forming the development pattern of "3 million teas and 4 water and 5 tea teas".
Intra-provincial tea industry has increased innovation, and major tea types such as green tea, black tea, red tea, and the integration of tea brigade in the main production tea district has been promoted to boost the harvest of a large number of tea farmers.
Wind and water rotated, and red tea worked again.
According to experts from the provincial tea industry, after picking green tea to pick red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income during the four seasons of the year, and the value of tea garden rose straight.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leadership awarded medals for the fourth batch of enterprises that were granted the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark. Newly welcomed "The Source of Huanhong".
At the Xinixian Red Tea Museum, Fujian Tea Dealer saw a high mountain tea called “Ice Spring”, and placed an order immediately.
Wang Huixin, Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said that the current outbreak of diseases and other factors more or less affected the tea market, but from the point of view of the tea fair, the bright spots appeared.
With red red tea, it injects the cultural content of tea, is popular with people and trade fires, and the tea industry is happy with the new spring.
So if the food isn't hot, can we cancel it?
I don't want to. He couldn't deliver it because he couldn't stop down there.
To go to school is to study questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Form and schooling are philosophical basic laws intended to explain the existence and the fundamental nature of the world.
The Chinese translation of the name “Fortural and Schooling” is taken from the phrase “Fortural and fortuitive” in “Fortural and fortical”, which is translated by Metaphysic.
The physical branch of schooling includes the theory of nature, theology of nature and its extension.
The theory is to "research which nouns represent real entities and which nouns only represent a concept."
To go to school naturally means to deny the existence of God.
Its theoretical foundation believes that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural justification, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
The method of naturalism refers to the method of studying the word "no" to God.
Psychiatry is the philosophy of studying consciousness and the nature of their relationship to the body, especially the brain.
The dualist theory and monist theory are the main two schools of thought that discuss "the relationship between the soul and the body".
Intellectuals is a philosophical branch that explores the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline for systematic thinking and research into the life of human morality, where ethics is defined as all codes of conduct accepted by a group of people or by a culture.
The main divisions are meta-ethics (researching the essence of ethical theory or criticism in abstraction), normative ethics (judgment of different ethical values, and giving moral advice on correct or wrong behavior).
It examines what kind of moral code of conduct people should observe, applied ethics (academic application of ethical theory to actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and describes ethics (collecting information on how people live and summarizing from observed styles).
Its scrutiny of ethics is not based on the theory envisaged, but rather on the real choices made by the actual moral agent and observed, which contribute to all ethical considerations of the decision, and it examines the ethical views held by the social group.
Ethical history includes Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics in Greece.
Part One: Ethical idea of humanism, represented by Valra and Monda and others.
Part II: Ethical idea of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part III: Ethics in Politics, represented by Macyavelli and others, and ethics in modern times (in the 17th-18th century, Empirical Ethics in Britain, Representing People: Humud et al., 17-18th Century, Euroland Reasonic Ethics, Representative Persons: Sbinosa, 18th Century,
Logic is a discipline in studying "the principles and standards of valid inferences and proofs".
Logic usually consists of three parts: synthesizing reasoning, retroactive reasoning and reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.
The aesthetics are the subject of research on the nature of beauty and its significance.

Ding Ziping: To friends.
I would like to express my sincere thanks for the humanitarian assistance extended by friends over more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones, especially since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian relief to friends both inside and outside the country in early 1994.
Today, most of the old parents of the victims have been thanked, and the orphans have grown into families and employment.
It's the most difficult moment you've had to help our troubled families.
At present, the new crown epidemic is raging around the world, and most donors have retired year after year.
Therefore, I implored you to suspend the humanitarian donations to our hard-to-be, Tiananmen mother group, which should have been the perfect end of the humanitarian relief campaign.
I will always remember your love and believe in history.
For a variety of reasons, I can only express my will in this way and ask my friends to understand!
Please accept my sincere blessing.
Tau: Allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance by the All-American Federation of Science and Technology (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democratic Foundation (MCDF).
In carrying out humanitarian relief, CNSSE and Minnesota's China Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, and project implementers often intersect.

The relief money often fails to reach the six difficult people.
In 1994, Mr. Jin Ding suggested that “Tiananmen Mother” should set up a special group to coordinate and handle the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, MDCF established the "Six Four Orphans Education Fund" and, 11 years after its implementation, in 2009, after graduating from university for all six or four orphans, MCDF subsequently set up the "Success Fund for Six or Four Orphaned People" and has been implemented since then.
These projects are funded mainly by campuses and social donations in six or four years, by generous donations from individuals, and by support from Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, support has also been received from the Labour Reform Research Fund.
Until last year, 31 years later, the six troublemakers finally received a partial contribution from Hong Kong to raise in the name of the 64th year.
During this period, Human Rights in China is also independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr Ding's request to stop six or four donations is for donors to consider, and we are indeed all retired old people. Income is not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to thank Mr Ding's "friends" letter.
We will respect their decision to terminate the project within two years and resume it as soon as necessary.
Those who have persisted in their generous efforts over the years to deliver humanitarian aid at risk join in thanks and esteem.

Thanks for the rabbit's comment. It was also said that the rejection of the ancient wind was not suitable for the ancient wind. I didn't expect the finished products to be so beautiful.
Thanks to Dandan's approval, your satisfaction will fill us with electricity to keep moving forward, and we will continue to cheer!
This photo studio is really great, and it strongly recommends that all young people come!
From reception, makeup, costume, lighting, photography to later stages, there is no room for criticism.
Cosmetics are so delicate that they can match your makeup according to your style, and make-up is also used on a single line of big brands.
Not to mention that photography is quite a professional.
The whole studio is artistic, with two kittens playing with them.
We work in Beijing, and all better cinemas in Beijing need to line up half a year in advance. Some of our colleagues took pictures in Beijing, and they felt just so.
The studio was deliberately searched for a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and it is also the short version of most people. Photographer Liang will scratch and record natural wonderful moments.
Make-up artist, photographer, late design, and a fine team.

My girlfriend has been recommended for the past, and she was equally happy to see the negative.
It is hoped that such studios will not be buried, that more people will find it, and that they will be filmed in their own style rather than in the same way.
Thank you very much for the five-star comments on the eagle and Xingling. Both of them are very thoughtful and creative new people. We are the creative studio. As long as customers like it, we will do our best to meet each other with gratitude and gratitude.
The sweet assistant, as well as the lively photographer teacher, each and every member of the team has a super nice shot, and it's hard to forget, and it's a lot better than I thought.
Thanks to Xiaoyu's comments, it's also a coincidence that the trust in us from Hohout to the island of Qin is thousands of kilometers. It's nice to meet you and come to the island of Qin next time.

But if the training is intended to enter the industry, it is really a very good choice, especially for those who are self-control and weak.
If you are more self-control, you can also choose self-education, but you will be tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
It depends first and foremost on the teaching power of this institution. If the teaching power is not strong enough, the training institution will have little meaning. Of course, some of the new training institutions will have no special strength.
Second, to explore the training institution before choosing it, it would be better to visit the students from the institution. After all, only the students from the institution know what the institution is like, and the curriculum is good or bad.
In fact, I don't know how to answer this question, because there is no specific introduction to your own situation, and learning about this thing and the individual's situation are very relevant.
For example, the profession, the age, the language you want to learn, even in which city, will have something to do with what you want to learn or what you want to do.
If you're a student and you haven't graduated, or if you're a computer major, then if there's enough time to personally recommend self-study, it's the least efficient and expensive. Now many offline training institutions are actually nice, but once learning costs are high,
But if it's what I say, self-study is easy, and now many of the learning resources on the Internet are free, or there's a lot of training resources to go to station b. If you don't find resources, you can also contact me through profiles, get free resources, or
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with videos.
If you're not a computer professional, but you can also pay a certain amount of money and time for studying, then it is recommended to go to the training institution so that learning is easy, the teacher's instructions are detailed, there are questions and answers, and there is also assistance in learning planning or supervision.
Many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal quotas, and after studying, recommend companies, so that the interview process for finding jobs later can save a lot.
These are some of my observations. Since I don't know about you, the description is not detailed. If you have anything else to consult, you can contact me to communicate with each other at any time.
I said I was there by 1:00, and I saw it at App.
What do you mean?
I'm not done yet. What are you doing?
In person, carry all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoveheads, oil smokers, lamps, glass cleaning, professional seams, domestic services
Thanks to those who give me credit for trying hard to make life, life is very tired but it has to go on.
Life doesn't fail every person who works hard, you can look after me if you like, and thank those who give me some credit.
That's the way of life. People only look at the results, they own the process, and face life, we have no choice but to stay strong, and we have no choice but to look back, but we can't go back...
Cleaning is a job and a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of heart.
While cleaning is the dirtiest thing we've ever done, we'll clean every corner of the client's house with the most seriousness, see the smiles and thumbs that the client is satisfied with, and at that moment all the tired are worth the price and pay back!
My day-to-day work
- Your request, my service.
Use your heart for service, keep your heart clean, keep your beauty.
In the details that you care about, Fong Gui domestics have done "clean" for you, and I have been able to serve the family.
Baowan's family is clean, the tree housekeeper is pristine, and the service is in place, so it's clean to get home.
Keeping clean inside and outside. My day-to-day work.
Crystal lamps, though gorgeous, may be dark without washing for a long time. Only cleaning can shine light, and so can life.
If you do it with your heart, you can succeed, you can shape it in detail, and we are serious about the beauty.
Give me a chance and it'll make you happy. Quality speaks for everything, because your profession is worthy of trust. Your approval is my most encouraging!
It's hard to do all walks of life at the moment!
But I've always believed that if I'm serious, insistent, hard enough, I'm better than others, at least I'm better than sitting and complaining."
The idea of one day lies in the morning, and all the beauty begins early in the morning, and I hope you will start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and desire, and keep the good mood all day.
When I was a kid, happiness was something and happiness; when I grew up, happiness was a goal and happiness was achieved; when I matured, happiness was a mentality and understanding happiness.
Be the truest and kindest of yourself and walk without regret for this life; live one way and follow one's own path; live two treasures of life: good health, good mood, beautiful and living in old age!
At every stage of life, different difficulties are encountered.
Too often, it's not the power that binds you, it's the courage to face it positively.
Since it can't be avoided, it's better to face it squarely.
The more afraid you are, the harder it will be to be knocked down; if you rise to the challenge, the problem will eventually be solved.
China Shatze exhibiters joined forces to host Saudi Arabia's first biannual exhibition of contemporary art - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, 12 December (Reporter Wang Haizhou Huqiang) The first two-year exhibition of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia - the two-year exhibition of contemporary art in Durier - was officially opened to the public in the Dirieje JAX Art Zone, northwest of the Saudi capital
The two-year exhibition was jointly planned by the Saudi Dieria Biannual Exhibition Foundation and the UCCA Yurens Contemporary Art Center of China, and the director of UCCA Yurens Contemporary Art Center of China, Yuyuyuyuyuyu, was the director of the arts.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of this two-year exhibition is "touching through the river with stones", and the metaphoric reform strategy adopted during the socio-economic transition period also reflects the current situation of socio-cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The two-year exhibition, which covers nearly 12,000 square meters, spans six interconnected buildings, and is presented in six units: Touching Stones Through Rivers, Transplants as Experiments, Thinking on the Margins, Walking to the Public, Beautiful New World, and
Of these, the number of works by 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibit, including paintings, device art and performing arts in many forms; the works of 12 Chinese artists were also of great interest, and some artists used recycled materials to create them in innovative ways, such as Xu
Barclay, CEO of the Diriye Biannual Exhibition Foundation, said he hoped that the current biennial exhibition would establish an international dialogue that would give the global audience an opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's flourishing cultural industries and creative communities and strengthen interaction.
"The goal of the two-year exhibition is twofold, allowing Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, and allowing Saudi viewers to integrate into the contemporary art world," Tan Xiaoyu said. "
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the two-year curtain week. Artists, exhibitors and opinion leaders of creative industries will discuss cross-cultural exchanges, contemporary art development, and other topics.

Yunnan: Integrated regulation of rural public goods job management - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lim Bingfeng) In order to continue to do well to help lift the poor out of poverty and consolidate the achievements of expanding the fight against poverty, Yunnan Province recently introduced relevant policies to promote the revitalization of rural public
The relevant head of Yunnan Department of People's Social Affairs said that currently, Yunnan has developed 4,483 million rural public service jobs for the employment of rural hardship groups such as the poverty-eradication labour force, and has played an important role in helping the people
The new regulations, issued jointly by Yunnan People's Society, Village Renewal, Finance, and other seven departments, will mainly regulate the target range, financial management, job development, and job management of recruiting rural public service workers at the grass-roots level.
With regard to job development and placement, the new regulations clearly state that the establishment is based on the principles of "placed as required, appointed as person, dynamic management, and volume control", "developed by person, use by person, responsibility by person", and "one person
Recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, audit, publicity, recruitment, pre-service training, and placement.
In addition, the new rules also clearly define the specific duties of the main development department of rural public goods jobs, and the criteria and means of subsidy of rural public goods jobs, and stipulate that each rural public goods jobs development department shall buy commercial insurance for accidents and injuries for rural public goods workers; and require relevant departments to regularly monitor the
Wrong address.
Hello.
Is it possible to cancel the order
I'll reschedule.
Has it been cancelled
Second, although the right has a promising time in history, it is not very long, so the short reason is that the sun is bright and the water is open and sweaty; the short reason is to look forward to it, and be struck by it.
But the reality is that the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right should not be denied from ending the definition of truth standards in Brunei, developing the economy to improve science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and human rights guarantees.
Thirdly, as far as I'm concerned, although not in full agreement with some of Li Wedong's claims, I care about him and respect him as well; because he is serious, he is serious about China and takes China's social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that the counter-revolution is necessary. The revolution is bound to lead to social unrest, damage to the livelihood of the people, and the political group is mixed in, and foreign countries take advantage of it.
Fourthly, the attitude of changing or improving China should be patient and accountable to the people. The political speculation attempt is a knockout. That is not the right party, it is an asshole.
Let's talk about left.
On the left side, it is actually a bunch of time and politics deserters.
If the right has a positive effect on society, and the Communists will listen to right words and analyse their thoughts when they need them, then the left won't make it, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communists throw away!
Fifthly, some of the friends who recently saw the anti-thief on the left side of the counter-thief are quite active, and I don't think they need to.
Don't try to be reasonable with the traitor and the left. It's all just one thing. There's no reason to talk about it.
And don't try to prove that we're right, let alone let anti-thiefs and left-handeds admit it, why not?
I told my friends: When the anti-thief scolded you with 50 cents, and when the left scolded your right dog, it proved that our middle way was right!
Many young people also have ideals when they are older, forget about them or pursue them, but become paranoid.
And the ideal is slowly moving away, and even the dragon-slayering youths are eventually the dragons.
Around the world, I think that generally means restraint and freedom, and that China should be left as a whole because of its historical and historical genes.
The right side of the country is free, with an emphasis on efficiency and development, and the left side strengthens supervision, with a greater focus on fairness and security.
Now, society in general wants to focus more on fairness, while China and the United States compete with each other. The left side is positive, and it is estimated to last for many years.
Even though I can't understand it, it's done with some praise.
Don't say anything. Flowers are just like that.
In the past two years, the blockade and siege of the Chinese Chip by the Emperor have not only placed China in an unprecedented situation, but also caused huge losses to the “American system” enterprises.
The direct consequence of the United States Empire crushing China's chip industry and requiring its own enterprises and allied countries' related enterprises to block the country's chip industry at the same time is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers have been affected, resulting in lower R&D inputs and reduced production capacity of chip producing enterprises, thus creating a global
Today, the "deficit core" has affected major industries around the world, such as the shutdown of car companies and the increase in mobile phone prices, and almost all industries that use chips have suffered from it.
In order to master the "chip" autonomy, more and more countries have embarked on the path of "beautiful" technology giants.
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor and hold back the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States and the United States have become more active recently, hosting the “chips summit”; and invite the 64-nation giants to form a semiconductor union, and draw money to support the U.S.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on the station's power buildup, it was likely to take away the "job" of the station's power buildup.
The reason for this certainty is that Intel, as the old technology giant of the United States Emperor, has cultivated for decades in the semiconductor field, has a large pool of talent and technological reserves, and must rise rapidly in the short term to defeat the power supply.
However, with regard to Intel's decision, Zhang Xinjin, the founder of the power plant, paid no attention to it.
At the “2021 Master’s Think Tank Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Xinxin spoke amazingly. Zhang Xinxin said nothing about Intel’s investment in the construction of a crystal circle factory: Intel built a chip-for-promotion factory, which is quite ironic.
Zhang Xinxin is indifferent to Intel's entry into the crystal circle because Zhang Xinxin is still obsessed with a part of Intel's anger more than 30 years ago.
During the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was always the bead of the empire's manufacturing industry, and he was at the top of the world, and he was the master of the world's semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chip had been held by a few powerful people.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip was designed, manufactured and sealed by a plant, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overstretched some small enterprises, and many semi-conductor entrepreneurs have had to face huge production-line construction costs.
In the 1980s, a division of labour began to emerge in the chip industry, inspired by market demand. In 1984, Zhang Xingxin learned that there were companies specializing in chip design, and thought that since there were specially designed plants, it would be possible to set up a factory specializing in crystal
Shortly after that, Zhang's vision of the plot became a reality, and the power supply of the station became a reality.
The station power has targeted the main business at the single link of "crystal processing", and it does not design, but only provides surrogate services for crystalry manufacturing.
The power generation that was just created at the time was a small one in front of Intel, the giant barbarian.
In order to gain capital support, Zhang Xinjin had sought investment from Intel, but as soon as Intel heard that power generation was only used as manufacturing link in the chip industry, it was clear that some self-esteem was high, could not afford power generation, and decidedly refused to invest in power generation.
Zhang Xinjin also identified Intel as a service that failed to see the crystal circle process at the time.
I didn't think that the giants who failed to see the services of the crystal circle manufacturing service would now begin to work in the crystal circle.
Therefore, Zhang Xinjin found it ironic that Intel entered the Translator Generation Worker.
Today, the market value of power generation in Taiwan exceeds that of Intel.
Faced with the powerful assault of power generation, it is natural that Intel is not in a position to be self-confident.
Today, station power has hit 3nm chip, while Intel is still at 14nm seven years ago.

Let's see some of the weird hot searches today.
What's normal love?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: in February, the two dragons raised their heads, and the Li Xia Yu raised their prices, and the Gumla incident, where the spread of the bond spread formed a wave peak. Then [the index fell down] (the smooth curve) eventually dissipated, and if the secondary
They appear to be no different from the [web-based evolutive model] shown by the Network.
What's anomalous?
The random selection of six hot searches in the same incident displays [single peaks], [singing teeth] and [shattering cliffs].
[Single Peak] is artificially heating up, rapidly launching hot search, which attracts public attention; [Serious] is cyclical heating to ensure that the topic is hot on the list; [Breaking cliff] is collective evacuation, and the hot search completes the "functional"
In figure 9, the hot wave peak of one event happens to be the valley of another event. The time-minutes are no different. It must be a unified batch of water troops that receive a task and start a new offensive.
The professionalization of Black Public Relations is evident: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract eyes, which are responsible for Coptics, which are responsible for war-making, which are the diversions, which are the perceptions, which are misleading judgments, which are
Communication is a science. From objective data alone, Black Public Relations will have no place without taking a stand and feeling for all subjective factors.
Wherever you walk, you must leave traces. We will dig them out together.

For the first time, Mauritius and other countries found Omician drug strain infection - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12
Mauritius reported for the first time two cases of Omician drug strain infection in the country on the 10th.
According to Mao Health Minister Kelesh Jagutepar, one of the infected persons was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa; another was a local resident of Mauritius, and he tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after contacting a person who had recently returned to South Africa
After hospital isolation treatment, the two infected nucleic acid test results were turned negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
Cyprus's Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country had identified three cases of Omikjon infection for the first time.
All three were students who returned from travel abroad earlier this month and were not admitted due to mild conditions.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omik Chin drug strain, the government of Serbia has constantly stepped up its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers aged 12 and above who entered the country by air will be required to take nucleic acid tests at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it would begin vaccination of Pfizer’s new crown vaccine for children between 5 and 11 years of age in the country.
On the 9th, Malawi's Minister of Health, Kambize Chiponda said that the country had detected three cases of Omicone drug strain infection for the first time.
The country's health department sequenced the genome of 12 new positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found three cases of infection.

Location: 12th floor of Happiness Home 156 South Road, Ring City
At the beginning, because of trust, friends introduced them, so they chose to look at my initial budget of $70,000 for a basic renovation.
He came to the store and started a series of tricks.
For the first time, I came to the store to see my family chart. They didn't actually take a physical look at the house. They were able to offer me a price of 70,000 from my 135th house, and they probably showed me their material without knowing what brand they were.
Their second set of tricks is that you're gonna drag you to the store to pay the down payment (and you'll never get out of it unless you've had enough experience to fight the theory against them).
When I was hesitant to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount you can get if you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit, and I am a living example of being deceived, and I paid more than 10,000 down payment in mind impulses.
He offered me a lot of questions about $70,000 that did not include hydropower and no doors and cabinet bathrooms, and those three were the big costs of the basics.
They are also charged higher than any other company for their services.
I lost trust in this company, so I signed the contract without being clear from the beginning.
When I went to get their money back, they showed experience, and they had a special little team to deal with you.
In any case, they will bite to death as a problem for their clients, and they will not be held responsible.
There are a lot of details about all the responsibilities, and I don't want to cry at all, and I don't want to choose them anyway, because my friends are looking for their renovated houses because they're not of good quality, and later I'll give you all kinds of expenses.
Ji Pa, they are the original conned Dragon Head Decorations, and now they are Daemei, and it seems that they have collapsed again and changed to something else.
So let's not choose the decorating company where the father is such a fool.
In the future, people will look at these consultations as they choose to do so, because the renovations are not small money.

Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
Well, don't cancel the conversation. If you don't refund me for 5 to 10 days, you will.
I asked if it could be cancelled in less than 15 minutes.

In the sky, there are about a pair of binocular meteor showers that arrived on the 14th. - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency Tianjin December 12 (Reporter Zhou Yunqian) Astronomy experts introduced that, as one of the last large-scale meteor showers this year, the twin meteor showers of one of the three meteoroids in the northern hemisphere will rise dramatically on December 14. Friends who like meteor
On December 13, 2018, Beijing Astronomy enthusiasts filmed a double star shower in Qinghai.
Most of the parent bodies of meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent bodies of bingo meteor showers are the same as the 3200 asteroid Fae, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The double meteor shower is also the second meteor shower that is known to be not "pregnified" by comets.
As in the case of a big film at the age of congratulations, the binary meteor shower usually occurs at the end of the year, which can run from December 4 to December 17, as described by Tianjin Astronomy Council Director and Astronomy Section Specialist.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability, and along with the quadrant meteor shower and the Anglican meteor shower, it is known as the three meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that meteoroids are slow and colourful, and there are plenty of fire meteors, which are suitable for both viewing and astronomers to film.
On December 13, 2020, Yang Xuan, an astronomical lover of Tianjin City, shot a double star shower in Tianjin Tianjin Tian Tian Tianzhou.
Astronomer predictions show that this year's binocular meteor shower will meet at around 1500 hours on December 14, at 150 hours ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen every hour when radiation points are placed right above the top of the head under ideal observation conditions).
A recommended index chart of Gemini meteor showers.
"Last year, the ‘difficult’ bingo meteor shower has impressed people, but this year’s bingo meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight and somewhat reduced.
On November 11 of the Chinese Calendar, the moon is full of moons. The bright moon will interfere with observations. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the middle of the night. At this time, the radiation points of the twin meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the hours they lag behind in the middle of the night, but be careful to keep warm. "
How can we see as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, but it is possible to choose a high-altitude or small-scale view in the suburbs or villages, open in the direction of the northeast, and patiently wait until the moon sets down to see the observation.
It is important to note that there is a large flow of bingo meteor showers in all directions. It is not necessary to keep staring at the radiation points of bingo meteor showers during observation.
A friend who likes photography would like to film a beautiful 'smartade shower'. It would be better to choose a shot with a wide angle and a big halo, using high ISO and the largest halo.
For reasons of stability and continuity, tripods, back-up batteries and fast doors are also essential. "
Shuli Peng reminds.
What difference does laser TV and traditional TV make in market positioning?
In my understanding, what the subject is referring to traditional TV is LCD, and the difference between laser TV and LCD TV on market positioning is mainly the following two points:
First, laser television focuses more on the big screen market.
Laser TV clearly focuses on the big screen market more than the market positioning of LCD, or laser TV itself is a product of the big screen.
At present, mainstream LCD is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while laser TV is generally 75 inches or more, with a maximum of more than 100 inches, fully meeting users' demand for big screens.
In recent years, the sales and sales share of laser television has been increasing globally, accounting for more than 60% of total television sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecasts of China Eikang, the laser television market will continue to grow at a high rate of growth of more than 140% in 2020.
The success achieved in the big screen market is largely due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser television overlaying, laser light does not shoot directly into the eye. The image process is closer to the image of an object under natural conditions than the backlight of LCD, and the stimulus to the eye is smaller.
The ophthalmologist from Saixi Laboratory of the Chinese Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and Beijing Association and Hospital produced 144 test data through a rigorous comparison test of laser television and LCD under the same conditions as the crowd.
The data confirms that laser television does have a strong eye protection feature and has a certain improvement effect on certain aspects.
At a time of increasing attention to the health of vision, laser television not only attracted more users with the advantage of eye protection, but also opened another breakthrough in the colour and electricity market.
Second, laser TV focuses more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuing search for LCD prices, the current market price of laser TV is mostly in excess of RMB 10,000. As size and light rise, the price rises.
Why should laser TV be so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser television has many advantages that cannot be achieved by LCD and projection.
With ultra-focal projection technology, laser television's projection distance is shorter than traditional projectors, it is able to achieve 100 inches of screen experience within a short distance, requires little space, and its host is small, and it is very small.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TV can reach more than 2,000.
Plus, the heat is lower, the equipment is less expensive, and the television has a longer useful life.
In addition, many high-end laser television models carry a number of cutting-edge technologies such as really 4K super-high-quality paintings, artificial intelligence systems, and imitation screens, which can provide users with a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It's not about false demands, it's about the product of the breakdown of needs, the quality of drawings and input output ratio. Laser TV is not the type of sound player's food, it's about balancing the big screen with the inadequate viewing environment. It's possible to try
Simply put, hyperbroad-angled near-focal projector-laser TV, which had to use expensive hyperbolic lenses and reflectors in order to get close to the screen, was not in line with the best optical design.
In order to block part of the environmental light, the Finier screen, which uses a microstructure, is expensive, and the 80-inch price can be basically replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
On the other hand, I particularly hate the idea that projectors take a wide reflection to be good to the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that can be seen in the eyes is direct to the eyes, you can't see it on the ceiling, and you can't see it. If you don't
Moreover, the projector screen would not have been able to reflect if it hadn't been an extensive reflection.
It is painful to be ignored that the hot (light) effect of high-growth screens reflect a lot of light into the eyes from one angle.
For the time being, there is not yet a branch in the selection quality shop of the Visual Gallery.
After adding the date of the appointment of the WeChat, the younger sister sent me the optional schedule, and the answer information was more timely
Before going to the shop to see the film, more of it was the outdoor wedding dress, it was beautiful, and it involved a lot of film styles.
After the arrival of the day, I briefly shared my thoughts with my younger sister, tried two sets of tangled style clothes with great patience, and eventually finalized some props to start the make-up. Before the photographer shoots, it will guide the moves and improve the details.
But maybe it wasn't the style I wanted, but it's supposed to be a nice one.
The photographer will help pick the photos after the shoot, share the style of the later period, and feel very thoughtful.
It takes about half a month to fix the film, wait for the effect
For the second time, it was written as a real type of king's meal. Most of the clothes on the scene were able to choose one shot.
Finally, a black dress was chosen, and different styles were experienced.
It takes about two hours for the whole filming process to be made, and the cameraman responsible for the shooting is the younger brother after 95. It feels a little dreary. It is hoped that more advice will be given later in the customer's action guidance.
Selected Quality Shop of the Visual Fine Photography Museum. Response.
It's on the front page. Let's see Queenie too.
After filling in the store with the name number and choosing the costume, the wedding dress can be chosen, and it's patient to change three or four costumes. After selecting it, the makeup has been made up for a long time, and the service attitude has been good. Later, the film will teach you how to
[Environment] It's all right.
There are a lot of optional clothes.
There are almost three make-up positions in the studio.
[Service] It's warm and careful.
The stylist is patient.
Photographers will also be very careful to teach you how to behave.
Unsatisfied, photographers will also come forward with a supplemental shot.
[Experience] may have been a bit too much, but the eyelids were put on three eyelids.
Eyebrows have also been shaved, and it's a little embarrassing for not drawing eyebrows.
The photos were given in the next 10 days, but the P-charts were not very satisfactory, and it felt clear that the eyelids were still there.
Because it's not clear what style is required, and I tried two sets, and I picked them out, and I chose the black dress. Xiao Xi said it was a comparison of Hepburn's ancient style.
The hairdresser and the make-up sister are so patient to help me get it out, and it's very satisfying.
I started to take pictures after making up my hair, and the photographer directed me to my pose all the way. The process was easy and harmonious.
After the shoot, he carefully selected four of his favorites as masters and masters, and said that the film was 15 years old, and the ending was very satisfactory.
No reply has been received on 3rd ... As your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS_ORG#plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is, every time I pay, I use the same credit card.
I have to pay freight every time.
You can forgive me and charge me for my monthly fee until after you've finished your investigation. Is that okay?
A small umbrella for insurance. Do you believe that?
A small umbrella is an Internet insurance broker platform.
From the point of view of the conditions: According to the "Regulation of Insurance Brokering Agencies (Revised 2015), to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met: shareholders, sponsors, who have had no major illegal records in the last three years, and a minimum limit of RMB50 million
These three articles are actually very demanding, and it is important to sum up that they have the strength to pass the approval of the state authority department of the Silver Insurance Supervisory Board (which supervises insurance companies and banks in the country), and the shareholders need to behave well. As the small umbrella insurance of insurance brokerage companies,
On this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy.
From the perspective of the insurance product: A small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' star heavy health insurance is sold on this platform. For example, the most recent and the Thai Super Mary 5 heavy health insurance, the claimant and insurer are both Thais and life. A small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary
From the point of view of the fee model: The product of the Internet platform has a relatively high universal price due to the cost of operating the business point and the wage of the operator, as well as the flexible way of paying the fee, supporting monthly payments, reducing the pressure on the insured person to pay, and maximizing the leverage of
It's still very good.
You can think about it.
From the professional point of view, this is particularly important because insurance is a very professional industry where many Internet product customers can insure themselves, and there are a lot of errors. In the case of health notification and occupation, non-insured workers often add their own subjective sense of being insured and feel healthy or compatible.
I myself have made insurance phone sales in the “Standing Micro Security” (like a small umbrella and an Internet insurance broker platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
The Internet insurance is real and solid. It is not about people. There are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are many misleading sales.
For example, 6 million yuan was insured for insurance, 600 million were paid free of charge for insurance on mobile phones, but the marketing strategies were not wrong. However, they avoided the risk and did not tell the insured. First dollar was required for the first month, and the next month was required to
Thought it would cost one dollar, and the insurance company paid 6 million dollars for the pie.
Free cell phones are sent only after the end of the policy number 6666,8888, a special policy number, and if the winning text is sent, it will not be exchanged, nor will anyone be reminded.
(This is another pit for the insured) It's a short term to receive a free 60,000-heavy health insurance. In the event of serious illness, if there is no other commercial insurance, there's nothing to do with 60,000, and there's nothing to solve the problem.
At present, the state is taking a heavy toll on the misleading sales of Internet insurance.
So, on balance, there are no problems with the platform, and there are no problems with the product. What is problematic is the professionalism and professional conduct of the operator.
It is recommended that the subject matter be considered carefully and comprehensively. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, with more opportunities and products available to customers, and some products have a better price than Internet products.
I myself helped 59 Internet customers, insured off-line products, and saved 2000-3000 yuan/year for each person.
If you have any questions, you are welcome to communicate and communicate with me.
I: Mingya Insurance Broker has had three years of experience in business management training, served nearly 1,000 business users, and cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before instituting insurance, I will customize insurance products for customers according to their needs. In the insurance policy, I will
Growing up with every customer for life.
I hope my answer will help the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is the insurance operation in which the insured person can independently complete all insurance processes after clicking on the insurance link.
In the process, the insured person does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insured person alone.
Although the coverage of Internet insurance is not too "ceremonial" and may not even have a paper contract in print, it has no impact on the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.
This pattern is somewhat similar to "telephone sales" of current waterline operations, but there is also a fatal problem with insurance, which is that follow-up services may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediate" we have chosen, or an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and will provide us services many years later?

No problem. Don't have to arrange for the re-delivery. I already bought it. I don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have rejected any form of slander and scolding, even less such personal assault.
In civilized society, we can embrace everything but to put an end to such villains.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it's the uncivilized way to resist first.
From the moment you started sending Facebook and friends' requests, to the point where you posted a modifier post, to the point where you tried to post my home and my father's name on social media, I have taken an unresponsive attitude.
After you stepped up more than just six meals a day, you went on to tag, even more so when Facebook and your so-called friends continued to brazenly discuss my covert, humiliating remarks, appearance, body, birthing, and what kind of bed strawberries,
How do you know that later on, I received comments from a number of friends about a photo and sexual harassment component of your Facebook friend's account.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After I uploaded the news of the police report, you completely failed and became more aggressive.
I don't care what your political background is, and whatever your status is, in our society, it needs to be respected by both sexes.
Yes, you can go on with your sarcastic, covert, humiliating and insulting remarks, and you can go on saying that you're just caring and paying attention to me. You can continue to think that this isn't harassment, you can even continue to deny that it's not
Yes, I can't, and I can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you. I don't need you to comment on my appearance and body.
I don't even think there's a girl who is willing to let someone else humiliate herself so much in exchange for fame.
Friends ask me, are you okay?
I said yes, you won't believe it either.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being so bullied.
In the workplace, in society, in politics or in business, only those who do not have basic virtues will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart.
I cut off part of the message for everyone to comment on.
No one can pretend to be you with your own post.
I can only say you're an enemy of civilization.

Vietnam People's News Network - Prime Minister Fan Ming of the Vietnamese Government is attending the Third National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
Two major meetings were held during the Third National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum in Viet Nam, and the topics of discussion revolved around the themes of digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, digital technology enterprises, and the economic recovery and development in and after the outbreak of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
The Minister of Communications and Media, Nguyen Menchung, said that the number and operating income of Vietnamese digital technology enterprises maintained the growth trend of nearly 10% in 2021, despite the spread of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic.
In 2021, Viet Nam’s typical digital products were cultivated to focus on solving the major problems facing Viet Nam. Many digital products have moved out of the country and Viet Nam’s digital technology ranking has been raised.
Minister Nguyen Mensheng called on digital technology enterprises to assume responsibility for the development of national digital transformation platforms, and to assume the task of developing national digital platforms in these countries.
In the forum, enterprises, organizations and individuals that are researching, developing, applying, and transferring digital technology are sharing the mobilization and pooling of social resources to develop Vietnamese technological enterprises, working together to promote the national digital transformation and economic recovery in the wake of the Chuhui epidemic, among other breakthrough ideas and solutions.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng stressed in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is a necessary route for the world and an objective need for development.
Digital transformation has become a global problem, and digital transformation serves the entire population, so it is necessary to mobilize popular participation.
People and enterprises are the core, main subjects, goals and driving forces of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies must be for the sake of the people and enterprises.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng stressed that the digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit, with internal strength as the main, strategic, long-term and decisive factor, and external power as the important and breakthrough.
At the same time, he believed that the digital transformation needed to drive deep development and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia outbreak, economic recovery and development, cope with subsequent changes, overcome the depletion of natural resources, and contribute to the green transition and develop green energy.
Digital transformation requires participating in the establishment of databases for the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, national ethos, etc., and promoting the digital transformation of banking, taxation, land management and development databases, as well as logistics.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier, and the country is growing more prosperous.
Prime Minister Fan Minghing called on all levels of government and institutions and enterprises to increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, raise awareness of digital transformation, continue to develop and improve institutions for digital transformation, strengthen national management and promote the development of digital technology in a spirit of respect, communication, listening,
During the forum, Prime Minister Fan Ming attended the ceremony of the 2021 Award Award for “Viet Nam Manufacturing” outstanding digital products and the opening ceremony of the “Viet Nam Manufacturing” digital products exhibition.

The Yangtze River stem flow achieves full coverage of the water green integrated service area - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) Chongqing City Green Integrated Service Area, Changqing City, completed and put into operation as scheduled on December 10th. This is the second water area officially operated in Changjiang, after the operation of the
As of this date, the water-green integrated service area has covered the upper, central and downstream areas of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Jiangxiang Aviation Administration, Minister of Transport, said that previously, the provinces of Hubei, Hunannan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built 10 integrated water green service areas operating in the middle and downstream of the Yangtze River,

They are based on the theme of green environmental protection. They are characterized by ship repair and ship emergency rescue services. They will achieve "one call, multiple services" for ships in Hong Kong
US-III carriers regrouped in the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam 2022-01-17 multi-dimensional news from the pro-CCP media: the latest news from Sino-US relations: the latest satellite images show that three American carriers are gathering around China; the media also revealed that the most powerful
According to the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" of China's think tank, the satellite found the USS Carl Vincent carrier near the Strait of Barabak on January 9.
The Parabak Strait connects to the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location in the chain of the Western Pacific Islands First Islands.
The platform anticipates that the Carl Vincent will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This was the first time that the carrier of the Carl Vincent was deployed on board the F-35C fighter jet and the CMV-22 fish eagle carrier.
The American carrier, now operating upstream in the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the Carl Vincent, is the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier, who left the United States on January 3.
Lincoln was also on board the F-35C passenger squadron for the first time, and the squadron belonged to the US Marine Corps' 314th fighter attack squadron.
In addition to the above-mentioned two carriers, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the USS Ronald Reagan carrier, which docks in Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the "Shamplan Lake" missile cruiser, the "Stokdar" missile destroyer, and others.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Posture Perception Platform" released the latest satellite pictures, showing that the three aircraft carriers of the US military were gathering around China.
(Weibo @Nanhai Strategic Posture Perception) The US three carrier assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam on January 17, 2022. The U.S. naval carrier CMV-22B flight route.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) It was also reported by CNN on January 17 that one of the most powerful weapons in the Navy's arsenal visited Guam rarely last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, which contains 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the United States Navy base on Guam last Saturday (January 15).
The U.S. Triad carrier assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam, analysing it as sending a signal to allies and enemies in an increasingly tense situation in the Indian-Pacific region.
This is the first time that U.S. ballistic missile submarines have visited Guam since 2016, and the second time that they have visited Guam in public since the 1980s.
The U.S. Tribe carrier has assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The figure is for China's Yongxia island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in its statement that the visit of the Ohio class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the U.S. and regional allies, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, operational readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly known as "boomer submarine".
The whereabouts of the 14 "thinging submarines" in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually strictly secret.
The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes "thinging submarines" "the most important survival weapon of the nuclear triad", a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles located on the mainland of the United States, as well as bombers with nuclear warheads such as B-2 and B-52.
Talked to friends about the recent 26% drop of Meta, and the market value evaporated at $251 billion. Zuckerberg responded "to face unprecedented competition," why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company whose revenue comes mainly from advertising, and today's commercial companies that make money have their own flow channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and so on, whatever functional location, is Meta's flow channel.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertisement league," many of which are posted outside App to realize through Meta's advertising platform.
But the times have changed.
First, due to Apple privacy policy adjustments, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's privacy policy is now very friendly to users, and it is obvious whether users will allow App to access their information, and most people's normal reaction is certainly not.
Next, if Google stabs another one, it will have a greater impact on Meta's income.
Second, the previous Chinese factor in Meta's income growth also weakened (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's income comes from China each year, mainly from China's companies doing business in China.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is approximately hundreds of people, and there are several large agencies in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets. Meta is an advertising channel that can't be bypassed. Most of the money paid for the fire was paid to Meta.
Interestingly, TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but in the past two years, Meta can make a lot of money from the byte.
Various agents in the country are doing ads at Meta's, and Meta's Greater Central China is doing a great job.
I haven't been special about it lately, but it won't be better.
The stage of large-scale burning of money by Chinese companies abroad has passed.
Third, the new flow channels have not expanded smoothly.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets are not just looking at middle income, but more importantly at what is expected in the future.
Clearly, Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg told "Megaspace."
The universe should indeed be one of the directions for the future, but the realization cycle of the universe is longer, and the story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
So it's gonna be a tough time for Meta in the next two years.
Don't look at Facebook now, with income of US$100 billion to US$200 billion a year. In fact, Facebook now has a very strong sense of crisis. Compared to other Internet enterprises and high technology companies, there is no safe moat.
While some of his social software is now high in daily life and mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp and others, Facebook has little confidence in the rapid development of tiktok, which is a blinking hand between subversion.
And there's no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, and that's why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for a new track, but I think his track choice is wrong, and it's not going back.
