The 28-year-old chef was found dead in a mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead this week in the staircase of a local mall.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't think of anyone who wanted to harm him and said, "It's all right now."
According to the office of the San Francisco Coroner, the body found on Wednesday morning at the Nishida shopping mall was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police said that the death had been convicted of murder and that an investigation was under way.
Louis Galicia, the victim's brother, told KGO, the ABC radio station in San Francisco, that Frank, who worked as a stream cook in Boston, found an ideal job as a stream cook at Sons & Daughters' restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A speaker at the Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were "very shocked" by Frank's death.
The speaker said, "We are a small group of close family members, and we will miss him deeply."
At this time of grief, we express our deep sympathy and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank lived in the guesthouse at first, but recently, "It's finally all right."
Louis Galicia told KGO: "Frank found an apartment and was at the same time dating a girl."
Louis Galicia said he couldn't figure out who would want to harm his brother.
Frank has a good heart and a large heart.
Louis Galicia said, "Frank always cooks dinner for his family."
He never wanted to argue with his family.
He's a follower of everyone's opinion.
Louis Galicia said, "All things in the world are likely to go wrong, but Frank is a man who glows every day."
Any leads can call the San Francisco Police to report the number 415-575-4444.
Primary doctor ' s strike: call for new labor action
The primary doctor's delegate called on the Union to approve its new labour action in response to the new contract dispute.
The Junior Doctors Committee of the British Medical Association will ask all its members to support more labour action starting in early September.
According to the Board of Primary Doctors, the ministers had not resolved their concerns about the contract.
Primary doctors and medical students voted in July to boycott the contract deal with the British Medical Association.
Of those voting, 58 per cent objected to the contract deal.
Ellen McCourt, the Chair of the Junior Doctors Committee, in a letter to members on Twitter on Thursday evening, said that the government was “always silent” about the issues that led to the rejection of the contract.
She said, “In view of this, the Executive Committee of the Board of Primary Doctors has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and has called for a resumption of formal consultations on all concerns.”
In response to the Government ' s silence, today the Executive Committee of the Board of Primary Doctors formally requested the British Medical Association Council to convene a special session to approve a long-term plan to upgrade labour action from early September.
The dispute has led primary doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the first full strike in the history of the UK National Health Service.
Dr. Johann Malawana, head of the junior doctor of the British Medical Association, resigned after voting against the contractual terms recommended by the British Medical Association.
In a meeting before the 54,000 junior doctors and medical students voted, he said to members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, stated that the contract would be enforced among the medical staff in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Don't be part of the Union?"
A gesture ended a crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday and both sides shook hands and announced an official end to the eight-month saliva war and economic sanctions.
However, as Vladimir Putin greets the Turkish President in a golden hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I have a strong feeling that this reconciliation is the most desirable one for Ankara.
Yes, both sides did shake hands.
However, even according to the standard that Mr. Putin has always held in mind, Putin has only smiled lightly and has shown little enthusiasm.
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan reportedly mentioned Putin as a “good friend” five times.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to the pre-crisis level, even higher.
The next day, a newspaper wrote that Mr. Erdoğan was acting as if nothing had happened.
But I think his enthusiasm suggests something to the contrary.
However, Mr. Putin's continued indifference showed that he had forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement was the reason for the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
The reaction in Moscow was intense.
Mr. Putin vehemently criticized the incident and accused Ankara of secretly counting Moscow behind it.
The attacks from so-called friends are even more unacceptable.
It is difficult, if not impossible, to re-establish real trust on both sides.
Russian opinion has also turned since November.
For months now, the government-controlled media have carried out an alarmingly full-scale attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seemed to be responsible for everything.
Of these, the most serious were accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdoğan ' s family had profited from the illegal oil trade in the so-called Islamic State-controlled Syrian region.
He has categorically denied the claim.
However, news from St. Petersburg suggests that it is time to move forward.
After all, the meeting was premised on Putin receiving an apology from Turkish President Erdoğan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the truce are obvious.
First, Erdoğan was pushed out of power after last month ' s failed coup d ' état, so he needed the support of all his friends.
It is clear that the constant terrorist attacks have hit him hard.
There is also economic motivation.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, particularly by banning charter flights that can transport millions of Russian tourists to Turkish shores every year.
The figure has fallen significantly by almost 90 per cent.
As flights resume, Russian travel agencies and charter companies will be relieved.
They'll be heading towards the end of the season for the Mediterranean.
State television even this week predicted that the prices of fruit and vegetables would fall once Turkish agricultural imports were reopened.
A story from the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti says, "The tourists are there and the tomatoes are back."
The visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara was outraged by the weak reaction of the Western world to the intention to take over.
Moreover, Ankara was dissatisfied with the slow progress of EU accession negotiations and Putin ' s involvement for a long time, and Putin was keen to exploit political chills and weaken Turkey ' s relations with the Western world.
Russian leaders will certainly get Ankara's points because of their support for the elected authorities after the failed coup d'état.
Note that this is a gift to Moscow, which has always had deep fears of regime change.
Thus, the meeting held in this glorious beachside palace of Kim Bei made Russia and Turkey ally with two nations that were rejected and abused by the Western world, and one analyst described it as "not in the union".
However, despite open reconciliation, significant differences remain between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors. Moscow has recently played the role of peacemaker in Syria, while Russia and Turkey support the opposite faction.
It can be foreseen that, after almost three hours of preliminary talks, the two Presidents said at the launch meeting that the subject had not yet been addressed.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided questions about the differences between the two sides, which Putin stressed.
There was no clear consensus on how to share differences on the Syrian issue.
It must be a good thing that the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries re-opened their dialogue after months of open hostility and the possibility of a major catastrophe brought about by the shooting down of Russian warplanes by Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
According to the Chief Executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank will be simplified into a logistics department.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEun told BBC Scotland that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand had been dedicated to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago, on the verge of collapse, relief had to be accepted and the pursuit had been abandoned since then.
During that time, brand strategists used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
The group spent millions of pounds to sponsor international sports events such as the six-nation football tournament and the Winboldon tennis championship champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right thing to do is to make more national brands visible.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish clients, but will not return to the status quo ante.
In England and Wales, all references other than headquarters and stock exchanges will be changed to National Westminster Bank.
The Alster Bank brand has been used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Autonomous Region.
There are also other, more prominent, smaller private bank brands, such as the Censorship Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan was interviewed during a tour of clients and employees in Inverness County.
He told the BBC Scotland Division that "The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and will also be one of the employees' hired brands because we are now a bank with many brands in the larger sense."
Because the bank itself became an international brand, RBS became a global brand.
At this point, I would like to say that we no longer focus on the globe and that we have turned our eyes to the mainland.
Each brand represents different industries, and our employees serve their clients through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations tournament; at the same time, efforts have been made to raise the profile of different brands sponsoring sports events.
The CEO said, "It's time to become a multi-brand bank, because in private we've been looking for ways to become a better bank to serve our clients."
If we were to become a big bank with a lot of brand names three years ago, we would be scorned.
We are now focusing on client needs, and I am sure you have noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands, and now is the right time.
Daitouri won 3,000 jobs in Newmucket with the success of Prediletion.
Newmarquit's two victories helped DeTouri win his profession by 3,000, after which he sprayed champagne to celebrate.
Friday, professional horse jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th victory in Newmarket.
He took the hand of his trainer John Gosden's Prédiletion in a rush on the street and won two victories that night, which also enabled him to achieve a career of 3,000.
The 45-year-old Italian was the sixth professional horse jockey to achieve this milestone in the field of flat-field competition.
The top five are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion rider that won in Ghayyar earlier said, "This is special."
I'm excited because my family was there.
I'm happy about what I did in Newmuckett, because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big horse race, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's just a normal Friday night with 20,000 viewers.
I'm happy and humble.
After the victory, Daituli brought in Prediletion, which caused the whole party to cheer.
In the barrier field, two jockeys, Sir Richard Johnson, the champion, and Sir Anthony McCoy, the 20-year-old champion, who won more than 4,300 victories in his record career.
Berger was the champion of the 9th German Games and won 4,493 victories in his career.
Dayturi is one of the best jockeys of our time, so it's not surprising that he has achieved this milestone achievement, and not many people have done so before him.
He was fashionable and strong, but what really made him emerge from the heavy room was his tactical reason.
He is a remarkable horseman, and his passion and charm have attracted a large number of fans to this movement over the years.
A few weeks ago, I told Epsom that if he wasn't just a weekend with a jockey, he would have won 6,000!
Seriously, it's too important that Detouri be the best horse winner in Britain in 30 years.
He's got a lively personality. It's good for the English horse race, but besides that, he's an incredible jockey.
Detouri celebrates this milestone with his iconic jump-down movement.
From jumping through the jump line to jumping down the horse, Daytouri has been a typical representative of the British flat-ground field for 20 years.
His career is like a roller coaster.
He won a number of championships, including the famous "Seven Successes" in 1996 at the Royal Escorcaym, but he was also hit by a plane crash and banned for taking forbidden drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned to the field after the end of the six-month ban period, he had had a hard time. But, finally, he showed an amazing personality advantage and finally returned to the top, giving the skeptics the head.
He probably won't be able to do it for too long — he said before that he wanted to be in the race at least until he was 50 years old.
Russian President Putin removed Sergei Ivanov from the post of Director of Cabinet
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly removed Sergei Ivanov from his post as Chief of Staff.
For many years, Mr. Ivanov has been a member of the core group that has gained Mr. Putin's trust.
Ivanov, currently 63 years old, has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
A Kremlin statement stated that Mr. Putin had “declared Ivanov's post as Head of the Russian President's Office”, but did not give reasons.
Anton Vaino, who began serving as Mr. Ivanov ' s deputy in 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. Vaino is 44 years old and a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonian capital, he graduated from the famous Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he managed the President's draft and government employees, as stated on the Kremlin website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Mr. Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of this Government is to support the Head of State in drafting laws and implementing control directives.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself had asked to resign and had recommended Mr. Waino to take over.
Is that a good smile?
Moscow is puzzled by this move.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest assistants and, like Putin, worked in the Soviet Security Service (KGB).
As Chef de Cabinet, he was one of the most influential persons in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcasted on national television, both claimed that the Chef de Cabinet himself had asked to resign.
Despite the smile in front of the camera, almost no one is convinced — especially at this time before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of losing or losing in some sort of power struggle?
I haven't heard yet.
However, the official statement — that a candidate who was once considered a presidential candidate suddenly chose to dominate Russia's environmental policy — raised many doubts.
The Kremlin website quoted Mr. Ivanov ' s dialogue with Mr. Putin and said, "Yes, I asked you at a dialogue early in 2012 to give me this difficult job, even a difficult one, four-year term."
As a result, I've been Presidential Chef de Cabinet for four years and eight months.
Mr. Ivanov took up this position in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, was a former member of the State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin became Director of the Federal Security Agency (FSB, formerly the National Security Agency), Mr. Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
After Mr. Putin took office, he designated Mr. Ivanov as one of his five most trusted.
At one point, it was thought that Mr. Ivanov might become President of Russia after Mr. Putin's second term had ended, because the three re-elections were unconstitutional.
But the position ultimately belongs to Putin's other close assistant, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin took up the post of Prime Minister of Russia before returning to office after three and a half years.
The mystery fish came out, Banff, a garden.
One of Banff's residents found fish in his garden and then sent out a request for help.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could have been saloons from a sea tornado.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, released a video of this strange scene on Periscope in the hope that someone could explain to him why these two inches of fish would appear.
The Quince Ferry Bridge has now reached Farf.
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north side of the Queensferry Crossing bridge to the tall bridge, which means the bridge has now reached Farf.
The project is now near completion, and the project is the first of its kind.
The bridge, which started in Farf, is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 metric tons.
It used 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 slanted zippers.
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
The Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, visited the site today and became one of the first people to board the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic moment in the construction of the Quince Ferry Bridge."
We have all witnessed engineering work on such an ambitious project, and this part of the bridge alone uses more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel.
Although the size and weight of the bridge are enormous, the completion of the dragons between the high bridge and the bridge surface requires fine work and very precise assembly.
Overall, nearly 79 per cent of the total bridge surface has now been installed, and the concrete surface of the last section of the bridge is poured today at Rosyth, meaning that all the bridges are ready for position.
Michael Martin, Project Director of the Quince Ferry Bridge Construction Company, said, "No matter which bridge project, the first one is a major milestone."
As far as that remarkable project is concerned, the team has shown the cutting edge of civil engineering technology.
Once the last section of the road panel is installed and connected to the expanded North Bridge road panel, the remaining gaps on the north side or close to the land side will need to be completed.
The completion of this operation will require the transfer of the northern heights southward of the bridge 700 mm.
It's a huge operation, and it's also a very sophisticated one.
It's huge because the height bridge is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 metric tons, and requires a slope of about 3%.
It's sophisticated because the engineering team needs to make sure that the deviation is very small, with only a few millimeters on each side.
It is gratifying to note that everything is going well.
Simon Bails picks up female gymnastics all-powerful champions.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is not affected by all this.
It's full of energy when you jump.
There's more to the balance of the upper wood blades.
Free gymnastics is amazing.
The overall performance was excellent.
Now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnastics player, who took the all-power champion on Thursday, fully demonstrated her talent in leading the world in gymnastics at the Olympics.
She has a 62.198 score that goes far beyond the silver medal winner, the "Final Five" player, Aly Raisman, and the bronze medal winner, Aliya Mustafaina.
Simon-Bails from the United States performed a balanced wood performance at the all-art gymnastics women's personal finals of the 2016 summer Olympics, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byers helped the U.S. team achieve four consecutive championships of female gymnastics personal ability at the Olympic Games, where she personally won five medals, further confirming that she is the generation and possibly the best gymnastics player in history.
When I saw my share, Byers couldn't help but shed tears. She finally ended this long journey.
As a result, Bayers joins Michael Phelps in the 'Twenty Years Ahead of Athletes', raising sports in their respective fields to new heights:
Bails has been known as the Grand Prix for the last three years and has won 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold medals. She has been trained daily with ambition to achieve greater accuracy. Mary Lou Retton, the 1984 Olympic champion, said, "Bails is the best gymnastics player I've ever seen."
There was also the last competition in Brazil, but it was more a match between herself and the pressure of great expectations than a competition between Byers and other gymnastics players.
Everyone would be very disappointed if Byers did not return to her home in Spring, Texas, full of gold medals.
Simon Bails (left) and Leisman from the United States hug each other, who won gold and silver medals, respectively, at the all-women artistic gymnastics finals of the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August (Friday).
Byers won the first gold medal on Tuesday to give a nice surprise to Martha Karolyi, the soon-to-be-retired coach of the national team.
Although Byers insisted that he had not planned for the future in the long-standing process of taking over the championship, that was not entirely true.
One part of Byers' free gymnastics — including the one with her iconic upswing chain — was accompanied by Latin music, which she used to listen to only one block away from the Olympic Hall in Rio.
It's no coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by grandparents as a baby and found by the mother of Aimee Boorman during a field trip to the stadium, has now grown into a strong force.
Bayers has not failed in the All-power game since the summer of 2013, and she will win if she wants to win.
It's just an illusion that Mustafa is a little ahead after two rotations.
Balancing wood and free gymnastics two projects, the champion of the world's champion Bayers, are waiting for an ambush.
Her balanced wood score was 15.433, and her free gymnastics score was 15.933.
And while waiting for the final score to come out, Lesman hugged the bass lightly. When Bayers learned of what he had dreamed of, he left tears behind.
Leisman behaved a little like revenge four years ago, when she was in third place, but lost to Mustafaina in the finals.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, who was called "Grandma" by the American play, was far ahead.
She flew to the crowd after the end of her free gymnastics to kiss and announce her return, but sometimes before that return, it seemed questionable.
Byers is only 19 years old. Since earlier this week, his news has spread virally on Twitter. As far as Byers is concerned, his life has been given a whole new meaning.
Mahaj Brown, 6 years old, survived the Philadelphia shooting.
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, and this is the second six-year-old who was shot in the city this week.
The grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child who was shot was Mahaj Brown.
They said Brown had multiple gunshot wounds in the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but the child was sober on his way to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, and his little body was hit by bullets, and his grandmother, Delores Meléndez, said to the TV station.
I can't believe it.
The boy was in critical condition at the hospital and had undergone several operations.
His family told the television station that the child was expected to recover.
He was about to start his first grade in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Of the other three who were shot, two were 29 years old and one was 32.
According to CBS Philadelphia, the situation of one of the 29-year-old victims is critical; the situation of the other two victims is stable.
According to the television station, the child and the 29-year-old victim were found in the front seat of the car.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether there were gunmen among the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like multiple gunfights.
A number of shell casings of offensive weapons were discovered at the scene, which leads to the inference that they used different offensive weapons.
From that point of view, there is no doubt that this is an ongoing war.
There are shell casings on the sidewalks on both sides of the street.
"So, it can be seen that a number of armed men were at the scene in a state of intense war," said Anthony Ginaldi, Chief of Police of Philadelphia, to the television station.
A number of houses and vehicles were damaged in the area.
No arrest operation has yet been carried out, and the police are said to be checking surveillance videos.
On Tuesday, another six-year-old (girl) was shot in the arm by a stray bullet while playing in front of his home in West Oak Lane.
She is currently recovering and the police are still pursuing the suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie?
That's how I evaluated this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First, since 1984, I have been to every summer Olympics, but the United States has never been so dominant.
Secondly, the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnastics — Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez — who have been inspiring many colored girls.
The formation of this team is a great pride for all because it includes Aly Raisman of Judaism and Madison Kocian of Catholicism.
The team finally looks like the American team.
It also consolidated the peak position of black and Latino women in this movement.
The top female gymnast has been African-American for the past four years.
Last year, Simon and Gabriel were ranked first and second.
That's amazing.
The last Olympics, Gabriel Douglas, “unfortunately” became the Olympic champion, cheering America.
Today, the world has witnessed three world champions, Simon Byers, Douglas, and Laurie Hernández, who have made the most wonderful performances. They've made their routine gymnastics work.
On Thursday, Simon helped the American team achieve four consecutive championships on the Women ' s Personal Capability Project.
Her teammate, Ali Leisman, got the silver medal.
We're at the top of this movement, but that's not the case in all American gymnastics classes.
Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie entered the Olympic team on the same route as Ali and Madison.
They are the Final Five, because the next Olympic gymnastics team will consist of four gymnastics players, which is Marta Karolyi's last year of teaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly sport, gymnastics are trained mainly in private gymnastics clubs, and their parents have to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotel fees (including the associated costs of coaches and gymnastics and family members), and the list of fees is constantly increasing.
Most gymnastic clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the industry.
All gymnastics training is done in these clubs and is a long-term and expensive expense for gymnastics families.
Aimee Boorman, Bayers' coach, and Maggie Haney, Hernández' coach, have been teaching these two gymnastics players ever since they started gymnastics.
We must bring more meaningful and accessible gymnastics training to countless young girls who are deeply affected by Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie.
Twenty years ago, I founded my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we provided free and cheap gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youths (mainly black and Hispanic Americans) in black residential areas and developed national and world champions.
In September, we will expand Detroit to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this opportunity to learn and who will benefit from this remarkable Olympic movement.
Gymnastics helps to nurture body strength, flexibility and harmony, as well as the spirit, self-discipline and determination to endure hard work.
These can bring lifelong benefits to a person ' s health, education and success in his or her work.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sports is significant, especially for girls.
It's an exciting moment.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for their wonderful display of "the power of girls" in winning Olympic group gold medals, as well as for inspiring young girls of so many different backgrounds to start the path towards health, strength and success.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's offer, the junior doctor planned to launch a further strike.
The ministers initially hoped to end the change-induced dispute by accepting a modified contract from British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 primary doctors who voted opposed the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract, saying that the British National Health Service (NHS) was currently in a “vacuum zone” and that a slight delay would harm the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract begins with a reference to the modification of the working practices of primary doctors overnight and weekends in order to improve care during irregular working hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Junior Doctors Committee, said in a statement last night: "The primary doctor still has serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially if it exacerbates the current labor crisis and fails to treat all doctors fairly."
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors sign the new contract, and we need to make progress, and time is running out.
BMA tried to resolve disputes through negotiations, but everyone was reluctant to participate and sometimes the government responded in silence.
Nevertheless, just last month we received the promise of Jeremy Hunt, who said that his door was always open.
"Jeremy Hunt now needs to take action to remove enforcement and address the concerns of primary doctors."
If he does not do so, the primary doctor makes it clear that they are ready to take further labour action.
The last strike, which took place at the end of April, resulted in nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 extensions of appointments, as nurses and medical doctors provided cover for doctors on the picket line.
The ministers initially hoped to end the change-induced dispute by accepting the BMA-modified contract.
BMA hopes to get better weekend wages for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract.
NHS Employers CEO Daniel Mortimer called the junior doctor to stop playing any strike.
Mr. Mortimer said, "The labour action has done little, but on the contrary it has put pressure on already dedicated teams and services, leading to fear, anxiety and confusion among patients, caregivers and their families".
Over the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Board of Primary Doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and other departments, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and the whistle-blowers.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility of training, other training for those who re-enter after career interruptions, training costs, common knowledge of curriculum outline, refresher leave and gender pay differentials in the medical field - which illustrate the importance attached by employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health to the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds of medicine a day can reduce the threat of heart attack.
Officials suggested that a medication of Pound2 a day should be extended to more patients and that the duration of medication should be extended, after which thousands of heart patients would benefit from the drug.
Anticoagination pills for ticagrelor can reduce the risk of repeated heart attacks among heart patients.
This drug lasts 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a second heart attack.
The National Health and Clinical Optimization Institute (NICE), a regulatory agency of the UK National Health Service (NHS), recommends continuous drug use for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now NHS Regulatory Body NICE recommends continuous medication for patients for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year, and a quarter of them will continue to experience repeated heart disease or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fat matter forming specks in the deposition of the arteries.
If the speck breaks, it leads to a blood clot, which in turn prevents the flow of blood into the heart, leading to a heart attack.
If the embolism moves, it enters the bloodstream, obstructs the flow of blood into the brain and causes a stroke.
A patient who has experienced a heart attack is at a higher risk of having another heart attack.
Cargrethe was made by a British company, AstraZeneca, and sold in the name of the commodity, Briliko, to reduce the risk of morbidity by reducing the formation of blood clots.
The NICE draft guidance released today recommends that patients take 90 mg for 12 months, followed by 60 mg for Kargray and twice aspirin each day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Although there is effective secondary preventive treatment, as many as a quarter of patients who have had a history of heart disease will suffer from another disease or stroke, usually with serious consequences."
Fear of relapse can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that taking it with aspirin would effectively reduce the risk of repeated heart attacks and strokes for patients who have experienced a heart attack.
We are very pleased that the temporary recommendation for Cagre will provide more treatment options for thousands of beneficiaries.
The draft guidance does not recommend the continuation of the treatment beyond this deadline, given the limited information on the efficacy and safety of the treatment of Cagre after three years, in particular the risk of haemorrhage.
Computer culture has made “election fraud” prevalent in Muslim regions.
Tower Hamlets, former mayor of Lutfur Rahman, was brutally dismissed for corruption last year, prompting the publication of a government report.
This lethal government report reveals today that the culture of “political correctness” has led to the widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being ignored.
Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet minister, accused the police, election regulatory bodies and town halls of turning a blind eye to the evidence of electoral abuse because of "exensiveness to ethnic divisions and religious issues".
The former Minister of Community Affairs, the current anti-corruption leader, said that it was bad to intimidate voters with religious positions and that the police should be allowed to set up cordoners outside polling stations in order to protect scared voters.
He suggested that voters vote with identification documents to confirm their identity.
Currently, voters only have to declare their names and addresses.
The report even recommended that the ink that could not be wiped on the voter's fingers be painted to prevent a second vote.
Sir Erik said that the protection of whistleblowers should be strengthened.
He called for increased media access to parliamentary documentation and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
"It's not just to guard against electoral fraud, but also to protect local governments from the scourge of a widespread culture of corruption and financial fraud that is closely linked to it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street after the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral tribunal ruled that the incumbent mayor, Rahman, was subject to a series of corrupt and illegal practices and should be dismissed.
The Tribunal found that Rahman had “very ridiculously abused” the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and kept silent on allegations that the sword pointed at him for racial discrimination and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have declared that it was a religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him during the campaign.
As many as 300 votes have doubts, and voters may have faked someone else to vote.
Sir Erik said there was evidence of electoral fraud throughout the country.
He warned, in particular, of the fraud of the post-elections, where senior members of the Muslim community were said to put pressure on voters to vote for their designated candidates.
Sir Eric made a number of suggestions for cleaning up the voting mechanism, including bringing a good identity card to confirm your identity.
In his report, he said: “The evidence shows that senior members, especially in Pakistan and Bangladesh background communities, put pressure on vulnerable groups in some minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote according to their will”.
“They fear that State institutions will turn a blind eye to such behaviour because of excessive sensitivity to ethnic divisions and religious `political correctness'.”
Sir Erik put forward 50 proposals to clean up the electoral mechanism, including a strict ban on political activists from handling mailed voting documents to prevent the “voting harvest”.
The report also requires that registration information be scrutinized to prevent voter lists from being used for immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa May is also considering the report.
These included a requirement for voters to produce identification documents before voting.
After the vote, the ink that the voters could not wipe on their fingers prevented a second vote.
Systematic verification of the ethnic affiliation of voters to ensure eligibility to vote.
The valid deadline for the automatic mailing of voting requests is set at three years.
Political activists and radicals are prohibited from handling completed mail voting and mailing voting envelopes.
The police were authorized to set up a cordon around the polling stations.
The amendment of the legal provisions made it easier to charge persons for the crime of intimidation under the People ' s Representation Act 1983 (Representation of the People Act 1983).
It is against the law to take photographs at polling stations.
English is allowed only at polling stations (except Wales).
(c) Strengthen training to ensure that staff strictly enforce the requirement that voters go to polling halls alone.
Sir Erik denounced Metropolitan Police, saying that they had not made any criminal charges after the Tower Hamlets incident, which was truly “surprising”.
“Rahman and his election officer suffered a number of corruptions and irregularities, which resulted in the disqualification of the election court”, he said.
In accordance with the criteria for criminal certification, he is beyond doubt guilty in many respects.
He also criticized the "check boxing" of the Municipal Council Election Registration Department, which was virtually non-existent.
Sir Erik said, "The court judgment against Tower Hamlets last year was a wake-up call."
My country has a glorious tradition of “mothers of parliament”, but the secret election frauds and all the subsequent denials of certain institutions are worrying and threaten this good reputation.
The cyclists who looked like Princess Kate at the Rio Olympics and those who ran into other famous people are being admired.
This week, Pauline Ferrand Prevot, a French biker who looks like Princess Kate at the 2016 Rio Olympics, was very well received by the audience.
But the 24-year-old Olympic player was not the only gold medal contender at this summer Olympics who ran over famous faces, at least not according to social media.
Therefore, in honour of the Rio Olympic Games and all the famous faces that appeared on the screen at the time, FEMAIL compiled a list of Olympic players who ran into Hollywood stars.
Hunters and Wolves: Brady Ellison (left) male archer of America has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to Kate's face on the bicycle track, many Internet users quickly discovered that some archer was the twin of Leonardo DiCaprio.
The American male archer Brady Ellison has caused a huge commotion in social media since his photo of Wolf of Wall Street was released on Twitter.
In fact, the archer noticed the social media campaign and admitted to being small, someone said he looked like a plum.
"I don't think I look much alike except for the gills," Brady said to Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome dude, so I guess that's a compliment to me."
One of the most popular contrasts at the 2012 London Olympics will no doubt find more similarities this year: British jumper Greg Rutherford looks like the famous actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Aliya Mustafaina, a Russian gymnastics player with big eyes that can speak, was identified as a Cuban-American singer, Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, for years, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison, the lead singer of the Glee.

Yulia Efimova, the Russian swimmer with the silver medal, and Annalynne McCord, the actor, have the same brown skin and blond hair, while Nikami of the US team is compared to "Joseph Gordon Levitt" by fans.
Woman: Football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar faces and eyes.
It's not the only one: one Twitter user was happy to find that others saw these similarities.
Dissemination theory: According to this user, there may be a reason why the pair looks like this.
A Twitter user recently happyly declared on the Internet that "other netizens also think Hope Soro and Jennifer Carpenter actually look exactly the same."
Indeed, the American football star and the star of Bloodthirsty Forensics have very similar faces and eyes.
Other popular contrasts include Kerri Walsh Jennings, whose smile is almost the same as that of the actress Laura Linney, and Gabby Douglas, a gold medal-winning gymnastics player, who has a beautiful and brilliant smile with "Bring It On star" Gabrielle Union.
The CEO of the Olympics apologized for the comment that Chinese swimmers are "slow as pigs"
On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald's comment on 14-year-old Adil's acquisition of a woman's 4x200 m free swim relay provoked a live viewer of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's (CBC) Olympics.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, an interpreter of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation CBC, said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer would "go out faster than the stink" in the competition, and finally "go as slow as a pig", after which the CBC was forced to apologize.
The interpreter, Byron MacDonald, made some observations at the end of the women's 4x200-metre free swim relay final, when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
The audience heard the team of CBC exposers, Byron, who wears "coloured glasses" critic, say, "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
Because of the excitement, the start of the journey was faster than the smell, but later it was as slow as a pig.
Thanks to her.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, Abzo, was the second best, with 1 minute and 57 seconds to 79 - 1.61 seconds behind Canada's Taylor Ruck, which led the Canadian team to narrow the gap with China.
The entire Canadian audience was shocked by this interpreter's tone and language, and they reacted to it on the Internet very quickly.
Emmett Macfarlane tweets: "The CBC interpreter says that 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "Slow like a pig?"
This idiot doesn't realize it's live.
"The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter quickly came on Twitter, and many asked him to quit.
When Twitter users heard that Byron MacDonald was slow to react to it, they did not stop.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Wow #Baylan MacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and your words sound like a bunch of racists to us all.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, the CBC radio host, apologized on the live air for Byron's comments, saying, "We apologize for comments on the performance of the swimmer."
"We apologize for this inappropriate wording."
CBC apologized more than 90 times to Twitter users who responded to the speech.
Another interpreter, Scott Russell, apologized on behalf of Byron.
The CBC then copied their apology and pasted it to more than 90 other Twitter users protesting against what Byron said.
The channel also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We are deeply sorry to say that and to broadcast it live.
Last night, we moved quickly to apologize to those watching us live and watching us in social media.
What needs to be clarified is that Byron's story is about the performance of the swimmer, but not about her personally.
That means that the wording is indeed inappropriate, and Byron is deeply sorry about it.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the live air, saying that his words did not mean a little personal attack and tried to justify his remarks by using them.
"I want to spend some time apologizing for what he said last night at the end of the women's relay race," he said on the CBC Oscillation.
"I'm just commenting on the performance of swimmer, not personal."
"Of course, I didn't mean disrespectful. I'm sorry."
Primark customers expressed their anger at a brazen woman who tried to wear underwear in the center of the store.
A woman took off her underwear on the spot in the centre of a Primark store, where customers did not know where to look.
Worse still, she checked how she looked when she put them on, and then she took off her panties and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelf and eventually tried to wear four panties in the shop at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
The woman kept trying to wear underwear in the Primark store in the Bouverie Place mall in Folkeston, and then put it back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson, who was also in the store, said that after trying to wear underwear, the mysterious woman "get dressed again, then walk out of the store and buy nothing."
She said, "Everyone can't believe what they saw."
She stood in the middle of the shop, took off her panties from the shelf, took off her tights and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a hidden place to try it on -- she was just standing there, brazenly."
"When she took off her panties again, everyone was surprised. Apparently, she wasn't happy because she put them back on the shelf."
And then she tried three more like this, and she found out she didn't like them, and then she got dressed again and left the shop.
"She doesn't seem to care that someone is looking at her -- or she doesn't think who's gonna finally buy the underwear she tried to wear."
Ms. Davidson (33 years old), who lives in Kent town, said, "It's disgusting to think someone's gonna buy someone else's underwear that they wear and they're not washed."
This happened Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "When she leaves, the shopkeeper obviously has to take down the underwear, which is fortunately the case."
"I hate buying a new pair of underwear home, but I find another woman trying to pass it and never washed it."
A spokesperson for Primark said, "Primark already knows what happened at our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9th."
All problematic commodities have been set aside.
How to use the Maga technique to protect yourself in a gun attack.
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com may bring you some sense of security.
We're going to the master of Krav Maga Federation in New York City, Rhon Mizrachi, to teach us how to get close enough to deal with the gunman.
Whether he approaches you from the front or from the back, the video will teach you how to win.
Mizrachi said that if the shooter approached you from behind, the first thing you had to do was turn around so that you could see the attackers and "clean the fire."
Then, put a gun in your forearm and shoulder, and then hit the attacker in the face with your elbow.
Then he took the knee to his groin, turned the gun in his hand, hit him in the face with a barrel and a back-up gun, and kept the weapon on him.
If the shooter approaches from the front, a similar technique is used — to keep your body outside the line of fire, to take the gun and turn it around so that the gunman cannot fire.
At the same time, he put his weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, turned the gun from his grip, then pointed it at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video and see what Mizrachi did.
But remember, if you're not Maga Master, the safest way to get out of robbery is to hand over the cash.
A rogue family destroyed a cheap rental house in Soltash, Cornwall County, before being evicted.
A rogue family who had been evicted for intimidation of its neighbours destroyed the low-cost rental housing that they lived in before leaving, causing a loss of Pound50,000.
After a long series of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and his husband, Shaun Trebilcock, were expelled from a cheap rental house in Soltash, Cornwall County.
After being forcibly removed from the residence, housing association officials were surprised to discover that the place had been severely damaged.
The walls are full of holes, the floors are torn, the garbage is all over the floor, and the walls are covered in chaos.
The family has been moving since the eviction and is said to be living in a private residence.
Donna McEvoy, the housing manager of the Cornwall County Housing Association, said she feared that the house could no longer be saved.
She said, "This is a nightmare for people living here, and I don't think people can live like this."
There are a lot of things to weigh now, because this house is likely to be a bad element in Cornwall County.
The family is notorious and their names are equally notorious.
The couple has three sons who will live here from time to time. According to the police, the family's terrorist acts include fighting in the streets using baseball bats, terrorizing nearby residents, drug addiction, drug trafficking, yelling, arguing and cursing.
In June, a 47-year-old tenant named Skeldon received an antisocial behavioral resolution.
In this house that may have been demolished, many rooms have been filled with garbage for a long time.
In this room that once traded drugs, the floor was lifted.
Neighbors say they often see them fighting in the streets, and they often call the police.
After giving them an 11-week extension to move voluntarily, the Cornwall County Housing Association forced her and her husband to leave the house this week.
At last, the relieved neighbours cheered for it, saying that life before was a hell of a human being.
A neighbor said, "They don't care about anybody."
We've been living next door for 20 years. It's been so bad.
We've seen the police on countless occasions.
"This morning, we couldn't sleep."
We're up early because it's too quiet here -- we're not used to it!
They're finally gone, it's wonderful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the community executive manager of the Cornwall County Housing Association, said that the family had failed to cooperate well with the local government.
The family has lived in this house for 20 years, and the police often visit.
Garbage and old toys are left on the side of this low-rent weed.
He added: “It is regrettable that the tenant did not bear any responsibility for the actions of her and her family, and that eviction was the last thought of the Cornwall County Housing Association.”
It was a very difficult case because they behaved in a very extreme manner, and what they did must have frightened the neighbours.
I thank my team for the work done, as well as the Devon and Cornwall Police and the community members who bravely provided us with information.
I hope this will bring some comfort to the neighbours and convey the message that we will not tolerate antisocial behaviour.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said that their three sons had lived in this house at different times, but also said that they were in their 20s.
After they were removed, a dirty mattress was thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms.
The housing association workers will soon clean up all the garbage around the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and discovered over 70 grams of marijuana, as well as scales, drug-using devices and Pound1,700 in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of Category B drugs and for drug trafficking intent.
She claims that the money was used to buy gravestones for Lee Skeldon, the son who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is understood that after becoming homeless Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms in the house were painted with graffiti.
The police said they would expel tenants who disobeyed the tenant rules.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall County Police said that the eviction had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to defy tenant rules.
"This warning is directed at those who think they will not be blamed for their actions, and those who are devastated by them," she said.
Devon County and Cornwall County Police will not tolerate crime and antisocial behaviour, and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Reed: The elected President of Hilarije will nominate Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senator Harry Reid, leader of the Democratic Party of the Senate, said he was convinced that if the Democratic Party presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, was elected president, she would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senator Republicans have been blocking the confirmation of Garander since President Barak Obama nominated Garland in March.
The majority leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, said that the next president would choose him to replace the late Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
Reed said at a telephone conference on Thursday that he predicted that Hilary would choose Garland with "some credibility".
Reed's female spokesperson then said that Reed had no direct conversation with Hilary about whether or not to nominate Garland, and said that he was only guessing.
He commended Garland Grangara and said that Hilary's team did not want to be "disturbed" by the new candidate.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States District of Columbia Federal Circuit Court of Appeal.
Reed said that the Republicans who stopped Garland from nominating were the "pearers" and "achievers" of Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate.
He said Trump wasn't fit to be president.
"Treats": Naked calendar "Women and Men Love"
Treats magazine will work with photographer David Bellemere to film a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
This time, they plan to find a new generation of top models for their 2017 NUuses calendar, not famous naked people.
Steve Shaw, the president of Treats, said earlier this year that their magazine, dominated by nudity, was different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "the latter is male-oriented."
And we're looking at women.
Apparently, he thought the same thing about this set of calendars.
"We need to show the eternal and classic nudity that makes both women and men feel comfortable, and this time we're inspired by it," Shaw said at a calendar launch.
The women will be happy to participate in this film because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photo applications online, and they can personally go to open recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.
Video reports show that small sleeping sharks are the longest-lived vertebrates.

The French court rejected the petition to dismantle shops in the jungle camp.
A French court rejected a petition by the Galay government to dismantle dozens of temporarily built shops and restaurants in the “circle” refugee camp, where thousands of refugees are currently living.
At the court hearing this week, the Galay government argued that the French government should have the right to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops in the camp. People sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks in these shops in the camp, provide hairdressing services, and sell tea at 50 cents (40 pence) or basic meals at a few euros price in temporarily built restaurants.
The Governor ' s Office of Galle believes that these places should be dismantled because they are parallel economies that do not pay taxes, and there are fire and health hazards.
The humanitarian community, however, indicated to the court that these shops and restaurants were extremely important because the free food provided by State-sponsored associations and other groups could not at all meet the growing needs of refugees in the camp.
According to them, these temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
A Ryer court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the operators of the 72 temporary shops, but said that the Governor's fears were “better understandable”.
Judge Jean François Molla said that the utility of these grocery stores, cafés and restaurants went far beyond simply providing food to refugees living in “extremely dangerous conditions”.
These places, he said, were peaceful points of convergence between refugees and volunteers.
One of the locations threatened with demolition was the “Jungle Book Kids” café in the camp, which provides 200 food, English and French classes per day and offers asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was written that the closure of this café "will be a disaster for these children, many of whom are only eight years old."
Two charitable organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, predicted that the number of refugees in the bush camps had surpassed 9,000 on Friday, the highest level since the summer surge in the number of refugees.
"This $5,000 grant solves my urgent need."

According to Xinhua News, the New South Wales Government of Australia announced on 11th that $200 million (approximately $154 million) would be spent on the largest renovation since the establishment of the famous Sydney Opera Theatre.
The New South Wales government has indicated that this renovation will not change the shape of the opera shell.
The Sydney Opera House, one of Sydney's landmark buildings, was designed by Danish architect Jon Utsson and built in 1973 to receive approximately 8 million visitors per year.
Rowley Jeffs, General Manager of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes that the Sydney Opera Theatre will use this adaptation to play a "turn over" and become one of the world's most vocal concert halls.

Journalists today learned from the National Tax Administration that, by the end of June this year, tax authorities at all levels had published 2,470 “blacklists” of tax offences.
It is understood that in July 2014, the General Directorate of State Taxation took a step forward in the central government functions by publishing, in conjunction with the Tax Credit Management Scheme, the " Method for publishing information on major tax offences " .
However, the facts of the violations, the legal basis and the handling of the penalties in these cases are published, and the basic information of the offending party and the persons responsible for the relevant intermediary agency are disclosed together with the "black list".
Government departments such as Quality Check, Finance, Customs have also taken relevant disciplinary measures against persons on the "blacklist".

"Environmental problems manifest themselves in the atmosphere, water, soil pollution, but roots are still productive lifestyles".
For example, in 2015, Jiangsu province had up to 21 per cent land development, ranking among the highest in the country ' s provinces and autonomous regions.
As a result, the problems of high pollution, large energy sources and large landholdings have yet to be addressed fundamentally from productive lifestyles.
On the one hand, according to the results of the creation of various ecological environments at all levels in Jiangsu province, the country is ranked first with absolute advantage; on the other hand, the resource environment is under heavy pressure.
A solid advance in eco-environmental protection and governance requires a fundamental push towards a transformation of productive lifestyles in order to build eco-civilization for the benefit of the people in transition.

Qingdao is the twelfth city in the country and the first pilot city in Shandong Province to use and trade sewage rights for a fee.
On 11th, each enterprise came to the Qingdao City Sewerage Trading Centre to submit a claim for sewage rights, which will be followed by payment of a fee for use.
The first list of transactions that will soon be completed foreshadows the formal opening of the Qingdao waste trading pilot, which will also be the first for the province ' s sewage trading and the first for the country ' s city-level sewage trading.
At 11 a.m., Zhao Suping, General Manager of Twin Peaches Chemical (Group) Limited, Qingdao, came to the City of Qingdao City sewage rights trading centre to submit a claim for sewage rights.
At the end of last year, the company ' s plant area in the Old City district of Qingdao was completely shut down and environmentally friendly was relocated to the new plant area of Pingdu.
After Zhao Suping submitted the application form, the environmental impact report for the construction project, etc., the Qingdao City Decontamination Rights Reserve and Trading Service Centre began the initial examination of the application material.
Based on the collection criteria established by the Qingdao City price, finance etc., the initial sewage rights usage fee is currently estimated at approximately $6422,000 and the staff member will complete the approval within seven working days.
The first list of transactions that will soon be completed foreshadows the formal opening of the Qingdao waste trading pilot and will also be the first for the province-wide sewage trading and the first for the national city-level sewage trading.
Zhao Suping said that the corporate environment has now invested 400 million dollars, apparently huge, but that it has a significant impact on business management concepts and social benefits, and has opened up space for business innovation management.
On the same day, Qingjiang Qingjio Qingjiang Shinzhengchi Chao Car Parts Ltd. also came to requisition sewage rights for the 4200 high iron and interior fittings items produced annually.
The project belongs to the mechanical processing enterprise, and the initial sewage rights requested are 0.514 tonnes/year of chemical oxygen demand (COD), and 0.052 tonnes/year of ammonia (NOX).
The right to use and trade atmospheric contaminants for paid use is used to supply priority industrial enterprises with electricity and heat production throughout the city.
Existing sewage units that have been evaluated by the Environment Assessment by 1 January 2016 will not be charged a fee for their use for the time being.
"According to sewage rights for a fee is not the same as acquiring illegal sewage powers and is not free to release pollutants."
Qingdao City Environmental Protection Agency Deputy Director Han Hongyan explained that it would not be possible to allow illegal businesses to avoid punishment by buying sewage rights if illegal sewage, over-marked sewage and sewage were still subject to punishment in accordance with the relevant regulations.
In other words, by means of legal means, environmental offences are severely combated, enterprises are severely punished for excess-standard sewage, thereby protecting the environment and safeguarding public health.
Businesses are now more motivated to treat pollution for their own benefit, cherishing limited sewage rights and reducing pollutant emissions.
Driven by economic benefits, the reduction of emissions of pollutants has changed from a coercive act by the government to a conscious market act by the enterprise, thus truly achieving the objective of protecting the environment, protecting nature and safeguarding public health.
The right of discharge, also known as “emission rights”, is the right of discharge of pollutants, meaning the right of emitters to release pollutants into the environment within the limits allocated by the Government, in accordance with the law.
This right is essentially the right of the polluter to occupy, use and gain the resources of the environmental capacity.
The next step is to transfer discharge through currency exchange between internal sources, provided that total pollutant emissions do not exceed permitted emissions.
Since 1968, when the deal was proposed by the American economist Dales, the United States applied it to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources in the 1970s.
We started piloting in 2007 and are now fully operational in 14 provinces (districts, municipalities) such as Zhejiang and Jiangsu.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, in order to assist the six strategic bombers in carrying out an aerial strike against the objectives of the Islamic State in Syria, several Russian military warplanes have taken up air support from the Syrian Hemeim airbase.
On 22 February this year, the United States and Russia agreed on a ceasefire between the parties to the conflict in Syria, which has been in effect since 27 of that year.
According to the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes against terrorist organizations designated by the UN Security Council, such as the Islamic State's Support Front.
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of Russian military personnel will be guaranteed accordingly.
He also said that if extremist forces were not attacked, they would spread to Russia.
Although Russia and the West have not agreed on a joint fight against Syrian extremist forces, Russia will strengthen its cooperation with Syria, Iran, Iraq and others in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia began a military strike against Syrian extremist forces at the invitation of the Syrian Government.
The withdrawal of the main Russian military forces in Syria began on 15 March this year, but the Russian side promised to maintain its airbase in Hemimem and its naval base in Tartus.

In fact, the relationship between the village and the city is supposed to be with each other, like mothers and children, with no strength or weakness, and no one needs to rule over anyone, it should be warm.
There are no fixed patterns of rural development, but it is difficult to make spontaneous changes on the village, and the most important thing should be to allow the right people to go to the village.
The Songjiang District Department in Shanghai recently used electronic police to fix drivers to play with their mobile phones. More than 30 cases were detected during the week.
With the spread of smart phones, mobile phones are becoming more fun, and it is normal to brush micro-mails, tweets and even play games, and go shopping for treasures. Many people seem to have to walk away from their mobile phones, and they can't even stop driving.
The Road Traffic Safety Act explicitly prohibits driving mobile phones and defines it as “impeding safe driving”.
Unfortunately, this phenomenon has not been punished with due to the presence of lawbreakers, difficulties in obtaining evidence, etc., and the legal provisions have almost become the norm.
If the authorities are determined to “declare war” on driving mobile phones, and to regularize this measure, this violation will certainly be contained.
Closely monitor the management of the civil registry file, establish electronic and paper files of the non-resident's household registration material, and ensure that the file is complete and effective.
The public security organs shall notify the relevant authorities in a timely manner of the registration of non-residents ' households.
A focused clean-up of policy measures that are inconsistent with the spirit of the present implementation opinion will be carried out, the changes will be carefully revised, and the repeal will be resolutely abolished.
Wang Shefin, age 48, is carrying workers to spray pesticides on pears trees in the collective shed of Donglin Village in Taikura City.
150 acres of orchards and more than 10 trees all over the village require only 12 workers and 1 technical engineer.
The sum of $50,000 last year, at my age, wouldn't be able to get it if I worked at the factory.
Last year, the village income of Donglin reached 22 million yuan, of which the total agricultural income was nearly half.
Village secretary Su Qifan: The average land area per capita is rising each year, starting with 50 acres, and now exceeds 100 acres; the average acre benefit is increasing every year, and there is scope to increase the income of working farmers every year.
Quantification of shares to every villager, the greatest point of collective economic reform in the south of the country lies in clarifying the property rights of rural collective business assets and exploring political and economic separation.
In July 2015, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations and their village and village committees were “distributive management” of the streets of Sinshan Town Town, without the city, and village councils were responsible for the management of rural public affairs, while cooperative organizations were mainly active in the business.
The two institutions have two accounts, which do not “get together” and prevent corruption among village cadres involved in the management of their collective assets.
The Deputy Director of the Rural Committee of Jiangsu province, Paul Ping, explained that Jiangsu's next step would be to continue to promote community partnership reform, encourage farmers to develop jointly, and establish mechanisms for the functioning of democratic power at the village level.
Say hi to Bao Ping: Further advance the reforms, work with community shares, quantify assets to members of the community, fix them to farmers and form clear property rights.
Through the Internet+, the implementation of his right to information, the right to participate in decision-making and the right to supervise democratic governance, the three rights are given to farmers, and it is indeed turned into a functioning mechanism for regulated joint-stock cooperation.
At present, the new rural and collective economy in the south of the country is dominated by four development models: asset leasing, business share, agricultural development, and joint development.
It is understood that the overseas fairs serve as an important platform for promoting the construction of the "one way" in Zhejiang province.
The successful organization of these overseas fairs has accumulated valuable experience and good foundations to continue to open up emerging markets along the "one way" route, and to build an integrated platform for overseas fairs.
Pike will always be guided by raising the demand for sports by raising the demand of consumers, building an ecclesiastical circle in the sports industry, and accelerating the strategic upgrading from a single sporting goods manufacturing enterprise to a professional sports service enterprise.
Hamir added that 34 others had been wounded and taken to hospital, including three firefighters who had suffered minor injuries and had been discharged from hospital.
He also appealed to the residents of the fire apartment to contact the authorities, as some of the occupants were still unaccounted for.
According to the information received, Ms. Mariana Turay, who lived in this apartment for 30 years, said, "It looks like a bomb fell."
According to the information received, the local fire department spent 1 hour and 45 minutes putting out the fire, and residents of nearby buildings were allowed to return to their homes after a few hours.
The American Red Cross estimated that approximately 100 people were homeless, 60 to 70 of whom stayed in shelters in nearby district centres, mostly of Hispanic origin.
On August 11, the first Jinzhou wetland tourism and culture festival was inaugurated on the eve of the "Handy Lake" in the East of Chinatown, Jinzhou.
From 2014, the tourism industry generated 10 per cent of GDP in Jinzhou City; it reached 11.3 per cent in 2015.
The wetland hot springs tourist area of the East Chinese city is located in Linghai, Jinzhou city, on the coast road No. 1, 70 km from Jinzhou city, 50 km from Linghai city and 70 km from Chak Jin city.
There are indoor hot springs covering 3,000 square metres and outdoor hot springs covering 4,600 square metres.
Xiaomen girl Zhang Binbin: "Beautiful hand" has been "reversed" in the career of shooting on the road.
Zhang Donghong, from Dong Hong village in Xiangmenang district, replaced his home's 29-inch old TV with a 65-inch television show just a few days ago.
The average farmer's daughter was Zhang Binbin, who captured the silver medal of the 50-metre female rifle of the Rio Olympics for China on the night of 11th.
On the night of 11, just before this new TV, the Zhang Donghong couple and dozens of relatives and friends witnessed the amazing process of running their daughters all the way up and running from almost pre-game to almost reversible.
During that day's game, Zhang Binbin once ranked down the middle and seemed to be far from the finals.
But parents and relatives and friends didn't give up, and kept brushing the text live, seeing that with the other players out of the game, Zhang Binbin's name was raised and eventually locked up for the finals, and his family started cheering from time to time.
In the finals, Zhang Binbin won the silver medal with only 0.2 ring marks for the last few shots, after one time falling behind the ranking.
Zhang Binbin, 27 years old this year, almost passed through this hard-won silver medal during his 16-year shooting career.
Her mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told reporters that when they were hesitating, Zhang Binbin had come to find a few "novels" from his village.
These novelists were the same village children who were also recommended for training, including Zhang Binbin's cousin.
Shortly after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin took the initiative to go back to Shang An school for reasons such as family difficulties.
But after his enlightenment coach, Zhang Ajay, repeated his work, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once returned home for lack of hope because he was too late to enter the national team.
This time, not only Coach Zhang Yaji, the leader and coach of the Xiamen Shooting Arrow Campaign Centre and Fujian Provincial Team came to the house and eventually persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the Provincial Team.
Just like yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl insisted on a reversal of the shooting path.
"The way every coach chooses his team is different, when I saw Binbin's hands look beautiful, and suddenly I fell in love with each other."
Zhang Donghong also recalled that while the daughter was not the best at the training test, the number of rings made was stable, which was also an important reason for Zhang Binbin to attract coaches.
In training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yaji was most impressed by the input of the farm girl.
He recalled that more than a year after Zhang Binbin entered the Xiamen Shooting Team, the team conducted a sustained firing training, requiring the crew to remain in motion for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told the reporter that her daughter has always been a quiet, sweet child who has always loved drawings and homemade handmade toys since childhood.
"I used to make clothes at home, stitches and patches, and Binbin picks up the edges and makes his own dolls."
She said that her daughter often sews her own handmade toys, and that she is good at drawing, from the five officers of the doll to the dress, and can always do well.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and his family get together more often, and only on holidays can they return home, often by telephone.
Parents said that whether they meet or call, Zhang Binbin rarely talks about their hard work and more about having fun with their parents.
The daughter is usually not seen, and parents keep her drawings as a child at home and the honors of the years.
Zhang Xiaolong showed his daughter's cartoons to a journalist, "If she doesn't be a shooting player, she should still paint."
On the second floor of Zhang Binbin's living room, there was a cabinet full of medals, medals and certificates she had won.
Zhang Donghong put the medals and medals together, and the certificates were put together in the folders, "These are the honours of Binbin's heart for more than a decade, and we all cherish them."
In recent days, the Xiao Xiao Xiao Foundation of Hebei Province sent $16,000 in condolence gold to six families who lost relatives in the villages of Kosuke, Taiwan and Guiquan in Iijiang County.
This was another act of sympathy and care following the Fund's revelation to society to look for the missing children and lonely old people in the 7.19 flood.
7.19 The heavy rains caused extensive flooding and flooding in parts of Hebei Province, as well as deaths and disappearances.
The feeling of the good man, Iron, was touched throughout the town by the unfortunate loss of his life by helping the district with its compulsory drainage, leaving behind two-year-old children and a wife with six nails, and the good man, Iron.
On 4 August, the staff of the Tzu Xiao Foundation of Hebei Province and the Hebei brand club volunteers came to the good man's "old iron" home and gave 3,200 yuan in love to the "old iron" family.
When Yelly, Vice-President of the Brands Association, learned about the current situation of the "old iron" family, it was decided to launch a "love for sale" campaign among corporate members of the brand club to help the "old iron" family share their difficulties.
Hebei Province Tzu Xiao Foundation, all known as Hebei Province Voluntary Service Foundation, Tzu Xiao Foundation, was founded in August 2015 under the auspices of the Hebei branding committee.
According to the Hong Kong Eastern Daily, on August 12, the sale of diamonds in the Mainland is currently described as having three major problems, including the net push of false diamonds to higher prices, the weight of falsely marked diamonds, and the lack of security after sale.
Antwerp is one of the largest diamond trading centres in the world, and the local craftsmen's diamond cutting techniques are well known, and the diamonds sold are highly validated and very popular with the Mainland lady.
"A small bag, holding its hand, a small handful of lightly floating, worth almost millions of dollars", a Lao mother who was involved in buying diamonds, described her experience in Antwerp in June this year to the Mainland media.
She said she hid the diamonds in her underwear, took them to the bathroom for days, bathed them, and walked to sleep very nervously.
She claims that diamonds bought in Antwerp are bought at about $55,000 per carat, and diamonds of the same quality are retailed at around $111,000 in Xiamen.
She sold all the diamonds she had purchased, adding 20% to the purchase price, making over $200,000 at a time.
According to Mainland Customs, diamonds are not goods or necessities for passengers in their journeys, so they fall within the category of goods and are subject to declaration at the time of entry or exit, otherwise they are listed as smuggling, and the situation is severely punishable by imprisonment.
According to the foreign media, on the 10th of local time, the British Prime Minister's Office, Downing Street, announced that British Prime Minister Teresa May would spend summer vacations in Switzerland, but did not disclose any specific place for vacation.
According to the media, after the British referendum, the new British Prime Minister chose a “neutral” Swiss holiday on the European continent, with some kind of policy symbolism.
The British Guardian commented that the symbol represented by Switzerland as a neutral country played a role in the choice of the British Prime Minister's first resort.
According to the British Daily Telegraph, Teresa May chose Switzerland for a holiday, the first time since Mrs. Thatcher, the British Prime Minister has taken a vacation in Switzerland.
The choice of two female prime ministers contrasted with the preference of two male prime ministers, Blair and Cameron, to take vacations in hot spots.
It is known that the new British Prime Minister, Teresa May, will return to London on 24 August and will await her after that is a series of important tasks and activities.
The British Parliament will resume its meeting on September 5, and the topics debated include the request for a second Trans-European referendum on the Internet.
On June 23, the British referendum decided to go out of Europe, but the new British Prime Minister did not want to launch paragraph 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by the end of the year.
There are 1325 intangible cultural heritage projects in the city of Huangshan, both of which are the province's first in variety and in number.
As the cultural non-genetic heritage of the emblem depends primarily on oral face education, many non-relicts are on the verge of being lost, and it is imperative to use digital technology to preserve and protect them.
In accordance with the main points of work of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People ' s Congress this year, the Standing Committee plans to hear the consideration of ad hoc reports on its work and conduct inquiries on the implementation of the Banking Supervision and Management Act to serve local economic development.
In mid-August, the Standing Committee will organize two research teams to conduct research in some municipalities in preparation for thematic inquiries.
Han Jianhui noted that for the first time in my province, the Standing Committee of the Provincial People ' s Congress heard, considered and conducted ad hoc reports on the work of vertical management and conducted thematic inquiries, and was a positive exploration to strengthen and expand the work of the Great People ' s Oversight.
In Xinjiang Kashi's exercise director department, with the order of the director-in-chief, the units of the Carabineros in Kash, Wada and Aksu quickly carried out a mobile assembly and proceeded to the battle site in accordance with the guidance instructions.
China's Mars project is here.
Our Mars mission has to be rounded up, landed and visited once, a form that has never been seen abroad.
The goal of our Mars exploration launch is to go around, land, and patrol one step at a time, a task that is quite difficult.
Because Mars exploration takes 26 months to meet a time window, experts are working closely on engineering plans to launch our first Mars probe in 2020.
According to Xu Da Chul, although our vehicle has entered deep space, completion of the Mars exploration mission remains indispensable, and Mars detection means that China is entering deep space exploration age in the true sense of the word.
"It is only every two or three years that Mars has the closest chance to Earth to launch a Mars detector at this point in time, which is the most energy-efficient launch vehicle."
"Bearing in mind the quality of the Mars probe, the launch mission will be completed by our Long March Five carrier rocket."
Our Mars mission is about to be rounded, landed and visited once, a form that has never existed in a foreign country, where it was planned to be rounded and landed once, but the landing failed.
Mars exploration involves a lot of technical areas, especially since, although the Mars vehicle is a space detector, it has a distinct character compared to the general space detector.
In other words, Mars detectors need to have the ability to determine the course of their journey and detect the hazards of obstacles.
China Space Science and Technology Group Researcher Pang Chihou-ho said that humans are so interested in Mars exploration because Mars exploration has important scientific, technical and other implications and even relates to the future of mankind.
Mars has now become the planet with the highest level of human research except on Earth, and the history of human exploration using space detectors runs almost through the entire history of human space.
It is therefore the hope of mankind that one day a living base will be established on Mars, eventually migrating to Mars and turning it into the second home of mankind.
There are also numerous indications that Mars, like the current Earth, was likely to have evolved over billions of years into thin atmospheres, low temperatures and depleted water sources.
Therefore, research to detect or land humans on Mars could produce plans to prevent the Earth from becoming the second Mars where human survival is impossible.
As of June 2016, 114 lunar surveys and 43 Mars surveys had been conducted globally.
However, from the 1990s to the present, there have been 18 Mars expeditions, while only 14 have been detected on the Moon.
There are currently five Mars orbital vehicles and two Mars cruisers working, but only a one-month ball orbital vehicle and a one-month ball landing vehicle are working.
As shown by the fact that the world's space-faring nations have developed exploration plans targeting the Mars system, today's Mars exploration is hotter than the Moon.
On 5 November 2013, India launched the first Mars probe, Mangarian, to become the first country in Asia to successfully explore Mars.
Mangarian is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars and to find out if there are signs of methane and life on Mars.
The hardest part of this mission is that the detector enters the atmosphere on Mars with only one chance to move and slow down the parachute.
According to Sun Zechua, the Master Designer of the Mars Explorer in the General Department of China Space Science and Technology Group, China Space Science and Technology Corporation, there are many technical challenges facing Mars exploration missions.
Mars air pressure is very low, with only 1% of atmospheric pressure on the Earth's surface and high uncertainty.
Scientists have yet to have a thorough understanding of its changes and characteristics during storms, among other things.
Mars often forms dust storms similar to the Earth's sandy weather during summer, which could cause the solar light energy received by the Mars vehicle to drop sharply, and it is necessary to design a "sleep" model for the Mars vehicle so that it can patiently wait for the dust storm to pass.
At the same time, Mars atmosphere also has a reduced effect on solar light, which poses a challenge for the energy supply of Mars exploration.
This requires the detector's solar wing to be larger in size and constantly to adjust and try to focus on the direction of the sun.
Also, Mars' surface gravity is only 38% of the Earth's, but it's much more than the moon's surface, so the probe needs more power.
"The most central and difficult part of this Mars mission is the process of aerodynamic appearance and parachute deceleration after the probe enters the atmosphere of Mars, with only one chance to ensure success."
Sun Zechua said that due to the distance between Earth and Mars, the whole process could not be controlled in real time by the ground, so it had to be done on its own by means of detectors.
In the absence of so many propellants to offset that high speed, the slowdown on landing on Mars depends on the role of the Mars atmosphere, which is difficult to simulate on the ground.
Pang Chiho said that, in general, Mars was detected in a manner similar to that of the Moon, and was also "rounded, fallen, patrolled, returned" and eventually achieved the goal of human landing on Mars.
As Mars is much farther from Earth than the Moon, the detection of Mars requires a series of more complex technical difficulties.
According to Taiwan media reports, Taiwan's "President of Administration" Lin Qin announced yesterday morning that "the regulations governing the improper acquisition of property by political parties and their subordinate organizations" will come into effect today.
The Vice-President of the National Party, Jan Qinghyun, said, "A more than a hundred-year-old National Party, with the commitment and responsibility of society, will not collapse this way".
Lin would like to emphasize that if political parties, subordinate organizations or trustees, etc., violate the prohibition of sanctions set out in the regulations, the committee will investigate ex officio and impose sanctions and fines “in accordance with the law”.
Lin Quan has also announced that the candidate for deputy chairman of the improper party production committee will be Hong Beagen, Deputy Director of the ICAC.
He said that the Chairman of the Improper Party Production Committee was no second choice, drawing on the experience of Hong Beagan in past investigations of related major cases, and would serve as a basis for the Committee ' s identification of related cases of improper party production.
Gen Qihyun believes that no one will contribute to your society as long as there is party property today. If the whole of the party is confiscated, the National Party can just ask for social support and sponsorship. "There is really no chance to ask today."
Jin Qinghyun also stressed that even if the KN party ' s output was not completely confiscated and confiscated after the improper party regulations went on the road, the rest would still be donated, as promised, to allow the party to return to zero, and the party would want everything to start from scratch.
The original title: "The Corridor Doctor" Ranyan Peak v. Wang Zhian, China's host, lost in first instance on the violation of his honour.
The rule of law evening news anchor Wang Zhian, who spoke on Xinwa Weibo about the incident of the corridor doctor, went to court on Landing Peak to sue Wang Zhian and Beijing's Micro Dream Network Technology Ltd.
Yesterday afternoon, the Hayden court sentenced the case, finding that Wang Zhian and Microdream did not constitute a violation of the law, and dismissed all the claims filed at Landing Peak.
At the beginning of 2014, a survey by Yang Xiang Xiang Zhian, a journalist, found that, despite having sat in the hospital corridor for more than 600 days at the Landan Peak, the media had been transformed into a sad hero under institutional pressure, there was a large amount of false information about these reports.
On March 29, 2014, the corridor doctor programme produced by the Chinese News Survey was broadcast.
None of the various so-called excessive medical information reported to the media by Land Peak is supported by evidence.
Wang Zhian is also in the authenticated Weibo, which describes the fact that "the Landan Peak has come to this point by virtue of character, with obvious paranoia, etc. "
Randal Peak asked Wang Zhian to delete Weibo, apologize to him and compensate him for the moral damage of $100,000.
During the trial at that time, both sides argued whether Wang Zhian had violated the right to honour of the Landing Peak.
Look at the 12th: The track opening Chinese team is busy with girls rushing on four bikes looking forward to a breakthrough.
The bike is expected to achieve the Olympic gold medal "Zero Break", and the girl will challenge the two world champions, the German team, and expect to burst into the top four.
Wang Town has been in a prominent state for the last two seasons. Last year in Beijing, the Athletic World Cup won silver medals, and in May this year, the group competed for the World Cup to upgrade the individual project champion.
According to the foreign media, 27-year-old Korean archer, Zhang Hui-jin, won gold medals in the female archery personal competition, then won the Olympic gold medal after the group race and became a double champion.
Zhang Hye-jin, who was considered to be a late-coming contestant, regretted not receiving tickets to the last London Olympics, was proud to stand on the highest stage of the Rio Olympics.
Zhang Hue-jin defeated Lisa Onlu of Germany by a total score of 6-2 in the finals of the women's archery individual contest held at the Samba Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and won the gold medal.
She didn't shoot the arrow for the first time in the fourth grade of primary school until she was 27 years old and won the first personal gold medal in the World Cup in 2014, and she was a late-known player.
Zhang Huijin recalled that "there was no level before attending secondary school so that he could not participate in national competitions.
Zhang Hye-jin won only four fourths in the London Olympics competition four years ago. Unfortunately, he lost the Olympic ticket and only sat and watched his colleague and best friend Chev double the gold medal.
Zhang Hye-jin talked about her gold-digging speech after the ceremony of the female archery personal award. "Until the end, as many arrows as possible were fired, it could have brought good results and satisfaction.
Chivbe, the 28-year-old Korean archer, First Sister, and the individual gold medal winner of the London Olympics, won the bronze medal.
Chivbe lost to Zhang Hue-jin in the semi-finals and fought for the bronze medal against the Mexican contestant, Alejandro Valencia.
Chivbe is making sure that the copper medal is followed by tears and tears at the raceground, and the surreptitive financial burden that he is carrying can be imagined.
The first is that the coach team has accumulated a wealth of experience in its ongoing research, and the second is the manner in which science is trained, which requires long-term accumulation.
The archery team helped the crew focus and maintain their common sense of purpose by military training, night crossing of the cemetery, and so forth.
Although it has not yet been confirmed, many sources have indicated that the IPhone7 launch in the autumn of 2016 will take place in September.
Although Apple did not respond, news about the new iPhone functionality, configuration, and even online images of the iPhone7 "real machine model" have been released.
The new generation of iPhones is called "the eyes of all," hot, tight, rich... if you want to buy the real thing the first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Sunin.
This adds to people's disappointment with the new phone, "It's longer, but it can't project holograms! The iPhone generation sucks."
Like other iPhones, iPhone7 was born with countless secrets.
In addition, several sources claim that a new generation of iPhones will cancel 3.5 mm headphone interfaces and turn to Bluetooth connection and charge interfaces, which will provide space for apples to add a second speaker.
Another piece of evidence to support this message is that Apple allowed headphone manufacturers to produce headphone products connected by charging interfaces as early as 2014.
These messages are real or false, and the answer will not be known until the Apple will be released in the fall of 2016.
But this does not prevent industry from looking at the prospect of iPhone7 — many believe that iPhone7 will most likely be the last major upgrade of Apple to iPhone series.
Although according to data released recently by IDC, the market share of iPhone fell.
In this case, Goldman Sachs maintained the "buy-in" rating of Apple stocks, while BMO analysts believed that iPhone7 would reap a historic sales score.
At the same time, the company CEO Hock Tan said that the future harvest of apples would likely increase by more than 20 per cent, thanks entirely to the introduction of iPhone7.
Seven per cent of respondents indicated that they had plans to buy iPhone7, compared to 4 per cent of those who planned to buy iPhone6 two years ago.
It is understood that 20% of the user groups currently holding iPhone6 or 6Plus are planning to buy iPhone7, which is a significant proportion.
Second, there's expert analysis that most of the fruit powders prefer to replace their iPhone cell phones in later generations.
According to statistics, about 26 per cent of all iPhone users have not changed their cell phones for two years, iPhones, which has almost 120 million users for two years.
According to the media, during the production of iPhone7, Taiwan was hit by several earthquakes, “the power production facilities on the station were damaged beyond imagination and could have had an impact on the initial supply of iPhone7”.
The supply-demand paradox affects ordinary users, and it is time to choose a good channel to enter the original iPhone7 at a lower price in the first place.
According to sources of knowledge, Suning's seniors have been meeting with Apple on a regular basis in recent times to prepare a sufficient supply of goods.
The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and it is foreseeable that, as the two sides work together in depth, they will inevitably bring lower prices and more caring services to the users.
"at the lowest price, consumers may be able to buy iPhone7 with only $7 a day."
A sufficient supply of goods and a variety of preferences to make the purchase of iPhone7 no longer "pressure mountain " , and Sunin's logistics will turn this beauty into a more intuitive sense of experience.
Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Suning buys, your iPhone 7 is here."
The sponsors hope to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two countries through an exhibition of antiquities that will make the local people more aware of the long-standing Chinese culture.
Barcelona's "Ming Dynasty Exhibition" is part of the European tour and will continue until early October.
The first half of 2016 was published yesterday by the Bank of Wah Xia and the Bank of Pouphang, and in the second quarter the Central Certificate gold once again stepped in to increase its shares.
Of this amount, China has increased the share of the bank of Huaxia by 29.2931 million shares. By the end of June, the share of the bank of Huaxia was raised to 387 million shares, and the share of the bank also increased from 3.35 per cent to 3.62 per cent.
In addition, the merchant securities were measured, after deduction of the transfer, the China Central Gold 2 quarter added 38 million shares to the Pulse Bank, increasing its holdings to nearly 600 million shares, accounting for 2.77 per cent of Pulse Bank shares.
In recent days, Hobo Park, a lion's garden in Jingfu village in Xiangjiang commune, Zhejiang province, has been officially opened to villagers and tourists.
The park is made up of more than 100 small circular ponds and has grown some 300 varieties of ornamental flowers, sleeping lotion, etc.
The rural flower industry, which is both visual, recreational and economic, has become a bright spot for new rural development in the country.
According to the foreign media, the Rio Olympic “Green Pool” incident has been of interest to the outside world in recent days as a result of the shift from blue to green of the pool.
However, in the morning of the 10th day, the water from the pool next to the diving pool became green.
The Australian waterball player, after the race, said that his eyes were sore that he wanted to shed tears.
Previously, the official Rio Olympics confirmed the greening of the pool and stated that the coloring of the pool was due to the weakness of the alkaline and did not affect the health of athletes.
But Australian athletes, after winning a race with Japan's representative team in the pool, said that their eyes were sore.
At first, after the pool had become green, the organizers of the competition worked overtime on the night of 9 days to deal with the diving of the pool, but it was discovered in the morning of 10 days that the colour of the pool also changed rapidly.
The environmental conditions of the pool deteriorated during the Australian and Japanese team competitions, but the official stressed that they would restore the water quality of the two pools to their original colours by November.
The spokesman for the Rio Olympic Games, Mario Andrada, said, "In the first place, yesterday afternoon, the alkaline level in the diving pool became weaker."
"We have learned a series of reasons that could trigger the coloring of the pool, as well as the alkali content of the water quality."
Water sports centres conducted a series of tests of water quality, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used pools to determine that water quality conditions met standards.”
"We've been following normal procedures these days, but we may have overlooked the impact that more athletes could have on water quality."
"But changing water colours certainly have no effect on the health of the body, especially the athletes."
"This independent team confirmed our assessment and the measures we took to return the pool to normal colour and normal chemical state."
"We had hoped that the pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the rate of recovery was affected by the rain."
According to Taiwan's Central News Agency, a prison on the outskirts of Metro Manila was bombed last night, injuring the warden and killing 10 prisoners, including two Chinese.
ABS-CBN TV reported that the incident took place at about 9 p.m. last night in Paranaque prison, but the police did not make a preliminary statement until 2 a.m. today.
The police said that the 10 prisoners had sought permission to see the warden and complained about the transfer, but that there was no speculation on both sides, and that the prisoners threw grenades and made an explosion.
The prison authorities have yet to release the names of the deceased prisoners, but according to GMA TV, which includes two Chinese.
As of 8 a.m., no detailed explanation had been provided by the prison authorities, including how prisoners obtained grenades.
Yesterday, the central police of the country entered the Leyte regional prison and killed one of the prisoners who had “attempted to attack the police”.
Urumqi has to sign contracts with tourists for a travel agency that regulates the operating order of the tourist bazaar market.
Xinjiang has now entered the tourist season and, in order to regulate the operating order of the tourist dispersed market, Urumqi City ' s Tourism Enforcement Task Force and the Enforcement Branch of the Municipal Transport Authority conducted a survey yesterday on the irregularity of the tourist vehicles in the dispersed market and the low contracting rate of travel agents and tourists.
Yesterday morning at 8 a.m., around the Cabinsky Hotel, there were about 10 buses full of tourists, most of which were on a daily tour to the Tianli.
"Hello, I'm from the Urumqi Tourist Bureau. Have you signed a contract with this travel agency?"
Yu Bin, a member of the enforcement branch of the Urumqi City Transport Authority, introduced: "The travel bus and the shuttle bus run the tourist passenger project in the Urumqi market and are not eligible to practise their profession."
"A fine of between 300,000 and 100,000 for over-extended operations, and the driver's lack of qualification is a fine of $2,000."
It is known that previously, the Urumqi Tourism Enforcement Department had inspected areas of concentration of tourists such as West Park and Red Mountain.
In a combination of the two inspections, Markie, Deputy Chief of the Tourism Enforcement Branch of Urumqi City, said: "First is safety, second is regulation, tourist vehicles are fine, and if there's a problem, they'll all be injured and killed."
"We are jointly and continuously inspecting the market to regulate travel agency traffic practices to ensure the safety of tourists."
On the morning of August 12, the press office of the State Council held a press conference on the functioning of the national economy in July 2016.
The news spokesperson of the National Statistical Office and the Director of the General Statistics Department of the National Economy, Sein, said that, in July, the rate of growth of indicators in the part of the national economy had slowed, but it was still operating in reasonable areas.
Data released by the National Statistical Office show that data on the growth rate of fixed asset investment, total imports, etc., declined in July.
Sheng came to say that, with regard to the performance of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow the words of the Prime Minister, "It's volatile, it's still good", which gives a better overview of the characteristics of the economic performance in July.
He explained that the word "volatile" meant that the rate of growth in some of the economic indicators in July did actually fall back.
Export pressure is still high because the economy, both domestic and foreign, is still undergoing deep adjustment in July, the international situation is complex and volatile, and the world economy is not recovering as expected.
Domestically, the economy as a whole is still at a critical stage of adjustment, the pains of adjustment are being unleashed and the economy is under considerable downward pressure, so some indicators are somewhat volatile.
Sheng came to point out that there was another special case in July, that the flood disaster was severe and that the heat and heat of the summer had had some impact on production operations in some areas.
According to a recent release by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people throughout the country were affected and direct economic losses exceeded 200 billion yuan.
These areas are affected to varying degrees in terms of industry, investment and transport-related indicators.
The weekly freight transhipment in July grew at a rate of 3.6 percentage points lower than last month, and the flood disaster had some impact on traffic in these areas.
In view of these factors, it is also normal and expected that some of the indicators will fluctuate in July.
He said that the word “good” meant that, although the rate of economic growth had returned somewhat, the economy had generally operated smoothly, with steady progress and moderate improvement.
The CPI rose by 1.8 per cent in July and the ring rose by 0.2 per cent; the CPI rose by 2.1 per cent in January-July, so the price situation was generally stable.
According to the data of the Chongqing Meteorological Department portal on the high temperature weather in the districts and districts, the rest of the city, with the exception of Xiaoyang, receives high temperature allowances of varying degrees.
At least 28 provinces across the country have defined the criteria for the payment of benefits, although the criteria for the payment of benefits vary from province to municipality, while Chongqing receives the high temperature allowance in the form of a high temperature working day allowance.
The rate is not less than 10 yuan per person per day, and the rate is not less than 15 yuan per person per day, not less than 37°C.
High-temperature workers above 40°C receive up to $20/day per month (except for workers who already receive high-temperature job allowance according to the law).
According to this standard, Kaizhou, which had the highest number of days of heat last month, received $330 and the city entrance, which had the lowest number of days, was $80, while the highest temperature of Xiaoyang, which did not meet the high temperature standard, did not have a high temperature allowance.
In the past, a number of units used to use cool drinks to offset the high temperature allowance, and the Municipal Security Inspectorate indicated that the practice was not in line with the current scheme.
The employer may not deduct or lower the wages of the workers if the work stops due to the heat or weather and the working hours are shortened.
According to the Municipal Affairs Bureau, employees who work at high temperatures and are not receiving high temperature benefits may seek legal rights and interests through the labour dispute mediation agency in which the enterprise is located or call 12333 for complaints.
Workers who refuse to pay high-temperature benefits may file a complaint with the human resources social security authority at the county level or above where the worker is employed.
At the same time, due to the fact that the high temperature allowance is part of the wage and not a benefit, the total wage is included and a tax is deducted.
Therefore, the high temperature allowance is not covered by the minimum wage and must be paid in cash and cannot be replaced in kind, such as beverage.
The newly constructed Urumqi station is located in the high iron section of the city of Urumqi, with an overall area of approximately 100,000 square metres.
Ground floors 1 and 2 are for entrances, waiting rooms and office and commercial rooms, while underground floor 1 is for outstations.
At present, the Urumqi station is the largest integrated traffic hub in Xinjiang, bringing together high iron, orbital traffic, public transport, rental etc. to achieve seamless docking by various modes of rotation.
There are 3 ticket offices on both the north and south sides of the station level and on the north side of the outstation level, with 39 person work ticket windows and 34 ATMs.
With regard to tickets, there are 30 passages on both the east and west sides of the waiting hall, and passengers can quickly check and wait for vehicles according to the number of the stop on the ticket.
If you need help, you can select the 41 call buttons set up on the motion station, and you can get a timely service.
From July 1, the passenger train at the old passenger station, the southern station of Urumqi, moved in separate steps to the Urumqi station.
In other words, all moving cars and 30 pairs of outbound trains can stop at Urumqi station.
Both stations can now buy tickets to travel, and the train travel time between them is around 10 minutes. Passengers need to pay attention to the exact name of the station at which the ticket starts and ends.
The official commissioning and operation of the Urumqi new passenger station will be an important platform for Xinjiang to build a national integrated transport city, advancing the "silk route economic belt" and the construction of the new zone.
Grescia is a cute female big mouth bird with tropical rainforests all over her body.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the story of the giant mouthbird Gracia and its story is well known.
At the press conference on August 10, the post-operative rehabilitation of Gracia finally showed the people its brand-new 3D print-out of plastic beaks.
The giant mouthbird, broken a year and a half ago and dying, is finally reborn.
That day not only declared that it had recovered 100 per cent of its health, but also that it had moved into the luxury birdhouse and met with human friends who cared about it.
Gracias, the first to enter the new home, is slightly obsessive, but in a few days it becomes lively, playing around in the basin and eating grapes with new beaks.
To remind people of the harm it suffered, the technicians did not color its new beak, but retained the original white of the 3D print material.
The outside of the bird's beak is a thin layer of horned gills, in which there is nothing but a few fine bone support poles staggered.
Despite these internal reinforcements, giant mouthbirds still have fragile beaks that break when they are hurt.
The Animal Rescue Center, the Ornithologist and an American 3D printing company worked together to produce several "test beaks" for Gracia and finally created the perfect beak for it.
Gracia is now skilled in using new beaks to drink water, eat and even peck small grains.
"The design of the final product took about two months and only four or five hours to print out."
"3D printing is not a future technology, it's actually walking into your life." Thomas Lange, head of the SG3D printing company in the United States, said in an interview with Xinhua International.
In January 2015, at a farm in Gracia, Alajuela province, central Costa Rica, the blood-covered giant mouthbird, Gracia, was discovered.
At that time, its upper beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, and it was completely unable to eat and its life was in danger.
Gracia's tragedy, which was reported in the media, caused a tidal outcry against abusive animals inside and outside Costa Rica.
There were calls for stricter animal protection laws and stronger penalties for abusers.
People came spontaneously and did their best to help Grescia recover as much as possible from his pre-injury life.
Even the 3D print technology inventor, Chuck Hull, was involved in the design of Grescia's upper beak.
"Grecia is in a special situation, and the rest of its upper beak is less than 1 centimetre, so it creates many difficulties in installing new beaks."
"We scan Grescia first, then design and produce an extended prosthesis slightly longer than the rest of its upper beak, stuck with glue on its upper beak."
"This would reduce further intrusive harm to Grescia." Lange told Xinhua International.
Prior to the installation of the prosthesis, staff had to clean Gracia's beak every day to prevent infection.
A thousand miles away, the story of Grescia was moved by the famous documentary director, Paula Eredia, and by the producer of the Discovery News Channel, John Hoffman.
They recorded points and drops during the installation of Gracia's new beak, and they recorded a documentary, The Big Mouthing Bird Nation, which was shown on the Animal Planet Channel this month.
The documentary "The State of Big Mouth Birds" shows how a small big mouthbird can change a country and involve its citizens in the fight against animal abuse.
Core reminder: Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of China's small independent oil refinery known as the Teapot.
The Japanese media reported on August 12 that JX Energy, Japan's largest oil company, considered that “China's export expansion is one of the reasons for its low level of interest.
Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of China's small independent oil refinery known as the Teapot.
China’s petroleum product quality is gradually approaching Japanese oil products due to the Chinese government’s strengthened environmental regulations.
Before obtaining a crude oil import permit, the Teapot Refinery usually imports heavy oils with higher sulphur content from places like Russia for refining purposes.
The production of petroleum products with higher sulphur content and poor oil products is one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining a crude oil import permit, the Teapot Refinery was able to import Omani and Russian crude oil with lower sulphur content, and the quality of its petroleum products was raised.
According to the General Oil Company for East Fever, "as the quality standards of petroleum products in China are constantly improving, so is the ability of refining equipment.
As a result, the quality of China's petroleum products exported abroad has gradually reached the same level as that of Japan (the world's highest quality).
According to JX Energy, "after the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia and competed with Japanese products in Asian markets.
Although Japan's "high oil" is facing a crisis, Japan's oil companies have only responded with a strategy of "exporting to profitable areas while paying attention to market conditions".
As the impact of Chinese exports of petroleum products on Asian market performance is enormous, there is also growing interest in teapot refineries.
In 2016, the Yanko Evening News Sunshine Support Initiative was launched on May 26, and after two months of registration, the total number of poor students applying for scholarships was more than 800.
In the course of the study assistance, social donations of over 1.2 million yuan have been received (five public notices have been issued), which can help at least 240 tyrannical students at the University of Dreams.
Contributions are still being made, and the newspaper calls on society to continue to help so that more children from families in need can receive financial support and social care.
In order to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in teaching aids, the newspaper has since today issued a series of instructions to publicize the basic information of the students, which today is announced to number 1-100 and is supervised by the readers.
China ' s famous charitable brand, the Sunshine Aid Initiative, has been operating since 2003 in Jiangsu to fund more than 4,000 poor students.
The scope of funding for this activity is the admission of students to high school undergraduate studies, excluding tuition-free specializations; merit and merit; and family poverty.
According to the Bureau of Statistics, the increase in New Zealand's population previously exceeded 2 per cent during the birth peak of the “baby tide” population in 1974 and the early 1950s to 1960s.
As of June this year, New Zealand ' s net immigration inflows in the 12-month period stood at 69.1 million people, which has been a major driver of New Zealand ' s population growth in recent years.
In addition, New Zealand ' s natural population grew by 28.2 million during the same period of time.
The data show that New Zealand ' s average annual net immigration inflows have been 2180,000 during the last 10 years, and the average annual natural increase in the population has been 323,000.
In terms of demographic structure, a large influx of immigrants means that the proportion of the “working age population” aged 15 to 39 years is gradually increasing.
During the 12 months up to June 2016, New Zealand ' s working age population grew by 3.6 per cent, reaching 1.58 million people.
At the same time, the number of older persons over 65 also increased by 3.6 per cent to 700,000.
Yesterday at about 10 a.m., X9003 international cargo squads left the new station in Xian for Almaty, Kazakhstan.
The start of the train marked the successful departure of 10,000 cars by the Xian Railway Bureau since the launch of the Central Asian International Freight Line in 2013.
It is understood that the class of cargo goods transported in the freight class covers industrial raw materials, mechanical equipment, industrial spare parts, construction materials, food, light-industrial products in six main categories, totalling 206 varieties.
As of 11 August of this year, the new station was running 221 and 1009 trains in Central Asia, with a cumulative shipment of 338,000 tons of export goods, of which 84 rows were opened in 2016, an increase of 47 per cent over the previous year.
It is understood that the first shipment of goods from the Central Asian Platoon was “manufactured” and today it attracts a large number of foreign sources actively listed above.
By the end of July, Central Asian class containers had reached 64,000 mark boxes, an increase of 8 per cent over the same period in 2015.
The volume of cargo at the new Xian Railway Station has increased year after year with the encryption of the Central Asian rows.
In 2015, traffic toll at the new station amounted to 24.77 million tons throughout the year. As of 10 August 2016, freight delivery had reached 15.31 million tons, an increase of 6.7 per cent over the same period last year.
In order to meet future development needs, the Xian Railway Bureau's construction plan for a new Xian railway integrated logistics centre, centred on a new station, has been put in place, and all efforts have been made to build a modern new integrated railway integrated logistics park.
An Indian uncle just went through an airplane landing at Dubai International Airport last week, and this week he won a $1 million prize at the same airport.
Muhammad Bashir Abdul Hidar, an Indian from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, has a habit of buying lottery tickets every time he returns.
His 21-year-old son was paralysed by an accidental fall on 13 days of birth, and he worked hard to repay his son ' s loan for medical expenses.
"It was God who gave me a second life to escape from the air crash, and he gave me this money to do good," said Hidar.
Although it has now been set for autumn, the power of the Autumn Tiger seems to be no worse than summer.
The UV not only darken the skin of the students, but also sunburns the skin, how can the skin survive the military training without getting sunburned?
SPF and PA are usually marked on sunscreen packaging, SPF refers to sun protection index, which is directed at UVB ultraviolet, and our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50 etc.
Products marked with PA are targeted at UVA, so sunscreens can play a more effective role, and usually PA strength is expressed in +, and an additional + indicates an extended effective protection time.
The oily skin should choose water protection supplies with greater permeability, and sun protection spray is also a good option.
Dry skins should choose sunscreens of frost; neutral skins are generally not strictly regulated, and any maintenance items on sensitive skins are a burden, suggesting pure physical sunscreen products.
Remember to wear sunscreen half an hour in advance, as sunscreen products take time to fully penetrate the skin.
Military training days are long, sunscreens are wiped every two hours in order to have lasting effects. Don't be lazy.
Since the skin has just been irritated by the sun, the army has been instructed not to use white and white products immediately.
After the military training, conditions can be used to wrap towels with ice in order to reduce local heat by burning the skin of the town.
Farmers who purchase agricultural machinery during the fair continue to pursue the policy of cumulation subsidies, with farmers receiving up to 40 per cent subsidy for the purchase of agricultural machinery.
The exhibition was aimed at global job fairs and, in particular, increased invitation to countries along the "one-way" route and target market countries.
The exhibition sought to complete 60 contracts, introduce 22 billion yuan in funds, conclude more than 160 trade contracts with a value of 3.2 billion yuan.
According to the information received, for seven consecutive years, the Xian Bo Club has settled at the bottom of its home because of its strong manufacturing base and long history of industrial development in the city of Loudy, Hunan Province.
Lou has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world as the host of the Xinbo.
The Xiaoble became an important platform for the local development of niche industries and the promotion of niche industries out of the country.
In some nights, the ionosphere is full of free electrons, which means that radio signals can go further.
The U.S. Air Force is interested in copying this effect, as reported on the U.S. Mass Science monthly website on August 11.
Although the ionosphere, with a stable large number of free electronics, can help people listen to this radio station on the edge of a university radio station, this may not be the interest of the United States Air Force.
The electrons-filled ionosphere means that the radios used by the military have a larger distribution range and that it may provide some protection against solar storms for Global Positioning System (GPS) signals.
The ultimate goal might be to build a series of cube satellites according to demand, which could strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first of all, these teams that contract with the air force must prove that the scientific principles will work.
Industry data show that the total size of coal production capacity in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons, with a national excess capacity of 1.8 billion tons.
In the past 10 years, the State Department has issued five notices before and after phasing out excess and backward capacity.
Although the first four times did not target the coal industry, the target industry has a direct relationship with the coal industry.
Between November of last year and January of this year, the price of 5,500 kilocalories of power coal in the island of Qin has been hovering long at a low of 370 yuan/tonne, leaving 90% of coal businesses in a loss.
The price of coal has been gradually rising since February, and recently the price of power coal on the island of Qin has risen four weeks in a row, rising to a high point of 16 months, once climbing to $436 per ton, nearly $70 more than at the beginning of the year.
As the price rises, there are fears that a small coal mine will return to work?
In response, Xi Xianming, Director of the Economic Research Institute of the China Institute for Reform and Development (Hiannan), analysed and interpreted the situation.
Qing Xianming: The elimination of capacity has attracted a high degree of interest, and today's published report card on the production capacity of the coal industry has indeed caused some concern.
These three surface factors also reflect the relative lag in our past shift in growth patterns, namely, that government-led growth patterns have not yet undergone a fundamental shift.
Second, it is also directly related to the push of local governments, where funding and accompanying measures are in place during the process of carrying out capacity production, and where differences between different regions do appear to be greater.
Third, if some provinces that are currently slow in progress are to catch up in the second half of the year, they may be at greater risk.
In such cases, reliance on central reward funds to advance the process of decapitating capacity may have some negative effects.
First of all, the ability to produce is not simply to control aggregates.
Our aim is to promote structural optimization by phasing out backward production capacity and reshaping the new business of the coal industry as a whole.
In deploying production capacity, local governments must combine production capacity with the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry and vigorously develop related services.
Secondly, if we are to complete this year's decapitation mission, we also need to give full effect to the powers of executive oversight and administrative oversight.
Finally, we want to strengthen the playing field of social security.
Since the market is directly related to employment issues, we need to enhance job skills training for employees and employees.
"The reason for the decline in ranking is the expected deterioration of foreign investment in Brazil's GDP development in the medium term."
Brazil ' s participation in global direct investment was 3.7 per cent in 2015, down from 5.7 per cent in 2014.
The Bank ' s international investment attraction index includes four sub-indicators: infrastructure, economic prospects, business environment and direct investment volume.
In 2015, Brazil ' s international direct investment was $64.6 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year in Brazil, the “green land investment” (investment model for foreign investment plants) was $17.9 billion, a decrease of 2.1 per cent over the same year.
"There are 288 `Greenfield Investment' projects in Brazil, compared to an annual average of 314 in 2003-2014".
However, international direct investment in Brazil reached $33.8 billion in the first half of 2016, an increase of almost 10 per cent compared to the same period last year.
Original title: Canadian police killed IS supporters: homemade bomb strike near the end of the city's preparations
The taxi company stated that the taxi had been transferred to Delev's house before the police arrived.
In a press conference on Wednesday, the Canadian police said that the information received by the police included a "Sacrificial Video" from the FBI about the young man's intention to carry out the attack.
According to the German Voice, a man wearing a black Balaklafa cap is reading the Koran, referring to crimes against Muslims, and swearing to attack a Canadian city soon.
In the video, he said that the attack would take place within 72 hours and at a peak.
The incident was the first time that the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had killed a terrorist suspect before the incident, after he took office last year.
The upgraded Jinghang Great Canal branch channel, the Old Vanfu River and the North Great Leakway, began to collect tolls on 1 September.
These two tributary routes are built in the form of social financing, and the charges have been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.
The old Van Fu channel flows through Kim's village and fish towers and crosses Southyang Lake into the main channel of the Jingyang canal, which is 32.5 km long.
On the basis of navigational needs, the old Vanfu channel has been modified by conservation, dredging the local water depths, bending the local bends straight, etc., and improving navigation conditions.
The channel runs through Kimgsu county, Qingtown district, and crosses Southyang Lake into the main channel of the Jingyang Grand Canal, all 19 km long.
The renovation work on the two routes began in February 2011 and was completed in January 2015, with the investment in construction and operation being carried out by the Anping Canal Logistics Centre of Jinning City.
In accordance with the principle of “loan construction, fee repayment”, the Anping Canal Logistics Service Centre of Jinning City collects tolls on the route according to the rates approved by the Provincial Price Office of Shandong.
Of this amount, base tolls are calculated at 1.75 yuan/heavy tonnage, and mileage tolls are calculated at 0.05 yuan/km heavy ton.
The toll was collected from 15 June 2016 until 14 June 2019.
The reporter learned from the Jinning City Port Authority that there are currently four toll channels in Jinning's territory: the Susu River channel, the White Ma channel, the North Great Leakway and the Old Vanfu channel.
The four channels are the tributaries of the King Hang Canal, all of which are upgraded by means of social financing.
The Susu Waterway Upgrading and Upgrading Project was the first to adopt the "Government Plus Market" model for a project to build navigation infrastructure at the river port in Shandong Province, with the government taking the lead investment, and the social fund replenishing the funding gap.
The sea lanes of the White Horse River, the Old Van Fortune River and the North Great Leather River follow a purely market-oriented approach.
The funds allocated by the State ' s finances do not meet the needs of construction and limit the pace of the upgrade of the course.
Social funding for the construction of public infrastructure conforms to the requirements of national policies and serves as a means of defusing financial bottlenecks.
Ning Zeto's performance in the 100-metre free swim semi-finals has left many Chinese viewers speechless.
But in the 50 metre free swim premonition, Ning Zeto once again refreshed the people's bottom line.
The fact that 50 metres of free swimming is not Ning Zetao's main project, his performance and best grades at the Kazan World Cup also determine that he has little chance of making a breakthrough on this project.
As it turns out, the Great Gazette of Hong Kong's authoritative media revealed that the biggest cause of Ning Zetao's loss was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many factors outside the scene may have had a great impact on his vision of the future, and he may now be more interested in entering the entertainment world.
After the Kazan World Cup, Ning Zetao became red in a flash, thanks to his super-glorification and good grades.
As a result, the terms "national husband", "sweet meat", "beautiful man" and so forth became the label on him.
All kinds of commercial activities come to the door, and the good money road becomes a golden glittering road.
In this case, even if Ning Zetao chooses to retire from the entertainment business at this time, it is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable path.
After all, he was 23 years old, and after a certain amount of study, he could do one or two TV dramas with his personality.
But Ning Zetao needs to see if he has enough qualifications to compare himself with these seniors.
The 2000 Sydney Olympics, already 21-year-old Liu Xing, have come to the end of their athletes' careers.
Liu Xiaomei's appearance made her quickly remembered and laid the foundation for her future career in the entertainment world.
Liu Xiang played several TV dramas after retirement and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang participated in the single-double-person 10-metre competition of the two Olympic Games and won 2 gold2 silver.
However, after losing to teammate Hu Jia in the 2004 Olympics single-man 10-meter race, Taomi's competitive position fell and was thrown out of the jump team.
And he and his daughter took part in the "Where Daddy goes" and all the more so that he earned his eye.
The former gymnastics gold generation Yang Wai, Li Xiaoping and Chen Icing are high-profile participants in a variety of amphibious shows.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei Li Xiao Peng, who led China to win the 2008 Olympic Men's League, has twice received a personal all-power gold medal, known as the All-power King.
Chen Icing, while leading China to win the 2012 Olympics, has also become the King of the Hang Rings.
And after the London Olympics misjudged the loss of the gold medal, Chen's massive move also made him troupe.
But the main energy of these athletes is still on the playing field, and it's just like a dragonflies - and then they run away.
But both retired and active athletes need to be assured that they will be able to enjoy the benefits of the entertainment industry.
After all, athletes have set foot in a new field, whether they are capable or connected, which is a blank state.
Even the "old people" who have been in the entertainment business for years, such as Tian Liang and Liu Xiang, are mentioned by ordinary viewers, and they think more about their performance at the Olympic Games.
Newcomers like Yang Wai and Li Xiao Peng, all except the Olympic champions, were introduced during the show.
Ning Zetao's title as a swimming champion in the World Cup is still slightly thin compared to those above.
Moreover, the negative impact on the image of Ning Zetao would probably be immeasurable if he was 23 years old and had suffered a setback in his sports career, compared to the success of Yue Xiang, Liu Xuan and Yang Wai among others.
After all, when it comes to athletes, people are asking for "no fight, but no risk," and Ningzeto is far from it.
Ten thousand steps back and say that Ning Zetao is handsome enough to earn the support of thousands of brain powders with face value.
It's not as difficult as training to get what you deserve to be in the entertainment business.
The path of life is chosen on the basis of personal will, but how it is chosen, Ning Zetao should have known it.
On the surface, the Internet social networking platform expands the social circle and reduces people ' s sense of loneliness.
The sphere of influence of cybersocialization has become wider, not only gradually replacing traditional telephone contacts, but even creeping into the real life under the line, slowly changing the social life of the current population.
The benefits of online socialization are obvious, such as convenience and speed, so they are particularly vulnerable to the favors of young communities.
A survey of the social habits of university students showed that 57 per cent of university students spend more than five hours a day using mobile phones, and that daily life is basically “stopped”.
"Society networks are characterized by low cost, speed of transmission, simultaneous communication of many people, etc., and correspond to the needs of contemporary university students."
Expanding the circle of relationships, talking more equally and avoiding social concerns is the main reason why we are talking more deeply on the love line.
Newcomers who have just entered the company love to communicate with their colleagues online, "because they're not very familiar with the unit, they're much closer than they used to be with the social networking platform."
Friends-friendly people also often communicate online, and "I haven't talked to friends for a while because of some misunderstandings, and then talk to them in a large group before they get back together."
The IT engineer, Wu Xin, is a deep network socialist, and most of his social life takes place online, and the number of online contacts is several times higher than the number of friends below the line.
Wu said himself to be more "like a fish to water" on the Internet.
"You can answer your friends at your convenience, because there's plenty of time to weigh words, and the expression can be clearer."
"You came to avoid face-to-face interpersonal collisions while hiding under ID, and not only gave room for swings, but even gave each other more time and space to think and act."
"People of different identities have the same voice and efficiency, and social concerns in real life seem to have been eliminated in cyberspace."
A friend of Wu Xin's thought, however, that Wu Xin was a "bright boring man" in life.
Peng and Wu Xin knew each other in a large group because both were active speakers and quickly became acquainted.
Peng thinks that if Wu Xin and the Internet are two people, they don't talk, they don't express themselves, they just say, "Huh, good, right," or "I'm going to check this online."
The Mahila Police is now involved in the investigation, and the Mahilai Transport Department will also intensify its efforts to combat the illegal operation of vehicles.
"The conflict police of August 4 did not have the results of the investigation, and the taxis of two other drivers were smashed again at their place of residence on August 11 at midnight."
"Most of the three-wheeler cars now operate illegally at night, and it is hoped that the authorities will also intensify their efforts to deal with them."
The South China Sea Network journalist learned from the Public Security Bureau of the Autonomous County of the Mahishilis that the police had now taken up the reports of the two cases and that the causes of the two cases, who did them and whether they were connected were all under further investigation.
Wang Wenyi, Director of the Traffic Control Station of the mausoleum water and transport department, said that the mausoleum water and transport department had begun to clean up illegal camps carrying three-wheelers at the beginning of this year, banning a total of 613 illegal camps carrying three-wheelers.

On August 11th, at 8 a.m., a reporter from the Qirou Evening newspaper followed the "Healthy Chinese Line" team to the village of the river in West Lake Town, East Port District.
The remote location of the village, approximately 24 km from the city, and the presence of more than 200 households in the village caused inconvenience to many of the elderly and middle-aged due to economic, transport and physical constraints.
The doctor's programme was comprehensive, with internal medicine, surgery, respiratorys, psychiatry, dermatology, paediatrics.
Many villagers were told that experts from the clinic were coming and had already been waiting in the small square of the village.
Xue Dynasty, 67 years old, suffers from a congenital spinal curve, and she has been suffering from “asphyxiation” in recent years so that she can breathe even on the previous slope.
The doctor told Madam Xue that chronic bronchitis was not likely to seek a radical cure, and that the usual adherence to medication could be alleviated.
At the dermatologist's clinic, an elderly man in his 60s came with her little grandson to consult.
The younger grandchildren of the elderly are 11 years old, and since the child was 3 years old, the left foot has been troubled by the "foot breath".
The doctor told the elderly that this was not a foot gas, but a seasonal wet rash, and never take the medication to delay treatment at will.
"We have provided medical and B Super service in this village, while the other team has also provided free medical examination services at Qiu's shop village in the village of Huen County.

The news agency Avesta of Tajikistan quoted the central bank of Tajikistan on 11th and stated that the rate of inflation in Tajikistan was 3.7 per cent for the first seven months of this year.
According to the report, the rate of inflation in the Tatmadaw during the first seven months of the year was 3.7 per cent, of which 0.6 per cent was in July, compared to 6 per cent in the last year.
According to the report, the goal of the Tatmadaw government is to plan to keep the annual inflation rate at 7.5 per cent in 2016, compared to 5.1 per cent in 2015.
In addition, it was noted that there was a certain discrepancy between the Government and the projections of some major international financial institutions on the issue of Tatmadaw ' s economic development and inflation in 2016.
According to the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development, the growth of the Ta nation will reach 7 per cent in 2016, and the inflation of the country is also largely above that level.
The Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, on the other hand, gave different forecasts for the 2016 economic development and inflation of Tajikistan.
For both indicators, the Asian Development Bank projected 4.2 per cent and 7 per cent, the World Bank projected 4.8 per cent and 7.5 per cent, and the International Monetary Fund projected 3.4 per cent and 8.2 per cent.

On August 11, when the journalist interviewed Huang Elin, who had returned to his home in Sichuan, she said, "It was too urgent, and all I had in mind was to save people!"
Huang Elin is a student of the 2015 level of the Central and South Linco Grand Wind and Parking Academy.
Huang Yilin, who studied urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Sichuan and study the local architecture, so the family went to travel.
On August 8, at around 10 a.m., Huang Elin's father rested at the hotel, and the mother and daughter came out to visit the ancient city of Yuen.
He was not far away, and suddenly a group of people shouted and went out out out of curiosity.
Looking at "The little boy has disappeared, the little girl has stung in the water, her little head appears on the side of the river, and from time to time she sank", Huang Elin, who learned to swim as a child, jumped in a hurry to save people.
After the water went down, Wong Elin, 165 centimetres tall, discovered that she couldn't step to the end!
The water looked calm before, but there's a current down there!
But she's still desperate to swim to the little girl.
Huang Elin said that the river was thick and fast, less than five metres away, and almost all her strength was wasted.
She did everything she could to push the little girl to the dyke, and she said, "The slope is particularly slippery, and I'm afraid I'll sink if I don't have the strength."
So Huang Elin asked her mother for help, heard her daughter's call for help, and Ms. Yoon, who was not well-watered, was prepared to go into the water and was stopped by tourists next to her.
On August 10, Ms. Yoon was “accountable” when she received a lot of condolences and praise from her relatives and friends, following the spread of Huang Yiling's escape from the river.
"It's really scary to remember now. Honestly, my heart is breaking when the kids are dying on the riverbank and they're asking me for help."
Ms. Yoon said she would still support the daughter's choice if she were to stay in that scene again, despite the dangers she faced, and she was proud of her daughter!
Since she was forced to swim, Huang Elin rarely took the initiative to come back into the water after learning to swim, "I didn't think this skill was really useful."
According to Chief Chen Jian of Huang Elin's class, Huang Yillen is a well-known "Teacher" in Banari and is willing to help.
The opening ceremony of the first Youth Games in Yunnan Province, on the 13th, demonstrated youth vitality by playing the national card.

Since 1 September, 60-64-year-olds can take a bus to the city at half a price.
In the morning of 11, at the IC card marketing centre of the Djinning City bus company, the seniors of the card window were waiting in line to deliver the card, and Master Yao, aged 62, received the old-age half price card.
Previously, the Djinning City Committee on Ageing, the City Finance Bureau and the City Traffic Bureau issued a circular on the semi-priced urban bus for 60-64-year-olds, which was officially implemented on 1 September of this year.
"Satisfactory seniors can have a second-generation identity card processed at the IC marketing centre; seniors of foreign households who meet this age are also entitled to this benefit."
Liu Xia, Deputy Director of the computer centre of the Djinning City bus company, said that more than 200 old-age half-price cards had been put in place since the start of the operation on 1 August.

The distribution of fraudulent text messages has reached a certain number, and even if the fraud is not successful, it can be punished as a fraud offence.
The People ' s Court in Chilong District, Nanyang City, Henan Province, found that from 30 September to 4 October 2015, the accused Li Xingwang sent fraudulent information using pseudo-based station equipment in the district of Yongpau and in the district of Namyang City.
In the same year, on 5 October, at around 1000 hours, the accused was arrested by the Public Security Civil Police when he again came to a hotel room in the Gyulong district of Namyang City to send fraudulent text messages using a group of pseudo-based stations.
It was assessed that the pseudo-based station equipment sent 622228 text messages on 4 October 2015, causing the per capita communication of 622228 mobile phone users to be interrupted for more than 8 seconds to less than 10 minutes.
The court considered that the accused Li Xingwang had used the pseudo-base station to send a total of 622228 fraudulent text messages to a large number of people, and that his actions constituted a fraud offence.
The defence ' s suggestion that the accused was arrested as an attempted criminal with no consequences, and that the guilty plea was better, recommended that his view of a lighter punishment should be taken into account.
The defendant was sentenced to four years and six months imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 yuan for fraud, in combination with the nature of the crime and the attitude of the guilty.
Northeast Tiger, currently listed as endangered (EN) species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of endangered species.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, data from joint monitoring in 1998 by countries such as China and Russia show that Jilin Province has only four to six wild northeast tigers and three to five northeast leopards.
According to the Chief of the Protection Branch of the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, Changchun, the protection of wildlife has been increasing in Jilin Province in recent years. Northeast Tiger and Northeast Jaguar stocks in China are growing significantly and distribution areas are expanding.
The latest monitoring data for 2015 show that 27 wild northeast tigers and 42 northeast leopards were monitored in Jilin Province alone.
As a world wildlife conservation flagship species spread across the region of the border between China and Russia, cooperation between China and Russia is important for the recovery and reproduction of wild northeast tigers and leopards.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, a long-standing cooperative exchange mechanism has been established with Russia in Jilin Province.
The forest sector and animal conservation organizations of China and Russia once again reached a number of consensus points at the 2016 China Xuan Chun Tiger Panther Protection International Forum, which ended on 11 November.
The Jilin Provincial Forestry Department stated that strengthening cooperation between Chinese and Russian tigers and leopards in protecting tigers and leopards is not only an urgent task facing the northeast tigers and leopards of China, but also an imperative for the health of Russian tigers and leopards.
Sun Fook-jin, as the leader of the Party, lost his idealistic beliefs and seriously violated the Party's discipline, and after the Party's 18th year, he refused to quit, failed to stop, and acted in a bad manner and in a serious manner.
After the incident, the case became the focus of several media reports and the social impact was extremely bad.
After the incident, the head of the criminal police unit of the Haiguchi City Public Security Bureau attached great importance to it, and immediately organized a team of strong police officers from the branch to launch an active strike to investigate it.
The police immediately pursued the suspect online, took a variety of measures to spread control, and investigated the whereabouts of Wang's country by contacting the police in the field.
As the suspect is a repeat thief, he has repeatedly been dealt with by the public security organs, has a strong counter-detection capability, and, in addition to his long-term use of drugs, is frequently questioned about addictions, and interrogations are very difficult.
Greenland sharks, also known as small sleeping sharks, are widely distributed around Greenland and Iceland in the North Atlantic, reaching a height of 4-5 metres when they reach adulthood.
But they grow extremely slowly, sometimes only about a centimetre in a year, which suggests that Greenland sharks may have the life expectancy of Foreign Minister Gertrude.
The traditional year-calculation method usually uses animal calcification tissues and some sharks can use fin ridges, but this calcification tissue is very rare in Greenland sharks.
The new study led by Julius Nelson of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, turned to the use of the eye crystals of Greenland sharks for the radioactive carbon year.
This method was previously used to determine the age of whales, but for the first time to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis showed that the life expectancy of the largest shark was estimated at 392, with an error of 120 years.
This means that the shark is at least 272 years old, with a maximum probability of reaching 512 years of age.
In addition, female Greenland sharks are said to be about 4 metres long before they are sexually mature and converted to age, i.e. until they reach at least 156 years of age.
As a result, researchers wrote in their papers that Greenland sharks are known to be the longest-lived vertebrates on Earth, surpassing the previous long-lived champions of whales (211 years old).
Over the past year, the exchange rate of the renminbi has remained generally stable and has also laid the foundation for promoting the internationalization of the renminbi.
In terms of market performance, the two-way fluctuations of the renminbi exchange rate have been marked over the past year, exchange rate elasticity has increased and the exchange rate is expected to be generally stable.
The exchange rate has changed so far, and there have been several upward and downward fluctuations in the renminbi over 100 points of the median dollar, but the process has increased to the detriment of each other.
Last year's last transfer measure, before the 8/11 transfer, was implemented in 2005, with a significant appreciation of the renminbi against the United States dollar over a decade.
Since the introduction of the new transfer, the renminbi has changed its previous appreciation, with the median exchange rate of the renminbi depreciating by about 8 per cent over a year.
On 1 October this year, the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the renminbi as the weight currency of the SDR (Special Drawing Rights).
The statistics published this week by the China General Customs Administration show that China ' s total value of imports and exports during the first seven months of this year was 13.21 trillion yuan, a decrease of 3 per cent over the same period last year.
In the month of July, the total value of China's exports and imports fell by only 0.9 per cent per year, especially exports, which increased by 2.9 per cent per year.
Experts were of the view that although there were signs of stability in imports and exports in July, expectations should not be too high.
In July, China's total import and export value was RMB 2.09 trillion, a 0.9 per cent decline in the same year.
Of these, exports of RMB 1.22 trillion grew by 2.9 per cent; imports of RMB 873 billion fell by 5.7 per cent; and trade surpluses of RMB 34.28 billion expanded by 34 per cent.
Although the total value of exports and imports has declined over the same period, export data have increased, which is also the fifth consecutive month of export growth since March of this year.
Shanghai police captured more than 3,400 thieves for four months and attacked 157 "hiding and cheating" gangs.
In parallel with the investigation of the case, the police also pursued the recovery of the stolen property totalling more than 33 million yuan yuan.
According to statements made by members of the gang, they entered Shanghai from abroad by wrapping up a black car, then each of them got out of the car and committed the crime, and each of them joined together for hours before leaving the car together.
Suspects often use a building as a unit during the crime, using the exterior wall to climb and break the window fence from the top to the bottom.
The suspect in this case was handed over to the Xu Hong District Public Security Bureau to examine and prosecute the case.
The police warned the general public that it was important to lock the doors and windows of their homes when they went out, and recommended that the public should choose hard steel material for the selection of stolen windows.
In late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will travel to Kenya to attend the Sixth African Development Conference, as reported by the Chinese Voice News Evening Summit.
The Africa Development Conference was led by Japan, and the five previous meetings were held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, so this meeting will also be the first to move to Africa.
In this regard, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan stated that holding local meetings in Africa would help draw attention to Japan in Africa and in European countries.
To coincide with Shinzo Abe's visit, according to the Joint News Agency, the Japan Democratic Party will send a parliamentary delegation to the countries concerned.
It is no coincidence that Japan's path of “normalization” began in the early 1990s, and that the Africa Development Conference initiated by Japan also started in 1993.
If Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations and is an important ticket warehouse for the United Nations, how can Japan abandon Africa if it wants to be “normal?”
Exchanges will also take place with national stakeholders on the response of extremist organizations, the “Islamic State” and terrorist activities.
The Western Group will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.
The Foreign Minister of Japan, Man-sung Kishida, also recently stated his intentions on this African Development Conference in the United Nations Security Council.
Abe announced here that, for the sake of stability in sub-Saharan African countries, 100 billion yen (approximately 6.1 billion yuan) of assistance would be provided within five years.
Observers generally agree that Japan ' s generosity to Africa has been aimed primarily at two objectives: first, to increase Japan ' s sense of presence in Africa; and secondly, to win the support of African countries on the issue of normality.
The Japanese expert on Yang Bojiang analysed it and said, "In political terms, Africa, although relatively lagging behind, has a larger number of countries, so Japan has always considered it as the so-called "big ticket field".
Japan will not give up in the future, nor will it end its work on Africa and will continue to strengthen it.
On the economic side, because Japan has a relatively strong productive capacity, the domestic market is relatively limited and domestic demand is currently relatively low, especially in the context of the ageing of young children.
However, from Junichiro Koizumi 10 years ago to Abe 10 years later, Japan has repeatedly launched the usual “strike” but has all returned.
Japan's expert on Japanese issues, Yang Bojiang, believes that Japan's usual intentions are obvious, but the path to normality is bound to be difficult.
In order for Japan to achieve its goals, it must first make good relations with neighbouring countries, in which Japan needs to adopt a correct attitude, whether in geopolitical contests or ethnic disputes or historical awareness.
The Haiguchi Maritime Court opened a case early in the morning to secure the interests of the parties involved in the sinking of the fishing vessel in Pengak.
The relatives of the three dead crewmen went to the Maritime Court of Haiguchi at 4 a.m. on 7 August to file an application for the preservation of property and the seizure of the suspect cargo vessel prior to the indictment.
After the incident of 4 days, the suspected hit cargo ship was detained by the Maritime Authority in Haiguchi Soo Ying Harbour to assist the investigation.

The opening of the Hong Kong Vi Garden with the introduction of a new bright spot, the 2016 Xianan Cultural Festival.
The music of drums and drums, traditional snacks, fancy decorations and scenes of crowds.
The Xilan Culture Festival 2016, hosted by the Hong Kong Tide Club, was held in Victoria Park from 12 to 14 and was the largest Xilan victory in Hong Kong.
In addition to the continuation of the existing "single-hunting contest", the family has been able to participate in the "maternity-baby-baby-battle race".
Not only is the history of Xinan culture presented in cartoon form, but there are also 3D self-tape zones on the Xinan theme, traditional snack areas and traditional handicraft mobile classrooms, which attract small friends and overseas visitors.
A couple from France stayed at the event for almost three hours and experienced it in the mini-fashion mobile classroom.
"We found this special holiday online, so we decided to come and see it, and it was fresh."
They said that while France had a similar holiday to honour the ancestors, the atmosphere was heavy. Unlike here, there was music and food to learn traditional crafts.
She said, "In such a busy financial city in Hong Kong, you can also see such a large and organized ritual to worship your ancestors."
"It is not only an expression of the diversity of Chinese culture, but it will also make these traditional crafts known to more people and transmit them."
"We don't want the Xinlan cultural festival to be so horrible that people, especially children, are afraid to get close."
"We want to make young people aware, through the rejuvenation of events and the organization of the scene, that what is behind the Xinlan culture is filial and gratefulness."
He also said that there were 24 teams participating in the "Shunting Orphans Competition", which included not only community organizations but also a number of schools working with students.
It is known that Hong Kong's Tide Man Xiao Lan will be included in the "National Intangible Cultural Heritage Directory" in 2011.
On the evening of 11 September, China ' s National Kyoto Theatre came to Mexico City with its famous play, "The White Snake Passage", and at the Ink National Palace of Fine Arts, it presented the local population with an original juicy Kyoto drama feast.
From 9 to 23 August, China's National Kyoto Theatre performed seven Kyoto plays in Mexico City, Mexico City, and in five cities such as Córdoba, Ciudad Juárez and others, as a priority performance project for the Year of Cultural Exchange in China and China.
The viewers followed the story of the White Snake Passion, and the actors sang and fought, and smiled and ovated.
Marissa Jiménez Cacho, who watched the Kyoto play 15 years ago, watched the show with her daughter.
"It was a wonderful performance, and I was impressed by the music, the lights and the stage performance, and I felt it was necessary for my daughter to also learn about Chinese culture and the art of the Chinese Kyoto drama."
The enthusiasm of the Mexican audience was impressed by the performances of the White Lady and young actresses.
"I didn't think Mexican viewers were so passionate, I was worried about their ability to understand the story, but it was unexpected to see today that they caught the story plot and many laughs."
China's Ambassador to Mexico, Qiu Xiaoqi, said that the cultural exchange activities of this year's “year of cultural exchange in China and Latin America” played a positive role in promoting greater understanding and friendship between the peoples of China and Mexico.

Liu Xigui went to Sanya to study "Divine and Twin Cities" to raise the level of urban buildings.
In the morning of 12, Liu Xiaogui hosted a symposium to hear a report on the progress of the Sanya “two-city” pilot project and the suggestions of the departments concerned.
Liu Jigui gave full recognition to the phased results of the pilot work and the good experiences and good practices that were created.
Liu Chigui stressed that Sanya must seize the opportunity of historical development and use the two-city pilot as an important hand to fully realize the role of a modeled leader in the economic and social development of the province.
To play a good leading role in raising the internationalisation of international tourism islands, starting with drop-drop details, enriching international elements and building international excellence.
To play a leading role in urban-rural integration and global tourism, to speed up the construction of niche towns, to integrate tourism elements into every project, and to build every village and town in Sanya into a tourist attraction.
To play a good leading role in the 100 Days of Action for Social Investment, to promote a number of major projects and park building, to ensure that high-quality projects are located and that the requirements of the Big Action are put into practice.
Zhang Qi, Secretary of the Provincial Council and the Sanya Municipal Council, Vice Governor Wang Lu, and the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, Lu Chiyun, participated in the research workshop.
During his 14 years of sports career, Deng Yaping won 18 world champions and became the first person in China ' s Olympic history to win four Olympic gold medals.
She was ranked first in the world for eight consecutive years and the longest female athletes in the history of Ping-Pong.
On 26 September 2010, he was the Under-Secretary-General of the People ' s Daily News and the General Manager of the People ' s Search Network Holdings Company, and a cadre at the formal level.
She will join forces with Yu Minhong to build the country's first sports industry innovation entrepreneurship platform.
There are also such a group of star coaches on China's body: they won countless honours for the country during the athletes' time; after they retired, they taught what they learned for many years to later, training them to win the championship.
As the first world champion of Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yu Bin opted to pick up the whip after retirement.
From female coaches to male coaches to general coaches, Huang Yubin built an Olympic gold band, and even better team achieved 9 gold and 1 silver and 4 copper myths at the Beijing Olympics.
Since then, Tanyo has continued to advertise and, more recently, has played such important roles as "Cowro" and "Rayfing".
A lot of NBA players have proved their strength. But some people progress and others fall.
The performance of some players during each season is reversed, whether due to increased age or restricted attendance.
Of course, some of the “regression” may simply be a reduction in data, and the strength of these players may not decline.
Even if Wade is still one of the best scorebacks in the league, his performance in the bull should not be as hot as that.
The range of the rear range between him and Londo was limited, and the three-point hit of the home star Butler was only 32.8%, which would crowd them up next season.
When it comes to Wind City, Lightning will certainly give more power to Butler and Londo, and it is likely that it will choose how to feed itself in regular competitions.
The situation in Okafu was awkward, and as the first option for 76 people in the last season, he had to compete with Simmons and Nbid for time and rights in the new season.
The competition may not come soon, Simmons will have to adapt to the NBA, and Embide will recover fully from the injury and illness as soon as possible, but it is still a question whether Okafu will be able to find a place in the 76 long-strength.
Last season, Okafu scored 32 per cent from low-level attacks, which were higher than Coxince, Vuchevich and Brooke Lopes, while his usage was also high at the top 40 in the Alliance.
With Simons already showing an excellent front-loading potential, and Embide has a body better suited to the NBA game, it will be difficult for Okafu to be as strong as ever.
In the past two seasons, Thompson's usage has stabilized at the top 20 of the League, and these are the two best seasons of his career.
But the problem is that, with Durant's arrival, Thompson's use rate will definitely decline, and this will certainly affect his performance.
The impact will be not only the impact of the number of hits, but will certainly be significantly reduced in the next season, which in some respects will make it less difficult for his opponent to defend himself.
Durant's arrival will definitely shrink the numbers of the warriors, but the most serious of this is probably Thompson.
But that doesn't mean that the Tang God's standards are falling back, which is more like the sacrifice he made for the team as a whole.
Parker performed better in the last season than the data reflect, not only because his basket efficiency was at its highest, but also because his and Aldrich's chemical reactions benefited the stunners.
Duncan retired, Ginobiri announced another year of war, and the combined GDP finally ended, as the youngest of the three, with little oil in the fuel tank of the French running car.
Only Jabbar, Jordan and Russellby James won more regular MVPs after receiving the third championship ring, and Jordan was the only one with more FMVPs than James.
Oh, by the way, James just brought Cleveland's first professional sports championship in the last 52 years.
James, who came to the fourteenth season of his career, needed better physical security to prepare for the after season.
So, in the conventional race, James' data is likely to fall further, and he'll give Owen more weight, but he'll still easily be the top three players in the league.
"It is important to build on the talents learned from the country in Russia."
On the 12th of local time, the president of the Federation of Chinese Expatriates in Moscow, Huang Jing, was excited to say when he saw Chinese and Chinese online journalists.
Not long ago, she participated in a training course on Chinese talents (book law, painting) in Chinese cultural societies abroad, hosted by the Foreign Affairs Office of the State Council of China and hosted by the University of South China.
When he first attended the training course, he knew nothing about where to draw the book, and he was able to draw and write his own work at the end of the course.
When he returns to Moscow, he must make his own contribution to the dissemination and promotion of Chinese culture with the knowledge and skills he has learned.
Yan Wei, Secretary-General of the Chinese Cultural Promotion Association of Russia, who also participated in this training course, felt the same.
She said that she had made great progress with the help of the teacher of the training course, but also felt the heavy responsibility of being the “overseas distributor of Chinese culture”.
Yan Wei said that when he returned to Russia, China's traditional culture would be disseminated and promoted among Chinese and Russians who loved Chinese culture.
Today, at 19:35, during the 22nd round of the competition, the Chongqingi sails to challenge Beijing ' s national security.
In the 29th minute, Wang Dynasty hit the door, in the 39th minute, the new aid Caldek overtaken the harvest with Fernando's help, and in the 81st minute, the country brought back one ball.
Ten minutes after the race, the windfleet hit the corner with a series of opportunities, and Fernando's small angles were pulled out of the bottom line by the State's security line.
In the 15th minute, Zhang Hae-chul's middle-field line was picked up, Ilmaz had stormed the restricted area, and Liu Woo, a single guard, took the first step to destroy the ball.
One minute later, Park Xiao Fei confiscated the ball by shooting in the middle of the restricted area of Da Po without kicking it right in front of the left side of the road.
On the right side of Fernando's two-to-two-round, Carldock suddenly picked up the door before being knocked down by the Leiten Dragon's flying action when he was plugged in. The referee decided to point the ball and showed Leitenlong the yellow card.
On the 37th minute, the country's security changed, Zhang Xiaobin went to the scene and Zhang Chi Ming went to fight against the old master.
In front of the Caldock exclusion zone, where a low-level pass on the left side of the Fernando exclusion zone, Caldek was pushed to break the door.
And that's where Caldock gets the ball in the middle-and-high start, and the wiener 2-0 takes the lead.
As soon as Fernando opened the second half of the game, he won any ball on the right by force, but the small angle hit the door high.
After Deng Xiaofei was found to have delayed getting the yellow card, Peng Xinli, who replaced it, also received the yellow card because of the previous fouls in the restricted area.
In the 56th minute, Zhang Ji Ming's internal cut was accompanied by Zhang Hae-chul's passing, and his arc ball was blocked by Deng Xiao Fei.
In the Forbidden District of Liu, a ferocious raid was carried out against Kremetz, and he won the yellow card with the emotional Wang Dynasty.
In the 63rd minute, during the run-off of Fernando's right road, which was directly knocked over by Kremitz, Fernando was very unhappy with Kremitz's movements and Kremitz received yellow cards.
One minute later Fernando showed up again on the right side of the road with the ability to run, and Dabao won the yellow card to follow the rules.
Ilmaz was forced to break through the no-go line, fell down under Cheng Yuen's extended leg intercept, and the judge ruled the ball, Ilmaz broke the door with the knife, and Lilf 2:1 national security.

After four minutes of filling, the 2-1 score is kept to the end of the game, and the national security is defeated in the on-the-spot.
After taking this valuable 3 points, the score of the Quantico is now 27 points, temporarily numbering 10 on the score list.
Lehman will then serve as an expert for Dekha Asia Media Partners and participate in various local fan events.
It was reported that in the fall, Ambassador Lehman and Mateus of Delacroix would launch a legendary tour of Asia and the Americas on behalf of Decau, which would ring the outpost for the opening of the 2016/17 Satidika.
The event will span two continents and cover four top cities, which together with fans will heat up for the new season.
The Texas League was one of the five major European leagues (E.T.A., N.A., I.A., I.A., D.A., and F.A.), a flag race that the German sports community in the soccer kingdom refused to allow.
As one of the most powerful leagues in the world, Taka attracted some 13.3 million viewers in the 2014 - 2015 season alone.
The representatives of Dekha Haomen Bailinmunich, Dotmond and the famous players Thomas Muller, Ram and Gotsai are well known in China.
In coordination with the previously online Weibo, Yoko and Wei Weibo platforms, the Taka side looks forward to providing Chinese fans with a wider and more accessible channel to get the latest news of the tournament.
The British team won silver medals in a seven-man football game, and the Fiji team won gold medals.
During the finals of the seven-man football game on Thursday night, the British team failed to continue its outstanding performance in front of the Fiji team and was defeated by the Fiji team at Rio Tiodoro Stadium at 43-7.
The Fiji team won gold medals on the basis of impeccable performances in ball control, robbery, avoidance, collaboration, running and strength, which was the country's first Olympic Games medal in history.
The silver medal is also a great comfort to the defeated British team, which was the third silver medal the British delegation won that day. This score is enough to make the British football team proud: they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa all the way to the first seven-man football game in the Olympic Games.
Earlier that day, the British team won the South African team seven to five, which could have affected their state of play in the finals.
But in any case, the Fiji team now has enough to defeat a full-hearted 15-man team.
Tomorrow, at least one Englishman will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort to the British team, but it may not be. This Englishman is Ben Ryan, the head coach of the Fiji team from Wimbledon, who was the head coach of the British team.
The British team won't be easy to achieve today.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's teachings, they didn't win the 7-man football game in Adelaide International.
And now they're only one step away from the champion.
Although they have been hit hard, they have also made very impressive progress.
Fiji began with an advantage, leaving the British team helpless.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it's like bumping into a series of on-going buses. When Osi Colliniso entered the Cape Flag Zone, the World Series championship team was already five-to-zero far ahead.
Only four minutes after the game, Jerry Towey scored right-wing touchdown again.
12 to 0, the British team barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's powerful interdiction has left Leon Nacalava, a giant, with no third score, but it simply slows Fiji's score.
At 7 minutes, Yassa Welleymaru hit the ground on the right corner. 17 to 0, the British team is getting worse.
Then Karava scores another point, and the first half of the game is one minute away.
Then Vatmo Ravovo broke through the British defense and went straight to the score line.
The score is already 29 to 0 in the middle of the break.
Fijians seem to be born to play seven-man football, while the British team is still the first to emerge.
That's the situation.
The British team made a huge change in the second half of the game and hit the Fijian line of defense for four minutes, which was good for the first half. But then the Fiji team joined forces, and Joshua Tuesova scored again.
Dan Norton created an opportunity for the British team to score, changing the score to 36-7 on the left corner, but the race was already under the control of the South China Sea island nation and their fans sang loudly on the platform, waving flags and carrying songs and dances.
The excellent performance of the Fiji team made it imperative to clapping.
Mata William stopped an unimportant attack by Fiji's team at the last minute.
The final whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged together, and the defeated British team left only to regret.
Earlier that day, the Fiji team defeated the Japanese team with 20 to 5 in the semi-finals, while the United Kingdom managed to win the South African team in a fierce semi-final.
Kyle Brown helped the South African team get the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the door in the second half with an excellent footing method.
Later, Antony's brother Marcus Watson of England secured the team's victory with a brilliant intercept, and the British team eventually won the silver medal.
Helen Graves and Heather Stanning, inspired by their cancer coach, won the gold medal.
It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most moving piece of gold.
From the first rowing to the present, Helen Graves and Heather Stanning have received 220 punitive lift trainings, and the gold medal they took at Estacio da Lagoa has a more extraordinary meaning.
Although only two of them were rowing, the voice of one of the men on board — Coach Robin Williams — was always accompanied by their impact on the gold medal of the second consecutive female two-man oar Olympics, the first English pair of girls to reach this height.
They have maintained 39 undefeated records and have an absolute advantage.
What we see is that these two talented athletes travel gracefully on the surface, but that is not all of this victory.
There are many volunteers behind each of the gold medals, and it is their constant dedication that has created a difference, and none of this can help more than a coach who learned 30 months ago that he was suffering from cancer and wondered if he could live to see the day.
As he said, death could come any minute.
I had bladder cancer, and they operated on me.
If you don't operate, the cancer cells spread to the whole body.
That way, the situation would be much worse.
It'll change your opinion a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he started treatment early in 2014, minimizing the impact, although it may not be appropriate to say so in this case.
I need to get paid, so I have to get better quickly.
It's an incentive for me.
I live in the hospital, and although they say it's enough to walk a few steps, I walk 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet every time I walk around the ward.
That's the starting point for everything.
The boat race itself is a journey, which makes the journey a little longer.
At the moment of the gold harvest, they first thought of Williams. This morning William Musby talked a little bit, which was to overcome his anxiety.
Stanin, who was the head of the Royal Artillery Team, will travel to Afghanistan, saying, "I'm in a bad mood this week, probably a bit extreme, but this gold medal does mean a lot."
It repeatedly tells me how important this is to me, how hard I, Helen, and Robin have worked.
That's Helen, Robin and I trying for three years.
If it wasn't for Robin, we'd still be nobody. Thank you very much. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't find better trainers and coaches than him.
Helen Grave and Heather Stanning have not lost in five years.
The punishment imposed on the combination is beyond the reach of their opponents.
Even at the last 500 metres, even as New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanin and Grave still had large physical reserves.
It was quite a shock.
Helen said, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It's really important not to be influenced by your opponent.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not expect to do anything dramatic.
We didn't think about today's glory, we just wanted to row every oar and win the race, and we did.
It took a year for the combinations to decide their own future.
Graves will marry Steve Bucksall next month as a television explorer.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say this is my last game.
It'll put too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realize I was an Olympic champion.
It's a whole new experience, and I'm very nervous.
It has now been about four minutes.
She said, "I feel better."

Alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications, education, at the same price as last month.
Snapchat's vibe effect is pointed at as sarcastic Asians.
Snapchat indicated that the inspiration of the filter was automatic, but some observers thought it was racist.
Snapchat's 150 million daily users can change reality through its filtering tool and make people look ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a role in a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
These lenses have the effect of passivating and bending characteristics, generating more than 30 million self-pictures of decorative nature every day.
Any mistake will be immediately noticed by the public.
The Snapchat lens had been criticized for encouraging black people to play or for being beautiful with white skin.
So, when the application this week provides some users with a filter that creates slashed eye, weird tooth and powder face effects, some commentators refer to it as a racial irony to Asian “yellows”.
They even think that these recurring questions mean that the company has a bigger problem with diversity.
The Wednesday's story of The Verge and Motherboard provoked anger after Snapchat indicated that it deleted the function.
The company explained that the filter was a tribute to the moving role rather than a sarcastic Asian.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of the harmful stereotypes of reality.
Others are also firmly opposed to these moving images.
A Korean-American artist who posted Twitter on these photos and was widely shared said in an e-mail that the filters were “at least painful and uncomfortable”.
She also said, "It's hard to tell the difference between the extremely disgusting Asian sarcastic image and the effect of the filter."
Although the filters are not just yellow people, yellow people are extremely devalued.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches these cultural bottom lines.
From company boards to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusiveness.
The large youth group of Snapchat may be very sensitive because it is more racially diverse than the older generation.
When a snapchat filter created an insulting image of the user, 25-year-old Chu Kaiti said in a Thursday interview: "This kind of thing is harder to escape than it was before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, who was a product manager and engineer in Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article and a telephone interview written for Medium, she stated that she believed that the ethnic controversy reflected the lack of ethnic diversity in the recruitment process of Snapchat.
Ms. Chu criticized the company ' s employees, most of whom were white, and the leadership was all male and added a label at the end of the article: #DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese American, Ms. Chu said, " Either their employees have no different races, so they can make such a decision, or some of their employees have colored races, but their position does not allow them to speak freely."
Other observers shared the complaint that she had not been responded to by Snapchat.
The company did not publish data on employee diversity and stated that it was a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of his staff, but one speaker said that the company had recently hired a recruiter to focus on the lower proportion of its population and promote internal inclusion.
Ms. Chu said that she would close her Snapchat account: "I wonder if they need more users like us against this behavior."
According to the Congressional team, military officials distort ISIS intelligence.
In a report released on Thursday, a Congressional team noted that officials of the United States Central Command had changed their intelligence reports and described the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than the actual situation.
The mid-term report comes from a special working group formed by the Republican President of the House Military Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Sub-Committee of the House Appropriations Committee. The report states that the Central Command intelligence analysts have “wider dissatisfaction”, who say their superiors are tampering with their assessment of the war between the United States and the Islamic State.
Central Command (Centcom), located in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news article on the report, “intelligence that has been reviewed by the senior leadership of the Central Command is more optimistic about the description of United States counter-terrorism operations than is actually the case and has always been more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies”.
The representative of the Republican Party of California said, "The behavior of the Central Command is unacceptable. On the one hand, our soldiers suffer the war, and on the other hand, high-level policy makers get wrong analysis."
The question of the leadership of the Central Command extends to the highest level of the Agency.
The report details the long-standing problems of the Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing the training of the Iraqi army by the United States.
Although there is no conclusive evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration have ordered changes to these reports, according to the description of the report, these analysts feel under pressure from the leaders of the Central Command, forcing them to express a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
According to the report, “in the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and parliamentary testimony were much more optimistic than the actual situation”.
For example, an official of the Central Command publicly indicated that a major military operation might have taken back Mosul as early as April or May 2015.
The second largest Iraqi city, Mosul, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Republic Party of Kansas, said in a statement: “This result has become apparent after months of investigation”.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most of the high-level intelligence officers of the United States Central Command manipulated the intelligence products of the Command and concealed the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq.
The Republican Party set up a special working group after it learned from the analysts that information about the Islamic State had been manipulated.
As the investigation continues, more will be discovered after the report released on Thursday.
The Attorney General of the Ministry of Defence has also conducted a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives published their findings on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
In a statement, Sheinda, a representative of the Commission's Democratic Party leader, said that between 2014 and 2015, the Central Command had developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessments of the Islamic State and Iraqi peacekeeping forces.”
Mr. Sheinda said that the process “impedes the release of intelligence”, reduces the morale of analysts and “cannot accept different opinions”.
But Mr. Sheanda and the Democrats also said that they had found no evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on the analysts of the Central Command, so that their conclusions were consistent with "preset or political narratives".
The Beast Daily reported on the preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon Attorney General had opened an investigation after receiving complaints from central headquarters analysts.
In a statement, the Pentagon spokesman, Navy Major Patrick Evans, stated that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on this parliamentary report until the investigation by the Attorney General had been completed.
But he said: “Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security themes.”
The impact of this investigation has exceeded the success of the United States-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria (as claimed by an increasing number of Defense Ministry officials).
Last year, however, these claims called into question the extent to which President Obama could trust the assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas published by the Central Command.
Criticism about ISIS intelligence reminds me of the controversy of more than a decade ago when the Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Hook wrote a research article in which it was stated that George Bush's administration, despite the opposition of many analysts, insisted on sending small troops to Iraq and gave little consideration to the situation following the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hook played a key role in this opposition campaign on Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said that Mr. Hook's team had come to the conclusion that the air strikes against the ISIS refinery had not significantly reduced the economic revenues of the terrorist organization, which had built the temporary refinery and continued to sell oil on the black market, in contrast to the declared statement.
According to the September report of Time Weekly, the Central Command did not publish the discovery.
When many lawyers reviewed Senate testimony about over-optimistic assessments of the war, the Commander of the Central Command, Lloyd Austen III, was criticized last year.
General Austin retired in April and is currently being replaced by Joseph Waters at the Central Command.
America won four consecutive victories in the women's hockey game and will win against England.
Katie Bam, the only three-dollar winner in the six-to-one victory over Japan, took the lead for the American Women's Hockey Team twice on Thursday, helping the American team beat the Indian team by 3-0.
Two contests of five ball entry were amazing, but 27-year-old Bam said she didn't know she was doing so well.
She said, "I don't know anything about it."
I'm not the kind of guy who remembers how many balls he made.
What she knew was that the United States team had won four consecutive victories at the Olympics and would be number one with the British team that had failed after winning Japan on Thursday at 2-0.
Britain and the United States met on Saturday at the last round of the game.
Both teams will play a quarter final for promotion, which will determine who will appear first in the team.
The team that gets the team first will avoid encountering a strong Dutch team, thus making it possible to go further. The Dutch team will be on the line as the other team first.
In Saturday's game, the American team created miracles with amazing performances. You know, at the London Olympics four years ago, the American team was down in 12 teams.
Bam was in that team at the time.
Bam grew up in Brubel, Pennsylvania, first picked up a hockey bat when she was 3 years old (her twin sister did this in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming the youngest national team ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympic Games because she was unable to be elected to the final list.
In 2012, neither she nor her teammates were well received.
The next year, the British Craig Panam became the lead coach, and everything started to change.
Bam said, "It's a change of culture, mentality and substance."
We had not reached the current level in London at that time.
We've come to make a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam pulled his head out in the first half of the field with a close reflection.
India has not yet won the game, but this team has shown remarkable tenacity and kept the score of 1-0 until the end of section III, when Bam broke out.
She traveled long distances along the left side of the field with the ball. She then cut inside to the middle road, pumped into the net, and the U.S. team was two-to-zero ahead.
Melissa González hit the last ball in the middle of section IV.
For the first time in this game, the American counterpart, Jackie Bridges, had a single goal in the first three victories.
This time she's super-played.
Bam too.
Panam said, "We're in good shape right now." But it depends on the results of the Saturday game.
A cold and acidic food during the Great Depression.
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had just been elected President, sat in the office of the President for lunch.
As a cook, President Roosevelt likes to eat on Fifth Avenue, such as foie gras and salmon stew in Maryland.
On that day, his menu was very simple: ketchup devil's eggs, mashed potatoes and pastries as snacks.
Jane Zigman said, "It's for food to share the pain of those who are suffering."
Her husband, Andrew Ko, added: "It also reflects the way Americans eat."
The couple living in the Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Mr. Ko's last book, Excavated Cuisine, was about American Chinese food, and Ms. Zigman in her book, orchard 97, described the lives of slum tenants through food.
The book they co-authored, The Great Buffet, will be published by Harper Press on Tuesday, describing the food history of the United States during the Great Depression.
After showing a common view of food, they met a journalist at Eisenberg's sandwich store. This simple lunch counter in the iron district has been open since the collapse of the economy in 1929.
Mrs. Zigman, age 54, ordered a cream cheese with a broken olive sandwich, while Mr. Ko, age 57, ordered turkeys, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The press ordered a baked meat roll, which the couple considered fit to discuss during the Great Depression.
She said, "Bread was very popular then."
There was peanut bread, liver bread, soy bread.
They're made of a raw material and a cheap rinse that can pour on the raw material.
Imagine, your dinners are peanuts.
Mr. Ko has a strange face.
He said, "They must be like lead in your stomach."
In the years prior to the Great Depression, the Americans were serving buffets, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cook for male farm workers, and breakfast, lunch and dinner have newly tested pies.
During the First World War, it was the Americans who gave food to hungry Europeans. The Great Foods documented how the country suddenly stopped becoming a rich place.
Mr. Ko explained why he and his wife wanted to write this book: "Food was the main topic that made Americans uncomfortable at the time."
Another unpleasant topic was the new food that was sour: the "frozen food" such as bread and stew became the main dish, which was the "best leftover cooking method", and Ms. Ziegler said that it was because the cooks could use butter from the sauce to hide the bad food.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat that has been leading the American table for years has become a rare luxury.
The strange groceries only consider calories, and the first thing people think about nutrition is the taste and even the basic common sense of cooking.
In the course of studying the book, including various recipes, Ms. Zigman made a roasted onion filled with peanut oil.
Mr. Ko said, "It's not common at dinner tables."
Ms. Zigman said, "It's too strange."
Peanut oil and roasted onions are simply not compatible.
This is characteristic of many family economic meals.
Family economists influence the dietary habits of the country, such as Louis Stanley and others, who served as chefs of the Federal Bureau of Family Economy from 1923 to 1943, which is unprecedented in history.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encourage women to "tell hard" and dare to turn bad foods like creamed pasta with carrots into good food.
The Great Diner is a great "historical treasure".
Especially interesting is the government's response to hungry people, such as the attitude of the president's citizen, Herbert Hoover, "I can't handle other people's business."
Although he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse as a child, his diet was as delicate as a millionaire.
Mr. Ko said, "He likes to eat European foods like fish and cucumber sauce."
He was wearing a evening dress and eating in a gold-plated restaurant.
He was apparently separated from the people.
If his wife Eleanor hadn't encouraged him to set an example on the diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As this book says, Ms. Roosevelt's butler has no interest in taste, so the White House "food is not only the worst food in Washington, but also the worst food in cooking."
As soon as the United States returned to formality, many of the cooking methods during the Great Depression were abandoned.
Ms. Zigman said that what remained was our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking.
This means that when they wrote this book, they learned more about Ms. Zigman's mother's eating habits, such as how she didn't throw away her food.
Mr. Ko said, "She's very afraid of wasting food."
Ms. Zigman recalled: "She actually made many lives sick."
For example, there's been a "Cream Buff" incident.
After removing the plate, she and Mr. Ko pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: this was the fruit pudding that President Roosevelt had at lunch.
Ms. Zigman said, "It's called butter and fruit, and added that the name of a new tide for a normal dish is "the usual trick."
There is no cream in this dessert, but only fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
It's hard for everyone to go deep into the sticky brown paste.
Surprisedly, this dessert tastes good.
Mr. Ko ate a second and a third.
He thought it was an acceptable, real dessert and said to his wife, "Put some walnuts and they'll eat better."
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report showed that crude oil production continued to increase in July, and Saudi production reached even higher levels.
The report does not prohibit the market from casting doubt on the credibility of OPEC, and the road to oil price recovery is still, I fear, full of thorns.
This Monday, the OPEC Chairman-in-Office and Minister of Energy of Qatar, Sa'da, indicated that OPEC would hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on 26-28 September.
The monthly report published by OPEC on Wednesday shows that the production of the entire OPEC organization, including Gabon, rose by 46,000 barrels per day in July to 3,311,000 barrels per day.
OPEC also stated in its monthly report that low crude oil prices have led global refiners to produce more refined oils, thus increasing market oversupply.
International oil prices fell for two consecutive days as a result of the news, coupled with the projected increase in crude oil production in the United States and the unexpected increase in crude oil stocks.
As of Wednesday, the price of light crude oil futures delivered by the New York Commodity Exchange in September fell by 2.48 per cent and the price of London Brent futures delivered in October fell by 2.07 per cent.
Reuters believes that it is unlikely that the proposed oil-producing countries conference will significantly tighten supply and that the data published by the United States Energy Information Agency will suffocate the market.
On Wednesday, the official Iranian news agency Fars quoted the Iranian oil minister, Zangane, as saying that Iran ' s daily crude oil production was up to 3.85 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
As soon as the news of the meeting came out, Russian energy minister Novak said that there was no need for a new round of frozen negotiations under oil prices.
The last meeting of oil-producing countries had been held in April, and OPEC member countries had failed to agree on any measures.
The BMIResearch Oil and Gas Analyst, Emma Richards, said that markets and media might overreact to the forthcoming OPEC conference.
Helima Croft, head of the Grand Commodity Strategy of the Royal Bank of Canada, said that OPEC would change the mood in the market by releasing signals that they would facilitate the agreement.
It's like smoke and mirrors that draw attention to people's eyes.
Eugene Weinberg, head of bulk commodity research at German commercial banks, said that it was considered very unlikely that OPEC would attempt to stabilize the market through the September conference.
This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, after all, the organization has played "Wolves" once.
Medical advertising in violation of the law, the centralization of complaints, and medical establishments that have been punished several times in the past are the focus of spot checks in all regions.
The National Board of Health and Planning and the National Central Medicine and Medicine Administration will, in due course, organize inspections of the performance of special supervision and inspection in selected provinces.
According to media sources, the current homogenization of products has become a serious problem as a result of the massive influx of capital into Internet medicine, the tide of investment has dwindled and capital has entered the wait-and-see period.
Also, according to data from the Alipei Hospital Management Research Centre in Hong Kong, Internet medical companies lost a large number of lives in one year of business start-up, and about 20% of start-up Internet medical enterprises ceased to exist.
However, as most Internet-based medical enterprises struggle on the A or B financing path, a few leading firms in the classified fields still have access to capital.
It seems that Internet medical start-up must not be “a bee”, but rather depends on the needs of the quasi-market, so that it can stay focused and do deep work.
Fish jumps cost 1.2 million yuan, or 40 per cent of registered capital, and Kyushu public equipment companies contribute 1.8 million yuan, or 60 per cent of registered capital.
In recent years, the electronic, integrated supply chain management system has gradually entered hospitals at all levels, with the country ' s policy support in the area of medical information.
The fish jump with Kyushu Tong was aimed precisely at market demand, helping hospitals build up advanced supply chain management systems and using them as an opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet medical companies that are greedy, iBaby has been focused on the vertical area of Internet obstetrics since the beginning, deep-ploughing pregnant mothers and doctors.
Pregnant mothers not only have access to a competent doctor on a 24-hour and one-to-one basis free of charge, but can also pay for targeted medical consultations.
At the doctor's end, iBaby broke the geographical limit by organizing experts to give online lectures to grass-roots doctors, peer exchanges, case discussions, etc.
At present, three sections are opened at the doctor's end, one for continuous education of doctors, one for socialization of doctors and one for help of doctors.
Provision of services such as online learning, case discussion, academic exchange; social networking platforms with hospitals, with clinicians; medical patient relationships or legal aid, entrepreneurial support, etc. needed for personal life.
According to media reports, King CEO recently said Ali's health was "willing to sink" to take down the big health data.
Internet companies and data companies lack professionalism, and writing methods on the same phrase are not uniform.
Ali's current layout in the field of medical and health care is divided into three sections: Ali's Health, Skycat's Medical Clinic, and Paybaby's Future Hospital.
Wang told me that medical and health start-ups are harder than any other business, "It's not just about how much money it costs, it's about sinking, it's about being lonely and doing it slowly."
It's easy to hurt the heart to stay up all night watching the Olympics.
The Brazilian Olympic Games were just as hot as they were, and even though the event was aired at midnight in the country, many citizens stayed up to watch the event.
In response, the doctor specifically warned that there are health hazards associated with staying up late to watch the event and that it may cause cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up long enough, the hormone will still be highly secretive and the human body will remain in a state of tension and excitement, unable to recover normally, and prone to a contraction of the blood pressure and an increase in the blood pressure, leading to cardiovascular disease.
Han Chi-won particularly warned that groups with high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood fat, smoking habits, family history, etc. risk factors could cause cardiovascular disease more easily if they stayed up overnight.
If you stay up long enough, not only the cardiovascular function will be affected, but also the gastrointestinal function, the immune system, the neuroendocrine system, and even the risk of tumours will increase.
For old friends, Han Chi-hwan advised to try not to stay up for the Olympics, especially for groups with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last World Cup football match, Han Chi-won visited a patient in his 60s, whose heart infarction was triggered or related to the night watching the game.
He said that, since the beginning of the year, his office has been treating patients with myocardial infarctions or strokes at the age of 25, largely as a result of the patient ' s long-term overnight lifestyle.
1. Don ' t stay up late every day and occasionally stay up late to watch the favorite sports items, other items may wait until the next day to see the event resume.
2. Staying up at night is timely to replenish water and eat more fruit to prevent vascular congestion and increase the immunity of the body.
On August 12, Beijing time news reported that Chinese General Durie had won a bronze medal in 2016, when the women of the Rio Olympics fought for the finals of the three positions of a 50-metre rifle.
Durie became the fourth member of the Olympics, and four Olympics took down two gold and one silver and four bronze medals.
In 1998, he entered the Shandong shooting team and followed Coach Wang Devon for professional shooting training.
In June 2003, the gold medal of the 10-metre gas rifle for women participating in the World Cup and breaking the world record with a 504.9 ring.
In August 2004, gold medals were obtained for women's 10-metre air rifle, and the Chinese team won the first gold at the Athens Olympics.
In August 2008, gold medals were won in a game of 50-metre sports rifles with a total score of 690.3 around the Olympic record.
During August 2012, after the London Olympics, Durie declared the application for temporary retirement to the International Shooting Union.
In January 2015, Durie announced that she would return to the National Team to start training and prepare for the Rio Olympics.
In March 2016, the Rio Olympics selection competition was concluded, and the women ' s 10-metre gas rifle Olympics were eligible for re-election eight years later.
On 6 August 2016, during the Rio Olympic women ' s 10-metre air rifle race, Durie won silver medals with 207 rings.
On August 12, 2016, bronze medals were won in three positions for women ' s 50-metre rifles at the Rio Olympic Games.
The film is expected to be broadcast on central television and music premiere early next year and will also be launched for the first time in the VR Panorama.
The documentary Polar is a large-scale work focusing on the third polar Tibetan plateau of the Earth, telling stories about the convergence of Tibetan traditions with modern times and the interaction of Tibet with the world with a new perspective.
The greatest advantage of VR works is that the viewer has a unique viewing sense of "immersion", which makes the filming process even more demanding.
The production team of the Special VR edition of The Polar Panorama said they wanted to make sure that every image in every location was impeccable and that the audience felt at home.
On August 11, a special combat sniper organized by the Sandong Smoking Station Unit of the Carabineros came to Khunjong Mountain at a high temperature of 34 degrees Celsius to conduct training in the jungle.
During the cold war, the Soviet Union brought missiles into Cuba, almost leading to a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.
The event was seen as the culmination of the cold war, which was called the “Cuban missile crisis”.
But what little is known is that, also during the cold war, a strong solar storm was in danger of causing the US to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, which was only announced for the first time by researchers on August 9.
On 23 May 1967, a strong solar storm severely disrupted the radar and radio communications of the United States military in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the United States ballistic missile early warning system and are used to monitor Soviet missiles.
The paper, completed by researchers at the University of Colorado in the United States, interviewed United States military personnel who were involved in forecasting and analysing the sun at that time and consulted non-confidential literature.
The paper wrote that in the 1960s, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly waging a nuclear war, the United States Air Force always had a number of aircraft with nuclear warheads flying in the sky.
The U.S. military commander did not know that the main cause of the interference was the Sunstorm, not the Soviet Union, and ordered the war planes to be ready for battle.
Fortunately, the solar activity of the United States military since the end of the 1950s and its study of Earth ' s electromagnetic interference eventually prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he compiled information from the Air Force Aviation Weather Service and submitted a detailed report.
As a direct consequence of this solar storm, the United States military has since considered space weather to be a combat concern and has established a stronger space weather forecasting system.
During their daily travels, citizens find that cars of love are blocked by strange vehicles and can use the "MicroMork" function to solve this problem when the driver of a strange vehicle cannot be contacted.
Since August 11, the Xi'an traffic police micro-letter service, Xi'an traffic police, has launched the Xi'an transport service.
When this service is introduced, citizens in everyday life can solve such problems by using the "MicroMork" function if they find a strange vehicle that prevents their vehicle from moving while the driver is not present.
The new service function is one that is fast and saves administrative costs; two that respects and protects the privacy of citizens; and three that is full-time, round-the-clock.
As long as the citizens have a small trust, they can operate on their own very easily, in a way that is relatively friendly and easy for both parties to move cars to meet each other, ease parking problems, and reduce the incidence of traffic-related security cases.
On the other hand, with respect to owners of vehicles who refuse to move, illegally park or obstruct movement, the Xian Border Control Department has indicated that the traffic police will then take different disposal measures depending on the circumstances of the case and will do so according to the circumstances.
On August 9, more than 10 young employees of the Commercial Lo Power Company came to the cultural tourist attractions in the town of Xiahuagu, Danfung County, to carry out the theme "Ayogu City is full of electricity" and our holiday 7-day event.
In conjunction with the construction of spiritual civilization, the Tang Fong County Company of the Commercial Loop Power Company actively organized the "Sangyo City is full of electricity" and our festival, the theme of the 7th of July.
The employees of the companies participating in the event said, "The main energy they normally devote to their work and learning is lack of time and platform to communicate with colleagues and friends."
"This company has given us such an easy, happy and harmonious platform, which I very much like, meaningful and interesting."
The 7th-day event was widely well received by the youth workers in the field, and it was hoped that the company would organize more such events in the future and enhance communication and communication with more young people.
The high-profile male champion of the Beijing Olympic Games and the Spanish star Nadal, who had two rounds of victory in the male contest on the day, had been promoted to the finals, as well as to the male pairs.
The three-line strike of Nadar, who was the Kim's winner, had a one-hour relationship with the Olympic Games, and he was not cured.
He and his teammate Lopez will compete for gold medals with the Romanian contestants Tekau and Megya in the male double final.
The Rio Olympic Women's List project experienced the withdrawal of many seed players, and after several days of intense competition, the women's list was created in all fours and 11s.
Kovitova will compete with Puig for a final ticket, while another final seat will be created between Keith and Kobel.
The four strongs of the women's doubles were also created, and the semi-finals were: Singis/Basinsky vs. Hradka/Hravakova; Makalova/Vesenia vs. Strikova/Safalova.
The mixed-twin match of the day was also eight strong, but the fall of the top seed Mahu/Gascia group and the retreat of the Naso group made the mixed-twin match slightly disfigured.
On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly published a new edition of the US-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines in New York, allowing Japan ' s armed forces to play a more offensive role globally.
This was the day when US Secretary of Defense Carter, US Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Kaida Mansung and Japanese Defense Minister Nakada attended a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth time that the Chinese civilian think tank has published the Japanese military force assessment report and the fourth time it has been launched in English.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including general policy adjustments, military strength, defence budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, institutional reform, military training, foreign military security cooperation, military security relations with China, etc.
According to the report, 2015 was the year in which Abe's government took office for several consecutive years to advance major policy adjustments in the area of security.
Since then, Japan ' s initiatives in the field of security will be primarily at the operational level of the application of the rule of law, strategy implementation, policy implementation, etc., rather than at the large scale of adjustments and changes in frameworks, mechanisms and policies.
The report stresses that Abe's Cabinet tried to achieve the multiple objectives of promoting Japan's “normal nationalization” through the above-mentioned three-point breakthroughs, the self-defence forces going out to intervene in international security matters, the strengthening of the Japan-United States alliance, and the defence of China's Chinese system.
Prior to that, the China Society for Strategic Cultural Promotion published Japanese military force assessment reports on 5 June 2012, 19 July 2013, 23 July 2014 and 30 June 2015.
The British Financial Times released a collection of atlases of the residence of the U.S. Ambassador to China on August 12.
In contrast, according to the article, the residence of the United States Ambassador could, from the look of it, be considered a safe house in the next film adapted from John Le Calle's Cold War spy novel.
The residence was grey and was heavily guarded by the perimeter fence, the second level of the inner wall, barbed wire and the layers of vehicle roadblocks.
Filling of public sports facilities shortboards
The black coal farm warehouse became the football field of "green grass like hin" and the factory with the top of the red brick became the modern sports hall.
On the National Day of Physics, the South Falling Horse Camp Sports and Culture Park outside the Gang Gate in Hangzhou unveiled its mysterious veil.
It was once a coal mine and has been idle since closure more than a decade ago, leaving a large quantity of illegal buildings and household garbage.
As a result of its rehabilitation, it became a sports culture park, which will be officially opened to the public in November, offering free sports places to citizens, and undoubtedly opening new fertile ground for sport for all.
This is reminiscent of Hangzhou's Chen Xinxing Institute, where the "Hang Po military school" from China's swimming altar swims out of the world's champions.
The name of the swimming altar will continue to emerge, and the relationship between competitive sports and sports for all is vividly explained - a rich popular base provides good conditions for the selection of professional players.
The level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of sport for all, which in a sense depends on sport for all, and sport for all depends on the conditions of the site.
It was reported that, as of 2015, our per capita area of sport was 150 times greater than that of the new China when it was founded, but it was still far behind the sports powers.
In June of this year, the State Council published the National Fitness Plan (2016-2020), which focuses on the development of mass sports.
In order to complete this short board, on the one hand, the relevant departments must take fully into account the layout of the stadium in their urban planning.
On the other hand, the public stadiums that have been built, including in institutions such as schools, should be as open and efficient as possible.
The current Rio Olympic Games, like the burning of fire, have inspired people's movement and awakened people's sense of participation.
Gillid got a lawyer's fee in competition with Merk's patent for hepatitis C.
According to the judgment of the U.S. District Judge, Gilled Science Company is entitled to legal fees arising from patent proceedings for hepatitis C with the pharmaceutical company Merck Group of the United States.
In June, after American judges discovered that Merk had committed unlawful acts, including false testimony and other immoral acts, Gilled was exempted from paying $200 million in compensation for two violations of Merk's patents by Sofebwe and Harvoni resulting from Gillid's best-selling drugs.
In the proceedings on Thursday, United States District Judge Beth Ramberson Freeman stated that Gillid would not have to bear the costs of the defence.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilled, who rules the new generation of Hepatitis C drug markets. Gilled drug cures more than 90% of hepatitis patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilid and Merk sued each other and both claimed that they were the owners of the laboratory work of Sofibwe, an active component of Gilid's drug.
The US-backed forces announced that they had taken Manbitt back from the Islamic State.
The force spokesman said on Friday that all remaining ISIS soldiers in the city had left, and the U.S.-backed forces had taken complete control of the northern city of Manbitt, near the Turkish border.
After the departure of the radicals who fled into the city, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping the city.
Sharon Darwish, of the military committee of the Syrian Allied Democratic Forces in Manbit, told Reuters that they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians abducted by militants.
He told Reuters, "Manbitt is under our control now, but we're still sweeping."
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2% of the federal tax.
Hillary Clinton published his 2105 tax return on Friday, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax.
In 2015, the Clinton and Clinton charity donations amounted to $1 million, most of which went to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton's speech fees amounted to nearly $5.3 million, while the former Secretary of State earned $3 million from the publisher Simon and Schuster on the basis of a book about her work in the State Department.
Bill Clinton's campaign partner, Senator Tim Kane of the Federal State of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, published a 10-year tax return.
In 2015, they paid 20.3% of the federal tax.
Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement that Hilary Clinton and Tim Kane would continue to be financial transparency poles.”
In contrast, Donald Trump concealed and retracted his previous commitment to publish tax returns on false grounds.
Although the law does not require it, it is customary for United States presidential candidates to make public their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyers used the IRS audit as a reason to refuse to publish tax returns.
Bill Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, on Twitter, said it was up to you and attached a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Counsel, indicated to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax returns until the audit had been completed.
Critics of Trump, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, stated that Trump ' s refusal to publish tax returns raised questions about its net capital value, charitable donations, commercial transactions and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton caught the issue in sharp criticism and released a video on Friday highlighting the high profile Democrats urging Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in an economic policy speech in Michigan.
She said to people, "For decades, he refused to publish his tax returns like any other presidential candidate."
According to Politicians News Network, in two years in the 1990s, Trump had barely paid a penny in taxes, and the business columnist of The New York Times quoted several tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, saying that the current situation might still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a major problem in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named Warren Buffett, a billionaire investor, a rule that guaranteed at least 30 per cent of taxes to those who earned more than $1 million a year.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Birkhshil Hasaway was based, where Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he was also being audited by IRS and that Trump's "fearing" was not a tax authority, but a voter.
The earliest tax returns published by the Clinton campaign team were in 2007.
The average federal tax rate paid between 2007 and 2014 by the Clintons, currently residing in Chabak, New York, was about 32 per cent, and the combined rate was about 40.5 per cent.
The 2015 tax returns of the Clintons show that, unlike most Americans, they earn only $100 in wages.
Their main investment was the low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons' dividends and interest earnings were $109,000.

Jewish film producers criticized the Berlin Hotel for removing Israeli phone code - Reuters News - according to the Arab client's "request"
A French film producer of Jewish origin revealed to the media that the Kebinski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli telephone codes and that hotel employees said that it was in accordance with the Arab customer's “request”, which provoked a wave of public opinion.
Claude Longzman, author of the Holocaust documentary The Shoah, expressed his disappointment at the Kebinski Hotel and published an open letter in the Frankfurt Report of Germany.
During the recent stay, Lunzman wanted to find Israel on the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can call directly from their rooms.
Israel disappeared in 2016 in Berlin, Germany's capital?
Rantzman wrote.
Instead, guests can call the Israeli telephone through the call centre of the Cabinsky Hotel.
In an attempt to find an explanation, the film producer asked about the hotel's front desk.
In his letter, Lunzman said that the answer he received from the front desk was “scare him”.
The hotel staff said that this was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Cabinsky Hotel".
The reason for doing so is to make the film producer angry.
Rantzman quoted the employee's words: "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they ask for Israel's code to be deleted."
According to the Nande Daily newspaper, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Haddas Handelsmann, called this a "surprising insult".
We were surprised to learn about the incident.
The matter itself is a great shame.
And what happened in Germany and that chain hotel is more embarrassing.
There is no need to explain this.
"We hope the hotel will come to the right conclusion," said the official.
The incident triggered intense discussion on the Internet, which everyone thought was a scandal.
Some believe that the Cabinsky Hotel is simply a “wow-down” to meet the demands of Arab customers.
Another post directs to the hotel, "What a shame," and states that this street, located on the famous Kudam Street, is near a synagogue.
According to the Sunglasses Weekly, the hotel quickly clarified all the charges, claiming that everything was “neglect” and expressing its “apology” to Lunzman.
The Nande daily quotes the representative of Cabinsky: "No direct order has ever been given to remove Israel from the fast dialling list".
The newspaper also indicated that Israeli codes had been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesting Brazilian students.
On Thursday, in São Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with the police in protest against the reform of the Government ' s public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesters.
The reason for the incident was that law enforcement officials tried to disperse the students, so the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in the march and expressed their dissatisfaction with the programmes.
To save money, the Governor of São Paulo, Okmin, plans to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students will be transferred.
Some students participating in the protests expressed their dissatisfaction with interim President Michel Temel through graffiti on the wall.
Just a few days before a recent protest, protesters collectively took to the streets in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the National Senate.
The Scottish biker, Kalm Skinner, won the gold medal of the bike and returned.
The Scottish bicycle rider, Kalm Skinner, helped the British triads to successfully defend the Olympic gold medal following the 2012 London Olympics last night at the Rio cycling group of men.
The 23-year-old Glasgow biker, who replaced his Scottish compatriot, Sir Chris Hoy, became the backbone of the team. Even the legendary biker was proud of him when young Skinner defeated the champion New Zealand team and returned with a reputation.
Four years ago, the British team sounded amazing, and Hoy took the fifth of his six Olympic medals.
The British team was only ranked sixth in the March London World Quarters Championship, and Hoy has since retired. Then the British team is brilliant again.
The problem with the British team during the Beijing Olympics and London Olympics was the replacement of Jamie Staff.
That's exactly what the convoy did when Schindler showed up.
Hoy's retirement also left a gap, and Chin Emady and Matt Clapton both wanted to fill it.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's coaches insisted that he be elected to the national team, and Skinner eventually did not live up to expectations.
Skinner's partner was Schindler and Kenny, who won the gold medal with Hoy four years ago. The three men updated the Olympic record in the qualification contest, but the score was overtaken by the New Zealand team in the first round.
And the three British bicycle races eventually defeated their rivals and won the gold medal.
Although Schinds is slightly behind, Kenny has taken the lead for the team, and Skinner has kept this lead to the end.
The change in strategy was the key to this reversal, and Schindler chose the larger flying wheels, so it was slower, which enabled Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to maintain the speed.
Hoys watched the game as a BBC commentator. Skinner, Kenny and Schindler saw him on the stage.
The 23-year-old Glasgow biker Skinner said, "This is amazing for me."
I'm just doing everything I can to make myself famous.
We created the Olympics record in the finals and defeated the world champion.
It's unbelievable.
There's nothing better than this victory.
After winning gold medals with Kenny and Hoy at the 2012 London Olympics, Schindler admitted to falling deliberately on the track in a bad start.
Later, he withdrew his comments, and the British counterparts were unable to appeal.
And this victory has no such problems.
Schindler said, "It's like London, where all stations are British flags."
We just formed a team three months ago.
We've lost many world champions, so it's amazing to be able to defend Olympic champions.
It was just a game and a gold medal for the seven British team who won the 10-site bicycle medal at the Beijing Olympics and London Olympics.
If that symbolizes the progress we have made over the past five months, then we will continue to succeed in the bicycle hall over the next five days.
According to Kenny's state, it was not impossible for him to repeat the three gold medals he won at an Olympic Games.
If that is the case, Behoi is 12 years old and will also be born on March 23rd. Kenny will have six gold medals and one silver medal.
This achievement is the same as that of Hoi.
Kenny's next battle is today's three-day race.
The 28-year-old Bolton said, "I'm going to focus on this game for a while.
Team races are always the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
Frankly speaking, a man wins a little lonely.
Schindler said, "If he can take the other two gold medals, then he should be awarded a jazz seal."
It was the only game that produced medals that day, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wilkins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doyle are pursuing the four-km team with the fastest achievement.
Their grades were 351.943.
The 2012 London Olympic gold medal winner has a world record of 351.659.
The first and final round (10.42 p.m.) will be held today in the second race, and Wilkins will undoubtedly be the focus of attention.
Yesterday he had an argument with the competition officer before the qualification competition, when the competition officer asked him to measure height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rosell Chand, Eleanor Barker and Kate Archibald from Milgay were promoted to the new world record of 413.260.
The British team, relying on its strong site bicycle team, took the initiative and won several medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
After displaying its absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British bicycle team was somewhat disappointed when it went to Rio.
A number of swings occurred during the period, including the resignation of technical director Sean Sutton in April on charges of gender discrimination and bullying, and the retirement of legends such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night of the bike house was enough to prove the legend that the British team will once again rise to the peak of the critical moment.
When the little life comes to this world, the parents are responsible for it, not only for the physical health of the child, but also for spiritual development, that is, education.
If the education of the children fails, even if the career succeeds, it will not make up for the lack of life and the failure of the family.
When a new life arrives, the new parents will need time and energy to look after and educate their children and be responsible for him.
And responsible, in addition to taking care of their bodies and making them healthy, is also teaching their children how to be human, how to be adult and how to succeed.
Good family education means that parents need to accompany their children regularly, to care for them, to take patient care of them, and to teach them to behave in a civilized manner, so that they can learn better and improve their intelligence.
A parent's words and actions affect the child's growth, and they imitate their parents, which is what they often say is that dragons, phoenix, the mouse's son will pierce, and the parents will do whatever they want with their children.
So parents need to be good role models in front of their children, to regulate their words and deeds, and to develop their own good qualities, all of which indirectly help children shape good hearts and make them better.
Amy is a smart and beautiful girl.
She's very active, able to get along well with her friends, and able to adapt to the environment.
But Amy had a little secret in her heart: she couldn't focus her attention for long on what she was going to do, what she was doing.
This secret has been with Amy for a long time. It's not a serious problem.
Even if she learns and works through scattered, modularized time, she can basically accomplish her tasks and achieve good results.
But when the task is heavy and the time is tight, Amy feels very painful and painful.
The resistance of individuals to self-exploitation and their emotional experience is aimed at not putting their self-awareness and self-esteem at risk.
There are also behavioral psychologists who interpret resistance as an insubordination on the part of individuals to correct their behaviour.
I tried to get Amy to do an exercise to calm herself down by breathing lightly, to feel the pain.
And once she left that trapped situation, she felt relaxed and regained her freedom.
One of the 63-year-old vagrants, Han and another hanshaw, had an argument after which he slashed him to death with a knife.
Before the death of one of the Korean claims, both he and one of the homeless Hunshaw lived on the ground in a alley in the East Side, at a distance of more than 20 metres.
According to Han, on the day of the crime, they were asked by friends to drink together, and they had two quarrels with each other during and after dinner.
Han said he was afraid that Shaw would hit him, and he picked up a fruit knife from the garbage dump and stunned it to death.
In court, the victim ' s family demanded compensation for funeral expenses, death damages, etc. for a total of more than 530,000 yuan.
Uber entered the Taiwan market for four years and had a considerable impact on the traditional local taxi industry.
On August 12, the Taiwan Joint News reported that more than 100 taxis had bypassed Taiwan's “administrative court” to protest on the morning of 12, leading to serious traffic paralysis in the surrounding area.
However, the director of the Taipei City Drivers' Union, Jung Liqah, said that Uber had been on the stage for four years, that the authorities had only met at the end of the month and that the drivers could no longer wait.
The government, however, said nothing and kept it waiting.
A law-abiding taxi driver belonging to the bottom labourer, who competes with the unbridled Uber, feels deluded by the authorities.
Original title: 2,000 chickens from Jiangsu One Farm were arrested by the court and sold without permission.
After the judgement came into force, Wang Xiao applied to the Xiangyang court for enforcement because Li Xiao failed to comply automatically with his obligations as determined by the judgement.
On 16 October 2014, the court of Xiaoyang issued a civil ruling, ruling that only 2000 eggs and chickens in all of Li ' s farms should be seized, and that they could not be transferred or sold without permission.
After receiving the detention decision, Li-Xiao sold some of the eggs detained in the farm without the permission of the court in Xiaoyang.
At the time of the survey by the Public Security Bureau of Xiangyang County on 8 March 2015, there were only 142 eggs and chickens in the farm.
The journalist learned on August 12 that the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022 and the Winter Paralympics Organizing Committee issued an announcement that the Beijing Winter Olympic Committee inherits intellectual property rights such as the Beijing Winter Olympic Committee logo, logo, etc.
No one shall use the logo or logo of the Beijing Winter Olympic Committee for commercial purposes without the permission of the Beijing Winter Olympic Committee.
The head of the Industry Coordination Division of the National Development Reform Commission pointed out here today that excess steel production capacity is a global problem.
In recent years, our capacity utilization rate has been higher than the global average and higher than in countries and regions such as the United States and Europe.
We have taken resolute and effective measures to address excess capacity, and the results are gradually becoming apparent.
The head pointed out that the Party Central State Department attached great importance to the global problem of overcapacity in steel production.
The departments and regions are actively following up on the deployment of the State Council and are seriously working on reducing the crude steel production capacity by about 45 million tons this year.
From the point of view of our national circumstances, we do not encourage the export of steel, but rather take a series of practical measures to control the export of steel.
The Officer-in-Charge stressed that international trade in steel products was essentially a market act and an autonomous choice derived from the needs of importing countries, and consumers took into account factors such as value for money for products.
The implementation of trade protection measures would not help to address the root causes of the development of the global steel industry, but would, on the contrary, only have a further impact on the international trade order.
Turning to debt, the Officer-in-Charge stressed that debt resolution was an important issue that needed to be properly addressed in the process of resolving excess capacity.
Because of the size and scope of the assets of steel companies, the debt relationships of some enterprises are complex and may create regional risks if not disposed of properly.
According to the head of the department, in recent years, as the downward pressure on the economy has increased, the overall demand for society has gradually diminished, the productivity of some industries has declined and the production and operation of enterprises has become more difficult.
Some enterprises are unable to adapt to changes in the market environment and production operations are difficult to sustain or even close down, but are constrained by a number of institutional factors and have more obstacles to exit in a market-oriented manner, becoming “zombie enterprises”.
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of factor resource use, increases the costs of social management and hinders the establishment of a level playing field market environment.
The main reasons for the loss are the same as the plight of the global steel industry — weak market demand and low capacity utilization.
The main approach of the country is market mechanisms, economic instruments and the rule of law, and the Government is primarily working to ensure a fair and equitable market order for workers and social stability.
The chief stressed that the next step was to stay firm and keep holding on to the ability to produce and ensure that the target of 100 million to 150 million tons of crude steel production could be addressed over five years.
In the afternoon of 10, as soon as the Chinese tourist police opened their eyes at the Red Square in Moscow, they drew immediate attention. Chinese tourists waved with surprises, and locals and foreign tourists could not stop visiting.
On the same day, members of the tourism police unit of the Sanya City Public Security Bureau of Hainan Province, China's first professional tourism police force, came to the Red Square in Moscow to exchange and study with the local tourism police on duty.
The Moscow Tourism Police split into three teams on operational patrol in Redfield, Nikoliski Walk Street, Gum Department store, etc., and the Chinese Tourism Police followed the mission together, and the entire process lasted more than an hour.
In her 20s this year, she knows English and Spanish, and she just joined the tourist police force last year.
On his way, he carefully observed the words and actions of his Russian counterpart and interacted with her from time to time.
When Spanish tourists came to consult, the Moscow Tourist Police gave each other a patient explanation in fluent Spanish, which impressed Wang Ice.
"Moscow Tourist Police know foreign languages and some have two or more, which is very touching for us."
“Hainnan, as an international tourist island, is gradually focusing on attracting international tourists, and we want to improve our ability to match the status of an international tourist island.”
On that day, the Chinese Tourism Police went to Moscow City Tourism Police Brigade Station to interact with their Russian counterparts before following their studies.
"I often deal with Chinese tourists, and it's a pleasure to see them travel to Russia."
"The question they usually ask is how the road goes, where a monument is, how to rent it, how to get back to the hotel."
The head of the Moscow City Tourism Police Brigade, Resakov, said that the urban environment and the tourist atmosphere in Moscow had become increasingly good in recent years, and the attraction of foreign tourists was increasing.
To adapt to tourism development needs, a tourism police force was set up in July 2014 to patrol and secure major attractions and assist and channel tourists.
Currently, all Moscow tourist police officers are proficient in English and, in part, Spanish and German.
The police force divides them into nine groups according to the level of foreign languages, and takes two classes a week to study self-defense moves, laws and regulations and foreign languages.
"There are two tourist policemen who are now starting to learn Chinese and already speak well, and we're going to continue to raise their Chinese skills," Rezakov says.
Rezakov told journalists that the Moscow Tourism Police had gained some experience since its formation and hoped to inspire Sanya colleagues.
He believes that cooperation between the Russian and Chinese police services will enhance the sense of security of citizens travelling to each other's countries.
"Moscow tourist police recruitments, policing models, equipment and good interaction with tourists have given us a lot of inspiration," Chen Xiaokun said.
Chinese and new Internet journalists have combed and found that at least nine provinces and cities, Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian and Beijing, have issued regulations for the implementation of residence permits.
With regard to the conditions for obtaining a residence permit, it is generally proposed that the above mentioned areas require residence for more than six months and meet one of the conditions for legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence and continuous schooling.
Chinese and new online journalists noted that the range of public services and facilities provided in some areas has been expanded in comparison with the national version of the regulations with respect to the treatment offered by residence permits, which varies from place to place.
All of these areas have increased the ease with which children can participate locally in the Middle and Higher Examinations if the relevant conditions are met.
In addition, many places, such as Beijing, have clearly requested that the provision of public services and facilities be gradually expanded and regularly announced to society.
For example, Fujian proposed that the scope of the public services and facilities enjoyed by the holders of residence permits should be announced to society at least once every three years.
The Temporary Regulation on Residence Permits stipulates that the public security organ shall produce and issue a residence permit within 15 days of the day when the residence permit is processed.
Most regions agree with the national version regarding the time frame for issuing certificates, i.e. within 15 days.
Hebei made it clear that a residence permit must be issued within three working days from the date of receipt of the complaint by the public security police station of the place of residence if the conditions for the application are fulfilled and the materials are complete.
Jiangxi stipulates that the public security organ shall produce and issue a residence permit within five working days from the date of the hearing, if the conditions for obtaining a residence permit are fulfilled and the documentation is complete.
In accordance with the Temporary Regulations on Residence Permits, the aforementioned areas clearly applied for a residence permit for the first time and were exempted from receiving the fees of the documented workers.
For example, Sichuan requires that all public security police stations or commissioned community service agencies in different regions strictly enforce approved fee lines and rates, and firmly prohibit over-extensive, over-standard or by-road charges.
On 27 July 2016, Chen Yangxia, former Secretary of the Dingnan Cantonal Committee of the same state, reported to the Provincial Disciplinary Committee and served as head of the Party ' s political control room (in the rank of deputy director for a trial period of one year).
The wine that was used in the evening was provided by Lei Yu personally, and the other costs were borne by someone in Liu.
The Jiangxi Provincial Disciplinary Committee informed that Chen Yangxia and Cheng Ziqiang, among others, organized and accepted an invitation to eat at a private meeting, in violation of the eight provisions of the Central Code and in violation of the Party ' s discipline.
Borgba ate two yellow cards in the Italian cup last season and automatically banned one game according to the rules.
Although he has already turned back to the British Super, the British Foot has still extended his cumulative ban on competition to the British Super Bowl.
As a result, in the August 14 guest fight against Bernmouth, Borgba will watch the wall, and his return to the Alliance's premiere will be extended until the 20th match with Southampton.
As the first round of the 12th new show in 2014, Saric will officially land at the NBA next season and join the 76th team in Philadelphia.
As a young European player, many fans didn't know him well, but through the Olympic Games, it was believed that Sarich's performance was very impressive.
During the last Croatian race against Spain, Saric succeeded in sealing Paul Gazor's last attempt to drag the race into the add-on basket.
Recently, the Commander of the 76th Brigade, Bret-Brown, gave Sarić a very high rating, and the head of the horse-thrower thought he saw the shadow of Manu-Ginobiri in her youth.
Obviously, Saric has shown his talent and has made 76 people look forward to him.
In the first two competitions in Croatia during this Olympic Games, Saric received 24 points, 17 baskets and 12 aid strikes.
During the first half of the game, Saric demonstrated his ability to open space in the presence of his teammates, and he was shot in the basket outside the three-point line.
Although the 76 people are currently hoarding a large number of talented young players, they do not have the outer-line capability of Saric.
The number of insiders who can do this in the NBA field today, from caps to launching long-range rapid attacks and completing the offensive.
Since the beginning of the Olympic Games, Saric has received 13 points in each of the three games, eight baskets and five succour attacks, with a comprehensive performance.
James has signed two successive 1+1 contracts since he decided to return to the Knights in the summer of 2014.
As NBA enters its final year, James will be at the forefront of collective agreement negotiations as Vice President of the NBA Staff Council.
In view of the huge increase in Alliance revenues, thanks to the new TV transmission agreement and the fight between the boss and the players over how to deal with the money, the outside world fears that the NBA will stop next summer.
But for James, he didn't have to worry about becoming a free player next summer, because he had renewed a three-year contract with the Knights.
No matter when the 2017-18 season officially begins, James is in the contract.
The mobile phone market has also hit the tide of small screens since the iPhoneSE exclaimed.
Not long ago, Nubia also launched its first work in the Z11 series: Nubia Z11mini.
Nubia Z11mini has continued its consistent excellent photo photogenesis, equipped with a 5.0 inch screen, easy-to-use back-to-print identification, and has achieved a remarkable experience of use.
Z11mini, a small screen camera phone just listed under the nubia flag, dropped by $200, from the original $1499 to $1,299.
In terms of appearance, Nubia Z11mini uses a 5-inch 1080-P screen, which is still the classic design of the Small Red Circle below the front.
Middle frame is metal material, the bottom of which is symmetrically designed and configured for Type-C data interfaces.
The future of Portland Smelter is full of uncertainty due to the cancellation of the electricity contract.
Since the power company that supplied power to the plant disclosed that a factory owner would terminate a supply contract, thereby rendering all supply contracts ineffective, the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria and hundreds of factory workers are now facing an uncertain future.
This initiative took place after the Victorian government decided not to continue paying subsidies to guarantee the operation of the plant.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will expire in November.
Two thousand workers at the Aluminium Company Portland factory may face unemployment.
Up to 2,000 people may lose their jobs, either directly or indirectly, once the factory is closed.
And since the plant accounts for about 10% of Victoria's total electricity output, it may also have a chain reaction.
In 2014, Aluminum shut down the Hanry Corner Smelting Plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesi power plant last year.
The Aluminium company Portland Smelter is currently losing and facing the risk of closure.
This was done after predictions of the plant over the next few years, initially because of the strong Australian dollar and, more recently, because of the price of factory products.
AGL provides electricity to this large aluminium smelter through the old Eyan power plant in the Rutloub Valley. The company predicts that the owners of the other three plants will also terminate their agreement.
The largest shareholder of the plant was a joint venture between USA and Aluminium Oxyco, while China’s Chinese group and Japan’s Maru Hong Shrine Society also held a small share.
The joint venture said, “AGL expects that the Portland plant will continue to operate, meaning that the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand.”
AGL indicated that these contracts were “flash contracts” that should have been in effect since November 2016.
The termination period of the contracts was 12 months, so they would be terminated in 2017.
The power company said, "So, AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue for the 2017 fiscal year."
Any potential revenue impact on AGL since the 2018 fiscal year is currently subject to optimism in futures markets about the price of bulk electricity generation.
AGL stated that the company had written down the contract value of $187 million in the “termination of activity expectations”.
Aluminum stated that the decision to terminate these contracts “would not affect its ability to operate the smelter or guarantee its electricity supply”.
The American company indicated that it had signed a 20-year contract with the old Eyan in 2010, which would have come into effect in November of this year, but did not explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago factory near Newcastle will close down because of the bad economic situation in the industry.
In response to the analyst's comments earlier this week, the AGL operator, Steven Michaelson, said Portland had about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and the Tomago plant had about 900 megawatts per year.
If two factories close down, the demand for electricity markets will be significantly reduced.
He said, "This is not good news for us as an electricity company."
The Community Law Center keeps 160,000 people out of the house every year.
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are denied access to community law centres every year. Funding for this service is already stretched, and it is now facing further financial cuts.
In Queensland, three out of five people were denied free legal advice and representation services, most of them elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and people without resources to fight unfair evictions.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limit value and is now facing further financial cuts.
Since June next year, federal funding for these legal centres will be reduced by another 30 per cent.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Centre, said that according to the latest National Community Association Law Centre survey report, thousands of people were denied access every year.
Mr. Farrell said that the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change existing decisions.
He said, "The community law centre in Queensland has been under-funded for a long time, meaning that thousands of people will not be able to access the essential services they need."
Those who need to stay away from violence, those who carry huge debts that cannot be repaid, those who face a breakdown of their families, and the oppressed workers face problems at the legal level, and the report shows that they cannot obtain the help they need.
The federal government will cut another 30% from June 2017, meaning that thousands of vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to face complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Member of Parliament Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately rescind these cutbacks so that people can get the help they need when facing legal problems.
Last year, the state government pledged to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
Attention must now be paid to community law centres and their responsiveness to the needs of the community, and the White Lakzi Government must be invested in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team is being prosecuted for pulling their guns.
New York: Trump's campaign team was indicted for not acting after the head of Northern California had pulled a gun at a staff member while driving a jeep in February.
Vincent Bodini, former software trainer for the state campaign team, described the incident in the state courthouse in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bodini said that he had hoped that the matter would be resolved internally, but after several months of waiting, he realized that it was “not possible”.
According to Bodini's description, the head of the man named Earl Phillips "drawed out a pistol, put his right index finger on the board, and pointed his gun at Vincent's kneebone."
After complaining to the leadership of local and regional electoral teams, Bodini learned from the file that at least four others had experienced the same thing.
Bodini said in his complaint: "The fact that there was no shooting doesn't mean there will be no harm."
Just two days before the incident, the Republican presidential candidate in North Carolina told the crowd that if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was elected and selected the judge she loved, then the "substantiator of the Second Amendment", i.e. the gun holder and the gun lover, might take action, and that statement provoked anger.
Trump's campaign team said that the media was taking his words out of context and that he did not advocate violence.
Bodini, in his complaint, demanded that the campaign team pay compensation for its lack of oversight and that Philip pay compensation for his assault, assault and psychological injury.
The Trump spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to this news.
Couldn't reach Philip.
According to WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte, Philip recently left the campaign team.
His consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services did not respond immediately to calls.
The electoral team of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is controversial.
In this case, both parties ran for President Bodini and Trump, 16-CS-14300, General Division of the High Court of Mecklenburg County (Charlott).
The UK must convey the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport.
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our community, London and the country as a whole.
For me, this is Heathrow ' s charm, just as during the 2012 London Olympics we did everything possible to ensure that our countries and regions could benefit from these events.
The Olympic Games will greatly benefit Stratford and the Eastern Sector.
And we will once again benefit the region by creating opportunities for local people and businesses around Heathrow.
For our local community alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeship jobs, 40,000 new jobs and free young people around the airport from unemployment.
As in the run-up to the 2012 London Olympics, some consider Heathrow ' s expansion to be too large.
I was told that Britain will not be able to prepare for the Olympic Games and that we will be humiliated in front of the entire world.
Doubters were wrong about the 2012 Olympics, and their doubts about the Heathrow project will also prove wrong.
Although obstacles always emerge that need to be overcome, Heathrow is addressing every problem facing him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not a few.
The expansion project will create up to 180,000 new jobs and generate £211 billion in economic growth, leaving a legacy of technology and employment wealth around the airport and throughout Britain.
We have an excellent Heathrow team. The team is on time and within budget to complete 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment projects, including the T5 terminal, which was elected the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years, and the T2 terminal, which is located between the two of the world's busiest runways.
Now they're going to build the third runway with 16 billion pounds of private investment.
Britain successfully organized the 2012 London Olympics, and I believe the Heathrow airport expansion project will also be a great success.
The time has come for us to pass on the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport so that we can protect our future and create a technological and employment wealth that makes Britain proud.
Lord Paul Dayton is Chairman of the Heathrow Airport Board of Directors and former Business Counsellor of the British Treasury.
A woman killed herself on the Swiss highway.
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
The woman who tried to commit suicide was hit by several cars on the highway on Thursday morning. The police are now looking for witnesses.
The accident occurred on the A1 highway near Morzh, Vau County, in the morning of Thursday.
The Vaud state police said that a woman was lying on the road "in despair" at night and was driven by a number of cars.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman whose behaviour was clearly suicidal. She was run over by a number of cars, including a van.
The woman died instantly.
The police revealed that many of the drivers involved had been investigated, but some of them had still not been confirmed. The police are now calling on them and witnesses of the accident to come for an investigation.
Mr. Gilles Hoofsteiner indicated to the Geneva Tribune that criminal investigations had now been initiated, which was a regular process of such incidents.
However, it is not yet known whether drivers will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
"This will be determined by the prosecutor," said Hofstadter.
On the basis of the results of two other similar cases in the last five years, the driver will not be responsible.
According to the newspaper, both cases were caused by people walking on the freeway late in the night. The final verdict was that the driver could not have expected a pedestrian to cross the freeway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with negligent death and charged with hitting and killing a man on the A1 highway near Payene in August 2014.
The court was informed that the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking alcohol.
After the investigation, the judge stated that the driving behaviour of the female police officer at the time was completely legal, that the man appeared on the road "unfortunately and unexpectedly", and that the female police officer called the emergency number afterwards.
Anyone who can provide information about this accident near Morzh on Thursday should call 021,644,8346 or 021,644,4444 to contact the police.
NASA climate model: Venus used to be suitable for human habitation
According to NASA's prediction of a new climate model, Venus was suitable for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA Goddard Space Research developed a model to explore the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was used to determine whether Venus, with high surface temperature, no water and full of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, had ever had an environment similar to the Earth.
Previously, scientists thought that Venus was slow to spin because its atmosphere was thicker.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thiner, Earth-like atmosphere and was also slow to rotate at that time.
The model also shows the early terrain of Venus.
Venus may have more dry areas than Earth, but there was enough water and geographic change to breed life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early on, the light on Venus was 30% darker than on Earth.
At the press conference, Anthony Del Genio, scientist at the Godard Space Research Institute, explained: "In the model simulation of the Godard Space Research Institute, Venus slowly rotates its side of the day for nearly two months."
This warms the surface and produces rain that can form thick clouds that block most of the sun's heat for the ground like an umbrella.
The result of the simulation is that the average climate temperature of Venus is actually a few degrees lower than the Earth today.
The model simulated the evolution of Venus in close proximity to previous planetary scientists.
Although life may have existed on Venus, Venus was exposed to excessive temperatures and ultraviolet light over billions of years.
The ocean on the planet evaporates and the water vapour burns out of ultraviolet light.
With the escape of hydrogen, only the thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and the deadly greenhouse gas effect have been left, thus forming the Venus that we know today.
Researchers published the simulation results of the new Venus Climate Model in the Geophysical Research Newsletter.
Patrick Roy resigned as head of the avalanche team.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from his position as head coach and vice president of the Colorado avalanche hockey team, stating that he had no say at the team decision-making level.
Joe Sachs, Managing Director of the Executive Vice-President of Colorado, confirmed the news and said that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
In a statement, 50-year-old Roy said, "In the last three years, I have performed my duties as master coach and vice president of the Colorado avalanche team with vigour, passion and determination."
I've been thinking hard all summer about how to improve this team and make it stronger.
To that end, the goals of the principal coach and vice president must be consistent with the goals of the club.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
At present, however, these conditions have not been met.
Satchis hired Roy on 23 May 2013 and thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sarchis said, "Patrick told me today about his decision."
We thank him for his contribution to the club and hope that he will be well in the future.
Roy was nominated as the best coach of the Jack Adams Award League during the first season of the Avalanche team in 2013-14.
He helped the club get 112 points, ranking first in the middle sector. However, the Colorado team was eliminated in the first round of the post-season race and lost its hand in the last two years.
In the 2015-16 season, the avalanche team scored 39 out of 39 and 39 out of 4, and eventually lost its second card qualification in the Western Great League.
Roy won four Stanley Cups as a celebrity gatekeeper and two for the Canadians and the avalanche team in Montreal.
North Sea oilfield workers stopped the strike and went on negotiating.
The chief negotiator said that workers in the North Sea oil fields had stopped the wage strike and that the parties to the dispute had started a new round of negotiations.
There were several strikes on the North Sea oil platform operated by the Dutch Royal Shell against the oilfield service company Wood Group.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the current dispute resolution process."
Starting earlier next week, we will hold a number of full-day meetings in the coming weeks to revisit these issues.
The trade union stated that its recent action was to protest the possibility of a 30 per cent pay cut, which was the first action taken by the union in 25 years.
Wood Group has reduced North Sea contractors' remuneration by about 9% this year due to market pressure.
Prior to this pay cut, the company reduced the remuneration of marine contractors by 10 per cent in 2014.
The company said that a further salary cut would help the company survive the depression.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries because the company needs to streamline its operations when it merges with the British Energy Corporation British Gas Group.
Energy companies are facing pressure from lower crude oil prices and the British de-European decision in June.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute of the North Sea generation.
He said that the North Sea was vital to the region ' s economy.
Dave said in his statement: "In the North Sea and in the country as a whole, we need an economy that serves the majority rather than the minority."
In 2016, new North Sea projects are expected to spend no more than $1.4 billion, while the average project expenditure for the past five years has reached approximately $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of the stars of the Anjole.
The latest mission of the Capelle Space Telescope helped astronomers collect the most complete star rotation speed of the Orient Group.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the star of the constellation has different rotation speeds and connections with the composition of the planet.
Luza Rebur, research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the Pasadena Institute of Technology, said at a press conference: "We want to understand better the relationship between star quality, age, and even the history of our solar system by comparing our results with other clusters of stars."
The Orient group is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many stars in the constellation were born some 125 million years ago and are now just reaching adulthood.
They have reached the highest rotation rate in their lifetime.
When the maximum rotation speed is reached, these mature stars emit large amounts of star wind.
When these star winds pass through the magnetic field of the star, they have a brake effect on the star.
As the age of stars increases, their rotation starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time of the appearance of identifiable star blacks (like the sun blacks).
The latest spin-rate dataset indicates that larger stars are being rotated slower than smaller stars.
Rabel compares stars to dancers, and larger dancers rotate at a slower pace than smaller dancers.
Leble said, "In the Ballet Show of the Orchestra, we find that slowly moving stars tend to be of greater mass, while the fastest moving stars tend to be the lightest stars."
Due to the proximity of the Orient group, it could be the ideal cosmopolitan laboratory to compare the mass of stars with the speed of rotation.
Rabel said, "The Angry Stars have laid the foundation for a two-way rotation theory model for young and old stars."
We still have a lot of knowledge to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spins and "take up their dancing shoes".
Rabel and her colleagues elaborated on their latest analysis of the rotation speed of the Angry Stars in three new papers. These papers will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
Jung Jianjun, Chief of the Water Management Section of South Lake Park, explained that the bottom of the South Lake was more than 10 metres deep and that people who did not understand the water under the circumstances were likely to be at risk.
"Although the South Lake Rescue Team is very professional, it is hoped that the vast number of rowing tourists will wear life jackets, refrain from illegal actions on the lake and play safely." Cheng Jianjun said.
The surrounding village has a unique marine environment and is host to two major recreational tourism resources, natural and human.
"But the individual owners who bought the spaces in the area, fearing that doing so would affect their rental price of the spaces, and doubting that others are self-serving, have been involved in the destruction behind their backs, leading to the suspension of the renovation of the spaces."
There is still a diversity of views as to when the potatoes will be introduced by whom.
In the current more mainstream view, the introduction of cassava has three main lines.
The most influential and widespread of the three routes introduced by the cassava were Chen Zhenlong, introduced by the Philippines into Fuzhou.
The Beijing Municipal Office for the Management of Social Groups will be conducting a special inspection of the use of the unified receipt of membership fees for social groups as soon as possible.
Inspections are divided into self-checking units and focused spot checks.
The relevant head of the municipal association office explained that the scope of the inspection included the organization of a social group receiving a unified receipt of membership fees from the municipal association in 2013-2015.

Civil rights groups have issued travel warnings against Missouri.
As a result of Missouri ' s discriminatory policies and racist attacks, the American Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued travel warnings to colored people preparing to travel to Missouri.
"The NAACP Missouri Travel Consultation, which came into effect on August 28, 2017, called on all African American travellers, tourists and Missouri to pay special attention and be extremely cautious when travelling in Missouri, due to the recent series of suspicious racial incidents in Missouri, to inform this group's statement."
NAACP noted that a recently adopted Missouri state law made it more difficult to win discrimination suits, and that the state ' s enforcement also targeted minority groups to some extent, which prompted the organization to issue travel warnings.
Violations of civil rights are happening to people.
They were questioned about their skin colour by parking, beaten or killed, "Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel told The Kansas City Star.
"We have received an unprecedented number of complaints."
This was the first such warning issued by the organization against a state in the United States.
The organization cited the ethnic defamation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tori Sanders, a 28-year-old black male from Tennessee.
earlier this year, Saunders died under suspicious circumstances. He spent fuel fuel while travelling in Missouri and was detained without charge by Missouri police.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showed that "Black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be stopped and examined than white people".
Chapel said, "The consultation was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri."
"People need to be prepared to travel to Missouri with bail money, or to let relatives know that they travel within the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI hate crime report plan, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; according to the crime volume, the state ranked 16th in the country.
Travel warnings are also a response to the new Missouri law, which will make it more difficult to prosecute housing or employment-discriminatory businesses.
Previously, the states of the United States had passed immigration law enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to detain immigration offenders, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) indicated that it would increase the number of racial lawsuits and issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the United States Government against other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have adopted this approach in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.

BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city: making the foreigners feel like they're living in a new era.
The reference news network reported on January 18 that Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly becoming today's modern city of charm.
China's capital has an Internet that is fast and amazingly fast, has sophisticated technologies like face-to-face recognition software, has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has unmatched internationalized energy, and it is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners rich in exploration.
According to the BBC website on January 16, German expatriate Clemens Sethi said, "If I succeed there, I will succeed anywhere in the future." He quoted the singer Frank Sinatra to sing the words of New York City.
"If Sinatra survives today, he'll probably sing about cities like Beijing." Seth, who is the creative director of Traveler Archives, said. He said that living in this city would make you feel like a "new age" and always keep up with the tide.
Simon Norton, who lived in England but recently lived in Beijing, published an article on the personal blog website 4 Corners7 Seas, saying, "People generally have a feeling of being at the centre of something big, which is hard to explain, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it looks like and want to witness it."
It was reported that the city ' s high-quality high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment made daily life easier than ever before.
Andy Peña Fuert, from Manila, who is currently the deputy editor-in-chief of the Beijing Children's website, says: "Beijing is rapidly turning into a cashless society, and the Internet integrates traditional wallet functions on smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions."
The report states that smart phones are only the beginning of Beijing ' s technological ambition, that facial recognition software has become widely available and that many mobile phone applications use this technology for bank transfers and payments, for access to apartments and offices, and even for verification of the identity of the drivers of the Internet.
Beijing also recently announced plans to invest 13.8 billion yuan in building an artificial intelligence technology park, where more than 400 enterprises will settle after completion, focusing on the development of various artificial intelligence technologies from biometrics to autopilot.
Food is also at the heart of many major festivals in China over the years, and participation in these celebrations has been promoted by foreigners. Spring festivals are the most important social and economic festivals and one of the most easy days for foreigners to participate.
Sethi said, "I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year's Day. It's equally important to clean up apartments and put a new year's blessing on the home door. On New Year's Eve, all family members will come together to eat a great meal, then watch until midnight and greet the New Year with a radiant flame. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and family is a real opportunity for integration."
According to reports, the number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but the language barriers in China and the ease of communication among expatriates can easily be used as pretexts for their incomplete integration into local culture.
Seth said, "Some foreigners have been living in China for many years, but there has been little experience with their host country. If your initial attempts to reach out to Chinese people have not been successful, then it is easy for you or easier for you to get along with other foreigners.
In these so-called "foreign bubbles", "foreign bubbles" mean foreigners mix only among foreigners and do not touch local people and local culture - interpreter notes), foreigners hug in their own community, eat in Western restaurants, and friends only foreigners.
The simplest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin — which is simpler than one might imagine.
Seth said, "The Chinese private classes for the last two hours of the week or the introductory radio drama should suit everyone's busy schedule."
Even learning a few classic short sentences would help with shopping, ordering meals in restaurants or chatting in taxis.
It was reported that persistent air pollution was also a fact of daily life, although in recent years the Government had made efforts to contain some problems.
Residents stressed the importance of outdoor activities during the often lighter warm months of pollution, using the blue days as an opportunity to tangle in long-standing alleys or to explore popular Japan Parks.
Norton said, "Beijing is the Chinese city that can discover the most things on the surface, and you can find great artistic and musical events, angry night life, historical wonders, super-modern commercial zones and ancient holocausts."
The report argues that the impediments of ageing to the growth of human capital are increasingly evident, especially in the northeast, where ageing contributes an average of 1,280 per cent annually to the growth of human capital.

If the antimonopoly charge is found, Google faces a fine of up to 10 per cent of its global revenue, amounting to approximately $7.4 billion.
Google has not yet commented on this immediately.
Google is also facing an EU investigation because of its bias towards home shopping services in search results.

A picture shows the legal status of bitcoin around the world.
Abstract: In addition to the price-backs that are naturally triggered by speculative properties, the fall in the current round of digital currency is also related to the “hosting enemy” - regulatory risk.
From visual maps, Eastern countries have a more conservative attitude vis-à-vis bitcoin than the West, countries with the global majority are still looking at digital monetary legitimacy, and represent a “black swan risk” that remains high.
*This paper is from Wall Street News (Web ID:wall Streetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more wonderful information, please visit Walltreetcn.com or download Wall Street News News APP.*
The global digital currency, headed by bitcoin, has been bled out since this week, with regulatory storms in major Bitcoin markets such as China, Korea and the European Union. Bitcoin prices fell by $10,000 on Tuesday, and the largest single-day fall in three years.
In addition to the price-backs that are naturally triggered by speculative properties, the fall in the current round of digital currency is also related to the constant “hosting enemy” - regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, the big visual data site HowMuch.net produced a map showing the legitimacy and degree of regulation of Bitcoin across the globe.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legitimate market of bitcoin; orange yellow represents the neutral market, although it has not publicly legalized bitcoin status, but there are no major restrictions on use; light pink represents the restricted market, where local governments try to use digital money through red-line policies or regulation; dark pink represents the country defined as illegal; grey is the country that has not yet been evaluated.
(The above graph was drawn by HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15)
According to the article, the traditional attitude of the Eastern countries of Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West, as can be seen from the green mass distribution in Central Africa.
Russia is currently the largest country to define Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets in Bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries in which Bitcoin has not yet been evaluated and has not yet introduced relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of bitcoin, i.e. the distribution of green pieces is more concentrated.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America with respect to the bitcoin appear to be distinctly divided, and the distribution of the colour blocks in the above-mentioned regions is more mixed.
Of these, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil are legitimate bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, etc. have some restrictions on their transactions and use, and more Latin American countries have yet to make a sound.
Combined with the above data, a total of 99 countries (or 40 per cent) of the 246 countries that have been counted globally have no restrictions on the transactions and use of bitcoin, i.e. green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3 per cent) were restricted markets (light pink), 10 countries (or 4 per cent) defined Bitcoin as illegal (deep pink), and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) did not treat digital monetary information more (grey).
This suggests that countries that make up the global majority (53%, more than half) are still watching the legitimacy of the digital currency headed by bitcoin within their borders, and that the “black swan risk” of bitcoin remains significant, as some of these countries may eventually make legislative decisions to limit the number currency.
The article argues that the emerging category of digital currencies has not yet been fully understood by global regulators and may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made a pronouncement.
Although Bitcoin's “human face” has grown exponentially since last year, it does not represent the interest of all countries, and some countries may fear that local French currency will be threatened as a result, or more so that digital money will be used by criminal organizations.
Wall Street sights have written a detailed summary of international regulatory news against Bitcoin since last week, including China's beginning to crack down on online centralized services platforms and mobile apps in off-site exchanges, South Korea's still considering closing down the digital currency exchange, the EU's belief that bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of "bringing back their blood."
The editor-in-chief of Wall Street selects the year of digital money from the year of reading the headlines 2018: The global maternal opening of the digital currency? The year 2018 will be the year of digital money of the global central bank, either from the point of view of regulation, acceptance/criticisation or adoption.
Big powers like Russia have criticized the legitimacy of Bitcoin, but have also been trying to give way to the official issuance of digital money.
On January 8, Xinhua's Madrid electricity (reporter Xie Woo-ji), Barcelona's new aid Kutinio 8 showed up in Nokamp for the first time wearing a pizza jersey.
Kutiño passed a medical check-up in Bassa that morning and signed with Basa President Bartoméu on a contract that will expire in summer 2023.
He then appeared as a Bassa player in front of nearly 7,000 fans in Nokamp.
According to the Spanish media, Curtiño's total transfer fee, amounting to Euro160 million (approximately RMB 7.77 (Euro 1), is the first price for the Basa Club and the history of Nishika.
As Kutiño is still wounded, he will have to rest for nearly 20 days before he can meet himself in a virgin show with a pizza jersey.
What else is sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statue.
Americans, like anyone else, agree with this. So Saddam Hussein of Paradise Square in Baghdad was deliberately pushed down in 2003.
Stephen Miller, as one of the key think tanks of the Trump government, must know what happens when Jim Acosta, of CNN, is actively debating the President's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
If he did, then a group of cruise ship owners and liberal followers would surely eat him alive.
But he did attack the meaning of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was carved on the base in 1903 (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller denounced Acosta, "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America's freedom to light the world...
The poem you refer to, which was added later, not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
In fact, Miller was right, but, as he himself said, it's not really about history.
This relates to the modern echo of the language of Lazarus, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowd of people who want to breathe freely,/the suffering reject your crowded beaches."
There is no "rejection of the suffering man" at a time when our screen has become more dazzling.
Miller didn't do literary reviews, and he made it clear that these people would not be popular in the Trump era of America.
This conflict over the meaning of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus and her friends, who engraved her poems on the base after her death, are well aware of the highly political nature of the behaviour in which they are participating.
The purpose of the sculpture is to express the link between French and American Republicanism through the ancient classic metaphor of being a woman of the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poem, the image of a woman was no longer abstract, and she wanted to make a sound.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of exile.
The poem, combined with the painting, was a successful feminist coup d'état and a devastating blow to American nativeism.
Just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers always wanted it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker, Rush Limbagh, was a temporary baptizer of Trump, who in 2010 thought that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, but that he was an early neo-conservative who brought America's intellectual flame to a foolish world: "The Statue of Liberty has no way forward.
She meant to bring the torch of freedom from America to the rest of the world.
The torch does not light America's path.”
What's unusual is that Limbo is actually touched by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the perspective of the perception.
Lazarus' most imaginative approach is to be able to see it. When weary, poor but hopeful people will see it on the deck after a long and often terrible journey.
On the face of it, it involves the perspective of the world for those who seek refuge and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveys to them and needs the hope and welcome they hear.
Of course, this is not the point that Miller and Trump wanted to acknowledge.
Their torches are not intended to light the way, but to ignite hatred from their only source of strength.

The 2017 World Cup: Neil Black highly praised Scotland's team in the British National Team.
Eilidh Doyle remembered that there were only two Scottishs in the British National Team at the time.
Neil Black, Executive Director of the Athletic Association of England, said that the 16 strong Scottish team in the World Cup team would make a huge contribution to the National Team.
The number of Scottish field athletes selected for the London Athletics World Cup in 2017, which opened on Friday, was the highest in history.
Black thinks that "Scotland is making extraordinary progress", from which UK track and track athletes must learn.
"We accept this and try to understand it, and we will persevere until we succeed," Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute. They think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish trackers think this has something to do with what they're doing.
The Athletic Association of England considers this to be relevant to what they are doing.
Even street people think so.
Whatever it is, it's brilliant."
A number of Scottish trackers are contestants of medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be down at 5,000 metres with Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle was selected by the team as team leader.
"Erid is a little modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible." Black said.
"Many trackers, whether Scottish or not, or wherever they live or train, walk out of the house with pride and energy.
Eric's natural passion and true feelings are great."
The winner of the Commonwealth silver medal, who will be participating in the 400 metre cross-column competition in his fifth World Cup, says that there are 16 Scottishs in the British National Team, which is "unbelievable."
Previously, the number of Scottish track and track athletes participating in the World Series was up to seven, i.e. in 1983 and 2015.
Midrunner Muir was a leader. She made five British records and two European records in the past year.
She's going to compete for 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters of Projects.
Chris O'Hare, who took part in the 1500 metre contest, was another notable Scottish player who had achieved great results in the season and won the pre-election and Olympic anniversary competitions in the British.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first World Championship when the only other Scottish on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said that she was very proud that so many of her compatriots would not only join the team, but also, in some cases, challenge the medal and race to the finals.
"The special thing about being captain of the national team is that it was elected by the other members of the national team. So, knowing that your teammates voted for your very unusual achievement, it was a great honor for me anyway," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scottish team members.
It just shows how far we have gone.
And they're all old track and track athletes here, track and track athletes who are about to move towards the purpose of the Medal.
What about my captain's message?
Well, I think it's great.
I have just referred to the fact that, under the circumstances, we are very lucky because we hold the World Cup in the main arena.
That is why it is really important that we grow up with home support and return to the Olympic stadium.
I will be given a second chance to compete, and the atmosphere there will be wonderful."

Block critics on Facebook: if you can't stand the blame of voters, don't run for office.
The father of our nation knows how bad media works.
The Americans loved Washington, but soon after that, major newspapers began to speak out against everything, from domestic policy to political principles.
He was angry at those criticisms, no doubt.
But he didn't shush those critics.
Because as early as 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of expression is denied -- we will be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance."
That reminds me of the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 people's posts because they published their views on his Facebook official home page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff thought the suit was hasty, and the online coverage was full of their fierce resistance: "Who cares?"
A lot of people say, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
This is particularly important because people like Hogan are facing them.
It was a Republican who served as governor in a state with a democratic majority, and he was surprisingly popular.
Of the country's 50 governors, he was ranked second in good ratings.
Hogan is not a reactionary rash.
He controls Maryland peacefully and strictly adheres to the rules.
He was also very good at using Facebook as the main way to communicate with voters, showing his bald head after chemotherapy for the first time on the home page.
So it's totally unnecessary, and ultimately dangerous, to block people coming to the governor's homepage comment. The homepage is a public forum, an official management platform marked by public tax-supporting staff.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson, Amelia Shas, defended the Governor's behaviour by saying that she believed that he was trying to block their comments just to show restraint.
But they were too hasty to describe it as a flood beast or cynic who swept the network.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with people who had been blocked by Hogan.
They're just ordinary people talking to their chosen leaders: they're teachers, small business owners and priests, not some flood beast.
They say their comments are deep, respectful and not dirty.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and called on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Lamani, a barrister in Bowie, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked questions about hate crimes.
In the news story review section of the Washington Post, she wrote, "I was polite to comment that I was disappointed that he had not responded to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also don't like a bunch of people commenting on the same subject, because they are simply ignored by certain people who think they're so-called people's minds, rather than treating them as citizens who worry about their country.”
What the governor's staff called "intensible garbage information bombing" might seem to others to be "persistent".
The Facebook era made it easy to change a message, simply blocking a critics or deleting a negative comment.
And it was much cleaner than it was in the past, when it was necessary to send staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical comments or arrest or silence protesters.
But that's what's happening right now, just at the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for scolding others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was being sued by Twitter users because he blocked them on Twitter.
Last week there was a landmark ruling in Virginia on such issues.
According to James c. Katcharis, District Judge of Alexandria, USA, the Chairman of the Lawden County Supervisory Committee blocked voters from her Facebook home page in violation of the First Amendment.
The Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevan (R), was also visited by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet had similar influences.
The number of newspapers had quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and others had written anonymous letters strongly criticizing his leadership.
And even then Washington had an anonymous flood beast against him.
People write to newspapers using false names such as Julikla, Valerius, Belisaius and Pozius to severely criticize Washington's decision-making.
According to historical documentation collected by George Washington newspaper's online project, his office was flooded with petitions, criticizing his attitude to the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America, signed with the United Kingdom.
But he didn't snort them.
Freedom of expression, dissent and speech are the foundations of this country.
And true leaders need to accept that.
The wiring of the city's wind and motion is holding people's sensitive nerves.
Restricted purchase is a hard line in many urban real estate regulation policies.
In May 2017, Jinan introduced a provision that undergraduates would be eligible for equal access to housing policies for residents of the local permanent household population for six consecutive months;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy whereby university students can settle in with a graduation certificate and an employment certificate within three years of graduation.
Then the policy was added, and the official said that "students can buy a house at less than 20% of the market price."
In July, Chengdu introduced a rule that young people with undergraduate and higher degrees in field universities could apply for a residence permit in Chengdu.
In addition to this, cities or regions such as Quanshan, Shanghai and Hong Kong have also introduced policies related to "the introduction of talent" that lower the threshold for home ownership for the purchase of talent.
Zhang Xuan believes that it is actually the major cities that compete for people, especially people, and retain people, especially people, and that cities are competitive, which is the most important significance of these real estate policies.
Some even believe that this means that the time has come to cancel the building market's “limited purchase”.

Ronan Lafferty looks forward to enjoying home at the Renaissance Club.
The East Loosean Renaissance Club holds the 25th Scottish Permanent Green Open Competition, and Ronan Lafferty, former European champion, will enjoy coming home in the next three days.
The Northern Irelandman led Archerfield Links next door to the finals last year, but eventually lost to Paul Els. He now works for the new convention, representing Jerry Salvatti, founder and CEO of the club, as the competition ambassador.
Lafferty said, "I saw the creation of the Renaissance Club, and we will witness its glory through this game.
The athletes will see the best face and state of the field.
Jerry created this place like nothing else.
He was a keen supporter of the game and was very proud of what was achieved here.
This is the best stage to show the field."
Englishman Ils looks forward to the first defending of the coronation, although in 32 years of his career he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
And this Southport athlete said, "This is really special.
I didn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was cancelled the second year I won.
It's amazing to come to this place.
It's wonderful playing golf here.
Last year's memory came to light, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was of special significance to us.
It's really a special memory, and we'll always remember it."
It was Gary Orr who had just turned 50 earlier this year and then participated in the European Youth Tour.
This is his first competition in Scotland since the 2013 Scottish Golf Open.
Helensburger Orr said, "There will always be more meaning in homecoming games," he said.
You want to be good; but you can feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed being able to play again. I've been playing golf.
I am satisfied with the current state of affairs.”
The three-member group on the field was former masters winner Ian Woosnan and champion Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNuit.
There were six Scottish athletes on the field, two of them, Al and former Leader of the Leed Cup, Sam Torrance, and four of them Andrew Odcohn, Stephen McCallyst, Bill Langmu and Rose Drummond.

In August, the Director General of the Environment Inspectorate of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China introduced in Beijing a total of 57 cases of continuous daily punishment throughout the country. The new amendment to the Environmental Protection Law, implemented earlier this year, clearly added to China ' s environmental enforcement.
At present, environmental protection agencies in all parts of China can investigate and punish environmental offences by means of punishments such as continuous daily punishments, seizure, locking down of production and transfer to administrative detention, and cooperate with the judicial authorities in punishing environmental crimes.
Zhao's Chief People reported that in August, a total of 335 cases of seizure and seizure were carried out throughout China; 177 cases of restricted or suspended labour were carried out; 189 cases of transfer to administrative detention and 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution offences were referred.
Of these, Henan has imposed seven consecutive punishments on a daily basis, and China is now moving from last-end control to full-scale embedding to comprehensive and enhanced environmental pollution control.
Although the downward pressure on the economy has surfaced, China ' s Ministry of Environmental Protection has previously made it clear that China should properly address the positioning of environmental protection in economic development, enhance the "green force" and move down at the rate of economic growth. The less it can relax environmental protection, the better environmental protection is optimal for the economy.
Without the highest, but only higher, the stock price of Maotai in Guizhou will never stop on the path of high innovation.
On 9 January, the "sharelord" of the "sharelord" in Guizhou once again made a historic price, with a total market value of $983 billion as of the date of collection of $782.52 million, only one step away from the 100 billion market value.
The guidance price of $1.499 increased by $200 over the previous retail price of $1.299.
On December 28, 2017, Maotai, Guizhou, issued an announcement stating that, as a result of research decisions, the prices of the Maoutai wine products have been adjusted appropriately since 2018, with an average increase of about 18 per cent.
The price increase has stimulated a sharp rise in the stock price of Maotai in Guizhou, and the Beijing Morning Reporter statistics show that since the eight transactions announced by Maotai in Guizhou, the share price of Maotai in Guizhou has increased by 95 yuan, or more than 14 per cent.

The spirit of the red ship is a force that we must follow and understand, and innovation is difficult.
Every innovation in this.
The extent to which you feel you can't solve it. You have to hold on at that stage, and you're going on and on and on.
It was the people who came to the door, now they're coming up and down, so that means...
Do something real for the people.

He's got the guts to fight.

I'm deeply proud and happy, and I'm willing to sink and then sink, and write more about the fate of the small people of the great age.
What kind of advice can you have on this grass-roots literary development?
There's a lot of popular literature going on right now. It's a little bit popular.
It's a time-honoured masterpiece that is constantly being introduced.
It should be roots and roots, deep into life, and then produce works with a certain cultural thickness, positive upwards, and long-standing artistic charms.

Looking for toilets through the nose, it's the last century. There's a lot of memories of Chinese toilets.

Is it because of the uncivilised behavior of one person, that the civil service ceases?

It's a public toilet in Jiangsu Namking, Cebu, etc.
You brush your face for three seconds, you get a free toilet paper, but in order to get a double, it takes another 10 minutes.
Avoiding misuse of public resources
It's a habit that some tourists really want to take the paper back, but on the other hand, we have to reflect.
Isn't the next toilet we're going to have no paper, so that's what we're highlighting in the new three-year plan?
Let's get rid of this imbalance.
To push the toilet revolution deeper is to think more about what people think.
A third toilet must be in place to facilitate family escorting the elderly and children to the toilet.
We brought the baby, but we were embarrassed to come in with the men's room.
The little girl's room is a little awkward. The board is particularly comfortable and it's convenient for us to bring the kids.

There has been a great deal of success, and the active promotion of the toilet revolution will not only help people to stay away from disease, but will also lead to economic development to narrow the regional development gap.
This toilet problem is an outline issue and a node for the development of social issues.
It is a national civilization project that guides the layout from a national point of view and then solves small social problems from different levels of participation.
That's how we complete all our shorts.

Unite to the party's 19th-ever-determined major decision-making.
In Indonesia, poverty and death in gold.
Baddina Dejay doesn't cook with stoves.
She doesn't even use pots.
Her cabin is located in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County, Papua Province, Indonesia, where the housewife usually simply puts a potato — the local people call it `nota' — directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the burnt potato was taken out by an unwashed hand and eaten by the wolves.
Daydjie sits on the mud — she has no furniture, and this is where she does daily household chores, such as washing clothes, washing water is so thick that it comes from nearby swamps.
There's a bucket in a room without roofs, and that's the outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of the four wives of her husband, so she was not assigned to the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it's dangerous to work late: most men in the village are unemployed and many are drunk and there are many soldiers here.
She said, "No one dares to walk around the village after 5:00 p.m.."
It was a rare glimpse of everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a colony of the Netherlands that was incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, but that referendum was also controversial when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands in front of the army that occupied the area.
The current campaign of strong demands for independence and opposition to Dutch rule soon again targeted the Jakarta government, which exercised high-handed rule over the region and isolated foreign journalists and defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into Papua and West Papua provinces, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is remote and empty; it takes 90 minutes to fly from the provincial capital Chayapura to Nabyre, and then rents a car for five hours and turns the river all the way in the stomach.
There's no public transport here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, outside the cabin is surrounded by bamboo fences, and the wrinkled iron-coated roof is a variety of shades made of rust.
Few Indonesians come in, let alone journalists, and few foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian preacher, Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here as well.
Djay said, "We don't wear these clothes." She means her colored hand-weaving headscarf, dark shirts and bright half skirts.
"We used to cover our bodies with leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and is the region with the highest infant mortality rate and lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also Indonesia's gold continent.
Paniai County is located in highland, approximately the same size as New Jersey, with 153,000 people. The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Glasberg, is only 60 miles away, owned by Philip McMollan Copper Gold, based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Felipe mined around $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, the timber resources of Papua are very rich, with an estimated value of $78 billion.
But these vast resources are also the source of the tragedy of the Papuans, and that is why Indonesia's powerful military power has been able to keep them down.
According to a 2005 New York Times survey report, Philip paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 for one official alone.
Papuans are increasingly demanding independence, which threatens the gold lord and as a result they are subjected to cruel treatment.
According to defenders, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the highlands of the Papua tribe in the 1970s escalated into genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A report in 2016 by the Catholic Brisbane General Diocese, "We will lose everything " , contains proof of the perfidence of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture — another report reports that rape and electrocution are particularly common — and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
Andrias Harsono, Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch, said, "The violence takes place every day, so it is difficult to calculate the number of victims."
The repression began when Papua's resources brought in large numbers of immigrants outside Indonesia.
Eighty-three per cent of the 3.5 million people in the province are Christians, but Muslim economic immigrants have changed their demographic structure since they arrived from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javans' snack stand sells a combination of fried chicken and vegetables with peanut butter.
The locals struggled.
Abos Yu, a local 24-year-old Paniai, moved to the provincial capital Chayapura to find a job, explaining that “those immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans.
This has caused the local Papuans — the mama-mama — to lose their market.”
Indonesian President Zoko Widodo (who is often called Zokovi) vowed to address Papua 'inequality and abuse of power' during his 2014 campaign.
The carpenter's road to the Jakarta presidential palace was supported in 27 out of 29 districts, including Paniai.
But Papua hasn't changed anything. Today, the locals feel betrayed.
You said, "We're heartbroken, and in 2014 we voted for Zorkovi, hoping that he will fulfil our wishes and restore justice."
In fact, just two months after Zokovi took office in October, Paniai experienced the worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, Enarotali 11 children sang a Christmas hymn in front of the bonfire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly came on a motorcycle.
The frightened kids told them to turn on the headlights.
According to the local pastor, Aveit Tebai, one of the soldiers was unhappy with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
The victims and witnesses claimed that the drunken soldiers followed the children with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the children.
The 16-year-old Yulianus Yemmer was severely beaten and unconscious.
A few hours later, the nearby government agency election committee building set fire to the bear and the incident escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
With ritual hunting bows, they danced the waita of the Babouya Mee Pago tribe -- running around and mimicking birds.
Some protesters started throwing stones at regular military posts.
According to an official document seen in Times magazine, when emotions continued to intensify, soldiers received an order via internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot immediately," but this document was not released to the local media.
The 56-year-old Jeremiah Kayamu, the leader of the Enerotali Kego Koto neighbourhood, felt the imminent danger and appealed to the crowd to calm down and beg them to return home.
But nobody's in the mood to listen to him.
He stood on the porch of his beautiful cabin and told Time magazine, "When I turned back, my left wrist was suddenly shot."
Kayamu still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he said the bullets came from among the assembled soldiers.
And he said, "It was crowded and they fired a lot of guns."
According to the cousin of the local Alfyous Yur, he witnessed the shooting and saw Alfyous Yur shot three times in his body.
Yuhanes sadly told Time magazine, "I ran to check his body to see if he was him.
I found him dead and I kissed him."
The Chief Inspector of the Papua Police, Yuji Mende, told reporters that his subordinates were only at the "protective" police station because the police station had been attacked.
In 2015, Puggio Sulistio, police spokesman and chief of police in Papua, said, "When someone threatens to kill us, we must defend ourselves.
It's a matter of life and death."
According to HRW, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killing the next day spread slowly only in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi gave a well-spoken speech in Chayapura, expressing deep sympathy to the family of the victim and vowing to resolve the abuse left over from the history of Papua.
He said, "I hope this case is settled as soon as possible so that it will not happen again in the future."
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Valando, stated that he would set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuse for dildo is almost instantaneous.
He said, "Most of the violations took place a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations, but this still requires a process.”
Then on June 5, in Jakarta, Virando went back on dialogue with Times magazine, saying that he had no plans to establish a complaints mechanism in Papua.
On the contrary, he said, "All will be settled according to the law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Verando for the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999 as “crimes against human rights”, but he said that 11 cases of human rights violations in the Papua region had been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai incident scorned those remarks.
Juhanes said, "I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed at all."
Years later, he said, "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, and I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yukabus also thinks the people of Paniai are afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping bury the four victims.
He said, "When the body was buried, the army came to me."
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deyai district, Paniai neighbourhood.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a unconscious man to the hospital, clashed, one died and 17 others were injured, among them children.
A 24-year-old man, Lavianus Dowu, drowned while fishing near the river and died on his way to hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company's field office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the police, so the police fired warning shots.
But the riot control mobile force (the Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and one person was killed.
29-year-old Domingu Bady told Time magazine that "We were panicking and now we're afraid they'll retaliate." He lived near the hospital when he witnessed the wounded being rushed into the hospital.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deyai Parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and for the mobile anti-riot force to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a land of right and wrong for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has fuelled the grievances of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which are scattered in the central highlands of Pani'ai.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claimed to protect the rights of Papuans by spreading attacks and raiding Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Paniai, including Tadius Yuji and Daniel Yodas Kogoa.
As a result, thousands of Pani have been arrested in recent years by the military under the guise of “preservation of national sovereignty” and deliberately detained.
Some never showed up again.
In the eyes of Papuans, Paniai is a “forgotten place of tragedy”.
Poverty breeds discontent.
Enarotali sells rice that is poor, and the locals can't afford it.
The bread is simply out of reach.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and each woman can take care of four or five pieces of potato land.
They usually use most of the harvests to retain writers and sell the rest on the local market.
Ten red potatoes worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has spread among the local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased considerably since the opening of the new route to Nabyre airport.
The few jobs available are usually in the hands of better educated and richer immigrants.
Papuans have little money or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council, said, "Youth don't want to stay in this village because there's no job, there's no money."
Papua is isolated from the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Longshan were expelled from Papua because they were "not cooperating with the agencies concerned", even though they had rarely obtained authorization to film.
According to Felim Kane, Deputy Director of Asia of Human Rights Watch, the election vow of Zorkovi to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development was not realized.
In a statement, he said, "If foreign journalists try to report on the disgruntled provinces of Papua and West Papua in the easternmost parts of Indonesia, they have new risks: denial of visas and blacklisting."
The absence of media oversight means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's neighbours.
In March, six Pacific countries — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands — asked the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “all types of widespread human rights violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries also supported the Free Papua Movement.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Almanata Nasir, has no interest in the group's allegations, telling Jakarta journalists that “Indonesia is still in a democratic system and freedom of the media makes it difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations”.
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention.
According to an informed source, on May 4, when the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights, Keith Van Barr, led an official delegation to Jayapura, the local people broke the silence and cried, "We want freedom." He also attended the meeting, but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say that they are unlikely to vote again.
The Chairman of the Tribal Council, Gobai, said, "Zokovi's intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting."
He wanted Zokovi to know that the people of Paniai not only lived under the threat of a greedy army but had nothing, that there was little education in the region and that public health care services were scarce.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, think that the vote they voted for Zokovi is a debt he has to pay.
He said, "They don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting made their last symbolic resistance: the body of the victim was buried opposite the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
Yucabos bowed his head and said, "My family was killed.
What else can we do?"
With capital power, Sofia, Hollywood, and top firm brands are making a huge effort to customize the home sector. On February 10, 2017, the CSRC approved the initial application of Guangdong Sang-hwan House and Home Dwelling Co. Ltd., and issued a permit to enter the market for a deep deal with the small and medium-sized board of the residence, after having just approved the first IPO for more than 20 days.
According to insiders, the custom-made home area, which was already in the wind, will move from product competition to capital competition as the summation of the home and the succession of the Europa family is on the market.
At the beginning of the new year, the announcement that a typical representative brand-based home allocation in the area of home customarily was about to be marketed attracted the attention of the entire household industry.
Reuters, Beijing Time 9, stated that Samsung Electronics announced on Tuesday the first set of auto-drive components jointly developed with Harman International, as well as the information and entertainment solution, which is an important initiative for the company to enter the electronic market for military vehicles.
Three Star Electronics acquired Haman International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Fair (CES) held in Las Vegas this week, Samsung published car cameras with collision alerts, traffic diversion alerts, cruise control features, which were developed in cooperation with Haman.
Three Stars plans to start the delivery of this camera system this year, which is built on technology such as automatic machine learning and scaling up.
At the same time, the three stars showed a "digital cockpit", and even if the driver was not the owner of the vehicle, it would make the vehicle more personal, as the system allows users to download the driver's data from mobile devices and clouds.
Tonight, the 20th regular game of the CBA is about to begin, which also means the second half of the CBA tournament in the 2016-2017 season.
The fire has once again swallowed the Tower of Dubai's torch.
On Friday, a fire broke out in one of the highest residential buildings in the world in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the high 337 m, 79 floors of super-high buildings.
It was the second fire in just two years that swept through high-rise buildings, and happened to happen in the sky tower known as the torch.
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported and no cause of the fire has yet been identified.
"We're sleeping, and then we wake up with fire alarms and people start screaming.
We ran down the stairs and came down from 50 floors for about 10 minutes, "A resident named George told Reuters.
According to the civil defence authorities in Dubai, the fire brigade extinguished the fire around 4 o'clock in local time (US$ 00000 Greenwich Standard Time) and is in the process of cooling down the building.
The Government indicated that efforts were being made to provide shelter for those affected.
The accident may once again raise concerns around the world about the safety of the use of outer wall materials in high-rise buildings.
In a survey carried out by the management of the skyscraper building of the torch in the aftermath of the fire in 2015, it was found that most of the damaged objects were coated walls for decoration and insulation.
The British police have indicated that they believe that the problems with the insulation and overpanding systems of the Glenfield Building in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire, which killed about 80 people.
The Williams convoy also suggested that Massa might return, even though he had announced his retirement.
January 9 is only a month from the opening of the Pingchang Winter Olympics in Korea, and with the passing of the heat from the south to the north and the intense preparation of the Olympic holy fire, the atmosphere in Korea is becoming stronger.
Korean public opinion expects this long-defeating inter-Korean talks to bring a "black egg" to the Ping Chang Winter Olympics in a month's countdown.
On November 1, last year, Pingchang Winter Olympic Church holy fire arrived in Korea.
The heat of the fire was directly reflected in the sale of tickets for the Pingchang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the Pingchang Winter Olympics ticket sales rate was still at 32%, the Winter Paralympics ticket sales rate was 4.3%, and the low ticket sales rate was once a source of concern for the people of the Ping Chang Winter Olympics.
But as Lee Xifan, Chairman of the Pingchang Winter Olympic Organizing Committee, recently predicted for journalists, "The Winter Olympics are becoming more and more hot, and it is believed that the sales of tickets will soon improve."
According to Korean media reports, as of 3 January, Pingchang Winter Olympics ticket sales had reached 64 per cent, and the Winter Paralympics ticket sales rate was over 50 per cent.
In order to encourage foreigners to go to the Korean Olympics, the Korean Ministry of Justice announced on 8th that it would extend the stay in Korea for foreigners visiting Korea to watch the Ping Chang Winter Olympics for up to 120 days.
The investigation found that more than one in five American travellers boarded the plane with prohibited items.
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had boarded the plane with illegal goods, intentionally or unintentionally, via USTA checkpoints, and that at least 6 per cent of them had boarded the plane unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1% of passengers declared that they only later discovered that they were travelling with a wrong gun, ammunition or explosives.
The investigation of more than 1,000 people was carried out by Stratos Jet Charterers Inc., which also found that young travellers were more likely to blatantly ignore regulations.
19.7% of respondents who admitted that they had deliberately attempted to board TSA prohibited items were millennium generations, compared to less than 15% of the X generation population.
The most common items that deliberately slip past TSA security officers are food and drinks.
More than 3% admitted to having intentionally carried the blade through security checks, while 2.2% of the female respondents and 3.7% of the male respondents said they had intentionally boarded the plane with prohibited drugs.
The company stated that the purpose of the investigation of the country ' s travellers was to find out the number of people who had boarded aircraft by accident and intentionally carrying embargoed goods.
It is not surprising that those most likely to carry embargoed goods through security checks — intentionally or unintentionally — are those who fly most frequently.
However, the company pointed out that the TSA guide was a bit complicated and difficult to understand.
People usually don't know what kind of fluid they can carry and how many liquids they can carry.
So it's not surprising that TSA caught the most illegal liquid.
It was once thought that TSA might have used books as an embargo.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry liquids.
US EPA Prutt changed his mind about Obama's era emissions reduction regulations.
One day after being sued by 15 states, the Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Prute changed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama's era air emissions reduction regulations.
Prute proposed this change because the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state bodies that regulate the environment than the previous government.
He did not mention the legal challenges raised by the Federal Court of Appeal against his predecessor.
The debate focused on setting October 1 as the deadline for states to start meeting the 2015 ground ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid “disturbing local decision-making or impeding economic growth”.
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Pruitt was the State Attorney General of Oklahoma and has long opposed the tightening of environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Prute has repeatedly turned to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is one of the most recent legal obstacles to Prute's return to the agenda.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Director of Environmental Protection had overstepped his powers and tried to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's requirement that oil and gas companies monitor and mitigate methane leakage.
In a statement released on Wednesday night, Prute proposed a major shift in his attitude towards the ozone standard, saying that he wanted to strengthen the commitment of the Environmental Protection Agency, cooperate with the states and adopt complex procedures to reach new standards.
Prute said that "under previous government administration, EPA usually failed to meet the specified deadline, then waited for radical groups and others to sue and agreed to set the specified timetable by agreement." He initiated dozens of prosecutions against EPA in his previous work.
“We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously.”
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that Prute may again use his "extended mandate and all other legally available authorizations" to ensure that the provisions are consistent with "good policy and best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for extensive rewriting of ozone layer regulations.
The House Bill approved last month aims to delay the 2015 rule by at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
The State Attorney of New York, Eric Schneiderman, led the state coalition this week to sue the United States Environmental Protection Agency for its intention to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said, "The reverse of the US EPA -- after we filed a lawsuit -- was an important victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with more than 115 million American communities directly affected by smoke emissions."
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C., joined the New York state in this case.
Ground ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources to sunlight exposure in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause serious breathing problems for sensitive populations, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Prute for his amazing transformation.
Lori Ann Bird of the Biodiversity Center said, "It's disturbing that this common sense measure is under great pressure from the heads of the departments that protect the air we need to breathe."
"We must finally fight the Trump government's ideological movement to cater to polluters and special interest groups."
In addition to external factors such as the heating of steel prices, enterprises are also struggling to move on the path to lower costs.
The price of steel began to fall with the return of large areas of the enterprise.
At present neither the China Steel Association nor the National Statistical Office have published any profit data on the iron and steel industry for the month of June.
According to the Beijing Railways Bureau, the spring of the 2017 railway runs from 13 January to 21 February, for a total of 40 days.
My goal is to understand the current state of artificial intelligence — we are making far more progress than people expect, but we still have a long way to go.
Yesterday, two plots of land, located in the mountains of the House, came to the scene to compete, and two plots totalling 1,845.2 million yuan were handed over.
Recently, Japan's animated " Your Name" was unbelievably Asian. In Japan, after becoming Miyazaki's director, the film broke 20 billion yen for the first time in 15 years and took second place in the ticket house.
Since the second half of 2009, Xiaoshan’s sales volume (value) has remained high. In particular, this spring, Xiaoshan’s sales have reached an all-time high, sales have increased significantly and prices have risen. According to statistics, from January to June of this year, Xiaoshan’s mountain areas achieved 48 per cent increase in sales revenue from the same period last year, with the largest increase in nearly 20 years.
Xi Hae Yong, Deputy Director of the Xiaoshan Forestry Department, said that, along with good sales, Xiaoshan Hanaki production had developed faster.
During the past two years, the area of Xiaoshan Hanaki has been expanded by 30,000 acres, with a total area of 180,000 acres, while at the same time actively developing out of the area, Xiaoshan Hsiaoming farmers have established 80,000 acres of flowerwood bases throughout the country, an increase of 30,000 acres over 2008.
In parallel with the expansion of the area under cultivation, the quality of seedlings has been improving, the value of nurseries has been increasing, large-scale, high-quality seedlings have been retained and some of them have been sold.
He also warned that, in the face of the current boom, producers should face up to and analyse with calm and objectivity to see that society ' s demand for flowers will be long-term and increasing, while recognizing that there will be more competition in the market.
On the morning of 13 July Beijing time, the US firm Somaltus filed a suit against the Eastern Texas District Court, accusing Apple of violating a battery technology patent that it applied for in 2010.
Sony and Toshiba have been sued with the same patent before.
The suit alleged that both iPhone 6s and similar apple equipment violated US patent 7,657,386, a patent named Integrated Battery Services System.
The plaintiff wished to obtain cash compensation or a patent fee for tort equipment after the judgement was pronounced.
It appears from the indictment that the plaintiff argued that the iPhone ' s fast-filling function violated the company ' s patent.
iPhones with fast charge functions quickly charge up to 80%, followed by trickle-up charge.
Somaltus is actually a so-called “proprietary hooligan” because the company does not provide obvious products and services and it is difficult to find relevant information online.
However, they have succeeded in reaching an out-of-court settlement with car manufacturers such as Ford and Japanese.
The meeting recognized the importance of accelerating information development, promoting the integration and efficient use of resource interconnections, raising the level of digitalization and intelligence in industry, promoting “China to create 2025” and popular entrepreneurship and innovation, fostering new dynamic energy, and improving the quality of life of the masses.
Taiwan's hot-blooded youth film, The Six-Do Café, starred by Dong Jianxian, is the film festival's media grand prize contest, while another film, the Chinese language film, The Duran, starred by him, competes for the Golden Lord's Award.
He's 23 years old, wearing a colored T-shirt, black sports pants, and he's young and sunny. Because there's not enough chairs in the interview room, he just sits on the floor and says, "Come on, it's nice to talk."
As a result, it has been revealed that the railway sector has expanded the 12306 website, introduced new services during spring tickets, and nearly 60% of tickets no longer need to use the certification code.
According to leaked phone records, Trump had pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post leaked phone records between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On January 27, in a call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
It was reported that the President of the United States had expressed dissatisfaction with his public criticism of the separation wall and that Putin had said to him, "Don't tell the media."
During the presidential campaign, Trump promised to build a separation wall along the southern border of the United States and solemnly announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
The record of his call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also published, which showed a tense exchange between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the United States undertook to repatriate refugees to Australia was "preposterous", "disgusting" and "intelligent", and that he had advised the United States to ban the resettlement of refugees, and now insisted on the deal under Obama's administration's good offices, which would make him look like a "stupid".
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull, "This is today's most unpleasant call."

Moor Beach tragedy: activists repeat racist lynchings and justice.
A 1948 Ford Mercury car ran through a crowd of viewers in the town of Monroe, Georgia, heading towards the little Moor Beach Bridge.
The car was carrying four black passengers and a white driver, and a group of white men with guns went in front of the bridge and blocked the vehicle's way forward.
The mob leader, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, took a deep breath of cigars and looked into the windshield.
The passengers in the car were full of fear.
"We want- Roger!" that guy shouts.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged down from the previous row of passenger seats and screams broke the silence.
Fortunately, July 22 was only a repeat of this terrible scene.
But when Roger's neck was covered with ropes, almost all the viewers made a real sound of breathing.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moor Beach Bridge, reproducing the scene of two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm, and George and Meryl Dossy - who were hanged by three K lynchings in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"Although we know who they are, and although we have seen them in the community, none of them has been arrested in these years, which is incredible." Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize this repeat, said.
"This is the stain of history, the burden of our souls."
Brooks, 71 years old, was a former member of Georgia's parliament and a lifelong rights activist.
For him, the repetition was a remarkable call to action that reminds the people of the Monroe community every year that injustice has never been redressed.
"We want to sue, we want to close, we want to cure, we want to reconcile, but we must first get justice," he said.
"Until we get justice, we will not be cured and reconciled."
On July 27, 1946, the coroner laid a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Moor Beach lynching.
According to the FBI file obtained by the National Broadcasting Corporation News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in lynchings.
But none of them has ever been prosecuted.
Although suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists have stated that the dual motives for lynchings are well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the initial elections later that summer.
According to the FBI, at about the same time, the black tenant Roger Malcolm stabbed white landlord Barnett Hearst in a fight that looked like it was for a woman.
Brooks said the town rumor was that Hearst slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and her baby wasn't her husband's.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the prominent white landlord, Roy Harrison, spent $600 bailing Malcolm out of prison.
Dorothy and cousin Michael and George Dorsey accompanied him to prison.
But when they came back from prison to the Moor Beach Bridge, a mob of thugs surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison organized and ordered the murder," an FBI report came up with this conclusion.
“It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement agencies that not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witness.”
Brooks is very brief.
He said, "It's a voting tragedy."
"They were killed, and the murderer sent a message to the black people of this community: 'If you register and vote, you will have the same end."
Cassandra Green has been responsible for leading the annual repeat of the lynching at Moor Beach Bridge for nearly a decade.
She behaves with a clear image of her behaviour, with a very deep racist background. Many people hope that this kind of racism will no longer exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, it's harder not to see, but Green says that's the key.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because it makes us face the ugly side of everyone," she said.
"But I can't have a relationship with you if you don't listen to me or hear me tell my story."
This year's performance began in June, with nearly 30 actors on the first day - a dozen white people, the rest of them black - squeezed into a room and listened to Green's release of a good performance overview.
Wade Malbau is the co-director of Green.
He's been playing the role of the Three Kists for years, but he says it's never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Malbau said.
"But I think it's important to keep this history alive, because we don't want to go back to that era."
In the room, actors like Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hurst, Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, are rehearsing their lines.
At the beginning of the scene, Malcolm shouted and pushed Hearst away, angry that he had slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, get out of my land!"
Rascona echo.
Then they fought.
And then everybody (at least all black actors) started laughing.
Green laughs the most.
"What's going on?" Lascona asked.
He was panicking and confused.
Did I go too far?
"No," Green laughed.
"I just thought white people wouldn't say 'ah' when they hit back."
"Yes," another black actor plays fun.
"Your tone must be strong."
So the energy in the room changed; the feeling of fraternity drove away the feeling of discomfort.
Everyone tried to do so not only to perform the show, but also to honour the memory of the four victims.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rasconar said the word "ah", the tone was sharp and strong.
No one laughs.
The reoccurrence came to a strong and quick end.
The screams, the gunshots, and then the silence.
A woman in the black dress of the funeral stood next to the body of the actor and sang the sad words of Billy Haroldet, the strange fruit.
Her voice suffocated over other words.
A hundred yards away, about 40 viewers are constantly rubbing their sweat and tears.
Blacks and whites make up almost half of the audience.
There was a couple who came to see the show from Isaka, New York, and a lot of people lived near the road.
Brooks took them to Malcolm's and Dorothy's grave for nearly eight hours, and everybody was enduring Georgia's uncomfortable wet fever.
Until then, the murderer remained a mystery. But now, on the same land where lynchings took place, there was anxiety in the air.
When the last note of the song disappeared, Green asked people to come closer and examine the body of the actor.
The children bowed down, watched fake blood and corpses, and whispered among themselves.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mumbling like he's reminding himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and then the show ended.
The actor threw away the lynching rope and wiped out the tears.
Bradshaw embraces Malbau, a man in a suit who plays the three K's leader.
Nick Rascona hugged two of his colleagues and lost his voice crying in their arms; the emotions in the show eventually infected him.
"It doesn't matter," one of the women whispered.
"We know that your heart is not like that.
There's a reason you're doing this."
After that, the audience sat down and had dinner with the actors.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted closely with a black couple they just met and talked about the recurrence.
Dennis Duplinski had difficulty finding words to describe how she felt after watching.
"It's hard to imagine the terrible words and behavior... people like you say it and do it because they look like you," she said.
"This really makes me think that lynching is still going on," she added, "Now this is just a police shooting."
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sits next to the table watching and tastes and echoes civil rights.
He said he's already planning next year's performance.
"Recurrence is an inspiring way because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also very educational," he said.
"If you don't learn from it, it'll happen again.
Those who do not study and do not understand their history are doomed to repeat their mistakes.”

Reporter 7 learned from Kaiji Hebei Group that at 11.25 a.m. on 7 a.m., there was an explosion at the emulsion workshop of the chemist group Chems Ltd., located in the ancient smelting area of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, and that 13 operators were trapped at the site.
To date, of the 13 people trapped, one has been rescued and rushed to the hospital, while the remaining 12 are under intense search and rescue.
It is known that the scene has now been sealed off and that local public security, fire protection, medical and other departments are working to rescue the site.
According to witnesses, the incident started with a loud bang, and an instant mushroom cloud emptied.
According to members of the Kaiji Group who organized the search and rescue on site, Tangshan Kaicheng (Group of Chemical Industries) Ltd. is located north of Zhao Jiajun, a State-approved site production company for civilian blast equipment located in the ancient smelt district of Tangshan City, Hebei Province. It was founded in 1958 under the name of the 6O-2 factory of the Open Mining Authority.

US Media: China Air Force Engineering University Scientists study laser satellites for the removal of space debris
According to the American media, Chinese scientists put forward a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up chaotic Earth orbits and destroy old satellites and their sky trash.
According to a January 15 report on the United States Newsweek website, researchers at China Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled " Study on small-scale space debris conversion models for space-based laser removal " , which describes how space debris can be irradiated by lasers into smaller, less hazardous fragments through the use of space-based platform lasers.
It was reported that space debris had been the concern of international space agencies for many years and NASA had considered a variety of options for tracking, detecting and removing artificial debris.
The manner in which large-scale space debris is removed includes meganets used to clean and collect waste, and magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean Earth orbit.
The summary of the paper states: “(Simulation studies) provide the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based platform laser technologies for the removal of space debris.”
A 2014 study by Lockheed-Martin, the giant of the United States defense industry, found that there were about 200 threats every day for satellites operating along orbits.
High-speed debris moving along Earth orbit is considered a serious threat to future space missions and has been described by experts from the European Space Agency as a “lethal chain of threats”. High-speed debris has continued to grow over the past year.
It was also reported on January 17, of the American monthly magazine Mass Machinery, that space is essentially empty, but space next to Earth is becoming increasingly crowded. Each satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris around the Earth and, over time, it will accumulate.
The more debris there is, the more likely a satellite still functioning is hit by debris, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of dollars.
It was reported that all space agencies had plans to remove space debris in the future.
NASA is considering using jet gas to reduce the speed of debris and remove it from orbit, Europe is considering launching a satellite with a large net to capture debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan's idea is to capture debris with an electric chain.
At this point, China has also proposed a solution to the problem of space debris by using a large laser device to strike floating space garbage into less harmful small fragments.
According to a paper published by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University in the German monthly optical magazine, the installation of such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean space, at least according to simulation results.
It was reported that the only way to prove effectiveness was to conduct tests and that there were no arrangements for such missions, but perhaps sooner or later someone would install lasers on satellites and send them into space.
Once it is done, we can finally start ridding space debris once and for all.

A suicide bombing attack on the convoy in Kabul killed NATO soldiers.
According to official sources, a military convoy was attacked by suicide bombers in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
NATO stated that five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the explosion.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in this incident in the Karabagh area of the city.
This is the latest violent attack on Afghanistan - the bombing of the Herat mosque on Tuesday caused more than 30 deaths.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO statements, there was an explosion on Thursday evening, and a joint Afghan-NATO coalition patrol was attacked by an “individual carrying an improvised explosive device”.
The statement stated that all injured persons were currently in stable condition and were being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to journalists, the growing Taliban and so-called Islamic State (IS) organizations in the Karabakh region have raised serious concerns about NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to United Nations statistics, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, while deaths in the capital accounted for about 20%.
At least 30 people died as a result of a suicide car bomb attack in late July in the Shia-dominated area of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed that they had launched the attack.
On May 31, a huge explosion took place in the centre of Kabul, killing more than 150 people, the most deadly attack by armed elements in the country since the overthrow of the Taliban by the United States-led multinational force in 2001.
The violence highlighted the precarious security situation in Afghanistan at a time when US President Donald Trump weighed whether Afghanistan would increase its support for its army and police.
Journalists have reported that suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the Government and its policies, particularly in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sued to overturn the resolution and delayed smoke regulations.
Obama made a rule when he was in office calling on states to curb emissions that cause smoke, 15 states to sue the US National Environmental Protection Agency for it. One day after the indictment, EPA overturned the rule.
The US EPA announced its decision on Wednesday to continue the so-called "Ozone Target 2015" and promised that the EPA would work with the states.
In a statement, United States Environmental Protection Director Scott Pruett said, "We have confidence in dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to them."
Pruit announced in June that EPA plans to postpone the implementation of ozone compliance area standards until October 2018, with a one-year delay - according to which existing smoke pollution in parts of the country is measured to determine which areas should reduce emissions of smoke pollution to meet air quality standards.
15 major Democratic states, as well as the District of Columbia, filed lawsuits on Tuesday claiming that the act was illegal.
As part of the broader agenda, the authorities of President Donald Trump have been working to restore the environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama to stimulate economic growth.
But these efforts have provoked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups. They fear that more emissions will affect public health.
The US EPA website states that breathing ozone-containing air "will reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.

McKee Garcia and Vasili Lomachenko meet for the first time to explore possible future battles.
The most striking boxing contest of under 147 pounds will take place in the near future, with Vasili Lomachenko and Macky Garcia meeting for the first time on Thursday, now in a state of potential conflict.
In separate rooms in Los Angeles ESPN's office, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion García took the lead down the corridor and saluted the world boxing organization's super-featile champion, Lomachenko.
At the Showtime boxing competition held on Saturday, the referee unanimously concluded that García had won the victory of Adrian Bronner, the world champion of the four Divisions, and that both fighters had become the top five players on the same weight list.
Garcia reached out to his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck."
In the ESPN competition at 7 p.m. Saturday night, Lomachenko won Miguel Mariaga and preserved his position.
When both of them took pictures, Egis Clemás, the agent of Lomachenko, pointed out that the potential confrontation between the two players depended on the perfect size.
"I was lightweight before," García leads.
"I went up to fight Bronner, but I didn't weigh that much.
I'm a little overweight compared to 140 pounds.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he has to be lightweight (135 pounds) before we can fight.
That's what fans want.
Then we'll meet them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Clemás asked him whether he should pay the fees, and part of his strategy was to have Lomachenko start-up with a 135-pound player later this year, thinking that next summer would have a date with Garcia. García was also interested in fighting the winner of the battle with Jorge Linarez-Luc Campbell after the Forum Lightweight Fight on September 23.
"Because all the fans are asking the question, this battle may be on a charge-by-charge basis," said García. After that, he expressed his openness to the competition on the network that offers the best financial options.
"We're the main characters.
The rest of us can't get so much attention.
As long as they're ready..."
García appreciates Lomachenko as an “excellent player” and may be watching his boxing match on Saturday.
But Lomachenko has hesitated to praise Garcia, saying he thinks this tri-district champion from Riverside looks "so slow." Sorry, Mikey, you're gonna be out."
Garcia said the point was to show the power of fists before boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing competition.
"This is the battle that has to be fought,
Attention and heat speech are beyond the reach of other boxing competitions.
I'm very happy to compete, "Jascia says.
Lomarchenko said, "I've been waiting for top warriors, this time it's Mikey's turn.
It'll be a great battle."
Promotion of environmental protection yesterday, the West Side hosted a major environmental volunteering event on the theme "Green Home, Motivate West City".
Unlike the traditional way in which garbage is picked up and promotional materials are distributed, the sponsors have set up six special game experience areas, including water-saving toilet displays, enzyme production experiences, traffic domino cards, etc.
At present, in the country, many young people quit their studies because they targeted professional golfers and walked smoothly along the career path, much less considering universities.
China Development and Reform Commission officials expressed their position on the early completion of the 11th Five-Year Emission Reduction Target, giving the steel industry, which is constrained by limited electricity production, a strong expectation of recovery.
Although the steel plant has not yet received a clear notification from the local government that the energy-saving emission reduction effort has been closed, it is estimated within industry that, on or about 15 December 2010, steel plants in various parts of the country that were already restricted will be reproducing, and steel prices may begin to pressurize.
There has been no notification of the end of the capricious production, but in fact the pressure from businesses has been considerably smaller than in September and October, when a private steel company in Hebei province said to journalists.
The northern branch of the river has repeatedly issued restricted production documents and, at one point, restricted production by enterprises by force of lockdown.
Journalists learned from local businesses that steel plants in most of Hebei have now resumed work and production restrictions have been eased.
My steel network analyst, Zhang Tieshan, expects that the end demand for building steel will gradually shift from strength to weakness as the north is wintering.
The phase-out of energy-saving emission reductions will be completed by December 15, when most steel plants will have essentially returned to production and products will arrive in local markets by New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put some pressure on the right price of steel.
On December 20, Chinese smart car-related sources told journalists at www.thepaper.cn that Chinese communications had acquired 70% of the shares of the Xiaohai Xuanteng passenger vehicle, and on that basis formed a smart car team for Chinese communications, which was "unable to reveal, amounting to hundreds of millions." We are recruiting talent, and the future smart car will be a very important business for Chinese communications.

The 68th Emmy Awards ceremony was held yesterday in Los Angeles, United States of America (on the evening of September 18, local time).
This year's drama case, “Beware of the Emperor”, was fiercely competitive, and two newcomers eventually defeated an old actor: the best male lead prize was won by the first-nominated Hero Rami Marek, the Hero of the Hacker Corps, and the best female lead prize was won by Tatiana Maslani of Black Orphans.
The big winner of this Aimee Award is the Game of Power and the American Crime Story.
U.S. Crime Story wraps up an important grand prize in the category of miniatur/TV movies, while the Game of Power takes 12 grand prizes (including technical ones), including the best drama series, the best director and the best writer three heavy-pound prizes.
To this end, the Game of Power has won 38 Emmy Prizes, making it the largest television drama in history.
Unfortunately, this year's Game of Power failed on the actor's awards.

International online news (journalist Liu Xing): On 18th, the Economic and Commercial Affairs Branch of the Italian Embassy in China organized a China-Italy environmental conservation talks, which resulted in an extensive exchange of views and a positive consensus on cooperation between the two countries in the field of renewable resources in the light of the new situation.
Chinese representatives are known to be mainly Chinese Renewable Resources Development Co. Ltd. and China ' s International Technology Transfer Collaborative Network, while others are made up of the Global Energy Environment Exchange and the Bologna Regional Business Federation of Italy.
The Italian representative said that Italy had diverse environmental technologies and solutions in the field of renewable resources, proposed pilot projects with China on industrial waste disposal, waste oil treatment and waste incineration equipment, and looked forward to extending the environmental cooperation experience of China to other parts of the globe.
The latest results of the Swedish asylum-seeker age assessment test are published
Swedish asylum seekers are tested using the latest method to medically assess their age. The latest results show that more than 80% of those tested were sentenced to over 18 years of age, but not all of them believed in their accuracy.
The Swedish National Center for Forensic Medicine (R?ttsmedicinalverket) started this test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees claiming to be minors, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) designed these tests with a view to conducting a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Migration Board has sent 6880 testers, and the Forensic Medicine Centre has now published the results of a total of 2481 testers for the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
80% (2002 persons) were sentenced to 18 years of age or older, yet in another 25 tests, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine determined that the subject “may have reached 18 years of age or more”.
In 432 tests, the result was that the person "may not be 18 years old".
The test is only for people whose age is in doubt.
According to John Grant of the Forensic Medicine Center, these results are consistent with those of the previous months.
He told The Local: "These data are not much different from those of the previous months, and the numbers are very much the same."
The higher proportion of cases where a person has been convicted of having reached the age of 18 years or older does not necessarily mean that these asylum seekers falsely declare their age.
In May, the Centre published 581 test results and stated 442 "showing that the subject has reached 18 years of age or older".
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of the 581 tests released and found that 243 of them had publicly indicated that they would be 18 this year.
An X-ray examination of the smart teeth, an MRI scan of the joints and analysis of the results by dentists and radiologists were also questioned in some areas.
One of the skeptics was Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose work included assessing the biological maturity of people to determine whether they experienced puberty earlier or later than normal age.
He told the newspaper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I don't think the measurements used should be like this.
It's not accurate to determine the biological age in this way.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can do it.”
Grantson at the Forensic Science Center, however, defended the accuracy of these tests: "It is generally fair to say that the risk of uncertainty in determining a child as an adult is small."
The greatest risk is that the person happens to be under 18 years of age, which is about 10%.
The governor of West Virginia announced a party change.
Thursday night, Jim Justice, Governor of the West Virginia Democratic Party, announced at President Trump's rally that he would change the party.
"You like it or you don't like it, the Democrat has left me," said the governor's judge.
"Today, after a lot of prayers and a lot of thinking, I'm going to tell you... today I'm going to tell you as a West Virginian that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor."
The rally broke out and cheered.
"So tomorrow, I'll turn the Republican Party into the Republican Party," Justin added.
"As a coach, I'm gonna tell you it's time to start another game."
Trump promised to make a major announcement at an earlier rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42% of the vote in West Virginia, and Justin didn't support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justin was selected as the only billionaire in the state in 2016.

Sebastian Ko applauds Russia's "thankful" apology for the stimulant scandal.
On Thursday, Sebastian Ko, President of the International Association of Athletics and Athletics, expressed appreciation for Russia's apology for the stimulant scandal and stated that the apology was “open”, but reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to re-engage in the campaign.
The President of the Russian Association of Athletics and Athletics, Mitri Shilakdin, stated at the International Congress on Fields on the eve of the World Athletics Championship that his country was rightly banned from participating in the campaign and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said he regretted that "all the athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were deprived of medals."
Despite his comments, the Congress voted to maintain the ban. Previously, the report of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) mentioned evidence of Russian state-sponsored doping, which was implemented in November 2015.
"I think today's response was very frank and very frank," told the journalist.
“The entire Council and the General Conference of the Federation are happy ... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has experienced a very burning period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can retake the game.”
He said he was also "happy" that Russia accepted the criteria for re-entry.
"I think it's a very constructive day, and I think we've made some progress, but the UTA General Assembly supports the Panel's recommendations, and it's not the time to reinstate Russia's candidacy," said the Section.
“We need to do what we can to normalize this situation in the coming months.
Our guiding principle has been the desire to separate innocent athletes from the contaminated system," he added.

The Federal Reserve published a book on the economy, showing that almost all 12 Federal Reserve regions reported moderate to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018, and remained optimistic about the prospects for the current year.
Meanwhile, unemployment in the United States remained at 4.1 per cent in December, the lowest since 2000, and businesses are expected to increase their wages in the coming months.

Marketers have pointed out that, in recent times, the ECB’s monetary policy has tightened and is expected to boost the euro’s exchange rate, that the dollar index has fallen continuously, and that the renminbi’s exchange rate against the dollar has accordingly increased rapidly, although it is unlikely that the ECB will quickly adjust its policy stance, that the short-term fluctuations in foreign exchange markets will eventually return to basics, and that it is likely that the renminbi’s exchange rate will continue to function smoothly.
It is worth noting that the attractiveness of renminbi assets to offshore investors has become increasingly apparent as markets become more stable in expectations of the renminbi.
The Chinese People ' s Bank of China authorized the China Foreign Exchange Trading Centre to publish that the median value of the exchange rate of the renminbi in the foreign exchange market between banks on January 18, 2018 would be: US$ 1 against the renminbi 6,4401; US$ 1 against the renminbi 7.8482; JPY 100 against the renminbi 5.7854; HK$ 1 against the renminbi 0.82399; US$ 1 against the renminbi 8.9017; US$ 1 against the renminbi 5.1302; NZ$ 1 against the renminbi 4.6779; US$ 1 against the renminbi 4.8546; US$ 1 against

What effect does football financial rules have on Neymar's transition to Paris?
The rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending by the European Haomen Football Club will not prevent Nemal from moving from the Barcelona Club in Spain to the St. Germain Football Club in Paris (PSG) in France at record prices.
The consequence is that the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has further downgraded the St. Germain Football Club in Paris. The Union of European Football Associations is the governing body of European football games and has the right to ban teams from participating in widely appreciated Eurocunna leagues.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules (FFP) launched by the European Federation in 2011 meant that the Paris Club of St. Germain Football would eventually have to prove that Nemal's transfer would receive financial support without causing huge losses.
Barcelona Club has already paid 222 million euros ($262 million), merely to pay for the cancellation of the Brazilian player, whose salary will be as high as tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Nemal's transfer to France.
Considering that the team is funded by the rich Qatari ruling family, the St. Germain Football Club in Paris can certainly sign Nemal in cash and include him in the team of other stars.
Clubs can spend a lot of money on buying players, but they have to use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge amount of money spent so that they can achieve a balance of gains and losses in football-related operations.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules were conceived by Michel Platini after he was elected President of the Federation in 2007.
According to the former French player, if banks or owners withdraw support funds for clubs that are heavily indebted for success, they are actually deceiving and putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from club debt to club loss monitoring.
This change means that Rome? The business model used by Roman Abramovich when he acquired the Chelsea Club in 2003, namely to buy a club with potential and then spend a lot of money to improve the team and create a global brand, is now in a much harsher position.
During the three-year rule assessment period up to 2018, the club may lose 30 million euros.
Aleksander Ceferin, a successor to the European Federation of Football Leagues, remains committed to stopping excessive spending, despite Abu being devalued by the incumbent president in 2015.
"Of course, the Rules have not lapsed, and we will certainly strengthen future regulations." Andrea Traverso, in charge of matters related to the Rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although the St. Germain Football Club in Paris will pay Nemal's buyout terms in one lump sum, it can also distribute amounts according to accounting purposes for the duration of the contract.
Nemal has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee may show a cost of 44.4 million euros in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of Rule sanctions imposed in 2014 brought the most severe sanctions to the St. Germain Football Club in Paris and the Manchester City Club under Abu Dhabi.
The St. Germain Football Club in Paris was fined Euro60 million ($82 million at the exchange rate at the time), which was reduced to Euro20 million, and demanded that the team be reduced to 21 instead of the normal 25 players during the 2014-15 season.
The Federación Fédération européenne is looking at clubs that try to increase their income by linking up with club owners and deceive financial regulators.
Although Qatari companies can sponsor the St. Germain Football Club in Paris, if the amount of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market price, the Federation will not consider it a legitimate income.
This happened in 2014, when the Federation ruled that the amount of the Qatar Tourist Board ' s sponsorship of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris had been overstated.
It was reported that a portion of Nemal's income at St. Gilman's Football Club in Paris might come from payments made by the Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee in 2022.
However, both the St. Germain Football Club in Paris and the Organizing Committee denied that Nemal would be an ambassador to the World Cup, and such an initiative would be easy for the regulatory bodies of the European Federation.
The recent sanctions imposed on the St. Germain Football Club in Paris mean that the Federation will be more vigilant about any attempt to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, informed sources said that the Federation had not engaged in pre-discussions with the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris about Nemal's transfer.
The above-mentioned individuals contacted the Associated Press in an anonymous capacity only because they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris.
According to the last published accounts, the operating income of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris was Euro542.4 million in 2015-16 and more than Euro10 million in profits.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not yet been published.
The Club de Football St. Germain in Paris anticipates that the Guild of Nemal will bring the evangelical benefits of sponsoring events, franchising and sales of jerseys.
The club expects to increase the collection by at least 30% after signing Nemal.
Obviously, seeing the most famous players leave, the Spanish Union is deeply angry at the attempt to block Nemal's move and claims that the St. Germain Football Club in Paris violated the Rules.
"This is a clear example of a "financial stimulant" according to the Spanish newspaper AS. The club and the country are the same" means the Qatar with the ultimate ownership of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris.
Arsene Wenger, head coach of the Arsenal team (the club's owner is the American sports tycoon), has reservations about the attitude of the state-funded club and about the WAA game.
"This is the consequence of ownership, which has completely changed the entire ecology of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"When the state owns the club, everything will happen.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, as there are many different ways or interests for a country to demand that large players represent a country.”

The story was recapitulated in memory of actors during the wind and light years of the 1980s and the garbage era of the 1990s (David Wayne and Michael Seward produced sketches for MTV The Nation before and after); it was also a memory of the past itself and of the year 2001; before that, a number of stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Luther, had not yet come to life.
As a cultural art, it is an imitation and reflection of our permanent memory of the Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is running out.
The first day of the camp echoed strongly, but it wasn't just because of its absurd humor. (Theater was about original stories about a talking vegetable canned, by H. Jon Benjamin.)
The double use of cynics in dramas -- middle-aged actors playing kids at the age of trouble -- makes it impossible to go back to the past and become a funny part of it.

But Detective Twins is so dedicated to creating a loud and genuine comedy - a killer with a Reagan mask in the play - and it usually plays that role.
The television of the six episode was slightly delayed, and the comedy effect was not released quickly or frequently enough.

In recent interviews, journalists learned that the northeast trades of steel, rail traffic, ships, machinery manufacturing, etc. have generally suffered a decline or even losses.
According to some experts, under the current circumstances, the new round of revitalization of Northeast industry is not only related to the economic recovery of the entire country, but will also have an impact on the long-term development of our manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, and is therefore in urgent need of adjustment and transformation.
The general decline in corporate efficiency and the loss of traditional industries to the production of raw materials industries and heavy machinery and equipment is a major decline and even a loss, and is the primary manifestation of the low economic performance of mid- and north-east industries in the current round.
In the past, the lower end of the economy was mainly characterized by high impact on primary products, but in this case, both high end and low end industrial products from traditional Northeast industries were affected.
The Saddle Steel Group (Webbo) began with the restructuring of products in previous years, focusing on the development of high-end panels such as container boards, steel tracks, shipboards and civil household panels, yet sales of these varieties have declined considerably this year, especially the sales of board have fallen by 50 per cent over the same period last year.
Saddle steel shares (Hao Kyung-soon, Director of the Metallurgical Department of the Liaoning Industrial and Communications Committee, described metallurgical gold as the third pillar of Liaoning ' s industry, with 60 million tons of iron and steel production capacity per year in third place in the country.
In January-May of this year, Liaoning Province produced 2,154 million tons of rough steel. The production and marketing of the products needed for projects that are strongly built by local governments and encouraged by State policy is better. The sharp decline in the more competitive products of the market is another feature of the manufacturing industry in the northeast.

There were no banners, no tea cups, or even a bottle of ordinary mineral water, on the premises of the Guang'an exhibition centre.
Instead, it was replaced by a simple banner, a meeting location, a simple environmentally friendly paper file bag with conference materials, and a green paper cup filled with tea.
The meeting materials were thinner than before, and several pieces of paper summed up the theme and agenda of the meeting.
"Conservation is for the people, and it must be for the economy. We understand and welcome the return to a simple and realistic meeting environment today." The Guangan City People's Congress, on behalf of Wang Sung, said that they wanted to see and participate in an efficient, pragmatic, non-formatist meeting.

10 February news: The journalist learned yesterday from the Changzhou City Agriculture Committee that this year, building on the successful creation of a national forest city in 2016, Changzhou City will deepen the implementation of the National Forest City Building Master Plan (2014-2025) in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, consolidate the achievements of national forest city construction and build a green, harmonious and high-quality forest city for all.
The Bank of England will maintain a 0.25% interest rate.
The Bank of England would announce at a later date that interest rates would remain unchanged, and earlier weak economic growth and easing inflation had dashed hopes for upturns.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue to be “weak” because it controlled interest rates while strengthening household incomes.
The Bank ' s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers decided to maintain a 0.25 per cent interest rate with a 6-2 vote, while a few members this month called for higher interest rates, even though weak economic growth has weakened the upturn.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced growth projections to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, respectively, and issued warnings that household income contraction would continue, while inflation would skyrocket to nearly 3 per cent in autumn.
But it suggests that interest rates will need to be raised in the coming years in order to contain the inflation associated with Europe, while borrowing costs may need to be raised even more substantially than expected in the financial markets.
A year ago, under the influence of Europe, a large-scale economic promotion policy was implemented, and members voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce the suspension of the regular financing scheme and start providing low-cost funding to banks from February next year, although the Bank claims that under the plan, the Bank will now need an additional Pound15 billion over Pound115 billion.
In the minutes of interest rate decision-making meetings, the Bank of England stated: "In the MPC's core forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) is still weak in the near future, as real household income contraction will continue to suppress consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for “a certain monetary policy tightening” to suppress inflation and the need for a “greater degree” than market expectations.
The market is now expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year and for the second time in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that any upturn would be “slow” and “restrictive”.
The Bank's growth projections for this year and next year show a downward trend, compared with the projections for May of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The Bank maintains a forecast of 1.8% growth in 2018.
The exchange rate of the pound has fallen against the United States dollar, and the euro has followed.
The exchange rate of the pound has fallen by 0.5 per cent against the United States dollar, to 1.31, and by 0.4 per cent against the euro, to 1.11.
Prior to the decision to stay unchanged, the rising expectations were dashed by recent unoptimistic growth data. GDP rose to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
The bank claims that growth in the third quarter may have remained at 0.3 per cent, although it will increase slightly by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report by the Bank of England did not bring any good news to ordinary households, which were hit by inflation surges, and wage growth was negligible, because it claimed that austerity would get worse before it got better.
It was also said that monetary policy “cannot prevent” the impact on income over the next few years, but wages are expected to recover “on a large scale” at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, the economy will be stimulated to offset some of the effects of low consumption due to the devaluation of the pound sterling and a significant increase in demand for British commodities.
One year before the decision was made, the shocking European Union referendum caused the pound sterling to fall sharply, and interest rates fell to 0.25 per cent in August.
The Bank of England estimates that it may take four years to fully influence prices and the British economy.
Until the bank announces its latest interest rate ruling, the call to raise interest rates will be heard, as inflation has added to the already stressful average household, while three policymakers have called for interest rates to rise to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the Bank of England claims it is expected and will rise again in the coming months.
The line called relative to its 2% target, the excess is already the final bottom line of the weak pound.
Andrew Monterreyk, director of the Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent fall in interest rates, the mortgage market seems to be once again becoming more competitive, as lenders strongly call for more business and look forward to a positive end this year.
For those who may be nearing the end of existing transactions, such markets seem particularly beneficial, as re-collateralization (many are free of charge and interest rates are low) is increasingly popular.

The British National Health Service (NHS) has a controversial HIV drug with a green light.
The patient will be able to obtain "transformational" HIV preventive treatment starting in September after the high court's decision to provide drug support for NHS has come to an end.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylactic drug (PreEP), a drug that could be taken before sexual intercourse, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection among high-risk populations by about 86%. Health services will now provide the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary trial.
It agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal supported the High Court ruling last year, which stated that while NHS claimed that local authorities should fund the drug, NHS had the right to pay for the prEP.
The announced action on Thursday was described by the UK NHS Chief Executive Officer Simon Stevens as a "big new intervention", while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "critical moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first registered sexual health clinics. More clinics will join in October, followed by full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylactic (PreEP) is an HIV drug that is administered prior to sexual activity to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The experiment shows that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PEP before sexual intercourse means there's enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include homosexuals, bisexual males, transgender people and positive HIV carriers who have not successfully received treatment.
The clinic will determine whether eligible participants, including men, women, transgender persons and their sexual partner HIV status are unknown for antiretroviral treatment.
Persons who reside in England and register as general practitioners may also register at their local sexual health clinics.
The program will cost Pound10 million, while NHS England has signed a contract to purchase these drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The experiment aims to assess the full potential of PEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is located, absorbed and implemented on the basis of large samples.
Mr. Stevens said, "This major new intervention should complement and reinforce HIV prevention with a broad and increasingly successful approach.
This is another milestone in 30 years of action worth making progress in addressing the major health challenges of humankind.”
Chief Executive Officer Deborah King of the United Kingdom AIDS Trust said, "This is a crucial moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target people in need and at risk, then pre-exposure prophylaxis offer the possibility of changing the UK AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, the HIV-risk population will obtain a new, licensed tool through the NHS-funded experiment in England, which is truly self-executing without consulting with sexual partners, which will bring about improvements in the lives of many people.
We agree with the announcement's hands.”
Terrence Higgins Trust Chief Executive Officer Ian Green said, "The priority now is to make sure that the test is quickly rolled out throughout the country and that none of the people infected with HIV are left behind.
Now that we've bought PEP experimental drugs, we're ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV."
Shadow Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgeson said, "After months of delay and government delays, the start of PrEP's first test was popular and should have come earlier.
Evidence shows how this drug can bring about change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This experiment will give us a better understanding of the advantages of PEP.
It is now very important that this experiment be launched as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect people exposed to HIV and help us further to end the spread of HIV in society.”

High-quality life: using attics and smart designs to make the small apartment of the Countess Palace a spacious home
Joanne Ray, once a banker, was very keen on renovating her house, and in 2014 she moved from her big house on the Knight Bridge to a small condo at the Countial Palace.
This apartment is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Queen's balcony -- Joanne didn't pack her bags and sell it -- a powerful proof of the new design.
"Before then, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a bigger house on Knightbridge," Joanne said.
"I was looking for the right house with the offer.
I saw this apartment at the Count's Palace, and it's a very tall ceiling.
I'd like to make an offer on the same day."
This 1,000 square feet apartment has now been completely overhauled since the first house visit.
This apartment was originally a complex one-room layout -- one that needed to pass through the kitchen to get to the bedroom -- and Joanne wanted to increase storage space and attic to take full advantage of the full ceiling height.
"I want tall ceilings, big windows, enough light.
That's what I asked," she said.
To that end, she hired Elvan Azadi from the Duck&Shed Building and Design Studio (in Notting Hill) to use this 12.5-foot-high ceiling to build a family. It's not just a development project, it's a place where Joanne lives.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to increase two spaces up and down, so the building challenge is to create an attic that is high enough to stand up.
Elvan has to think creatively in order to solve this problem.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
“We must arrange space for it to be displayed up and down, without the need to shrug backs.
It's not just about building a simple platform, it's about starting up the steel so it can be at the right level to function."
Through this arrangement, Ervan was able to get two rooms in the space -- a lot of interesting elements that could be added.
The penthouse uses the rectangular copper windows of the Retrouvius brand to overlooking the fascinating areas of life.
The golden furniture with mirrors, the small silver furniture and the regenerative light of Sergei Mouille laid down the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Putting mirrors on both ends of the short corridor will make them look longer.
In the kitchen, the splatter with the mirror is like a window leading to another room.
At the Precious Gate, small cells with mirrors provide Joanne with storage space for the storage of dishes and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an attractive sense of space to put the kitchen away when it is not used.
The folding kitchen is not fresh.
But the unique thing about this folding kitchen is a garage-style lift door.
"This is about knowledge in some engineering fields," Ellfan explains the reinforced steel fence on the MDF gate.
"This is a balance principle, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide."
Joanne obtained an additional 16 square metres, an extra bedroom and an improved layout as a result of the clever use of space and storage.
"In the end, you sell the size of the house -- or your property is valued on the basis of the size of the house," Elvan said.
"By and large, real estate agents walk into the room and calculate according to the size of the floor."
They will try to increase the occupied space while using high-quality materials, thus bringing a sense of luxury to the space.
Elvan said, "Technology is your choice, so it helps to create emotional bonds in the home."
"You won't love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they won't hold your heart."
It has proved that, through good design and the addition of extra space, standard apartments can shake to surprise you.
Actually, you might as well live like Joanne.

26 July news: On 22 July, journalists learned from Red Bridge that the city's largest river belt park was completed and opened to citizens free of charge.

Two brothers in the 500-million-dollar real estate empire fight.
Forty years after the founding of the dynasty in his Italian family, two brothers fought for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million.
The former director and developer of Carlton's Football Club Colin De Lutis lives in a mansion in Tukara district, and the three doors are at his brother Paul's residence. The latter sued him in the Supreme Court on the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have had a heated debate on the division of assets in the Supreme Court.
The brothers and their mothers together owned 38 real estates worth more than $500 million, which had accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in Colinwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually developed it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold it for $85 million.
After that, the money was invested in real estate. At present, the De Lutis family's portfolio includes city office buildings, the Brenrich and Solento development projects, the Golden Coast and Blue Hill apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, who his brother Paul called the "principal promoter and dominant figure" of the De Lutis family, owned about two thirds of the company's assets, while Paul made up about one third.
According to the paper submitted to the Tribunal, Colin owned property valued at $316 million on conversion, while Paul owned property valued at $176 million.
Paul came to think that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the negotiations.
"Colin's proposal for the division of property left him what I thought was the best property," he wrote in a first court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several failed mediations.
Now, the brothers are still fighting for control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has kicked him out of the game.
Colin denied it and accused Paul of poor management of certain real estate properties.
In the early affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed a desire to settle the dispute.
"My Italian tradition determines that family is the most important option. My Italian origin determines family is the most important," he wrote.
The cost of the case is rising and hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails, company reports submitted by Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC and other top law firms, as well as senior lawyers engaged by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were all Italian immigrants. They started running general food shops and deli shops in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brenrich in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy Colin Wood's property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said, "I was in third grade," where he started Westco, "Paul was very small at the time (about ten years old).
Anna de Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to be able to pass on their property peacefully to their son.
"Luigui often said to me that he never wanted his brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of De Lutis Group, Colin paid Mark $10 million to leave the company and $26 million to Luke.
Paul said that both Luke and Mark were “unsatisfied with their property division clause”.
According to the biography published by television star Eddie McGuire to hand over in 2015, Colin has been keeping a low profile despite being a former board member of the AFL Club.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyer on Friday.
But only Colin replied by text message. He said that because the case had been brought to court, "I really can't say much."
"My brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family business to court, which is very, very sad," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to satisfy his brother ' s demands.
He said, "Our father doesn't want to see Paul and I end up in a dispute like this," adding that he still has hope for a settlement of the dispute."
Friday, that hope seems to be dashed.
"Our problems will be resolved through the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.

Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the President's media time.
Others have tried, but all failed.
John F. Kelly might really be able to do it.
If that's true, then he's the first.
According to US political news website Politico, the new White House Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump — including media reports — in order to ensure greater stability for the big boss.
Here's a quote from the journalist Josh Dauth:
"When the new Chief of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, gathered for discussion with senior officials on his first day of work, he pointed out that he wanted to solve one of the main problems of President Trump's admission to the White House: bad information in the hands of the President."
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the President make better decisions, so the message needed to go through his hand, whether in writing or in the form of a briefing.
Kelly's diagnosis looks like it, but others tried to tame it by watching Trump's media time, but eventually failed.
President Trump's television addiction has a long history — and his habit of watching television is still deepening in the White House.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Naberg told Politico that "if the candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, it would be useful for him to know that he has received positive coverage through credible channels as well.
"In the light of the experience of the six former campaign officials, the habit of controlling Trump's tweets was to ensure that certain praises were always included in the media messages he personally received."
It's totally okay.
But Trump's Twitter habit of being “controlled” is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know — that if they hadn't intervened, Trump's Twitter would have been even more aggressive.
We probably never know those tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff were able to save him from the fire, even a few times, their efforts would be worth it.
But no one can keep Trump from being controversial.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, a group of competing groups, people promote their world view by submitting potentially reliable or unreliable information to Trump, and play the game.
Politico — both about this story — reported in May on advisers' preferences for providing suspicious information to the President strategically.
This is an example of what the journalist Shane Goodmancher described:
“The current and former Trump officials say that Trump's reaction to negative news clips is like volcanic eruptions, especially those with destructive information leaks, and he's crazy about trying to find out where it came from.
At the end of February, the president received a malicious copy of an article on the website of Charles C. Johnson, GotNews.com, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff, Katie Walsh, of being the "source of the vast amount of information leaked" to the White House, as was the case with Trump.
Even if Johnson had been permanently banned by Twitter for harassment, no concrete evidence had been provided, and he had blown up a lot of false accusations, which were later openly denied.
Trump read the article and started asking officials about Walsh.”
Goodmancher also said that the then Chief of Staff, Reines Pribas, and the White House secretary, Robert Potter, “had tried to set up a system to manage and record documents received by Trump”.
What happened?
Kelly's going to do the same thing in three months.
Maybe he can prove himself to be a more efficient manager than Pribas, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump whose assistant still competes with each other and competes for influence.
These constant influence factors will make Kelly's task even harder.
Traveling town: how the wind gets drunk
[Summary] The potential of Zhejiang town is gradually awakened.
Today, these towns have become important destinations for tourists who travel to China to appreciate the waters of Zashan, read the culture and feel the pain of the country, and will also provide important support to our provincial efforts to build the "Poetry Zhejiang" China's most beautiful tourist destination.
♪ Winning in style ♪
"Society plays go with the moon rise, and weenie smells with the wind.
The traditional handicrafts such as Xiao Xing and Anchanggu town, where the traditional crafts such as buckets, bamboo edibles, iron strikers, shoes, flower pickers, cotton spins, etc. are seen everywhere, have amply demonstrated the intangible cultural heritage of the town of Anchanggu. Quartet tourists are indulging in the atmosphere of experience of Xiao Xianjin folk culture and the historical culture of Xiao Xin Xinjin.
According to the information received, during the three days of New Year's holiday, there were more than 65,000 visitors to Anchanggu Town.
In Zhejiang, a small town like the town of Anchanggu, star Xu Xiaobang Xiaogang, which has a warm and tender contract with the town of Jiangnan, the white wall of the state ' s 28th, which talks about the end of the millennium in the ancient town, and the fishermen of the town of Ishigang, Taiwan, who draw pictures that outline the lives of traditional and modern-day fishermen ... these towns are the "sumbing treasures" of the Xijiang tourism and the "heart Love" of the
In recent years, the potential of Zhejiang town has been gradually awakened as the development of tourism across our province has advanced.
In 2016, the Office of the Provincial Government officially released the " Implementation Scheme for the Creation of Tourism and Tourism Townships in Zhejiang Province " , proposing to receive and nominate 100 or so popular, eco-friendly, tourist and tourist-oriented provincial towns throughout the province over a period of about five years.
Today, these towns have become important destinations for tourists who travel to China to appreciate the waters of Zashan, read the culture and feel the pain of the country, and they will also provide important support to our provincial efforts to build the "Poetry Zhejiang" China's most beautiful tourist destination.
The relevant head of the provincial tourism bureau explained that, in the light of the trend towards the creation of a tourist-friendly town, we now place greater emphasis on the creation of a personalized tourism industry in the towns and cities of the provinces. New tourism projects and industrial formations have flourished, giving tourists a rich experience and winning a good reputation.
Focus on promotion
Recently, the Xijiang Province Tourism Bureau and Zhejiang Daily News Group hosted the Xijiang News Group, which hosted the All Media Center for Tourism of the Xinjiang Group to share Xijiang artists and the Xijiang City for Poetry? The Xijiang Tourist Town Festival was held at the Xijiang Province Exhibition.
"The windy town has the beauty of art and the temperature of life.
The style of small towns lies in original juice, original taste, native country, an original ecology pure.
"The Chinese Academy of Fine Arts and Film Animated Art Faculty teacher, the front-line film advertising director Xie Changfeng, and the director of the Chinese University of Metrology Institute of Arts and Communications Professor Xu Hsiao Xiao Xiao, among others, told the cross-border stories of small towns such as Small Village Renovation in the Camera.
Many of Zhejiang's tourist towns have deep cultural resources, and the new town from the south of the city of Huzhou has been set up on the scene to read the country's south.
Jiangnan's style has been popular with painters since ancient times, and now the town of Nanjinggu is cooperating deeply with such art schools as China's American Academy.
Tourism-friendly small towns need to be characterized by weather factors, tourism factors, service elements and environmental factors.
In this context, tourism services and environments are also important components.
A timely umbrella in rainy days would also allow tourists to experience the town's style better.
In this age of sharing, the hottest shared umbrella of the shared umbrellas of the Poetry Zhejiang version was customized by Zhejiang in conjunction with the All Media Centre for Tourist Tourist of Zhem, hoping to promote the idea of "Sharing? Green" and to raise the awareness and common sense of civilized tourism among tourists and residents of small towns in order to work together to share a wonderful tourism environment.
This became one of the bright spots of the "Poetry Zhejiang?" 2017 Zhejiang tourist-like town promotion campaign.
Looking forward to it.
To date, Zhejiang Province has published the first 21 provincial tourism towns to create lists and 115 provincial tourism towns to foster lists.
As a priority area for development during the "13th Five-Year" period of rural tourism, windy towns will eventually be built into tourist attraction areas above level 3A, which will become a new model for diversity of tourism products, tourism efficiency and industrial integration to win.
The key to the attraction of a tourist town is the taste of its original juice.
The beauty of tourist-friendly towns stems not only from the blighting water of small bridges, but also from long-standing cultural traditions; rural renewal stems from cultural self-confidence.
Throughout the world, the Dutch town of Lisser, the Austrian town of Halstadt, and the French town of pumpkin, with tulips, “salts” and pumpkins as their core attractions, attract large numbers of tourists from around the world each year and enable tourism to boost the economy of small towns.
For windy towns, the focus of `focusing on identity, staying in the village' gives the town a distinct personality and soul, more so as to provide cultural immersion, to carry the local literature, and to highlight the culture of the countryside.
Tourism-like towns, bound by culture and rural sorrow, carry humanities and landscapes, connect Quadrian tourists, and allow traditional culture and culture to carry on and innovate in the shared building.
In essence, tourist-friendly small towns are complex open tourist attractions and should be built together by local residents and foreign tourists and even by tourists.
As the main battleground for future tourism growth, tourist-like towns may not only change the ecological profile of villages, the way in which economic and social development takes place, and the direction in which industrial elements flow, but they are also an important force in bridging the urban-rural infrastructure divide and awakening the revival of rural culture.
The Zhejiang tourist town will present a richer story in the tide of accelerated rural revitalization.
According to data, 70 per cent of China ' s travel needs are concentrated within 3 km, so the entire short-distance travel market will be shared bicycles sooner or later.
The Japanese Financial News reports that inflationary pressures will increase as a result of the fiscal expansion policies of the next Trump regime, and the rate of interest increase in 2017 will accelerate.
The annual International Consumer Electronic Exhibition (CES) was opened in Las Vegas, United States, from 9 January (10 January Beijing time) to 12 January.

These "breaths" are nothing compared to the huge output of the annual coverage of 13,000 television dramas by the Guardian.
The renter negotiated the ditch and returned to Rich Man Street.
Some of the richest owners of the Western Midrands region have once again argued with determined tenants who have consulted on a ditch that the Government has dug up and demanded the return of land outside the luxury house.
The tenants parked 20 of their trailers in an open area outside of Solihe Street, which was crowned "The Richest Street".
The tenants, holding the horses, carrying the baby and leading the RV convoy, returned once they were expelled in May, and the “Save of the City” dug up by the municipal authorities did not prevent their entry.
The lean and seasoned team found a gap in the line of defense, and although there was no roadblock to pass, their vehicle was squeezed through the gap.
The angry residents criticised the Solihull Council Commission, saying that it “did a bad job dealing with the problem”.
A resident who didn't want to be famous said, "They arrived there on Monday night, before coming to Benlis Street, throwing stones at passers-by.
The Committee should be ashamed of what they did, because they were nothing to deal with.
The tenants came here in May and were subsequently expelled, and now they're back.
There's been a lot last night, probably more today."
She added: "The Birmingham City Council knows how to handle it by enforcing a long-term ban to protect its park.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and if the council can't stop something like this, I'm not willing to continue paying municipal taxes.
A local resident who didn't want to reveal his name said, "This is ridiculous. We just saw the last group of tenants leave, just for the sake of another group to destroy.

A woman spokesperson for the Solihr Commission said, "We know that unauthorized camping is taking place in an open area on Schultzbrook Road, and now we cooperate with the Solihr police and take the necessary legal action to get them out of here as soon as possible.
In order to support us in collecting evidence, it is important that as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal activity to the police by calling 101.
This will help us outline the situation for the Court's review when we refer the case to the Court.”

Italy has a tough attitude towards the non-governmental organization Migrant Rescue Ship
Italy warned non-governmental organizations operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue carrying out relief unless new operational regulations were signed.
Home Affairs Minister Marco Minniti, in an interview with the Daily newspaper Turin, said: "If NGOs do not sign new codes of conduct, it's hard to see what they're going to do."
The day before Minnity's warning, Italian officials detained the crew of a German aid organization, “Youth Rescue”, on board a ship, on suspicion that they actually colluded with traffickers to assist illegal immigrants.
The aid organization operated for only one year and refused to comment on the specific subject of charges by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartocio.
In a social media statement, the organization said, "To us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing now, so we regret not being able to operate in search and rescue zones at this time."
"When all the information is collected, we can only assess all the allegations and situations at this time."
The Italian official has been watching the Iuventa from October.
Its crew is suspected of carrying migrants brought directly from small boats by traffickers, and allows smugglers to flee in haste and re-use ships.
According to the prosecutor ' s file, at least one such meeting allegedly took place at sea 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast. The document was published by the Italian media.
Its crew was suspected of blatant disregard for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversaw rescue operations in the area out of humanitarian enthusiasm and not for any other motive.
According to the code of conduct, ships like Iuventa clearly require an Italian police officer to supervise their activities on board the ship.
At present, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code of conduct: Save the Children, the migrant maritime aid station in Malhe, and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new provisions to be unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not cause any “significant change and obstruction” to its relief operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins sans frontières (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti claims that there has been a sharp drop in the number of immigrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guards and to unite local mayors have begun to bear fruit.
The minister said, "In recent days, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel."
He announced plans for in-depth talks this month: to discuss economic development activities with Libyan mayors, and to discuss with Chad, Niger and Mali how to reduce the number of migrants who wish to leave those countries for Europe.
According to Ping, the chief financialist at the Transport Bank, the growth in industrial value added is expected to accelerate to 6.6 per cent in December, as industry added value in the first three quarters of 2017 appears to be high at the end of the season.
The cumulative increase in fixed asset investments in December is expected to be 7.2 per cent, the same as last month, which is lower than last year.
Industrial production, although weak in October, remained almost the same as in November.
Our manufacturing investment was running low in December, but capital investment has improved slightly, so capital investment is expected to level in November.

Beijing's new initiative of “high school relieving”: the North Chemical Industry will host thousands of students and teachers in the new campus in Changping.
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Beijing Chemical University was held in Changping District, Beijing, and the 1,800 acres of green campus was officially operational.
Journalists learned from the ceremony that, in order to strengthen the central function of the capital and to manage the “big city disease”, in recent years, in the context of the concerted development and defusion of non-capital functions in Kyunjin, Beijing has accelerated the process of dissipation of central city high schools to suburban areas, and some students and teachers of higher education schools are moving to new suburban campuses such as Hyo, Da Hing and Hiyayama.
The new school district of the North Chemical Industry, located in Changping south entrance town, occupies 1,800 acres of land 40 kilometres from the city, and is one of the priority projects of the Beijing city to defuse non-capital functions.
The construction of the new school is divided into three phases, the construction of the current phase is complete, the construction of the second phase is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year, and the plan will meet the study and life needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduates, graduate students and teaching staff.
As we look back at this year's film market, we find that the original text of the film and the two crowds of participating stars form an important part of the intended audience of the film.
Today, at 1710 hours, the 119th command centre of the city of Xiaoyang received a warning that there had been a fire in the storage of the tetrahydrofurans at the Hosnife factory located in Longshu Tong, in the city's two Qing district.
The Xiaoyang City Fire Squad immediately deployed five squadrons of 20 fire trucks to the scene with heavy chemical suits, anti-chemistry cleaners, etc.
After preliminary detection, fires occurred in small storage tanks where chemical substances such as tetrahydrofurans were stored, producing larger smoke at the site.
As at the time of press release, firefighters and soldiers were struggling to rescue, and the city health, security, environmental protection, security, traffic and so on went to the scene and no casualties were observed.
Michelle Carter was sentenced for texting to encourage Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and telephone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20 years old, will be serving 15 months' imprisonment, after which he may be converted to probation. Plus 5 years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of not intentionally premeditated murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is heartbroken.
My son is my best friend."
While awaiting appeal, Carter was allowed to keep his personal freedom.
She faced a maximum of 20 years imprisonment, but her lawyers believed that she and Mr. Roy were both mentally ill.
At the time of sentencing, Carter stood up, wore red pants and rice coats, held his hands tight, had tears in both eyes and looked down.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended her life for better living.
She didn't take responsibility”, the prosecutor said.
"She doesn't have any remorse."
But Carter's lawyer says it's "a terrible consequence, she feels very sorry."
Justice Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, would have any significant impact on her behaviour".
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying, "I haven't had a day to grieve for losing my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of what I've done and what I've done. I'm trying to stand with his sisters in all my pain, and that pain will accompany us forever.
Mr. Roy's sister, Cady Roy, testified that she was “spiritual” because she realized that she could never attend her brother's wedding or become his child's aunt.
"The loss of a man who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and I will spend the rest of my life with it." she said.
This case seems to set a legal precedent, as the laws of Massachusetts do not provide for the guilt of encouraging others to commit suicide.
Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in the car in 2014; this year, Carter was 17 years old.
After Carter's text message revealed that she encouraged him to commit suicide, the case drew national attention.
"There are many ways to hang, jump, stab herself." She said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death; he was on vacation with his family.
During the period before he committed suicide, she wrote, "You need to do this, Conrad," and, "All you have to do is start the generator and then get free and happy."
Judge Monez said that Carter had drawn attention through Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are differences of law in this case.
Amanda Knox, one of the few people defending Carter, was accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and acquitted two years later.
The 30-year-old Ms. Knox said in a column published in The Los Angeles Times: "Michel? Carter deserves compassion and help, not imprisonment."

The journalist learned from the Lassard Net Land Basketball Club on 2nd that the Lassa Net Land Basketball Youth Team recently won fourth in the finals of the National Youth Basketball League in Beijing.
The Lassard Net Land Basketball Youth Team is made up of 11 native players, and the principal coach is In-sang Joo, Assistant Coach of the Lassard Net Land Basket Adult Team.
The Tibetan Basketball Kid before going to Beijing for the finals.
The director-general of the Lassard Net Land Basketball Club, Liang Jun, said to reporters that the team's performance had improved compared to last year, and that the self-confidence of the players and their confidence in the field had improved significantly. The exchanges between the players and other teams had been more comprehensive, and there had been more and easier on- and off-the-ground exchanges.
At the end of the game, Captain Jiangtsang said that he wanted to gain experience by participating in the game and to do his best for the Tibetan basketball cause.
It was understood that during the Beijing game, players had overcome factors such as low-altitude intoxication of oxygen and displayed the image of Tibet.
Despite the fact that the track is a gold medalist at the Olympics and that the tracker gets the world's share, the track name will be lower than the suction of gold.
Automotive manufacturers face shocks, and Audi will convert up to 850,000 diesel cars.
The day before Odie announced the conversion, BMW said it would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 cars.
BMW Chairman said that BMW believed that "driving has more intelligent choices than limits", meaning that major cities in Europe - including Munich, where BMW has its headquarters - consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe would be converted to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed to have done so as recall.
European automobile manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emissions requirements.
But nitrogen oxides emitted from diesel engines are considered carcinogens and may cause asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset diesel car tail gas emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of diesel vehicles.
As German car manufacturers faced censorship, the government led by Prime Minister Angela Merkel was accused of over-exercise of these powerful car companies and ignored the signs of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid repeating the popular pattern of covering up their use of so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions during vehicle tests to comply with regulations and returning to normal driving conditions.
Several public executives have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated by countries on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zacero Giovani Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected by extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the general public, and the German government accused Audi of installing systems to avoid European emissions requirements, expanding the scope of investigations previously limited to the United States.
Odie's investigation could have a significant impact on the general public: luxury car manufacturers account for a disproportionate share of the profits of the public automobile.
It is common for a film to take a year or two or even a few years from preparation to presentation.
The animated film, Big Fish Seagull, announced that it would be shown on July 8, 12 years from the time of preparation to the time of the launch!
Liang Xing, the original author of Big Fish Seagull, who was 21 years old from the heat power industry at the University of Qinghua, and a friend, Zhang Chun, who created the other side of the ship together, received a million dollars worth of venture investment in 2008 to co-create ideas, and launched an animated film troupe called Big Fish Seagull.
The film has won numerous national and international prizes during the creative sample phase and has been recorded and praised as one of the most outstanding works of art by the contemporary art centre of Pompidou, France.
Because of the six-year period from creativity to production, the film was referred to by millions of fans who looked forward to it.
The Great Fish Seagull tells a fairy tale that belongs to the Chinese. With the release of this pre-slated film, it brings new expectations to all viewers.
He said, "This is the only thing I've done for 12 years, and now it's turning from a dream to reality, and I'm both nervous and excited."
Zhang Chun said, "I'm going to drive the team crazy thinking about using 50% of the budget of others to produce exactly the same image effect as everyone else."
Dong-jung, the “world factory” that used to rely on raw materials processing and a large number of popularists, is looking at high-level people who can lead the repositioning of the city.

Provence lavender is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has become the symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but there is now bad news that it is threatened by climate change.
As a result of the persistent drought and the emergence of virus-carried insects, lavender is declining, causing headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The lavender of Provence is under great threat because the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, the spring rains have decreased significantly, and the fall has been dark.
This affects the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a small individual twig, a leaf twig that can spread microbacterial bacteria, and in very dry weather they will appear in large numbers."
The point is that it's huge.
In addition to attracting vacationers, Qingya's lavender has been promoted by the perfume and cosmetics industries.
Eric Chase said, "Contrary to the many big flowers that can open with long-sleeved plants, we have problems with smaller individuals, stunted, missing or weak.
That's why we have less oil."
The solutions being studied include the adoption of better irrigation techniques and the mitigation of evaporation of soil moisture, the spraying of a protective mixture of clay and water on a plant, and the development of more drought-resistant varieties.
Compared to the science fiction element in the film, the two starring shows that it's the story of the film that is more attractive to them.
On the afternoon of September 5th, the Washington City Journal reporter, who continued to interview a number of prominent people in the vocal world and two other vocal artists, was surprised that they were almost unanimous and silent.
One was the Berlin Film Emperor, one was an up-grading young actor, and "Psychiatry Crime" was also the first partner of Liaofan and Li Yi Feng.
Mexico is dangerous. Journalists were killed.
The staff of Riodoce's weekly newspaper usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans to report on the riots in Sinalo County caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
Today, however, the shadow of tragedy looms over themselves, and they come together to discuss security issues.
It's important that they are told to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what was more safe: whether their children should be brought to the office (which had been hit by a grenade in 2009) or whether they should be left at home.
The security expert wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemy, neutral and ally.
They asked the journalists to name themselves under each column — without the need for evidence, observation and intuition are enough.
Those suspected of being drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on government lists, or cartels, made Mexican reporting dangerous.
The violence has never stopped, and the country has a growing number of journalists: according to the Commission for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists have been under federal protection following attacks and threats; so far this year, at least 7 journalists have died in seven states.
The last person who died was their editor and inspirational source, as well as Javier Valdiz Cárdenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
Valdiz has written a lot of books about drug violence, and he wrote in one of them: "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist."
You can feel deeply that he has left, even though he is everywhere — a huge picture hanging on the front of the Riodoce office building, with Valdez with the middle finger and the word “justice”; the T-shirt of Aaron Ivala and Miriam Ramirez, two journalists in their 30-year-olds, also showed his smile, and he was wearing glasses or his symbolic Panamanian straw hat.
The seminar took place less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their common wounds, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special Federal Prosecutor ' s Office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists ' cases, according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, the Office prosecuted only two persons.
The majority of the thousands of criminal cases per year involved drug trafficking and organized crime, so the perpetrators of journalists ' killings could rarely be brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they insisted on reporting violent incidents in Sinalo County, even though they were heartbroken, even though the land was full of wounds.
Ivala said that without information about the killer and justice, it would be of little use to hold a security seminar.
He said, "It's stupid to waste time participating in seminars like this.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdiz left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, capital city.
His red Toyota Carola drove out of only a few blocks and was stopped by two men; they forced him to get out of the car and fired 12 shots, presumably because of the newspaper's name — translated into 12 Rivers.
The assailants left in his car and crashed it in the vicinity.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two grown-up children behind.
Kuliacan gossips four times.
But the subject of Valdiz actually has nothing but silence.
Since Guzmán was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battles in the country, and hostile forces have gone wild.
One or more people are shot every day in the streets of Sinaloa, and the graveyards are filled with two-storey mausoleums of drug lords, which are already commonplace.
The "quiet" state was temporarily forgotten when only one cartel controlled the coastal state and its port and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdiz was well aware of the dangers of the job, the 60-year-old founder and director of Riodoce, Ismail Pohoqui, felt guilty for failing to protect his friends.
He believed that two mistakes had caused the tragedy.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, who led a cartel that fought against Guzmán's sons.
The story may have provoked the sons; the newspaper was bought by suspected gang members as soon as it arrived at the newsstand.
The second mistake was that Valdiz had not been forced to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper covering the same story had been confiscated.
Valdiz was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death had great significance for Mexico ' s violence against journalists.
His spirit has survived, and his friends and colleagues believe that he has always been with us.
He was also a senior journalist of Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues in the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 dollars in shares.
Pohoqui said, "In Sinalo, it's impossible to walk on the news business without dealing with the drug problem."
With the passage of time, the newspaper has gained a good reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising have increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish investigative reports that directly hit important people without fear of censorship, and readers like to publish stories in newspapers that others dare not report.
Five years after its creation, Riodoce won the Maria Moskapo News Prize of the Latin American nation.
In the same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdiz International Prize for Freedom of the Press in recognition of his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug story.
He said he was scared, too.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the award, he said, "I want to live."
Later in the second half of October, in an interview with the local television station Rompeviente TV, he said, "Drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaro State.
You must assume the task of falling on your shoulders as a journalist — either that or pretending to be deaf or dumb.
I don't want to be asked, "Why don't you make a sound about what's happening in the face of so many deaths?"
All the staff of Riodoce miss Valdez, remembering him cursing like a dock worker, remembering a friend who never hesitated to embrace and advise, miss a teacher who knew how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar across from the office often sits on the same table.
Now, they'll ask, "Is it his daily habits that caused his crash?"
His death also forced them to think about how to do good work and live well.
Pohoqué said, "They don't like you causing trouble to their women and children, nor do they like you influencing their legitimate companies and secret airports used to transport drugs.
It's all over their bottom line."
The result is to maintain a high degree of self-censorship and self-protection, even in the safest times.
Trust your instincts.
If you smell dangerous, get away.
Andres Villariel, editor of Riodoce, said the question was, "The breath is a feeling of being deceived...and then something like Javier will happen."
He and others have said that the previous rules no longer apply to Sinaloa — just as they no longer apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where smuggling routes are lucrative and institutions are weak, government officials corrupt and smug.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff participated in security training, the use of mobile phones was suddenly not allowed; the spy software allegedly sold only to the Government a few days ago had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two policemen took a cool ride under the shade to avoid the temperature of 104 degrees (40 degrees centigrade).
They were sent by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce, located in a four-storey building in the middle class neighbourhood of Culiacan.
Some journalists joked about whether the police officers would be 50% of what the governor himself said.
Journalists have been going to the mountains for months, where drug cartels are under de facto control.
Riodoce covered three major events this week.
Among them was the murder of the brother of Julio César Chávez, a great former boxer from Sinalo County.
There is also the disclosure of government funds from the governor's hometown.
And the kidnapping in a expensive restaurant in Kuliakan, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
The official did not publish information about the abductees and the kidnapping process, so it was necessary to write down what the city knew: the restaurant was a destination for drug dealers and the authorities alike.
A journalist learned from the public file that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician of the ruling Revolutionary System Party (PRI), which dominated the political class almost throughout the past era.
Recently, several Revolutionary Institutional Party governors were accused of corruption in several highly valued cases.
Villariel asked journalists to write about what happened at the scene of the incident, including the escape of one of the sons of Mexico's biggest drug lord, Guzman, from a military attack.
If a few months ago, readers would look at Valdez's column and look for the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
46-year-old Verarill, who was called "Little Man" because he had a thin body, said, "We already knew what happened before.
Now all sources of information and communication channels have been cut off.
Valdiz's office is now being used to store signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists, because employees have become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, a journalist, Miriam Ramirez, took a sign and took it out of the room and went to the local prosecutor's office to attend a march in connection with another journalist.
El Salvador Adamé disappeared in the western state of Michoacán three days after Valdez was killed.
The official discovered a burnt body and claimed that according to DNA tests, this was his body.
Throughout the country, journalists became more vocal, organized protests and put the words "save the media" on sidewalks and buildings.
On that day, Director Pohokwe is not in Washington and he is trying to bring justice to the Valdiz case and to secure international support.
The day after Valdiz was killed, in a meeting with the Governor of Sinalo County, Ramirez accused the official of spying on journalists and killed them because they had told the truth.
Since her anger had affected her objectivity, she also asked to resign from reporting on government affairs.
Valditez has repeatedly reiterated that Mexican journalists are being “encouraged” by organized crime, fellow government officials and uninterested societies.
In his last book, Drug News, he wrote that journalists were not only maimed by drug cartels, but were on the list of politicians and security forces who were involved in organized crime.
Media Watch Group Articulo 19 blames police and public officials for more than half of the attacks on journalists last year.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up."
Obviously, these murders are chilling.
No one forgets that six years ago, Boss Maria Elizabeth Macias died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
She had a note next to her body allegedly signed by Zetas Cartel: "I came for my story."
Her head was cut off with a computer keyboard and headphone next to her.
After Miroslava Brech was killed in March, some newspapers chose to close down, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua State.
Others are continuing and the directors of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo were killed in 2014, but they are continuing.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke openly about the drug cartel with a front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled their homes or even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
It is difficult to find jobs in exile, and they still need to be careful and wary of danger on the streets.
Sometimes they were arrested and reportedly killed in 2015 by photographer Ruben Espinosa in a Mexican city with four women three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue to work behind the scenes, this is a routine step in high-risk decision-making.
Ivala wanted to be a poet, and he admitted reporting on the drug trade scared him.
He said, "Mexican is turning into hell, so I became a journalist."
In the middle of the last Friday, the latest issue of the newspaper was printed and the editors of Riodoce sat outside the office drinking beer and suddenly their cell phone rang.
A series of gunfights between rival gang forces and security forces near the beach resort city of Massatland confirmed 19 deaths.
The war is escalating, as a series of cartel information discovered in the region foresaw.
They uploaded the news to Riodoce's website just by the side of the road via their cell phones.
The next day's headline had to be changed.
The siren sounded nearby — there was another shootout in the area of a life-and-death duel.
Pohokwig glanced at the police officers standing there guarding them to see if they were alert.
If they had a little fear, then they didn't show up.
The founder of this newspaper was killed, and in his large portrait, his middle point pointed to the places where the entire Sinalo County needed to look, and all the staff of Riodoce followed his steps.
Bohokwe said, "How could you even want to shut down? The day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her on the street to report."
China ' s self-drive tourism market size or breakthrough of trillion yuan in 2020
[Summary] In the larger context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free travel, self-drives are encouraged by national policies and are increasingly popular among consumers.
At the same time, however, there is a double challenge facing the trillion-scale self-drive market that is expected to break through.
In the broader context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free travel, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and is increasingly favoured by consumers.
At the same time, however, self-drives, which are expected to break out of the trillion-scale market, face two challenges: on the one hand, the development of the self-drive industry is not commensurate with market demand, and on the other hand, self-drive organizers such as self-drive clubs and travel agencies face a low-profit dilemma; and on the other hand, the infrastructure and services facing self-drives are still at an early stage.
60% of the total number of people in the country, and the size of the market is expected to break by trillion.
Domestic tourism was 4.44 billion times throughout 2016, and self-drives accounted for about 60 per cent of total tourism in the country. The size of the self-drive market is expected to break 100 billion by 2020.
According to the statistics of the China Touring Boat Association on the number of people travelling on their own, the number of people travelling on their own has continued to grow over the past five years, and the proportion of people travelling on their own has remained stable at more than half of the country ' s tourism population.
At the same time, regional and national levels have shown greater interest in and support for self-driving as an emerging area, with policy and regulations relating to self-driving, residential and camping tourism intensively introduced between 2016 and 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourism Agency and the National Sports Directorate, jointly issued the Plan for the Development of Automobile Sports Camps; in the same month, self-drives were highlighted in the Action Plan for the Promotion of Rural Tourism Development Upgrade (2017), issued jointly by 14 departments, such as the DRC, the Ministry of Finance and others.
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy directions for the development of the country ' s self-drive.
The self-drive club has little profit, and the whole industry chain is the key.
Although the domestic self-drive market has great potential and national policies are actively directed, the self-drive industry is still in its early stages.
According to China ' s Annual Development Report for Self-Riding 2016-2017, the number of domestic self-driving clubs, car clubs, car clubs etc. reached several thousand, but the proportion of tourist self-help arrangements for self-driving is in the majority, with only about 15% of visitors participating in various institutions, such as motorbike clubs and self-driving clubs.
At the same time, the number of online tourism enterprises and traditional travel agencies that autonomously develop self-drive products is limited. Many online tourism platforms sell only self-drive products from suppliers, and some self-drive clubs are important suppliers.
In terms of organizing self-drive activities, many aspects of "eat, live, walk, swim, buy, entertain" are covered, with high fragmentation, heavy upstream supply chains and high random consumption by tourists.
The founder and CEO, CEO Li Congjie, of the Beijing Walking Auto Club, thought that the self-drive club was essentially similar to the travel agency, and that the main profit model of the early days was focused on offline activities, with the core being the self-drive line product and lead service.
However, now that the line products in the self-drive field are highly homogenous, and the level of leadership service varies widely, the self-drive club faces the need for a new transformation.
It can be seen that self-driving is not an independent industry per se, but rather that it is important to form a cross-geographical, industry-wide eco-circle with its self-driving characteristics.
Experts pointed out that, in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important consumer element.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving industry, the identity of the experience should be enhanced, the theme of self-driving plus should be developed, and the IP for self-driving products should be developed.
The viewing road is not just a road. Car camps should not be just for food and accommodation.
In the face of the rise of self-driving, the basic accompanying development of self-driving is also relatively basic.
Li Congjie pointed out that tourist attractions were not just a road, but needed to integrate transport and tourism elements into them, but road repair and tourism were the responsibility of the two departments themselves, the transport sector added tourism elements and stayed in the construction of facilities such as toilets, counselling centres, publicity boards, etc., which were not sufficiently integrated with tourism.
The construction experience of the well-known self-driving route, the US 66 Highway, is worth learning.
The landscape design is no longer the most direct and fast route between the point of departure and destination, but is guided by the design concept of "exercise the pleasure of driving the car" and provides the best enjoyment for self-driving tourists to enjoy the beauty of the road. The landscape is able to connect point and face tourism landscapes, preserving historical and cultural values of ecotourism resources along the route, and organizing thematic events to enhance tourist participation and travel experience, creating economic benefits for local tourism.
In addition to viewing lanes, the camp is also an important side-facilitating facility for self-driving.
However, among the self-carriage tourists that Newjing newspaper journalists know, there are few consumers who choose to stay in camps.
In their view, many camps tend to be more inclined to infrastructure than to eat and live, with low grades and a single product, and cannot satisfy the need for many elements to travel on their own.
Some insiders who did not want to give their names said that many of the businesses that had been camped in previous years had been set up to take land, that after taking land, the later stages of infrastructure construction and services had not been kept up, that many of the operations had been run at a loss, and that it had been difficult to do some of the accompanying products without later injections of funds.
Consumption group
According to data published in 2017 by the China Touring Boat Association, by age, self-driving groups are concentrated in 21-40 years of age, especially those aged 31-40, who have a certain economic base and have a higher demand for individualized tourism and are mostly parent-and-child travel clients.
According to the accommodation survey, the self-driving population is relatively more inclined to prefer non-standard accommodation.
In terms of the type of self-driving, the main type of self-driving around is self-driving, which accounts for 84.32 per cent of the total.
Outbound self-driving is the aspiration of many people, but the share is smaller.
At the same time, as consumer demand rose, visitors who used to like to drive their own “shows” began to change their mind, no longer “get out of the car and get in the car and sleep”, but more attention was paid to the experience and the process of travel.
Dinosaurs use disguises to hide from their enemies.
At first glance, it was scary, but it looked like a statue.
Researchers published the first research on the incredible biochemicals found by Canadian miners, like rhinoceros, noting that the fossil was well preserved and therefore experts called it "Mona Lisa of the dinosaur community".
The fossil is very well preserved, and it can even be determined that the colour of its scaffolding skin is red brown. This suggests that it has had some "happy experiences."
The relevant story in Contemporary Biology magazine describes it as "the best preserved picature dinosaur ever discovered and one of the world's best dinosaur specimens."
The fossil is a newly discovered type of pulmonary dragon that lives between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Cyclops.
It's extremely well preserved and shocked researchers, who described it as "exaggerable."
According to the National Geographic Journal, the herbivores porcelain dinosaur fossil is the most well-saved and well-saved type of dinosaur fossil that has ever been discovered.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered this fossil while digging at the Senkol Millennium Millennium Minerals near McMurleyburg, northern Alberta, Canada.
At the time, he ran into something that seemed different from the surrounding rock, so he decided to look closely.
The fossils he discovered were then sent to the Royal Tyrell Biology Museum in Canada.
Researchers took six years to show the real face of this beast hidden inside the 2500 pounds (1100 kg).
After such hard work, the final results are now being announced.
"If you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a scientist and first author of the Royal Terrill Museum. The creature was on display at the gallery.
"It will be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science -- Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world."
Researchers, by studying their skin, found that the herbivores, while wearing armor, were like walking tanks, were likely to face major threats from meat-eating dinosaurs.
The dinosaurs wearing heavy armor use red and white disguises to avoid predators and use covert techniques known as “anti-shade”, which are also used by many modern animals.
The experts said that in this way it could be better integrated with the surrounding environment, thus avoiding the enemy, indicating that it was preyed upon by larger dinosaurs.
This 110 million-year-old creature belongs to a member of the Journey family and became the headline for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Terrill Biology Museum.
Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who is a member of the team, has spent over 7000 hours carefully excavating the animal's veil, and the researchers are now studying it and naming it "Borealopelta marktelli".
The samples were extremely well preserved, allowing Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists to record the patterns and shapes of the scales and nails on their bodies.
They discovered the "anti-shade" technique, which is a common form of defence in the animal community, meaning that the back of the creature is darker than the color of its side.
Although anti-shade techniques are common, the results found are surprising, as the dinosaurs are much larger than existing animals using anti-shade.
The dinosaurs are under pressure to be hunted by meat-eating dinosaurs, which evolves in a favourable direction, allowing them to hide in each other's bases as a means of survival.
However, most existing animals that use antishading techniques, such as deer, zebra or zebra, are as small and vulnerable as prey, indicating that the creature faces real survival pressures.
"The wild hunting of large heavy-demons shows how dangerous the white-coloured meat-eating dinosaurs are," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin color of the dinosaur is red brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the life clues of the creature, including the stomach content it retains to find the last food to eat.
In their view, dinosaurs fell into the river at the time of death, were then washed into the sea and eventually sank in a back-down way into the sea floor.
At that time, Alberta's climate was as warm as it is today in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans might be deeper inland than they are today.
Brown said, "This Lumpy Dragon is truly amazing because it is completely covered by the staircase skin that it has preserved, and it has been preserved so far in the dimension, so that its original shape can be preserved."
"Therefore, the creature now has almost the same shape as the white age.
You don't need too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping.”
The time of the White Ribbon is a time when large animal foot dinosaurs walk around the planet on two feet.
Although the Tyrannosaurus is the king of the dinosaurs, it only appeared a few million years after the Pilar Dinosaurs. Picago Dinosaurs could have been captured by some of their ancestors.
They include high thorn dragons, a giant beast weighing 6 tons long and 38 feet long (11.5 metres).
The latest research found that scientists who appeared in Contemporary Biology magazine believed that Lumpy Dragons were washed into the sea after their death and then formed mummies in the mud.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink dug up the creature at the Millennium Mine near McMurleyburg, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved picature dinosaur, with complete skin and armor in areas ranging from the nose to the hips.
The average length of this organism is about 18 feet (5m) and weighs 3000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It's got two 20 inches of sharp angles from the shoulder.
Researchers believe that this herb-painted dinosaur is active in the current western part of Canada and is then washed into the sea by the flood-spilling river.
However, such dinosaurs are buried under the sea floor to preserve their coats in their entirety.
The fossil remains of this special sample are very well preserved, so that the remaining skin still covers the punctuated nails on the skull of the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geography magazine, this preservation is very rare, just like the middle color.
The more I look, the more I find it incredible.
Residue skin fossils are still covered on the muzzled armor on the skull of the dinosaur.
Its right front palm is on its side, with five toes up.
I can count it."
Journalists learned that adding natural or plant-based kelp acids, corrosion acids and amino acid efficiency carriers to the urea production process allowed for the adaptation of traditional urea, resulting in a 5-10 percentage point increase in the use of urea for kelp acid, zinc corrosion urea, and urea nitrogen for cereals compared to general urea.
Environmentally friendly, crop productivity growth potential is clear, especially in large particulates where urea is a good raw material for BB fertilizer.
The total number of security personnel is twice as high as the number of security personnel at the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In order to ensure the safety of the Rio Olympic Games, Brazil will launch the largest-ever security association programme.
Previously, the Brazilian Government indicated that a total of 85,000 people from the army and the police would work together, including 20,000 soldiers and 65,000 policemen.
Most of the soldiers will be responsible for the protection of Olympic stadiums, while the additional 3,000 will be responsible for the security of international airports, metro stations and streets.
The police patrol the rest of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
According to the information received, 6,000 soldiers have now arrived in Rio to serve Olympic security.
They are responsible for patrolling the airport and the main roads connecting the airport to the Olympic complex, in addition to the four major areas of the Rio Olympic Games.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service sector is no longer new, and for evaluation mechanisms to be effective, it is important to make regulation more effective and less formal.
How radicals learn to answer this question: "Whose street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was disturbed.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis man sat in Episcopal rent bed, browsing Facebook on his cell phone.
She accidentally found the post of a high school student.
It says, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid who was still lying on the street."
She found that no other person posted the message on the feed, and she was confused. She turned off Facebook and turned on Twitter.
A @TheePharaah user kept pushing her for the Dynamic Times.
Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man with no weapons, was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's body lying on the street with lost vital signs, and his body was lying on the street for four hours.
"Magic," Ferrer thought.
But death is nothing new for her and her community.
She dropped her cell phone and did not turn on Twitter until the same night to read the tweets about the crowd gathering on Canfield Avenue.
There's a police video and a photo of people screaming, and there's a photo of someone who calls himself Brown's father, and it says, "Policies Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed and a policeman stood in front of a crowd of protesters with a barking dog.
She said in another video, another cop raised his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all of you...
"It's not normal," Ferrer recalled, said.
"This is not what we used to call a typical murder."
At that moment, I felt chilly.
I'm angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
In the next three years, what happened to Ferrer and Ferguson was the theme of a new documentary, "Who's Street?" that was shown at the cinema in August 11.
This is a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of those who live in this community and are crowded with streets and alleys demanding answers.
When Ferrer drove to Ferguson with her daughter (in a flower dress, wearing a coronation), they rediscussioned the topic they had discussed countless times before that morning: "About black experience and the black situation."
"Do you remember when I taught you when black men had to fight for their faith?" She recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is wrong.
I had to take her with me, "Real said later.
"What happened today is the climax of everything in the past.
She needs to know, see and rise from this.
She needs not only to develop well in radicalism and organizational aspects, but also to understand the different dimensions of black experience and black status and what we have to do to be free and free.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with a racist experience she had not experienced personally, she was nothing different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I think I'm hurting her."
Their first stop at Ferguson is at a site opposite the South Floristan police station. The site became their camp when the militants waited for the final outcome of Officer Darren Wilson's failure to prosecute.
Ferrer and her daughter contacted a local business owner who was packing lunch.
They have prepared bags and are responsible for handing them over to the protesters.
slowly, Ferrer began to form a new type of activism.
She said, "My radicalism changed completely after August 9th." When she studied at St. Louis State University, Missouri, she was president of the Association of Minority Nurses and Students, focusing on the gap between food justice and health in the black community.
“I have no organizational experience.
That's how it all came."
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with film co-director Sabah Fryyan during a night march.
Fryyan said she and her photographer Lucas Alvarado Falle "just wanted to record what happened."
A question emerges from Ferrer's mind: "Do you want to record or find a story you can use?"
This suspicion stems from many cases in which people, usually whites, enter a community to benefit from their pain and resilience.
As Fryyan explained in his last interview, "We heard that native-born people in Ferguson did not concentrate their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."
Fryyan has contacted co-director Damon Davis. Damon Davis is a regional artist known for radicalism against death row prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrer to join with six other locals in the “Whose Street?” project team, which lasted several years after Brown was shot.
"This documentary isn't someone talking to us or talking to us. That's what we said." Davis said.
"I'm concerned about how these people are presented, because that's how I'm presented."
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrer’s experience – but to show that the campaign was “not about the leader of the Savior, but about community cohesion”, Flaiyan said – she proved to be the most open of film participants.
As a result, "Who's Street?" is an amazing record of Ferrer's personal life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I feel naked," Ferrer laughed when he first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that doing this job and humanizing black people requires a certain degree of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrer's story reaffirms and repositions the role of black cooler women in the wider black life event movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- the creation of #BlackLivesMutter on social media following the 2012 shooting of black teenager Trevor Martin -- were identified as cool.
"Black cool women in leadership generally support this movement," said Ferrer, "That's because we fight on multiple fronts.
Black cool women have to live with this."
Fryyan agreed and said, "This movement really has the support of black women and many black cool women."
Because of her identity, Ferrer was chosen as the center of the film. She insisted, however, that this was not an affirmative action for things.
"She's the one who inspired this energy," she said.
"She's on the front line, but it's not a coincidence. Because in these intersections of life, as a black cool woman, you have a lot to do.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras had long disappeared, but ethnic tensions between the community and the police persisted.
As a result of an attempt to block the highway during a demonstration, Ferrer was given a suspended sentence of more than two and a half years.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in what she called home: "It's a mess."
Nevertheless, since she went to Ferguson's street three years ago, she has insisted on the holy song she tried to remember.
“It is our duty to fight for freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We can no longer afford to lose except the shackles of our bodies."
In fact, online translation services were already available on the Internet 10 years ago, and the argument that "machines are about to replace humans for translation" was heard a long time ago.
Similarity: Artists use Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
There are multiple faces in the center of the conservatory at Friedman Gallery in New York: white, black and brown, each face has almost undetectable similarities, and these faces are tied by ropes drawn down from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea? Manning sent her cheek tampons and hair scraps.
Manning sent hair crumbs from Livingworth Fort Prison, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years ' imprisonment for leaking confidential diplomatic cables via WikiLeaks website.
The exhibition was opened on August 2, under the title "Similarities".
This is the result of two years of communication between Dewey Hagburg and Manning, Dewey Hagburg, who combines his discipline with his own technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a famous dissident who went to prison and completed a sex reassignment surgery in prison. Former US President Barack Obama pardoned her remaining sentence three days before the end of her tenure.
Arithmetic analysis from Manning's DNA and the creation of 30 portraits of the "probably possible appearance" was made by Heather Duvie Harborg, who made a sharp and somewhat heartless comment. His comment was both on the multi-mindedness of DNA and on the concept of identity itself.
Manning was born with the name Bradley Edward, who publicly admitted that she was a woman at puberty. He was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including 6 espionage offences, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was contained and there was only one photograph, a photo of herself in black and white with a grain sense, that appeared to be uneasy, sitting on the driver's seat, wearing a platinum-colored wig.
In 2015, Heather Dewey Harborg made great success in her 2012 project, "The Face of Strangers."
In that piece, she created a portrait of a possible similar 3D figure using DNA taken from cigarette butts and chewing gum from medium court exhibits and from scraps.
That's an e-mail she just received from PaperSmart magazine.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a portrait," Heather Duvy Harborg said to the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning couldn't visit or take pictures at the time, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
So, the artist and her imprisoned muse became impossible pen friends and exchanged many letters over a period of two years.
They even created a comic book, The Repressive Head, by Shoili Kanungu. The comic book envisaged that the president would grant Manning privileges in the future and that she would be able to see the exhibition in prison.
Obama asked for her release just a few days after the publication of the book. This may be a coincidence, when Manning spent the seventh year of his military prison in Kansas.
In addition, the exhibition has another meaning. Because of contemporary America, the Trump government has continuously declared war on government leakers and transgender soldiers, while seeking new ways that can be tweaked on Twitter to nakedly incite division, which the exhibition is trying to bridge.
When asked about all this special occasion, Heather Dewey Harborg said, "Anything happens for a reason."
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's super-big sign is down there, calling for an end to the "glossy images of parties based on gender, sexual orientation and culture".
The opposite wall is her mitochonoid DNA sequence, with pencils twisting Cs, Gs and As symbols.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotide, a complex scientific dictionary for each artist), Heather Duway Harborg wants to express that by drawing these amazingly similar portraits, at least in the physiological structure, everyone does.
"I hope people get out of this dilemma, our genome doesn't care who we are, how open genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is." Heather Duway Harborg says his 2007 video "False Memory" is also on display.
"DNA data can tell many different stories, so this is 30 of them."
The last piece in the exhibition, in a room, came from one of the pages of a novel in the previous illustration.
The soldiers in the U.S. showed a manning with a loudspeaker and a golden Kong model.
"When they make your speech stop, they win," written on the wall.
"So don't shut up."
"The content came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm afraid again, and I'm still going to say it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition herself, as foreseen in the comic book, but when she does, she'll get her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters in the center of the gallery cheering.
It's also purposeful, just like all the objects in the exhibition, to reach the height of the genetic monolithic information she wrote with pencils (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
"In the past, I hung them up on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a bunch of people," Dewey Hagburg said when he spoke about portraits.
"But I want them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting against her release."
Professor at Northwestern University and Oxford University employees are wanted for murder.
According to the police, a man was found fatally stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago and a Northwestern university professor and an Oxford university employee were subsequently wanted and are currently searching for suspects throughout the country.
Cook County Court records show that on Monday, 42-year-old Windham Lesem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were arrested for murder without bail on suspicion of the death of Trenton H. James Cornel Durandro.
According to the documentation, 26-year-old Cornell Duranlo died as a result of multiple stab wounds.
According to the community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27.
Upon receiving the call, the police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment and found several fractures on the victim ' s body.
According to the police, Cornel Durandro died instantly, the detective is investigating the murder, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lesam has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement, Alan K. Cobbage, Deputy Director of Campus Relations, stated that Lesem had now been dismissed and had been banned from the University of the North West campus.
Kobaki said, "It is now a criminal case, and the relevant authorities are investigating, and the University of Northwestern is actively cooperating in the investigation."
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
The spokesperson of the Summerville College of Oxford University said in an e-mail statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and stand ready to assist the U.S. investigative agencies as needed."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were all deeply shocked and hoped that he would turn himself in.
Anthony Gullermi, Chief Liaison Officer of the Chicago Police Department, expressed strong encouragement to suspects to surrender to the authorities.
Gulermi said, "The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and we're trying to locate possible locations."
Gulermi indicated that local, regional and national authorities were fully assisting in the search of suspects.
Gulermi stated that the police had received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment and that he had just received a secret tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police said the situation was terrible.
Gulermi says it is still unclear whether this incident also took place on July 27.
According to the security camera, it was confirmed that Lesam and Warren were in the building at the time.
"We believe Professor Lessem has a relationship with the victims," Gullemi said.
Grand Plaza's management team issued a statement to residents saying: "The police are currently studying the victim's timeline and background of the crime and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Muteko said, "We will complete the road map for the world anti-doping agency in the near future."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Muteko stated that it would not take too long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for restoring the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“The implementation of road map standards has reached a certain stage, and RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (the UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA Road Map has been updated in this regard.” Muteko says Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Muteko made the above statement in commenting on the second part of the compliance clause of the road map of the World Anti-Doping Agency, which sets out criteria for restoring RUSADA rights and has recently been published on the organization ' s website.
According to Muteko, the criteria do not contain anything that could cause Russian fears.
He added, "All has to be announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be submitted to the IOC [IOC] and WADA in the near future.”
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian anti-doping agency must publicly accept the findings of the investigation approved by Canadian lawyer Richard McKerlen on WADA regarding Russian State support for the use of stimulants in national sports.
Speaking of this, Muteko said, "We're investigating that our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind it, and we won't admit anything that doesn't exist.”
Muteko's words echoed the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian public anti-doping committee.
Smirnov acknowledged the past problems of the Russian anti-doping agency when he was interviewed by the media Russian outlet RSport earlier that day, but added: "We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and provisions.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally," Smirnov said.
After the November 2015 stimulant scandal, WADA suspended the right of RUSADA to carry out stimulant screening in Russia.
But in June of this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate tests this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
When WADA Director General Olivia Negri visited the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, he said that RUSADA was "going in the right direction" and trying to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it's chess or national chess, defeating humans has been gone decades ago.
In an interview, Croatian FIFA President Davo-Suk said that participation in the Chinese Cup was interesting for Croatian football, and that the number of prizes for the Chinese Cup was very large.
We don't need any more surrogates! These more than 8,000 products have zero duty.
At a regular press conference organized by the Ministry of Commerce on 11 January, the Ministry of Commerce press spokesman said that, to date, there are 15 FTAs in force in our country, covering 23 countries and territories, covering more than 8,000 items of zero duty imported products.
At the same time, imports of cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean wine, and tropical fruits from ASEAN... these products you want need no more expensive purchases.
At present, 16 free trade agreements have been signed with 24 countries and territories and 15 have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 products imported at zero tariffs.
In the case of agricultural products, with the implementation of the FTA, consumers can taste agricultural products of different origin and of good quality and low price every four quarters of the year.
For example, in ASEAN, tropical fruits such as durians, twigs and dragon fruit, import tariffs are reduced from 15 to 30 per cent to zero.
Tariffs on Iceland ' s salmon imports were reduced from 10 to 12 per cent to zero;
(a) Red wine in Georgia and Chile, where import duties are reduced from 14 to 30 per cent to zero;
New Zealand's special agricultural products, such as beef and milk powder, are subject to larger tax cuts.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, part of Switzerland ' s imports of cosmetics have been reduced to zero;
A 50 per cent reduction in customs duties on imports of some watches will be reduced to zero in a few years;
Korea ' s imports of products such as refrigerators, cooking pans, massage machines and beauty machines have been reduced by 40 per cent and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
There are also larger tax cuts for consumer-type electronics, etc.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the FTA include intermediate products and raw materials needed for the manufacture of many domestic end-use consumer goods, and have contributed to some extent to the structural upgrading of domestically produced consumer goods.
The news spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce said at a peak that nearly one third of our total imports would benefit from preferential tariff treatment under the FTA, most of which would be final consumer goods, with tangible benefits for consumers.
Further reduction of tariffs on imports of consumer goods
Since 1 December 2017, the country has adjusted customs duties on imports of some consumer goods and further reduced tariffs on imports of consumer goods, covering all kinds of consumer goods such as food, health care products, medicines, day-to-day products, shoe caps, household equipment, cultural entertainment, and groceries, for a total of 187 tax numbers.
The average tax rate for this consumer product will drop directly from 17.3% to 7.7%, almost "stopping it!"
Since 1 January 2018, our customs duties on other imports and exports have also been partially adjusted.
(a) Import duties on some cosmetics, such as lipstick, eye shadow, perfume, etc., were reduced from 10% to 5%;
When tariffs are lowered, it means that consumers don't have to buy, let alone travel all the way out of the country to buy their favorite foreign products.

Exterior: At the end of the year, the U.S. malls made a big difference.
China-New Network December 29th.
According to the United States Daily News, just after Christmas, there was a retreat.
According to the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), about half of the goods sold last Christmas were re-sold.
In addition, readers have been defrauded on a number of occasions to buy content online, and consumers need to be careful when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but when buying gifts or electricity from small shops, care must be taken.
Ms. Huo of Langang, local time, bought a coat at an online shop specializing in stamp jackets on December 1st, which cost 60 grand (the same dollar) and which has not yet been sent.
She e-mailed the customer's service, and she didn't reply.
There was also an online material that traveled to the United States last year to buy a cell phone from a third-party seller and found it in a box of rubber mud.
After knowing that he had been cheated, he applied to the website for a refund, so that he could get a full refund.
But there are customers who believe that website refund services are not 100% perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident in Northern California, said that there had been two purchases of an emergency distribution service for a website, one for an emergency service of $4, but neither was delivered on time.
He then applied for a refund and did not receive a response.
Large malls or shopping malls have better return policies.
Most of Macy's merchandise is fully refunded within 180 days.
The goods must, however, remain “old” and must have purchase vouchers such as receipts or bank purchase records.
If there is no certificate, the customer can also obtain a market score that can be used to purchase other commodities.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for general commodities, and electronics usually last 15 days.
However, the return period for electronic and entertainment-type goods purchased between 1 November and 25 December 2017 was extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day period for refunds began to run on 25 December, i.e. before 25 January 2018.
Great shopping experience, a new era of shopping development in the business world.
More than a decade ago, the country was still in the overall seller market, with limited options and limited demand.
After 10 years of development, however, markets have long been transformed from seller to buyer markets, and consumer tastes have become worse today, and they are no longer content with simple shopping practices of "one hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand " .
As a result, how to give consumers an extreme shopping experience becomes the next point of competition for real estate developers.
Among the many factors affecting consumer shopping experiences, the impact of shopping centres in the business world is most significant.
To see how city builders focus on shopping experiences everywhere.
There are no two completely identical leaves in the world, and there are no two completely identical shopping malls, and a famous shopping mall necessarily has its own characteristics.
For example, the world-famous Kanyon shopping mall in Turkey, whose unique wave-shaped architectural design is inspired by Canyon, has the name Kanyon, who walks in the 200-metre walk of Minister Kanyon as if it were inside the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon-style design, there is a large elliptical performance site in the centre of the shopping mall, which is unique in shape and often features a special performance.
The open platform was designed to allow tourists to walk on every level to look down at the activities carried out in the Gorge and have the effect of changing the landscape.
At home, the Nanjing Forest Moor Commercial Street, known as China ' s first forest-style stroll-and-street, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
7000 square metres of green land square, 3,000 square metres of roof water platform. The project consists of nine monolithic buildings, which are connected to each other in the air, as a whole are designed to sink the courtyard, take the French tree above the earth to be the top of the building, and create forest-like feeling on the roof of the water roof.
Walking into Forest Moore is like falling into the rabbit hole in Alice's Paradigm, climbing the trunks surrounding the building, showing the grass, the springs, and bringing people into a forest full of life and vitality.
Also in Chongqing, Long Lake built the Li Qabin Water Business Circle to plan 100 different businesses, plans to introduce in the future more than 50 international top-selling flagships, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 national and foreign brands, and to create business centres with a strong focus on services industries.
In addition to this, the Reginan Water Business Circle integrates ecology into buildings, directs it to ToD public transport, gathers fashion shopping, living services, catering, recreation, education, sports, while also leading consumers to enjoy the unique “coastal culture” of Chongqing, combining shopping with water entertainment and recreation.
To sum up, it can be seen that some housing enterprises are now familiar with the discovery trajectory of this new urban business, and industry sources suggest that this consumption pattern centred on consumer experience, how to combine shopping with experience, will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
The business world today is not just a destination for goods, but also a complex place to integrate artistic culture, creative themes and carry with it the responsibility of people to live in cities.
Therefore, while meeting the one-stop material needs of consumers to eat and drink, play and buy, maximizing the multilayered spiritual need to transmit cultural and artistic art, and fulfilling the habitable housing needs must be the high point of the future development of the business community.
In Chongqing, the north bank of the nation's flourishing mountain is located north of the river, close to the bridge, close to the Xinjin Bridge, the world's commercial excellence, the international confluence around the world's giants, and the first brand gathers together to connect to the international fashion at close proximity.
There's a lot of pace here, and there's a lot of beauty in the world.
Toyohara has a better shopping environment. Toyohara is close to the South Lawn Business Circle and has the exclusive advantage of the Western and even the nation's leading four-storey traffic system, which enhances the comfort of shopping.
In addition, the greening of the groves and landscape floors on the two walking streets of Leisure Work Road and Wanda Square have been upgraded by planting about 300 logs, renovating 40,000 square metres of land and raising the image of the South Lawn Business Circle;
On the other hand, Dragon Lake Lake Lake One, near Chongqing's first low-density waterfront business circle, which was surrounded by nine parks, low density and high openness in commercial neighbourhoods, made people more willing to stay, stay and enjoy the pleasure of shopping, rather than rushing ahead in a rush by people behind them.
Today's commercial competition will only grow stronger, and it is worth serious thinking by all real estate developers about how to kill a bloody path in a highly homogenous market and win the reputation of a “shopping shrine” in the hearts of future consumers.
The strategy of differentiation alone is far from enough, and only those developers who really really put consumers in their hearts, rush consumers, want consumers to think, and offer consumers an extremely simple shopping experience can laugh in the market when the storm comes.
Of course, at the end of the day, I think it's the people of Chongqing who have such good shopping experience and business circles that no one could imagine today's prosperity 10 years ago.
The festival: Consumerist carnivals hide real environmental prices
16,82.2 billion dollars, which is the sum of the share of Skycat users spent on November 11, 2017, during the 24 hours of the "Skycats Two Eleven Global Carnival".
Specifically, after the two 11s, the cat's deal broke by 10 billion in just three minutes, over 20 billion in six minutes and five seconds, and 100 billion in nine hours.
On that day, the total number of payments made by global consumers through payment of treasures reached 1.48 billion, an increase of 41 per cent over last year.
These consumptions will result in 812 million logistics orders.
Whether Skycat buys platforms or pay-as-you-go platforms, they belong to the Ali Group in Maun.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that the subculture created by single youth on November 11 for self-defeating “Lightstick Day” would be compiled by electric merchants and become today's phenomenon-like “Dual 11” shopping carnival.
On November 11, 2009, Ali Baba used for the first time a marketing head for the "Long Stick Festival": no one was in love with you, so the "single dogs" came to buy it online.
Surprisingly, this day's trade in Treasure and Trade Town (the "Sky Cat"'s predecessor) went up by $52 million, 10 times the amount of the day's day-to-day trade.
From that point on, the "Boy 11" became the shopping carnival built by Ali Baba, from the beginning of which domestic buyers made their own fun, to the current influx of global traders, nine years later, the "Boy 1.1 billion" trade of Skycats was more than 3,200 times the size of the year, making the "Black Friday" impossible to see.
There are also a number of electricians, including the most powerful of them.
The "Kingdong" has its own shopping festival "6.18", but it does not have a "double 11" impact. This year, from November 1, to November 11, the "Kingdong" accumulated sales amounting to 12.7 billion yuan.
And after Double 11, it was followed by a similar "Dual 12", Christmas New Year shopping slot.
After New Year's, Chinese consumers are waiting for the pre-spring annual purchase and Valentine's Day shopping slots, and consumption will not take off.
The environmental problems caused by instantaneous consumption have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to the Xinhua daily telecommunications report, the average standard of 0.2 kg per box in industry is conservatively estimated to produce at least 300,000 tons of garbage during the “double 11” period this year.
Liu Hua, Director of Pollution Prevention and Control Project, Greenpeace East Asia Division, told China and China that this year's double 11 order volume of Skycats alone would produce 160,000 tons of packaged garbage.
The National Postal Service issued a report in 2016, noting that in 2015 (November 11-16) there were about 780 million fastware pieces using more than 3 billion knitting bags, 9,922 million boxes and 16,985 million metres of tape, which can be taped 425 laps around the Earth's equator.
And this year, the National Post Office expects that the “double 11” fastware volume is expected to exceed 1.5 billion.
Wang Xinhua, manager of a waste-burning centre in Beijing City, told Xinhua Society that more than 2,000 tons of garbage were coming in every day after Xinhua, and that it exceeded the processing capacity of the burning station.
Express delivery companies have become aware of the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry.
A number of electric company logistics businesses, including Suning, introduced recyclable and reused plastic delivery boxes, recycling bags that could be reused as shopping bags and garbage bags, etc., but the troublesome consumer acceptance was low.
Ma Yun also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics" in Twitter.
This microblogging has generated more than 68,000 "sweet."
What kind of mobile payments do the Germans want?
Zhang Dongqing: The mobile payment battle in Germany is not expected.
We don't pay and pay but move the battlefield to Europe. The rivals haven't changed. The Chinese haven't changed.
Where there is a payment treasure, there will be a payment of a Weibo.
Pursuant to an agreement with Wirecard, the German electronic payment service provider, the micro-payment officially started to land in Germany in November of this year and is gradually being laid out by businesses within Europe.
The meeting between the two "old folks" took place in Europe.
The payment of treasures and the payment of micro-letters have been singing all along the path of globalization.
With regard to China ' s mode of globalization of mobile payments, Irene ' s consultation on the China Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Study 2017 concluded that there were two types: one through strategic investment, empirical export, equity entry and support for foreign home-grown mobile pay enterprises.
Second, through the consumer behaviour of Chinese tourists abroad, mobile payment services are promoted to foreign businesses, thereby changing the perception and acceptance of China's mobile payments by foreign natives.
Indeed, the Chinese deserve the world.
China ' s rapid economic development, coupled with a large population base, is a tempting figure for Chinese tourists in Europe.
But it is also doomed that the Chinese mobile payment battle in Germany this time is not looking forward to it.
It's just that we've moved the battlefield to Europe, that the competitors have not changed, that the positions seized have not changed — or that of the Chinese — and that's globalization?
The more pioneering exploration is whether China's mobile payments can open its borders on Europe's mainland?
Take Germany for example.
"New retail" with magic.
Chen Xing, Yang Kaihe: Amazon announced his entry into military bookstore and grocery store when he was squeezed into the world's 10 largest retailers, and both timing and motivation are worthwhile.
In November 2015, Amazon opened the first entity bookstore in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and Santiago.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened a shop in New York and plans to own at least eight shops by the end of the year.
At almost the same time, Amazon announced that no-one's supermarket (Amazon Go) would run on trial, that customers would not have to line up at the store, nor would they need to close the accounts, that the door-scave and the goods they wanted would just leave, and that the purchase money would automatically be deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
As far as Amazon is concerned, it is a very unexpected thing to suddenly move around the real store in recent years.
Because as early as 2007, in An Open Letter to Shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazons would not open real shops easily unless the following four conditions were met simultaneously:
1. We must be certain that this new opportunity will give shareholders a return on their investments;
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great importance to the company as a whole;
3. We must be sure that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
We must be certain that in this market we have sufficient resources to make customer-oriented differentiation.
Bookshops and grocery stores are the most rocky categories of retail sales in both entities and the first rivals to fall when Amazon rises.
Amazons announced their entry into the markets of both entities, regardless of timing or motivation, as they crowded into the world ' s 10 largest retailers.
Is the Amazon's practice contrary to the pledge in the shareholder's letter?
A similar voice was heard on the other side of the globe. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Cloud Habitat Congress, the president of the board of directors of Alibaba gave a keynote address to Maun.
He said, "From next year, Ali Baba will no longer mention the term `electronic commerce'."
The era of pure power suppliers will soon come to an end, and there will be no e-commerce in the next 10 or 20 years, which will be replaced by `new retail'.
The combination of online and logistics will produce new retail sales.”
At one point, the word "new retailing" is like being enchanted by the industry.
But what exactly does "new retail" mean?
If it's just a combination of the finger line and the underline, then the concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked 180 of the largest electricity suppliers and estimated their total sales to be about $200 billion, of which the top 25 accounted for more than $159 billion.
Of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers (e.g. Macy's Department, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.) that only started operating on the line in the last five years.
The Alibaba Group is also well known for its $28.3 billion share of Sunning Clouds.
Globally, retailers and electricians are moving from a single channel to an all-channel retail system that covers real shops, power suppliers, mobile end and socialized media.
Is Maventi “new retailing” more a summary than a vision of the future?
If not, what is the difference between the whole channel concept and the “new retailing”?
Perhaps the point is not whether or not there will be integration on the line, but how.
Looking back at the past 20 years of retail trade, the rise of electric power suppliers, like the rise of early discount retailers, focused on prices and conveniences.
By relying on these two pain spots, the electrician moved the highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, from the bottom of the line to the line.
With the development of online consumption habits and the growing experience of customers, electricians have extended their tentacles to other types of goods and have begun to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, “using the ideas and technologies of the Internet to comprehensively reform and upgrade the existing stock of about 30 trillion social retailers makes it possible to effectively meet the rising consumer demand of Chinese consumers and makes the entire process of commodity production, circulation and service more efficient because of the extensive use of the Internet and big data”.
So the road of the electrician is a path that is superficially light and actually heavy on assets.
"Light" means that the burden of fixed assets, staffing, management processes, etc. is not large enough for traditional retail trade; "Light" means that huge inputs are needed in logistics, warehousing, etc.
Changes in logistics modalities have ensured the efficiency of electric power suppliers.
According to the Chinese Government's online news, Premier Li Keqiang of the State Council hosted the State Council's Standing Meeting on April 28, which considered the expansion of domestic consumption demand to be an important step towards steady growth and structural adjustment.
It was determined that specific programmes would need to be drawn up by the relevant departments on the basis of scientific assessments.

On January 18th, in Chongqing, Ali Baba convened a high-level dialogue on lifting electricians out of poverty and announced that it would contribute to poverty eradication and rural revitalization by exploring a new model of “Internet+ out of poverty”.
This is a new "plus" for Ali ' s fight against poverty, following the introduction of village strategies, the launch of the rural treasure-hunting project, the online farmers ' anti-poverty platform and the establishment of the Ali Baba poverty alleviation fund.
The fight against poverty is one of China ' s most important national strategies of the present time.
The total lifting of poverty has never been achieved in China in the last few thousand years.
“The alleviation of poverty by electric power suppliers is an innovation in the new round of pro-poor development and is an important catch-up for achieving a precise reduction in poverty and a precise exit from poverty.
The Centre attaches great importance to, and notes, the role that the Internet can play in contributing to the fight against poverty, promoting precision poverty alleviation, precision poverty eradication and the release of agricultural products from the countryside via the Internet.”
As a result, Ali proposed a village strategy as early as 2014, along with big data cloud computing and globalization, as the three core strategies of Ali for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Treasure (Village) Project, recruiting "Village II" in the village, leading farmers out of poverty and wealth through electricity dealers.
In 2017, Ali worked with the business sector to build a channel for poverty alleviation among farmers and farmers, and now has a cumulative docking of 13 provinces across the country, 120 poor counties at the national level.
Ali's platform gave birth to 2,118 scavenger villages.
Of these, close to 400 were found in poor districts in provinces and 33 in poor districts in 13 countries.
In 2017, on the Ali Baba Chinese retail platform, the sales volume of the country ' s treasure-hunting village reached 120 billion yuan.
Zhang Yong said that in the face of a national strategy to fight poverty, Ali had been thinking about how to use the technological, big data, cloud computing and other innovative capabilities of the Ali economy to make a new way out of poverty.
Among them, Murakami is the main platform for Ali's electricity merchants to lift themselves out of poverty and takes a new link to the Internet out of poverty, which is directly available for sale.
In the planting chain, village nags and ant gold garments jointly support farming tools and micro-credits.
In 2017, of the 832 poor counties at the national level, 795 were served by ant gold uniforms, which provided easy payment, credit, etc.
The rookie settles storage and logistics, Skycat sells, Aliun's big data counterfeasible to guide agricultural production and further improves the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of electricity suppliers out of poverty requires not only products, marketing channels, industrial planning, but also human resources.
Ali has achieved a combination of “poverty + mental support” by offering electrical vendor courses at the University of Bao Po to teach farmers standardization, quality and scale farming methods, thus enabling farmers to escape poverty on a sustainable basis.
These courses already cover about 92% of the poor counties at the national level.
And the idea of a "public good mentality, business instruments" can also guarantee Ali's "real poverty reduction" when it comes to poverty reduction.
Ma Yun, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Alibaba, said that poverty eradication should be divided into three phases: poverty alleviation, poverty eradication and wealth creation.
Poverty alleviation is the teaching of fish, poverty eradication is the teaching of fish, and wealth is the building of a “fish pond” for farmers to feed.
The power-driven industries are pro-poor, making fish ponds.
In the area of industrial poverty alleviation, the model of poverty alleviation in the Los Angeles Apple industry developed by Ali in collaboration with Xanxirocheon has been replicated throughout the country as an example by the authorities concerned.
Ali ' s electricity provider ' s efforts to alleviate poverty have also been recognized at the decision-making level.
The electricity company, represented by Ali Baba, has been sent to ensure that farmers increase their production and harvest through online and offline channels.
Some village Xiaoji and ant gold uniforms employees have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experiences in lifting electricity dealers out of poverty.
At present, the China office of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has been working with Murai to reduce poverty in the electricity industry in Anhui and elsewhere.
The Third Congress of the New Economic Think Tank was held on January 16, co-organized by the Ali Institute and the China Vision think tank Fortune. Zhang Li, Director of the Academy of Electric Business, Ministry of Commerce, attended and spoke.
She believes that our globalization actually ignores the most important issues, namely, the nature and use of globalization and the stages of globalization.
Many thus believe that globalization has stagnated and that many developed and developing countries have different attitudes towards globalization and models in the new phase.
The second concept is the issue of the medium-term phase of globalization. What are the constraints of the medium-term phase of globalization?
The constraints imposed by the economic and environmental underpinnings have occurred precisely because of the changing nature of the economic base.
According to Zhang Lei, the global economic restructuring was largely over by the end of 2017, and a new round of growth would enter after 2018, and the next round of growth would have to be a raw product.
The 7FRESH, the first birth market in Kyoto, has opened in recent days and plans to open more than 1,000 shops throughout the country over the next three to five years.
Together with Ali's box of horse freshborns, Infinity's super-species, Suning's Suh-shun, and the American family's palmfish, the "New Retail Door" started to pile up, and each other's "calls" on innovative models and even prices.
Where is the new retail?
"In 2018, we will quickly enter the country and open a whole bunch of shops in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival."
At the Second New Retail Summit, the CEO-E10 revealed the "new game" of 2018.
"Since 2018, the boxhorse is not just a raw electrician, but a consumer ' s immediate-service consumer class.
Underneath the core mode is the current, the experience, and on the line is the real sale."
Unlike the traditional malls, supermarkets, the box of horses is a fun and delicious "net-red shop" in the eyes of many consumers, and even the concept of "box room" has been developed by intermediaries.
Both online and offline retailers have advantages and disadvantages, while consumers appear through multiple channels, so both parties are trying the full channel model.
The industry believes that, in the larger context of rising consumption, there will be an increase in the number of shops of the "type carat" in 2018.
And the chariot continues to be explored from its first lifetime to more consumption, heralding more innovation in the retail market in the new year.
"For example, the business model of online-to-line combinations attracts the eyes of consumers, and the live and fresh supermarkets everywhere are called well and well."
"These relationships talk too much, they don't work, they end up giving consumers a good experience, so I'm willing to pay for it when I'm done."
In the view of CEO Yuan Bin, a co-organizer of the Great Yum Fat Flying Bull Network, consumer habits changed in the new retail environment, as did the demand for purchases.
It turns out that the line is cut off, the line below is about to beat the line, the line below is about to fight back, and now the consumer is holding hands together, because the consumer no longer has a line below the line.
The competition for capital has made the new retail gunpowder, which is now represented by the Live and Fresh Supermarket, feel perfect.
The analysis found that the competition of new retailing in first-line cities is far from reaching the Red Sea and that there are large areas of second-line cities yet to be excavated, and markets still have great opportunities and space.
Different types of industries will bring the development of new retailing into a diversified state of development with regard to the layout of new retailing.
In conjunction with the China Institute of Finance and Economic Strategy of the China Institute of Social Affairs and Economics, the China Finance and Economics channel has co-ordinated a dry product, which is the annual development report of China's electricity merchants in the country.
What kind of report card did the Chinese electricity dealer make in the past year?
What are the trends in global electricity suppliers?
Let's do it for everyone.
The sales volume is back on track at record speed again.
Since 2006, our online retail sales can be said to have been growing at a very high rate, and it's so cool to think that online purchases are fresh and can buy things without going to the door.
However, starting in 2013, the increase in online retail sales began to fall below 50 per cent. In 2015, it was for the first time less than 40 per cent, and in 2016 it turned into 26.2 per cent.
But the situation is different this year, with retail sales on the Internet accelerating again, and in January-September this year, the rate of increase rose back to 34.2 per cent.
The growth rate was significantly higher than in 2015 and 2016.
Maybe you're going around in circles, and it's easier to buy or buy.
Of this, the value of online retail sales of goods in kind is close to 5.08 trillion yuan and the value of online retail sales of services is close to 1.49 trillion yuan.
The share of total retail sales of social goods amounted to 13.6 per cent, an increase of nearly 3 percentage points in the same year.
Class, don't fall asleep, focus. The retail value of the service online is definitely a big credit!
Second, French Internet users who love choppers have a per capita Internet purchase of $1925, and they buy most of the goods online, in clothing, which is worthy of a fashionable country.

Amy Erett used to want to investigate employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up company, but the investigation didn't work.
The responses received are often vague, unhelpful and even worse, deceptive.
Even if she promised anonymity, some employees still did not trust the process.
Ereette managed 75 people's San Francisco e-commerce and development company Madison Reed, who said, "The responses received lack consistency and objectivity."
So she called outside to ask for help.
A new group of start-up human resources companies have emerged like rain and rain, helping companies to understand how employees feel.
They build and authorize software specifically designed to measure employee participation, thus allowing companies to conduct rapid polls for specific teams and population groups, provide employees with anonymous and complaint hotlines and, in some cases, allow whistleblowers to report directly to the board of directors.

Eret said that in three years, she used Glint to gain more insight into the thinking and feeling of her employees.
In addition to quick surveys and opinion polls by specific teams, Glint also provides company heat charts, which units have the highest number of complaints, which managers have low approval scores, and it is obvious that this allows her to understand the reasons in depth.
Companies began to realize that they had to be skilled in taking control of the company ' s workplace culture in order to avoid becoming the next advantage. A blog post describing the harassment environment was published earlier by former employees, and the speakers were punished by the company, and then the advantage fell into the scandal.
For start-up companies like Glint, this corporate desire for supervision is a money-rich business opportunity.
The value of the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry is likely to exceed $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technology analysis website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a start-up firm in Denver, Colorado, dedicated to helping companies prevent and detect bad behaviour, saw an increase in interest and activity during the loss of merit earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Episode, Microsoft and Tesla.
Yuzuki recently signed into a client.
Like Glint, Convercent can send companies customized diagnostic surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides anonymous SMS hotlines for staff to report misconduct.
If the chairman of the board is implicated, the complaint will go directly to the board of directors.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive officer of Convercent, said: "The court of opinion usurped the powers of the regulatory authority.
If a company is found to have treated employees badly or to have behaved unethically towards them, it may face the high consequences of consumer boycotts, loss of employees and involvement in litigation, as Quinlan suggests, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a catering chain across more than 500 places and with more than 25,000 employees, has been in use for over a year to ensure that employees understand the work code and work protocols and provide easy access to company headquarters.
Until then, if the employee wishes to report the problem, he must find the company ' s head office phone number or e-mail and file a formal complaint, and hope that the head office will take this seriously.
This is often a scary and disturbing experience, as James Witrano, the chief legal adviser of Ruby Tuesday, said, he did not think there was a good way to track complaints from employees.
But now that the company uses Convercent, it can more quickly identify and solve problems that were previously unknown to a remote office, city or state, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage behaviour.
"I can get a full picture of the work experience closer, 360 degrees closer," Vitrano, who is responsible for Ruby Tuesday's risk management team, said.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
According to Quinlan, companies began to pay greater attention to ethics, values and staff professionalism in 2002 after Andorran accounting firm closed down for violating ethics through the Enron scandal.
But it was only after "social media went into their own world" that companies realized that they could not stop their blasts from spreading the virus online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, hope is seen as a strategy," he said.
Glint and Convercent both offer their software as services and charge companies recurrent fees for the use of their products.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture investors who have already supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising its total capital to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million in funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, with a total of $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness of corporate, cultural and venture investments, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing number of studies show that today's employees have higher expectations of the workplace than before.
In a highly competitive market like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued and that their time is spent on a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company, feel their voices heard, and what they do is useful, they're more committed to making the company succeed," Nina McCartney, Vice-President of LinkedIn's Global Welfare and Staff Experience, says. LinkedIn uses both Convercent and Glint software.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well when their employees are loyal and committed.
If third-party analytical tools commit to increasing the loyalty and professionalism of their employees, it is not surprising that they will seek financial support.
Workplace culture experts argue that it is important to have data on the professionalism of employees.
However, these data are useless unless corporate managers take action.
In fact, if a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be expected that the company is undergoing change.
If change is not moving fast enough, or if little progress is made, it may cause disappointment and cause staff to leave the company.
"If you want to look for 4000 advices, then you need to be ready for 4000 conversations." He saw some of the company's mistakes in relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow through, the staff will think, 'Did you really hear what I said?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why would I care?"
Eret said that Madison Reed now conducts a monthly staff survey and can take action on the day that Glint reports the problem.
After collecting feedback from employees about their frustration with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by reorganizing her internal team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insight into its employees, and in the long run they want to be able to make a shift in this industry known for its high brain drain rate and better retain its employees.
"If you don't work to create a culture of transparency, you lose talent," Vitrano said.
"If you lose talent, you lose clients.
And when you lose your client, you lose your company."

NCAAA cancels the training twice a day and extends the daytime training of the Bears.
Towards 11:00 p.m., members of the football team of the University of California, Los Angeles, wandered and chatted next to the team's new campus practice.
Some of the players have taken off their sweatshirts and exposed their bodies after hard training on the first day of the training camp.
For a large segment of the team, the free minutes are rest time.
After three hours of practice, the participants in the summer course will return to the dormitory to prepare for the final exam and then return to the Wasserman Football Centre at 6.30 a.m. the following morning.
"The next three days are a chord for these guys," the Bear Coach Jim Mora said on Monday coming into Tuesday.
NCAA cancelled two exercises a day (in order to ease the burden on the players), but actually extended their training hours during the day - at least by Friday.
That's why the first three training sessions at UCLA are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to adjust to the timetable that the players are already crowded with.
From the cancellation of training twice a day to more training once a day, the Bears started training almost a week before the last season, and Moira first trained at summer school in the six seasons of Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions from August 20 and then start preparing for the official race of Texas farmers for the first war in September.
Mora said that he supported the NCAA rule adjustment, although that would allow the players to have a busy trip to add another project.
"In three or four days, we will give them a huge amount of training, which is very challenging," Mora said.
"They just passed. They're grinding. They're great kids.
I think we'll have more time on Saturday. It's really great."
As soon as the training camp is over, the University of California Los Angeles will stop training. Considering the proximity of the parking lot and the clear view of Luskin Center, this is not an easy task. The Luskin Center High Hotel has been thrown across the fence behind the goalposts.
Starting this weekend, the Bear team will be staying at the hotel. Moira admits that once these rooms are empty during the season, there may be problems.
"We'll take security measures," Mora said.
"It's a real concern. The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in a room and record the training scene is not too far-fetched.
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good.
But we'll take security measures there, and we'll take security measures in parking lot number 8.
We will make the best use of existing resources.
I won't worry too much about it.
We've made plans."
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data show that the value of houses in Australia rose by an average of 1.5 to 2 per cent in the second quarter of this year, an annual increase of 3.5 per cent, the lowest annual rate of increase since March 2013.
At a time when real estate agents expect more properties to be sold during the holiday season, Australian housing prices have risen to their lowest level since 2013.
The IT House reported this morning that the Wall Street Journal reported that AT&T had cancelled plans to sell China's new flagship smartphones in the United States.
We planned this week to announce the partnership on CES, and AT&T cancelled it at the last minute.
In response, on January 9, China responded to the news reporter saying that on January 9, US local time, China would release new products and specific listing information to the US market.
China has demonstrated its strength over the past five years through the introduction of high-end products in the global and American markets.
According to earlier reports from IT House, China will publish a "best cell phone you've never heard of" at the Las Vegas CES exhibition on the afternoon of January 9, and the ability of this cell phone to continue service for two days.
The industry is generally of the opinion that the Chinese flagship phone, which is about to be released, is Mate 10 Pro, carrying the Android Oreo system.
On September 30th, the film "I am not the Pankin Lian", featuring Guo Tao, Da Peng, Zhang Jia, and others, will be shown throughout the country.
Yesterday, the film held a seminar in Beijing on the theme "The sad side of comedy", attended by three guests: Feng Xiaogang, Ning Ho and Da Peng.
The director is the speciality of the caption "I am not the Pankin Lian" and the map is the confluence of the circle, especially when the round picture is taken with a masked lens.
Feng Xiaogang explained: "This subject is similar to the Qiu Ju case of Xiu Ju by Xiaojin's director. It's easy to think together, and I want to do it in a way that we don't use. There's nothing special about it, but I think it's funny and I want to do something special."
Feng Xiaogang called himself a virgin, learned how to make round pictures with photographers, and even spent millions of dollars for photographers to make a 10-minute audition.
Facebook will launch a fact-checking feature to counter false news.
Facebook announced on Thursday that it would send more potential prank articles to third-party testing agencies and show the results under the original post. Facebook, the largest online social network in the world, is trying to crack the so-called fake news.
Facebook stated in its statement on the website that Facebook would start using an updated machine to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to the fact checker, and might show the results of the fact check at the bottom of the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main outlets of the so-called fake news, and many believe that Facebook influenced the 2016 presidential election.
This issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, with voters experiencing a proliferation of false stories before the May presidential elections in France, Germany taking the lead in adopting support for a fine scheme before the September elections, and a fine if social media networks fail to remove hate posts in time.
Facebook indicated in a separate statement in Germany on Thursday that a new fact-verification functional test was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
The Facebook news feed product manager Sarah Sue said in a blog: "In addition to seeing which stories are questioned by third-party fact checkers, people want more background to help them make informed decisions about reading and sharing content.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its "relevant articles" function and make other changes to its press summaries to reduce false news.
Create a drawing novel: The story of the Castle of England
Recently, Little Scottney Castle played a leading role in a compressed version of the music film and once became a refuge for Mrs Margaret Thatcher during the '70s and '80s.
But Scotney, who witnessed 700 years of turmoil in the comfort of the Baylor Valley in Kent, is now a source of inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man who has a special interest in historical documents and has a moped.
"I can see the ancient handwriting 300 years ago, and I find it so beautiful," he says with all his eyes.
"What kind of relationship is it that makes this letter fall into my hands?"
Throughout the Middle Ages and the Eduard era, the book "A Castle of England" documented the families living in Scottney, each story being done by different future artists like Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book with the archive as a raw material: he also wrote "The Dead ' s Tooth and Other Story 2014", a book inspired by the British Library ' s literature, which he completed with uncontrollable creative passion.
He said, "I couldn't contain my writing impulse from the moment I saw the thumbprint left on the side of the letter, which was written by a double agent who worked for Jacob in the 18th century."
"That's his fingerprints!
And the letter always smells like smoke, because then you need to light up to have light.
For us 300 years later, this smell makes it feel like they're around us too.
Oh, I love archives!"
For those who were touched by the old paper, it seemed wonderful to have the support of the National Trust and Arts Council of England and lived in the castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I've been here a little long"), and I can't believe it's true.
Rhodes spent days visiting Victoria's "new" castle, looking through archives, studying many of the estate's treasures and ancient games, such as the hyena head hanging on the wall, and the bottle that spent centuries in the moat's river.
He walks on the land and ruins of the old castle, chats with vagrants, gardeners, and sometimes with artists who draw illustrations for his book.
And then at night, he'll "drink whiskey and write."
Scotney's hidden history is not very clear, because the British National Trust only entered completely after the death of Elizabeth Hershey, the last heir in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff started processing the files, and he described them as "the nobles of hundreds of years ago are leaving," "Oh, put them in the attic."
The diary, letters from the British Empire, and maps of the borders of various countries: "You'll think land disputes are boring," Rhodes said, "But two families will fight for a white birch tree.
Let go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the work started with castles, which led to a broader study of British history, including The Laborer, which was traced to a man who left the new castle to participate in the peasant uprising of 1381.
"The story of the Knights of Kent and Sussex in the book recorded a riot in the castle in 1380," Roz said.
"The farmer uprising started in that area, which I think is a good place to launch the uprising.
Maybe there's a connection between these two?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of castles, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit pastor for seven years during the reform of the British religion.
Or The Smuggler, the story's owner is Arthur Darrell, an 18th century smuggler, who was thought to have his own funeral by filling his coffin with stones.
"The Darrells" is Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney Castles: "These gentlemen seem to be scoundrel and always borrow money and buy things they can't afford.
Generation after generation of Darrell men solve their debt by marrying rich old women, and I think they're a handsome bunch of young men who know how to pursue women."
As his mission in the castle ended, Rhodes began to look for other strange writing experiences.
He completed a drawing novel in the wilderness of Finland in two weeks, about "El?m?ki?" It was a sanatorium in the early 20th century, and it was slowly abandoned.
But Scotney has a special position for him.
"I left sadly," he said.
"It's like, "Oh, I have to go face-to-face in real life."

Large energy companies are all "rich and enemy", so who's the best in many energy companies around the world?
Yesterday, the famous PFC Energy Company announced its top 50 rankings for listed energy companies in 2011, and the American oil and gas producer, Exxon Mobil, won the union with $406.3 billion in market value, followed by China oil and the Dutch royal Shell.
In this list of PFCs, in 2007 and 2009, China Oil had two questions, and in other years the top of the list was occupied by Exxon Mobil.
In 2011, out of the top 50 rankings, there were three companies from China and China, with China ' s petrochemical ninth and 15th in addition to China ' s oil second in rank.
According to the PFC, however, although the current price of oil is much higher than it was four years ago, the PFC Energy Company CEO notes that there are many reasons for the low overall market value, including mainly the decline in natural gas prices in North America and the low activity of the global stock market.
Xinhua reported that the heavy pollution weather in Kyunjin and the surrounding area from 16 to 19 had further intensified, with the appearance of a "blast watch" in the AQI, Hebei Shijia Bank, Sindang and Yaoji City.
The U.S. changes green card regulations.
The media quoted President Donald Trump's statement that the United States would launch a new immigration plan to amend the green card regulations.
The scheme is intended to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 persons per year, and temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications will be subject to stricter regulations.
The new provisions were proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
The American media quoted Trump as saying, "This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and realize these benefits by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will replace the current programme and reduce chain migration.
This new application process is beneficial for applicants who speak English, have financial support and have skills that are beneficial to economic development.”
On May 29, the first Chinese fireworks and fireworks safe environment fair will be held in Xiangyang.
The event was organized around the theme "Technology, safety, environmental protection" for a period of two days. At that time, the state-of-the-art artillery machinery in the fireworks and fireworks industry, and the most safe and environmentally friendly cannon support materials and new products of the country will be gathered together.
The Expo will invite a large number of experts and entrepreneurs to an academic exchange in the fireworks and fireworks industry to share the latest technology for the safe and environmentally friendly use of fireworks and fireworks.
Among them, the demonstration of fireworks mechanized production equipment and safe and environmentally friendly products will take place in Daoxuan Town, and the main exhibition projects will include the production of pyrotechnic mechanical equipment, such as low sensitivity, low explosive energy, safe and environmentally friendly personal combustion products such as sulfur-free, smoke-free, etc., with technical maturity, relevant technical validation and safety justifications.
At the same time, the demonstration of the fire safety and environmental products of fireworks and fireworks, performed by the group of 16 Xiaoyang Artillery Enterprises, was divided into two phases: product selection and product demonstration, and a demonstration of the fire of the fine new products selected through the previous evaluation was scheduled to take place on the evening of May 29th at the Xiaoyang City Artillery Observatory and the Golden Beach Burning Field.
And speaking of the upcoming 2017, Zhao Lei Ten said, "I want to clear myself after next year's tour and then settle down and write more new works."
In order to optimize the landscape environment and build a beautiful Nan Yue, the "636" volunteer team of the South Yue District Tobacco Specialized Agency (branch) recently launched an environmental campaign entitled "Riding the Mountain, Protecting the Home".
The campaign was supported not only by the entire staff of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also by the involvement of retired old cadres and workers and their families in environmental practices. The three generations of the young and the young worked together to climb the mountain ranger, clean the garbage, and devote themselves to building a “beautiful Nanyo”.
The purpose of this voluntary event is to preserve the south's landscape resources and promote the idea of volunteerism as "love for others, care for society, care for nature" and to enable the next generation to accept the fumigation from childhood and pass on the virtues of volunteerism.
According to the information received, since its establishment in early April this year, the "636" volunteer corps, with 16 development members, has been engaged in a series of volunteer activities such as watching disabled retail customers, helping smoke farmers care for tobacco leaves, and the Yaan earthquake love donation, becoming a volunteer and active force with a heart to deliver positive energy.

Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful.
Just when you didn't think it would be weirder in 2017, a new technology development report was released in the field of sex robots.
Yes.
It's a big deal to have sex robots now.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) released a report that looks forward to the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
Noel Shaggy, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, said that we need to start taking seriously the rise of sex robots.
Customers can choose the eye color, nipple shape and nail type of robot.
Shaggy said in the release of the new report: "People laugh behind their backs, but the big companies do have a lot of sex robots, and we'll see more."
Modern sex dolls have evolved from pneumatic dolls into robots with silicone skins, which feel warm and deliberately use artificial intelligence to create human-like sexual reactions.
Users can also "write" their robots to satisfy their preferences, from eye colours, nipple shapes to fingernails or colours.
But even more disturbing is the fact that many robots with a "personality" make the "reproducing wife" look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robots can come from definitions, such as shyness, depending on what users think is attractive.
There are also Roxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Company, which can predetermine character characteristics, including the slightly shy "cold Farah" and the "breathy Wendy."
"Roxxy Gold robots have personality that is as appropriate as possible to you," said True Company website.
That's why she loves what you love and hates what you do.
She was just like a normal person in those days!
She can be lazy, she can talk, or she can be "sexually strong!"
The rise of sex robots has caused a lot of unease — not only to replace real human relationships — but also to humble the female character of the knee and the hint of rape that moves on the cold (read as resistance) of Farah is the most worrying.
True Company compares Roxxy to a man's shock stick on its website.
The website says, "If a woman has a vibrating stick, then why can't a man have Roxxy?"
But these sex robots aren't just lovers, and they're not just sex toys.
Their emergence and growing maturity point to the darker and deeper parts of our culture: fleeing from perfect gender equality to sex with submission as an additional option.
Of course, most men do not leave sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the edge of consumption culture.
But something that infiltrates from the edges makes us see the course of the era in which we live.
Many people were neither weird nor aggressive until the free market gave them the chance to become so.
It is no coincidence that these fine sex robots appear in an era where the rights of women around the world are threatened, and a White House president boasts about sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the TV show The Story of the Angeless is not about pushing the real picture, it's not about the body hanging, it's not about the eyes being dug out, it's about the imagination that's too real.
The Republic of Gillean is a leap, but it doesn't seem so far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create the body that is most similar to a real woman (though in proportion to a porn star) as technologically possible.
The creators of these robots want them to have the human touch and imitate the real human movement.
But to put it bluntly, their “personality” does not represent a true woman.
They can't break up, they can't run away.
They have no recourse institutions, no follow-up story, no independence at all, and no possibility of breaking complete slavery illusions.
In other words, they're fun slaves.
Or according to the popular saying of 2017: make a girl.
The Great Wall tells the story of an elite Chinese army in ancient times to defend humanity and fight the Beast in the Great Wall, which is known throughout the world.
The final issue of the fourth season of Runaway Bros has been recorded. On May 30, Deng, the leader of the Runaway Boys Group, received a micro-letter interview from Shenyang Evening newspaper and Shenyang Network reporter, from the Run Man's "Teacher" to the "Jolly Bad Guy" in the "Hunting Man" Angel, and then to the "Flower Man" Chen Moo, and Deng's image of the audience is like the "Changing Star King", changing.
Deng said, "I won't do the same thing in the show. I'll keep it up to date."
Trump's great work?
Let Mitt Romney be the epiphany of common sense.
Political differences have led to the polarization of American voters, which, from a microeconomic point of view, has undermined American family harmony. This is strange enough for the Trump era.
Before and after Christmas and Thanksgiving, major newspapers in the United States filled the commentary column with fears about how to respond to the election of Trump relatives.
Usually it's thought that we're doing everything we can to crack our "filtration bubbles".
It is Trump's power to bring his family together to make less comments.
I mentioned this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, had a long history of discord with the Republicans in our family, and he was coming to visit me in New York this week.
She reminded me that united against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
As she worked with Trump at the White House, all the people she knew, even relatives of Republicans who had been fighting politically for decades, were suddenly and strangely on the same front.
It's certainly a good thing if they're all at the table. But I'm shocked that, from a broader perspective, this could be a major risk.
Although the leftist figure has always been encouraged by Trump, the heated effect of his presidency drives us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are talking about the possibility of fear that his odd behavior might one day stop.
However, there is another, more worrying, long-term scenario where Trump would like to “normalize” his relationship with the right-wing Republicans, who had opposed Mr. President's standards before, and now suddenly appear to be the symbol of reason.
I found myself recently missing a bit of the madness of Mitt Romney's version: putting dogs on cars, 14% of income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), and the crimes of these two moves do seem to be far too minor as compared to Trump.
After the Trump era passed, the next Republican candidate needed only rationally to qualify for incalculable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town, we took our kids to the carousel of New York Park, the biggest carousel managed by the central park administration in New York City. If you don't need coffee, these $3 tickets are the most valuable in the city.
The sound of the wooden horse is as loud as thunder, the central column is designed for fibreglass, all the clowns and animals turn their heads around, fearful and dangerously looking at their shoulders, and the jingle sounds strangely.
Too many mediocre cities are disappointing: the landscape overlooking high-rise buildings has become old-fashioned, the skyline has become too familiar with the incentives that no longer provide, and the reality of cities has not supported dreams.
35 years later, I haven't completely forgotten that day, and I found out that this "Swiss House" was not really a Swiss cabin, but rather a "Ye Old Swiss House" at the theme bar. I can't remember, but it's near a intersection in northern London.
However, the carousel in Central Park is still a magical experience, and everyone has fun for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four 40-year-olds and two girls.
If I could evaluate the carousel, I'd give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, I was asked to score one to five stars for my business experience before painting my credit card.
And in my coffee shop on the corner of the street, it's the same thing, and you can choose 15% tip for the rating, which is to buy things on the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down the supposed neutral transaction, but also to put pressure on the waiter to add personal factors to the unwanted scenario.
The poor lady in the department store laughed, and I was tired, and the credit card trading experience gave her five stars.
Oscar Pistolis moved from prison to hospital for chest pain.
It's the second time Pistolis left prison and moved to hospital.
Last year he was taken to hospital to treat a wrist cut, which the prison official claimed was caused by his fall in the cell.
Pistolis was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutor against the original wrongful killing decision.
In the early hours of Valentine ' s Day in 2013, he shot Stinkamp several times at his home in Pretoria through the toilet door until he died.
Pistolis claimed to mistook her as a breaker hiding in the booth at night.
The prosecutor has announced their intention to appeal again, this time for a six-year prison sentence against Pistolis, which they consider to be too generous.
The National Public Prosecutor ' s Office indicated that it would file an appeal with the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard this year.
If the prosecutor wins, Pistolis will face an increase to 15 years' imprisonment.
South Africa has no death penalty.

Would the meat, dairy products and chocolate help to alleviate inflammatory intestinal disease (IBD)?
The meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmare of your digestive system.
But a new study shows the opposite: diets rich in meat protein and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of inflammated intestinal diseases.
The incurable disease has had a life impact on about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 British, causing stomach cramps and abdominal swelling, regular or haemorrhaging diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at Washington University usually advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products in order to mitigate symptoms, but researchers find that key amino acid-colouric acids in proteins help to promote immune cell growth, which enhances the resilience of the intestinal tract.
Dr. Marco Colonna, Chief Researcher, explained that immune cells patrol the intestinal tract to ensure that harmful microorganisms hidden in food do not sneak into the body.
There is a balance between the cells that cause inflammation and the cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without harming all kinds of sensitive and fragile tissues.
Inflammational intestinal disease may occur when the equilibrium is too biased towards inflammation.
An immune-promoting cell was found in mice carrying specific bacteria.
Bacteria require chromosome amino acid (a component of protein) to form a cell's appearance.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a link between a bacterial population, which is a normal part of the intestinal microbial community, and the development of cells that promote resilience.
The more chromosome amino acids are consumed in the diet, the more immune cells they have.
He suggested that if humans used the same method, a combination of Lactacetic Bacillus and a gluten-rich diet, it might create a more resilient and less inflammated intestinal environment.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, a postdoctor researcher, studied an immune cell that enhances resilience when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but not when another group of the same strains were raised separately.
She suspected that the difference was related to the community of intestinal microorganisms in mice (the bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract).
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice found that six bacterial species existed in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
The mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked intestinal microorganisms and could not produce this immune cell, and the existence of Lactococcus produced immune cells.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers cultivate Lactium in liquids and then transfer small amounts of bacterium-free liquids to premature immune cells separated from young rats.
The immune cell developed into a resilient cell.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be demonstrated that the active ingredient is a by-product of glucose amino metabolite known as thi-3-emulsion acid.
When researchers doubled the number of chromosomes in mouse feed, the number of these cells increased by about 50%, but when the level of chromosomes was halved, the number of cells was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people, like rats, have the same cells with increased tolerance, and most of us have Lactus in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not yet known whether humans can induce cell development from Lactus by-products in their bodies, just like the little white mouse in the experiment, but genetic defects associated with chromino acid have been found among inflammatory intestine patients.
She said, "The growth of these cells may be exactly what we want because they control the inflammation reaction on the inside of the intestinal tract.
It may not be accurate to say that the presence of high-level chromosome acid in Lactium may lead to an increase in the number of species.
José Murinio thinks the Mansion signed the "genius" Nemaniya Matic.
On Wednesday night, following the first appearance of Nemaniya Matic in the Sampsolia competition, Muriño decided that Mansion had signed a "genius" midfield player.
Mathiech came from Chelsea, signed up for £40 million and won Paul Borgba and Andreas Perera in Dublin on Tuesday at 2-1 in the final pre-season match leading up to the European Super Bowl in Royal Madrid.
However, in the pre-Brunesti Asian Tour, Mattiche was seriously understated and only completed 45 minutes, and Muriño admitted that it needed improvement before the British super season began.
"He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and genius in thinking -- he thinks about football," Muriel said.
"We'll help him prepare as soon as possible."
Muriño started setting up his headlines at the beginning of the season. Like Mattiche, the newly signed players Victor Linderlov and Romelu Lukacu also started playing at the Injehua Stadium.
The independent newspaper reported this week that Muriño still wanted to bring in three more signed players, but he insisted that the club "worked well", he had four top-chosen players in his heart, and the club had already introduced three of them.
"The club brought in three of the signed players, and I appreciate it." He added.
"I'd be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they've done a lot for me."
Will China fall behind if it doesn't build the frigate?
With the recent announcement by the world's major naval powers of plans for the construction of new frigates, as if the frigates had become the focus of the attention of the naval forces of the major powers overnight. First, Japan decided to purchase two new frigates in its 2018 defence budget, which led to a substantial breakthrough in Japan's DEX frigate plan, and then the recent announcement by Lockheed Martin of the United States of America of the latest plan for the FFG frigate, where would China's new frigate go?
With the entry of the latest 054A frigate at the end of 2017, marking that the 054A frigate has built up up up to 29 ships and is approaching the sum of the 053H series of frigates, the construction of the 054A has been under way for 12 years since the first 054A came under water in 2006, and the construction of such a large number of high-performance common frigates has been built throughout the world. In addition to China, only the "Peri"-class frigates built by the United States in the 7th and 80th
And the reason why so many 054As have been built is simple, that is to say, it's good for real, good for good, and it adds up to the debt owed by the Navy over the years.
The frigate 054A, which has been favoured by the Chinese Navy for many years with a higher value and good combat power, has had about 4,000 tons of drainage, carried a 76 mm main gun, 32 units of a sea red flag-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missile co-launching hair-trigger system, eight eagles struck 83 and a direct-9 helicopter, although it was built in 2006 and was designed earlier, but its combat power, even today, is not so bad that it can reach the upper-middle level among the world's frigates.
But this is, after all, a ship designed at the beginning of the 21st century, with a weapons configuration on one side, its power systems and electronic radar equipment already far apart from the current world mainstream frigates, and it is time to develop new sizes when the same type of frigates in Europe are equipped with full electric propulsion, small multifunctional array radars, large-sized helicopter decks.
So how China's new frigate should develop is directly related to its future orientation and the strategic approach of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will definitely become the Bluewater Navy, and the future will be the ocean, with areas where China ' s vital interests are at stake for rapid deployment, demonstrating the presence of force and, if necessary, strong combat power to ensure that China ' s vital interests in the region are not compromised. So it seems that the new Hu Weijiang will move towards large-scale and distant oceanization.
Then look at the location of the new frigate in the future Chinese Navy sequence. The future Chinese Navy should be similar to the United States Navy. In addition to the required offshore defense vessels, other main naval ships will form carrier battle groups or amphibious attack ships as required.
And the role of the new frigate should serve as an anti-submarine main force and a neutral position in the mid-to-central region in the future carrier battles, and as a frigate class in the amphibious attack ship strikers, according to which the new frigate must have strong anti-submarine capabilities and good mid-range regional emptiness capabilities.
Based on the above positioning, a bold vision of the future of the frigate is possible.
First of all, there will be a significant increase in discharges relative to the current 054A frigates, with an estimated discharge volume of 5,000-6000 tons from the new frigates; the power system will use an integrated power propulsion system consisting of an QC280 modified gas turbine and two diesel engines, with a maximum speed expected to reach around 30 knots, and the continued capacity will increase significantly as far as the weapons are equipped with 76 mm main cannons and 1130 near defenses should be retained, but a red flag 10 launch system will be added, and a 32-48 unit of
That would bring the overall level of the new frigate to the world's current best standards, even if it were less than the FFG of the United States.
Of course, the above-mentioned concept is merely an assumption of the new frigate produced by the nation, and in particular how we can only find out when the new frigate is in the water, so let us look forward to it together.

In recent years, our city has encouraged enterprises to participate actively in the construction of national, industry and regional group standards, awarded 300,000 yuan to enterprises that are primarily or are involved in the development of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards, and 500,000 yuan to enterprises that manufacture brand certification through Zhejiang, which is the highest level of the award in the province and stimulates business participation in the subject matter.
Today, at the Wang Li Group Production Workshop, the head of the group ' s system, Gao Jian, together with his staff, is packing a safe door box for anti-piracy purposes as a sample for participating in the Zhejiang manufacturing group standard-to-standard compliance work to be sent to the Shashing Quality Monitoring Centre.
Just the last two days, Wang Li has passed the on-site audit of the `Zhejiang Manufacturing' certification team.
Xiang Jian said that a professional team of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations commended the group for its performance in core areas such as excellence in quality, autonomous innovation, and agreed that there was a perfect match, and that Wangqiang would be one of the first companies to pass the standard as long as the product passed the test.
Wang Lei Group is just a microcosm of standard-driven industrial transformation and upgrading.
The Zhejiang manufacturing group standards and compliance with the standards are being implemented in parallel with the city ' s Xiangjiang manufacturing group, along with the Qingyang group and the group promotion group.

In recent times, everyone has been talking about recent changes in real estate policy, whether real estate policy will be untying again? Will land policy provide a multiplicity of subjects that will cause housing prices to fall?
But at a time when we were worried about real estate prices, macroeconomic regulation, and the future of the real estate market, the People's Daily wrote again. The last time we devoted our comments to the regulation of real estate, the People's Daily writes about the regulation of real estate, but now the People's Daily writes about a subject that is more serious than buying a house, that is, can you afford a debt even if you can afford a house?
Today, let's talk about a bigger problem than buying a house: loan repayment.
I. The growing housing debt crisis in China
On 17 January, the People ' s Daily edition published a review article, Awards and Loans. The joys and worries of struggling youth. According to the data, in November 2017, China ' s State Financial and Development Laboratory and the National Balance Sheet Research Centre issued by China ' s Social Science and Technology Institute reported that the deleveraging rate in the residential sector continued its upward trend, rising from 47.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6 per cent in the third quarter, an increase of 1.3 percentage points, and an increase of 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The share of debt of the resident sector in the overall real economy has increased and the leverage rate has risen faster.
Studies indicate that China ' s family ' s liabilities in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, which account for about two thirds of the resident ' s liabilities, approximately twice as much as the operating loans.
Among them, medium- and long-term loans, dominated by housing loans, account for about 80 per cent of consumer loans, but in terms of volume, short-term consumer loans are growing faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition to that, China ' s household debt rate merely accounts for the total amount of credit that the family sector has received from financial institutions, while Chinese families have a number of private borrowings, including borrowing money from relatives and friends, and have large hidden debts.
In view of the data, it is difficult to tell the story. According to the statistics of the Suning Institute of Financial Studies, the leverage rate for Chinese residents was only 3 per cent in 1996 and 18 per cent in 2008, but since 2008 it has begun to grow rapidly, doubling in just six years, reaching 36.4 per cent, and in the third quarter of 2017 it has reached 48.6 per cent.
Let's compare the data again. In May last year, HSBC Bank released a survey report across nine countries, with respondents approaching tens of thousands of people.
The report was visited by the Millennium generation of young people (born between 1980 and 2000) in nine countries.
The report states that China ' s housing ownership rate for young people after 80 or 90 years is as high as 70 per cent, far behind the second largest Mexican (46 per cent) and twice the level of the United States target (35 per cent).
The data tell us that one of the most likely problems is that China's biggest potential “grey rhinoceros” at this stage will probably not be able to pay off their debt compared to being unable to afford a house.
II. Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have previously analysed, although we've been saying that China has higher housing prices, the housing ownership rate in China is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world.
We look around the world's real estate market, China's real estate market has not experienced a major real estate crisis, except for what we said earlier about Hainan, but the origin of the 2008 financial tsunami worldwide just 10 years ago was the real estate crisis in the United States.
The reason for the real estate crisis in the United States was attributed to two rooms: the house, the house, the house, and the house.
In the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold houses to low-income people in the United States in an effort to expand sales at a very low initial payment, and when the United States economy was better, the real estate market also flourished. However, as the United States economy stagnated, the income of home buyers fell, so large household consumption expenditures began to fall.
However, the current situation in the United States was one of financial assets and real estate assets that formed part of United States household assets. Almost all household assets of the low-income group in the United States were real estate, while most of the assets of the top 20 per cent of the high-income group were financial assets, the higher the debt rate for real estate in the United States.
A serious fact is that these people buy houses in better economic times, so the money to pay their mortgages is also calculated in terms of their better income. When income falls, the pressure on mortgages not only does not decrease, but even increases because some subprime loan schemes have become floating, so the real estate problems of these American families have gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
So, because the income was too low to pay the mortgage, the bank began to recover the property, and when the bank recovered the property from the buyer who owed the loan, they sold it at a very low price, which led to a steep decline in housing prices in the region. This process led to a vicious circle in which, when the house price fell to a certain level, more and more buyers found that the value of their house was even lower than their loan, so more people stopped paying their mortgages and caused more bad debts.
As a result, a huge vicious circle emerged:
"The recession — the decline in income — some people can't afford to pay their mortgages — banks sell their unindependable houses at low prices — house prices fall — more people stop paying their mortgages — banks sell them — house prices fall..."
And the problem is more than that, because the house price continues to fall, you don't have a debt after people stop paying the bank for the house, and if the money you owe to the bank for the house to be auctioned by the bank is still not on your loan, then you still need to pay back the money, simply say, assuming that you bought a house worth $3 million with a down payment of $600,000 and a loan worth 2.4 million, and when the house fell to only $2 million, you stopped paying the house to the bank, and after the bank auctioned the house, you not only lost
As a result, under such a vicious cycle, the economy of the United States gradually collapsed, eventually triggering the 2008 financial crisis in the United States.
Therefore, the high level of China ' s household debt rate of 46.8 per cent at this stage is a matter of great concern. The data is still below the level of developed countries, but the problem has begun to emerge, and the country has repeatedly stressed deleveraging since last year. This is a very priori judgement. If the household debt rate is allowed to continue to climb, it will entail a huge risk.
As a result, the house was located for housing, not for fumigation, and the State speeded up the establishment of multi-subject supply, multi-channel security, rental acquisition and mergers, among many other measures, to further mitigate potential risks.
For our own families, it is important to abandon real estate speculation, buy houses in a way that avoids their families falling into a huge burden. Only a reasonable assessment of their income and level of indebtedness is a healthy path to family wealth development.

On 10 July, the National Statistical Office released the National Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Industrial Producers ' Plant Price Index (PPI) for June 2016.
White House props cost thousands of dollars.
According to the military records published in Times magazine, last month the White House decided to transport a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of American manufacturing, at a cost of up to US$ 24,000.
Shikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine 1 when the president was on board, was an important exhibit in the White House on July 17, highlighting US construction project activities.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Burns and senior White House officials visited manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibits included helicopters made in Connecticut, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter to appear on the daily order (FRAGO), according to the records of the first fleet of marine helicopters (HMX-1) of the unit responsible for operating the helicopter, that is, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the south lawn to participate in the “special” event.
The day before the event, the HMX-1 commander, in an e-mail sent to the superior Deputy Commander of the Marine Corps, said, "I just want to make sure that you know because this event is highly valued."
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive on the south lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 at 3 p.m. and leave only after clearing the lawn at 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on the same night.
The information also indicates that, in case the departure from the White House is delayed, the return flight will require a second crew because of the time limit on duty.
The original crew was on standby at the side of the helicopter during the operation, while the security forces were on standby nearby while the aircraft was on the ground.
The record from Time magazine does not clearly indicate whether a second crew is ultimately needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record indicates that HMX-1 asked whether the event was in violation of the Act.
The commander wrote, "The question we asked is whether this is a violation of the Hutch Act and was told that there was no violation."
"It sounds like you're locked up." Deputy Commander replied.
The White House defined this “United States manufacturing” activity as an official activity and is therefore not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even official events are political.
At the event, the President pursued the issue of the then Senate: medical reform and boasted about the regulation of government regulations.
The use of Marine 1 or Air Force 1 for political propaganda purposes is no longer new.
Successive presidents have been asked to travel with these aircraft.
However, it is not common for them to be requisitioned for the sole purpose of photographing.
Trump received attention in February, when the presidential jet slipped slowly in Melbourne, Florida, and ended up in the background of his first campaign rally, while his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the use of the presidential jet by the former president.
Lindsay Walters, White House deputy news spokesman, said, "The White House was excited about this "American Manufacturing" exhibition, which showed products from all 50 states that were made by American workers using American materials."
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn to practice the accurate placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
HMX-1 practiced 58 landings at the White House during Trump's G-20 Summit in Germany in early July.
According to one official, this U.S. manufacturing flight was included in this month ' s crew training requirements.
The helicopter unit also flew an additional 11 hours of "non-presidential support mission" that day.
The White House claimed that the taxpayers did not bear the cost of any other props for the event.
Sikorsky spokeswoman said the company was not involved in arranging a South Lawn helicopter show.
HMX-1 did not keep budgetary records of presidential flights, and it was very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence ' s hourly fees recorded for the 2017 fiscal year, the reimbursable costs of the Ministry of Defence of VH-3D are US$24,380 per flight hour.
Troop records recorded 30 minutes of each flight from the base of the Marine Corps Airport in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House claimed that the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower than the cost.
Walters claims that "it is very misleading to estimate the costs paid by taxpayers on the basis of reimbursable fees.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs, including in annual allocations.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the reimbursable costs of the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs, but do include oil, maintenance and contracting costs.
At that time, the former White House news spokesman, Sean Speicher, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to show what was made in the United States this week.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, and they both have contributed to our national security, and I guess there are hundreds of jobs that depend on them even if there aren't thousands of them.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the fruit of countless American efforts.
So it's certainly not out of date to make this clear."
We don't know if Trump interacted with the helicopter during a tour of the South Lawn during his activities, but he did take the driving seat of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to a representative of Sikorsky and joked about his own company's aircraft and the media.
He said, "I know the Sikorsky plane. I have three."

The name of the rich tree, “Maraba Chests”, is a tropical plant of Mexican origin, warm and moist, and it is only when many conditions, such as sunlight, moisture and nutrients, are appropriate that flowering can occur.
Even in the wild, where tropical conditions are right, it is rare for rich trees to bloom and there was a saying that the flowering rate was only one in a thousand.

According to the Market Star, between 2005 and 2011, my provincial GDP rose from the central side to the bottom.
But my provincial economic growth continues to be hampered by low investment efficiency and the lack of core competitiveness of the industrial economy. To this end, the latest issue of the Economic Blue Page of the provincial economic information centre proposes to improve the quality and effectiveness of economic growth.
It is based on a number of representative indicators of our provincial economy in 2005 and 2011 and is compared with the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic efficiency, in 2011, high energy-consuming industries such as industrial energy and raw materials, which account for a significant proportion of my province, were more affected by market fluctuations and were overcapacityed by a “double pressure”, while leading industries such as domestic electricity and automobiles were under-innovated, resulting in low profits.
And large investments that do not bring corresponding economic benefits are important reasons for the poor quality and efficiency of economic growth in our province.
In this regard, the experts recommend that effective measures be taken to encourage innovation in enterprises, and that the scientific and technological achievements of universities and scientific institutes be “transferred” to enterprises in a timely manner.
With regard to the industrial economy, which was not very cost-effective, experts said that industrial mergers and restructuring should also be actively promoted, industrial layout optimized and industrial chains extended.

The British General Union (GMB) focused on investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow.
The union hopes that the management of McVitata, the manufacturer of biscuits, will ensure a long-term commitment to production at the Lasco factory.
According to the Scottish branch of the British General Union, the company has remained silent about the future of the Tollcross factory investment.
The factory has more than 500 employees and produces products such as oatmeal biscuits (Hobnobs) and rich tea biscuits (Rich Tea).
Pladis, the owner of McVitat, said that the company had invested more than £5 million in the factory over the past few years.
He added that if there was a change in the operation of the factory, the employees and trade union representatives would "take the lead in knowing".
In a letter addressed to the director of the company, the Scottish branch of the British General Union called on McVitat to “solve the money that has not been carried over to the modernization of the production line”.
The Senior Founder of the British General Union, Drew Duffy, said, "We can't get a clear picture of the future business needs and investment plans of Tollcross from the general manager of the factory, which is a source of deep concern for our members.
Generations and generations of families work here, and the high concentration of labour in the local community and Grand Glasgow is an important pillar of decent employment in regions with high unemployment and severe social deprivation.
Therefore, from the point of view of employment, pay and economic prosperity, the eastern Glasgow region urgently needs an expansion of the McVita production network against the backdrop of the rising cost of living and the long-term decline of manufacturing in the United Kingdom.”
The spokesperson for Pradis said, "The director of Tollcross just received a letter yesterday from the Scottish branch of the General Union of British Trade Unions, and the company will respond immediately because we value continuous contact with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the British General Union in Tollcrouss to discuss a number of issues openly.
We had discussions with our employees, and then, like all other companies operating in an environment of intense competition and economic uncertainty, we reviewed the continuing business model that we applied to enterprises and factories in order to maintain competitiveness.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross factory, especially in terms of production lines and business improvements.
We are fully aware of the historical status of Tollcross as a production base, and if there is any change in our operations at the plant, employees and union representatives will be the first to know.”
The Deputy Director of the Sports Bureau of the Tibet Autonomous Region of the China-China News Agency, Chen Xianbin, on May 11th, Nima Tsien, 10th, said at the base camp of the north slope of Everest, that the future clean-up of living garbage on the north slope of Everest would move from past actions of public interest to regularizing practices led by the Chinese Government and involving the international community.
On 10 May, environmental volunteers loaded the classified garbage into the truck.
In the last decade or so, the Chinese news agency journalist Ho Hong Peng took a picture of the environmental problems at the peaks' location as the number of explorers and tourists on Everest increased dramatically.

The video was also shown at the Tokyo World Climate Conference, which attracted world attention.
According to Nima Tren, after 1997, the public interest team has been cleaning the northern slopes of Everest, but most of the participants are non-professionals.
Three years ago, St. Germain of Paris warned Barcelona to sign Nemal?
Nica might regret throwing an olive branch at Marco Valetti.
After putting forward an offer of £189 million to allow it to exercise the exemption clause, St. Germain of Paris wouldn't give up signing into Nemal, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago to launch an attack on the world record raider?
This sensational approach has opened the summer roundup window, and the Al-Facak Club is about to break the world round record at twice the price of the last round. Paul Borgba returned to Mansion last season for up to £89 million.
Once the transition is complete, Nemal will jump to the highest bidder in the world and will also be the world's highest-paid professional player — St. Germain, Paris, provides after-tax pay of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona was angry at Nemal's way of attacking and breaking out, and sources of information about the Catalan team's board of directors insisted that after his arrival from Santos in 2013, the club did everything possible to take care of him.
But did President St. Germain of Paris make such predictions about the football world three years ago?
When Man City expressed interest in signing Bryce Matedi in 2014, Nasser Al-Hleifi issued a strong warning to any club that wanted to sign on to the best players in St. Germain in Paris.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we'll definitely confront them, and we'll contact their players," Al-Hulafi says.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign on to our players, they will also suffer the consequences."
Earlier this summer, the Spanish club seemed to have crossed the line and Barcelona threw an olive branch at Marco Valetti, the middle player of St. Germain in Paris.
St. Germain of Paris made it clear that they would never allow the Italian foot to leave, and Barcelona would most likely be affected by the loss of Nemar, the genius of the battle.

The British Sports Council is responsible for allocating funds for each Olympic project and, of course, also for issuing medals for each project.

In the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, the British delegation achieved one gold and one silver and two copper, the best since the first Winter Olympics in 1924.
Wales AM worried about "like an idiot."
It was suggested that AM should change the title to MWP, which shocked a lot of AM.
The reason for the proposal is that it is planned to change the name of Parliament to the Welsh Assembly.
The political community's AM is worried it'll make people laugh.
A Labour Party AM said that the Labour Party members were concerned about "this name rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
(Non-Wales readers know that in Welsh, twp means "breath" and pwp means "shit."
One JP AM said that the entire JP was “unsatisfactory” and suggested replacing it with another name.
A Welsh Conservative said that the Conservative Party was "open to this change of name", but pointed out that MWP was easily pronunciated as Muppet.
In that context, the Welsh letter w is pronunciation similar to the Yorkshire English letter u.

In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals for these names, and there was general support for the use of the name "Wales Parliament".
With regard to the title of AM, the Committee appreciated the preference for WMP (Wales Councillor), but the highest support rate in the public consultation results was MWP.
It is clear that AM proposes to use other names, but the president of the meeting, Elin Jones, has the headache that there is a delay in reaching agreement, as he is expected to submit draft legislation on name changes within a few weeks.
Legislation on reform will also incorporate other changes in the way Parliament operates, including rules for the disqualification of AM and the design of the committee system.
AM will vote on the final name during the legislative debate.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing the name of the country.
Voters will vote on Sunday to vote on whether to change the name of the country to "North Republic of Macedonia".
The direct vote was to resolve the decades-long dispute between Macedonia and neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens maintained that the name of its northern neighbour meant that Greece had legal rights over its territory, and repeatedly rejected Macedonia ' s accession to the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, was the opponent of this changed-name referendum and said he would not participate in the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that changing the name was nothing more than the inevitable cost of joining the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
The church in Harlem is in danger and the bells in St Martin's church are silent.
"The old people I've interviewed in history say there's a bar and a church in every corner," Adams says.
"Now, there is no bar, there is no church."
He said the bar's disappearance was reasonable.
"Now, people are starting to socialize in different ways," Adams said.
"The bar is no longer the neighborhood living room people regularly visit."
As for the church, he feared that the money to sell the assets would not last as long as the leaders expected, and that the money would sooner or later be zero.
He added that the church would be replaced by an apartment building and that the apartment would contain people who would not help maintain the remaining shelter in the neighbourhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "so it will accelerate the overall closure of churches, because most people who move into these apartments are unlikely to be members of churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations 10 years after St Martin's Church was built, before Harlem became a black city (the 1870 metropolitan community).
The original white Methodist congregations moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation who was performing worship nearby acquired ownership of the building.
Under the leadership of the John Howard Johnson pastor, the Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation. Pastor Johnson led a campaign against 125 Street retailers, 125 of which was a major shopping street in Harlem, but refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but since the parish residents of Father Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also commissioned the construction of the bell gin.
Father Johnson's son, the heir to St. Martin's Church, David Johnson, the priest arrogantly called the bell of the poor.
The professionals who played the bell in July called it "Culture Treasure" and "An irreplaceable historic instrument".
This professional, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also pointed out that this was the world's first bell played by a black musician named Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the Riverside church 18 years ago to play the bigger bell.
Merriweather said the Church of St. Martin did not find someone to take his place.
What happened at St. Martin's Church in the last few months was a complex story about architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by secular leaders of churches and others by bishops.
The parish administration (the parish council, made up of secular leaders) wrote to the parish in July, expressing concern that “the parish was trying to transfer capital to the parish council”, although the parish councillor would not be involved in hiring architects and contractors for the parish delivery.
Some parish residents complained about the lack of transparency in the conduct of parishes.
A 13-year-old boy in California was bitten by a shark while diving for lobster.
Officially, on Saturday, the opening day of the California lobster fishing season, a 13-year-old boy was bitten by a shark while diving to catch lobster.
The attack took place near the Beach in Ensinitas by 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel, in an interview with KSWB TV in Santiago, said that on Saturday morning, he dived with his friends, and about half an hour later he heard a boy shout out for help, so the pedestrians came up and dragged him out of the water.
Hamel said he thought the boy was too excited to catch lobster at first, but then he realized that the boy was yelling, 'I was bitten!'
I've been bitten!
His entire clavicle was torn open”, while Harmel said he noticed as soon as he got to the boy.
"I'm calling people to pull him out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' "Hamel said again.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital for Children in Santiago, where the situation is critical.
The species of sharks in the attacks are not yet clear.
Captain Larry Giles, the lifeguard, said at a press conference that a shark had been found in the area a few weeks earlier, but it had been determined that it would not pose a danger to humanity.
Jares added that the victim's upper body was traumatized.
For investigative and security reasons, the government shut down Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ensientas for 48 hours.
Jares said there were more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them did not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury's planning to march into the British beauty market.
Sainsbury's is going to use Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' department store style to open a beauty channel with professional assistants.
As a large number of department stores march into the British beauty market, valued at £2.8 billion, and during the fall of fashion and household goods sales, the market continues to grow and will be tested for beauty lanes in 11 stores across the country, and if the tests succeed, they will be extended to more stores next year.
The supermarket decided to invest in beauty products and to use the shelf space as a result of the prosecution of TV sets, microwave ovens and home goods shelves.
The Seinesbury department store stated that it would double the size of beauty products and roll out more than 3000 products, including brands such as Luhuameng (Revlon), Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'oreal, Maybeline and Burt's Bees will also be given greater space to have brand areas similar to those of stores like Boots.
The supermarket has also relaunched its own series of fine cosmetics so that most products are pure vegetarian products — what more young shoppers want.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will open two licensed shops in Seinsbury. The first shop opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and the other one will open in Sully Oak, Birmingham, by the end of this year.
The current trend towards online shopping and the purchase of small quantities of food in local convenience stores every day means that supermarkets must take more measures to attract people.
Mike Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of Seansbury's department store, said that the supermarket chain would provide more services and non-food items to counter discount vendors Aldi and Lidl, which would increasingly look like department stores.
Since the acquisition of these two chains two years ago, Cynsbury's department store has been opening Argos stores in hundreds of stores and introducing some Habitat. The company says the acquisition boosts the sale of groceries and brings profits.
The supermarket also tried to transform beauty and pharmacy before, but failed.
At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Seinsbury and Botzi tried to run a joint venture, but their cooperation ended after a dispute over how to collect revenue from the pharmacy in Bozi Supermarket.
Three years ago, Seansbury proposed a new strategy to sell 281 drugstories to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, Celesio, for £125 million.
The company said that Lloyds Pharmacy would add a series of luxury skin protection brands to four shops, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, and would therefore play an important role in the plan.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the business director of Seinesbury, said, "We've changed the appearance and atmosphere of the beauty passage and improved the environment for our customers."
We have also invested in the introduction of specially trained colleagues who will provide advice in the field.
A series of our brands are designed to meet every demand, and an attractive environment and convenient geographical location means that we are now a visible beauty destination and will be a major challenge for traditional shopping methods.
After Holly Willoughby dropped out of the Pound11 million deal, Peter Jones was "breathing angry."
The TV host, Holly Willoughby, withdrew from the £11 million lifestyle brand business, and instead concentrated on a new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV, which made Dragans Dens the star Peter Jones "breathing angry."
Willoughby didn't have time to invest in their home clothes and apparel brand Trily.
This is like Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand for partner business.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced in Instagram his decision to quit.
At the last minute, Holly Willoughby withdrew from a lucrative lifestyle brand business and turned to a rich new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which made the Dragon Cavern star Peter Jones angry.
According to sources, the television gold boy admitted at an intense meeting on Tuesday at the Malo Commercial Empire headquarters in Buckingham County that she had made a new deal worth Pound1.5 million, and when she heard the news, Jones was "breathingly angry" because it meant that she would not have enough time to invest in the brand Trily of their cooperative home clothes.
This business, like Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, could have doubled Willoughby's estimate of 11 million pounds.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was withdrawing from Truly, Jones was on his way from England by plane to one of his resorts.
One source said, "Truly was Holly's top priority.
This will be her long-term future plan for decades to come.
The decision to withdraw was a shock to all participants.
No one believes what happened on Tuesday because it looks like it's about to go to the market.
Marlow's headquarters has an entire warehouse waiting to sell."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the United Kingdom ' s most profitable facilitator, This Morning, could cost the company millions of dollars, as the company invests heavily in products such as mats, candles, clothing and household goods, and may further delay market delivery.
This may mean the end of a long friendship.
Dan Baldwin, who is now the mother of three children, and her husband, Jones and his wife Tara Capp, have been close friends for 10 years.
Willoughby and Capp formed the Trely brand in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as a director in March.
The couple are always on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares of the TV production company in Polvin.
Willoughby will become M&S' brand advocate and replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's host for "I'm A Celebity".
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business affairs."
After the solemn talks, "We're in love."
In response to the media criticism, he joked about it. Some people thought it was "defeating the presidency" and overrated North Korean leaders.
Why would President Trump sacrifice so much?
Trump mimics the sound of the news anchor and says:
"I didn't sacrifice anything."
He noted that in June, the first meeting of the leaders of the two countries had been held in Singapore, and Trump commended the initiative as an important step towards the denuclearization of North Korea. Kim Jong-un now intends to meet again.
But the denuclearization negotiations are at an impasse.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean Supreme Diplomat Lee Yong-ho addressed world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, saying that North Korea had not seen the United States “satisfactory response” to Korea's early disarmament actions.
He pointed out that the United States continued to press back and impose sanctions.
Trump showed optimism in his rally speech.
He said, "We're getting along well with North Korea."
"If we start a war with North Korea,
I'm afraid millions of people have died.
Now, that's a good relationship."
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong-un had yielded positive results, rocket tests had been terminated, hostages had been saved and the remains of American soldiers had fallen behind.
In addition, when he talked about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, he justified his particular approach by saying,
"It's easy to be president, but instead of bringing 10,000 people outside into this crowded space, we'd rather have 200 people standing here," Trump said directly to the crowd in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroyed an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Longmai Island, agencies such as foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they did not need their help.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 per cent of the population of the island, the Government has not declared a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for the initiation of international assistance.
"It is regrettable that, in many cases, they are well aware that they will not ask for international assistance, and therefore this will be a huge challenge for them," Ms. Sumbung said.
Save the Children (Save the Children) organized a team to Baru, but it is not yet possible to determine whether foreign staff will be able to access the site.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Agency Sutopo said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Baru to determine whether international agencies needed to be involved in the relief effort.
Knowing that Indonesia is likely to continue to experience earthquakes and face the fury of nature, Indonesia is still not well prepared.
Although Aceh has built a tsunami shelter, other coastlines have not followed suit.
Although tsunami warnings are in force, Baru has a clear lack of tsunami warnings, which could be the main cause of human casualties.
Even under the most favourable circumstances, it is challenging to travel across many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
A medical boat that was supposed to be stationed on Longming Island to rescue earthquake victims is on its way to Baru, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster relief site.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of poor infrastructure in Indonesia a central element of his campaign and has spent a great deal of money on repairing roads and railways.
However, as the elections will be re-elected next year, the shortage of funds has plagued the Government of Zoko.
Zoko is also under constant pressure from Indonesian sectarian tensions, and the majority of Muslim members are more conservative in their beliefs.
Christian and Muslim gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other crude weapons to fight in the streets, killing more than 1,000 people and displacing tens of thousands.
Watch: The Liverpool team Daniel Sturridge will score evenly in the battle against Chelsea.
Saturday, at Stanford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool's loss to Chelsea in the English Super Bowl by winning the 89th minute goal.
Stuart received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, when his team was 1-0 behind.
He passed the ball lightly to the left and then opened the door to the distant pillar.
When the ball moves towards the upper right corner of the gate, it flies very high above the restricted area.
Eventually, they crossed the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Stuart said, "I just want to get into that position, control the ball, then Shaq and others will move as far forward as possible, and I'm just trying to create possibilities for myself."
"I saw Canter walk over, touch the ball, shoot without thinking too much."
After the 25th minute was hit by the Belgian star Eden Hazard, Chelsea temporarily took the lead at 1-0 in midfield.
In that game, the Blue Army fronter passed the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic and then dumped the defense break-in half of Liverpool near midfield.
Kovassic played a quick sensitisation in the middle of the field.
Then, with a beautiful direct pass, Azar was taken into the restricted area.
Azar went beyond defense and left foot shot across the Liverpool team, Alisson Becker, and shot into the long-distance pillar.
Wednesday afternoon at 3 p.m., the Liverpool team will be at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, to face the Naples team in the European League of Champions (Champions League) team.
The Chelsea team will meet with the Vidioton team in the UEFA Europa League in London at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday.
The death toll caused by the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The Indonesian National Disaster Management Authority said in the early hours of Sunday that the death toll caused by the earthquake in Indonesia had risen to 832 people.
A spokesman for the Authority, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, reported at a press conference that a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday had caused waves of up to six metres (20 feet), which had caused buildings to collapse, and that many people had been trapped in the ruins of buildings.
The city of Palou, with a population of more than 380,000 people, is full of ruins and fragments of the collapsed building.
32-year-old man arrested by the police for murdering a woman.
This morning, the police opened an investigation into the murder of a female body found in Birkenhead, Mossed County.
The victim, a 44-year-old woman, was found dead at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, with marks of stab wounds on his body, and the man involved, 32 years old, was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called on the people of the area to come forward and provide clues.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is still in its early stages, and I call on the crowd around Birkenhead John Street to contact us if there's any leads.
At the same time, I call upon all people, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if any leads are captured in the CarLog, and the information you have is vital to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the victim was a local Birkenhead and that the body was found in a house.
This afternoon, a friend who knew the lady arrived at the scene and asked where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have indicated that the victim ' s relatives are being informed.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just wanted to return to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
Find out what happened and he won't say a word.
At present, residents are notified and will have to wait a few hours to enter.
A policeman told a man that the entire area had been designated as a crime scene.
A woman cried at the scene.
He kept saying, "It's too bad."
At 2 p.m., two police cars were parked inside the cordon and a van was parked outside the cordon.
A number of police officers were standing inside the cordon to monitor the apartment building.
Any person with knowledge can send DM to @merPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers (telephone 0800 555 111), citing the record of September 30, 247.
The Assembly's Cromwell statue became a monument to the final dispute over "rew history".
Crunwell's fanatical pilgrim followers were responsible for the Taliban-style destruction of British cultural and religious monuments and the banishment was a punishment.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal "extremely stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate about removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell, located outside the Westminster Palace, will undoubtedly be targeted.
The destruction of idolism in the British civil war was neither directed by Cromwell nor launched by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's biggest mistake was to be the victim of what his predecessor, Thomas, had done in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's high praise for Cromwell is a good testimony to the 19th century's ideas and is part of the Cromwell History that many believe is still worthy of celebration.
Kim Smith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Clenville is considered by many to be the defender of Congress against external pressure (and, in his case, the monarchy), and today it may be less so than in the late 19th century.
Whether this expression is completely accurate has been the subject of historical controversy.
But it is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century affected the subsequent development of our country and that Cromwell was recognized as a person representing the divided side.
His achievements as Protector of the Nation deserve to be celebrated and commemorated as well.”
The "killing pig" tore China's farmers to death.
According to local media reports, a farmer was killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
On Saturday, the South China Morning News reported that a man named Yuan, who was found dead, had his arteries cut off and had blood all over his body near a market in six bowls of water in Guizhou Province.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer from a pig farm in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China, was preparing to inoculate the pig.
On Wednesday, the pig farmer and his cousin reportedly arrived in the local market from Yunnan, a neighbouring province, to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin found out that the pighouse had died and that the door close to the pighouse was open.
He reported that there was a larger male pig in the pig's coil and that there was blood in his mouth.
According to reports, a forensic medical certificate confirmed that a 550-pound fat pig had attacked and killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs are bloody and miserable" quotes the news of "Youyang's Evening News." The cousin of Wu said.
The surveillance video shows Yuan's last name men feeding pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning.
And his body was found about an hour later.
But the fat pig who died did not belong to Yuan's family name nor to his cousin.
The market manager revealed to the Evening News that the fat pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others again, while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
It was reported that Yuan's family members and market authorities were negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been previous reports of pigs attacking human beings.
In 2016, on a farm in Massachusetts, a pig attacked a woman and her husband, seriously injuring both people.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound fat pig held a farmer in Wales on a tractor until his wife came to scare the animal away.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon was swallowed up by his own pig, and a farmer in Manitoba's Lake revealed to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation News Network (CBC News) that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a trigger agent.
"They just like to play.
They're as curious as kids and they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them proper respect”, he said.
The remnants of the hurricane, Rosa, will continue to cause massive storms in the southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa continued to move along the northern coast of Mexico, and, as forecast, the wind weakened after reaching this cool sea.
In the coming days, however, Rosa is expected to bring widespread heavy rains and flash floods to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday, at 5 a.m. East Time, the centre of "Rosa" is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, with a wind speed of 85 miles/hour, falling within category 1 hurricane.
It is expected that Rosa will continue north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific began to form a low valley eastward to the west coast of the United States. Rosa will form a tropical storm on Monday near the Lower California peninsula, when deep tropical moisture will march north towards the southwest of the United States.
Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rainfall to parts of Mexico.
Thereafter, tropical moisture interacts with the coming valley and will cause extensive heavy rainfall in the south-west region in the coming days.
At the local level, 1-4 inch rainfall causes flooding, mudslides and even landslides in deserts.
The effect of deep tropical moisture will bring rainfall up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona.
Rainfall in parts of southwest is expected to range from 2 to 4 inches, especially in most areas of Arizona.
Because of the scattered nature of tropical rains and the rapid deterioration of conditions, flooding is likely to occur.
Desert risk-taking activities will be dangerous due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause the canyon to form a steep river, and thunderstorms can bring local wind and dust.
The coming valley will bring some local heavy rains to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total rainfall may exceed half an inch, which may lead to a slight mud flow and road slide.
This will be the first rains since the region entered the rainy season.
Sunday night and Monday morning, Arizona will come with scattered tropical showers, after which the rains will expand during the night and Tuesday.
The rain will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
As the Arctic gets colder and the tropics remain quite warm, temperatures across the United States will experience severe fluctuations in October.
This sometimes leads to drastic changes in temperature within short distances.
On Sunday, there will be a huge temperature gap in Central America.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, will be close to 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the heat that will last forever will expand.
Most parts of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to begin the summer heat in October, and from the southern plains to parts of the northeast, the temperature will reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 27 degrees Fahrenheit).
The temperature in New York City may also reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday (approximately 27 degrees Fahrenheit), which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Long-term climate projections indicate that, as of the first half of October, temperatures in the eastern part of the United States were above average.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, the hearing of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh with the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s was broadcast on six television networks, attracting more than 20 million viewers.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, and the broadcasters disrupted the final turn of Friday's regular show: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona promised to ask the FBI to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Committee that he was 100% sure that Cavanaugh was drunk at the high school party, touched his body and wanted to take off her clothes.
Cavanaugh responded generously, saying that he certainly did not do so 100%.
Nelson reported last Friday that there might be over 204 million people watching this hearing.
The company is calculating the average ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks that broadcast the hearings simultaneously have yet to obtain viewing data, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nelson's company often encounters some problems with the number of people watching the show in the statistics office.
Objectively, this number is comparable to the size of the audience for the after-season football match or the Oscar.
Nelson said Fox News received 5.69 million views throughout the day on the day of the hearing, pressuring other online media. Fox News News was a strong supporter of the appointment of Cavanaugh.
The ABC came to the back, and the number of viewers was 3.26 million.
Nelson, the CBS audience is 3.1 million, the NBC is 2.94 million, the MSNBC is 2.89 million and the CNN is 2.52 million.
After the hearings, the level of interest remained high.
Frank became the core of Friday's show.
Previously, the moderate Republican had issued a statement in his office that he would vote in favour of Cavanaugh. On Friday morning, he was taken by CNN and CBS cameras when he boarded the elevator and went to the judicial committee hearing, and protesters yelled at him.
CNN saw him standing silently for a few minutes while he was being condemned.
A woman said, "I'm right in front of you."
"Do you think what he said to the nation is true?"
"You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Before the elevator was shut down, Frack said his office had issued a statement that he would make more statements at the committee hearing.
Cable TV and radio networks are broadcasting live follow-up information, and the Judicial Council will vote for Cavanaugh's nomination and send it to the Senate for a full vote.
But Frack said he would vote only if the FBI investigated further allegations of sexual abuse by the candidate next week. The minority Democrats have been urging further investigation.
After a conversation with a friend, Senator Chris Coon of the Democratic Party, Frak is to some extent convinced of this.
After dialogue with Kuen and several senators, Frak took the decision.
Freck's choice was strong, because it was clear that Republicans would not vote to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
Trump has issued an order to the FBI to conduct a supplementary investigation into Judge Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May blames the critics of Teo's issue for playing "political games".
British Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused the critics of his de-European project of “playing political games” on Britain’s future to the detriment of national interests.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018 to attend a Conservative Party conference.
In another interview on the front page of the newspaper, former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson strongly criticized his so-called deOcchikes plan and said that the proposal that Britain and the European Union should impose customs duties on each other was “puzzlingly absurd”.
Wayde Sims Shot: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspect of shooting a Louisiana state footballer.
The police have arrested a 20-year-old basketball player, Wayde Sims, suspected of shooting at Louisiana State University.
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder.
The police released a video of Sims fighting with Simpson, saying that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The CBS subsidiary WAFB reported that the police found the glasses at the scene, saying they found Simpson's DNA on it.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that Simpson confessed to the shooting and killing of Wayde.
Advocate reported that it was worth $350,000.
East Baton Roger Parrish Coroner's Office (East Batonluj County Department of Coroner Examinations) released a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head.
The Police Department thanked Louisiana State Police Fugitive Fugitive Task Force for assisting in the investigation leading to the successful arrest of fugitives, the state police crime laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and regional citizens.
Joe Alleva, a sports coach at Louisiana State University, thanked the regional law enforcement authorities and commended them for their “working hard and doing well”.
Sims is 20 years old.
Sims was 6 feet tall and 6 inches (1.98 metres), was a front, grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne was also a member of the basketball team at Louisiana State University.
Last season, he got 5.6 points, 2.6 baskets.
Friday morning, Will Wade, head coach of the basketball team at Louisiana State University, said that the team was "satisfied" to Wayde's death, "unacceptable."
Wade says, "This is the last thing we want to see."
Volcanic eruption in Mexico City
The eruption of the Bobocatate volcano spreads its ashes all over the southern part of the Mexican capital.
The Mexican National Disaster Preparedness Centre recorded smokes 183 times within 24 hours of Saturday, and then warned the Mexican people to stay away from the volcano after the volcanic vents were active.
Disaster prevention centres monitor the rumblings and minor earthquakes that have been launched on several occasions.
Pictures on social media show that Hodge Mirko, near Mexico City, had a windshield covered with ashes.
Geophysicalists noted an increase in volcanic activity in 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as "Smoke Peak", has been in operation since 1994.
On the eve of the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum, the police clashed with separatists.
On Saturday, thousands of people joined the anti-demonstrations march to commemorate the first anniversary of the Catalan bipolar division referendum. Pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and six were arrested in Barcelona.
A group of masked supporters of separatists threw eggs and powder paint at riot police, causing dust to cover the streets of previous days, which were crowded with tourists, and then stopped by riot police.
There was also mixed fighting later that day, and the police contained the unrest with batons.
"Don't forget, never forgive" supporters of the independence, and the protesters who shouted "Long live Spain" for several hours.
According to local media reports, 14 people were treated for minor injuries during protests.
Last October's referendum was considered illegal in Madrid and, a year later, the situation remained tense in an independent region, while Catalan separatists were celebrating.
Despite the fact that the vast majority of voters chose independence, the turnout remained low, as the majority of those opposed to division refused to vote.
According to Catalan authorities, last year the police tried to prevent successive polls at polling stations in the region, causing violent clashes, which injured nearly 1,000 people.
On Friday night, support was given to independent groups camping, preventing demonstrations and supporting the actions of the national police.
Demonstrations continued, but other avenues had to be pursued.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in this separatist protest, said that he no longer had any hope of Catalan gaining independence.
"We had the best time in our lives last year.
My parents cried because they were able to vote, but now we're in trouble”, he said.
Despite the vitally dangerous success achieved in the December regional elections last year, Catalan pro-independence forces tried to maintain their momentum this year, with many of the most prominent leaders or self-deportation, or detained awaiting trial for appearing before them during the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, an older mechanic, recorded protests on his cell phone to support the police, saying that the conflict had been instigated by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders held in pre-trial prisons since late last year, announced that he would participate in next year's European parliamentary elections.
“As a candidate for the European Parliament elections, he publicly denounced the Government of Spain's retreat in terms of democratic perceptions and repression, which would be the most advantageous way to do so”, he said.
London, Delhi County: three men were arrested driving down houses.
Three of the men who committed the crime (aged 33, 34, 39) hit a house in Delhi County in London several times in a car and were arrested by the police after the incident.
The incident took place around 19:30 on Thursday, at the location of Balynagard Crescent.
Bob Blemmings, a senior police officer, described the impact as causing damage to the gate and the building itself.
In some cases, the car may have been interfered with with with the crossbow.
Munga's goal is to help the Livinston team beat the vagrants by 1-0.
Dolly Menga's first goal was to win the Livingston team.
Livingston's promotion shocked the Travellers, and Steven Gerard lost the race for the second time in the 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal became the key goal, and Gary Holt's team got the Irish team in second section.
Gerald's team still hasn't won the season, and they're going to lead their eight-point runners next week.
Until then, Rangers will be in the European league on Thursday, the Rupid Vienna team. Until then, the Rover team will be in front of the Rupid Vienna in the Europa tournament on Thursday.
At the same time, the Livingstone team will continue its undefeated record in the sixth race of the region, and since replacing Kenny Miller last month, the lead coach Holt has not tasted the failure.
The Livingstons miss the chance to fight with the strong enemy.
Holt's team showed signs of leading before the score, and their attacks caused a variety of problems for the vagrants.
Scott Robinson kicked the ball to the other side of the door, though he broke through the defense, and Alan Lithgow was dragged to the side after receiving Craig Halkett's head.
Hosts are very willing to compete with the vagrants because they know that they can cause trouble for the guest team when they locate the ball.
That's how the key shot came.
The Rangers lost an arbitrary ball, the Livingston team opened an empty spot, and the DeClan Gallagher and Robinson formed Munga, who took a point from the centre of the restricted area. The Travellers lost an arbitrary ball, the Levenston team broke through, Declan Gallagher joined forces with Robinson to block Munga. Munga scored in the middle of the restricted area.
At this point, while the Travellers have control of the game, they find it difficult to break through the main team, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly has nothing to worry about.
This pattern lasts until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos took a ball from Kelly's feet.
Scott Pittman was thrown out by the Travellers, Alan McGregor, and Lisgo kicked another Livinston.
Crosses continues to enter the restricted area of the Livingston team and is constantly released, while two points — after Halcott offered to bring Glenn Middleton to the field and a handball — were kicked back.
Livingston's "Excellent Performance" analysis.
BBC, a Scottish journalist, Alasdair Lamont, reported on Tony Makaroni Arena.
The Livingston team performed extraordinaryly, with impressive results.
The performance of all players was excellent, and once again exceeded expectations.
Since Holt returned to the top league, there has been little change in the style and staffing of the team, but Holt's honour for the team is indeed commendable.
He brought out a lot of heroic players.
Captain Halcott did a great job, he deployed a highly organized defensive posture, and Munga, throughout the process, Jean Connor Goldson and Joe Wallall never set aside their guard.
The Travellers, however, lacked morale.
They occasionally performed well under Gerard's leadership, but far from meeting the standards.
Their last shot didn't go in — they only cut into the main team once — it's a wake-up call for the vagrants in the middle.
Erdoğan has mixed feelings in Cologne.
Saturday (29 September), the last day of the Turkish President's State visit to Germany, was a 10,000 miles clear, and the leaders of both countries held a friendly breakfast in Berlin.
President Erdoğan's visit to Germany was controversial and aimed at restoring relations between the two NATO allies.
They are deadlocked on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Subsequently, Erdoğan went to a huge new mosque in Cologne.
Cologne, a city with a large Turkish population, is outside Turkey's country and Turkey has the largest population.
The police prevented 25,000 viewers from travelling to the mosque for security reasons, but there were many supporters nearby who welcomed the President.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdoğan, many of whom belong to Kurds, have also made a diametric statement condemning Erdoğan ' s policy and condemning the German government for not welcoming Erdoğan to Germany.
The protests on both sides reflected differences over Erdoğan ' s visit: some German Turks called him a hero, while others condemned him as a dictator.
Dettford Road Traffic Accident: Car owner died when he crashed into a car.
A list of car owners died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred around 10.15 a.m. at the British Summer Day, near the border between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy section of Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The car driver stopped and checked, and the paramedics carried out the rescue, but the owner of the bicycle car died instantly.
Just a few months before the accident, on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash on Saturday, another list owner was tragically killed in a hit-and-run crash.
The London Metropolitan Police said that the police were in the process of identifying the man and would inform his immediate family about it.
The road has now been closed, the bus has been rerouted and the driver has been advised to bypass the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison guards were injured as a result of the riots
According to the prison office, six prison guards were injured in a riot in a high-security male prison.
On Sunday morning at 9:30 in the United Kingdom, riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcester County, and the riots are still ongoing.
The relevant departments sent a special cyclone strike team to the scene. The riot involved eight prisoners and now controls all those involved in a building.
Prison guards suffered minor facial injuries and received on-site medical treatment.
The spokesperson for the Prison Administration introduced: “The staff specializing in prison riots have been deployed to deal with the ongoing riots in HMP Long Lartin.
Six injured prison guards have been treated.
We will not tolerate any violence in prison, and we will hand over the perpetrators to the police, who may face longer imprisonment.”
HMP Long Lartin Prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in Britain.
In June, the prison director was reportedly attacked by prisoners before being taken to hospital for treatment.
Last October, riot police were used to go to this prison to deal with major disturbances and were attacked with a billiard strike.
Hurricane Rosa poses a flood threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City. (Arid Zone may benefit from this.)
Tropical low-pressure attacks on Arizona are rare, but this is likely to happen earlier next week, as the residual forces of Hurricane Rosa will attack the desert areas in the south-west, thereby causing flooding risks.
The National Meteorological Service has issued flood warnings on Mondays and Tuesdays to areas ranging from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah (including Phoenix, Fragstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City).
Rosa is expected to arrive with rain later on Monday and transit through Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix wrote on Twitter that "since 1950, only 10 tropical cyclones have remained tropical storms or low air pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that landed within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
According to the latest National Hurricane Centre model, rainfall will reach 2-4 inches, and local rainfall on the edge of Mogolon, Arizona, will reach 6 inches.
Other desert areas in the southwest, including the middle of the Rockies and large basins, are likely to have rainfall levels of 1 to 2 inches, and total local rainfall is likely to reach 4 inches.
For areas that do not pose a risk of flooding, the rainfall brought by Rosa may be fortunate due to the severity of the drought in those areas.
While the floods triggered a high priority, appropriate rainfall may also be beneficial, as the south-west region is currently experiencing drought.
According to weather.com, U.S. Drought Monitor shows that more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought conditions (the second most severe category).
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will cause it to land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa remained in hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind strength of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Cape Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at 12 miles per hour.
The hurricane touched the cool seawater at sea level, thus weakening the wind.
It is therefore expected to land from Mexico on Monday afternoon or at night at the strength of tropical storms.
In parts of Mexico, rainfall is likely to be large and there is a risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "the total rainfall from the Baja California Peninsula to the northwest of Sonora is expected to reach 3 to 6 inches, possibly even 10 inches".
Then Rosa will travel northward through Mexico in the form of tropical storms, arrive at the Arizona border in the morning of Tuesday in the form of tropical low air pressure, and pass through the entire Arizona state late on Tuesday night into southern Utah.
The National Hurricane Center said that “the main hazard expected from Rosa or her residual forces will be heavy rainfall for the Lower California Peninsula, the North West of Sonora and the South West Desert of the United States”.
The rains are expected to cause life-threatening floods and mudslides in desert areas and landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: arrest of four suspects of attempted murder
A 16-year-old boy found multiple stab wounds on Summerset, and the suspect was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. The suspect was three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man.
The murdered teenage boy was found injured around 4 a.m. Saturday morning in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was then taken to hospital, where he is “stable”.
Avon and Somerset Police said suspects (of whom 17-year-old men, two 18-year-old men and one 20-year-old man) had been arrested overnight in Radstock District.
The police called on witnesses who caught the live video on their cell phone to provide clues.
Trump called Cavanaugh "the bearer of the dastardly anger" of the Democratic Party.
Trump said at a rally in Welling, West Virginia: "A vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's ruthless and shameless tactics."
According to Trump, Cavanaugh “has suffered the dastardly and angryness of the Democratic Party” throughout the nomination process.
Cavanaugh, when questioned by Congress on Thursday, was moved to strongly deny the charges brought against him by Christine Blasey Ford, saying that he had never sexually abused Ford a few decades ago.
Ford was also present at the hearing on his allegations.
On Saturday, the President said, "The American people saw Cavanaugh's decency and courage."
The President said to supporters of West Virginia that “voting for Judge Cavanaugh is voting for the most successful legal thinker of our time, a jurist with a reputation for public service”.
When the President spoke of the importance of the Republican vote in the mid-term elections, he indirectly insinuated Cavanaugh's nomination.
We're five weeks away from the most important election in our lives.
"I'm not running, I'm running around like this,
So that you could choose a good candidate, he said.
According to Trump, the Democratic Party's mission is “resistance and obstruction”.
A senior Republican leadership assistant briefed CNN that it was expected that the first critical procedural vote on the Cavanaugh nomination would be held in the Senate by Friday at the latest.
The Indonesian earthquake and tsunami caused hundreds of deaths, which are still rising.
The Indonesian authorities said on Saturday that a major earthquake and tsunami struck Sulawesi Island in Indonesia, killing at least 384 people, and that a number of people were swept away as a wave washed over the beach.
On Friday evening, hundreds of people were gathering at a party on the beach in Baru City, when a wave of up to 6 metres (18 feet) washed up the coast, killing many people, and the tsunami was completely different.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
The spokesperson for the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency BNPB, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at a briefing in Jakarta: "When the tsunami struck yesterday, people were on the beach and failed to flee in time, and they were unfortunately killed."
"The tsunami came with cars, firewood, houses and everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at 800 km per hour (497 miles per hour) before attacking the coastline.
Some climb to the trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 evacuation centres in Baru.
The aerial photographs released by disaster relief agencies showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were distorted and collapsed, and a mosque was surrounded by seawater.
On Saturday, the aftershock continued to perturb the coastal city.
The region, which has 2.4 million people, has a strong sense of shock.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in a statement that the power released by the Great Earthquake on Friday was about 200 times that of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement also noted that the city was at the end of a narrow bay and that geographical location was therefore likely to magnify the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "large-scale" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were crushed beneath the ruins of the collapsed building, and he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho indicated that casualties and destruction along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Baru could be more severe, and that the area was Dungara, closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Dungara's communication was “completely paralysed without any news”, as Nugroho said.
ICRC stated that more than 300,000 people lived in that area and added that ICRC staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“Although this is already a tragedy, the situation may be worse”, the Red Cross said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing the general public of the tsunami that hit Baru, although officials claimed that the tsunami occurred after the warning was issued.
In a video taken by amateurs who shared it on social media, one could hear a man on top of the building screaming madly at a crowd of people down the street to warn them of the impending tsunami.
A few minutes later, the water wall washed up the coast and rolled up the building and the vehicle.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage and cut off communications around Baru, making it impossible for government authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
According to Indonesian authorities, the military has begun sending rescue transport aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport in Baru city is currently open only for relief work and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centre in Baru on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia rose to over 800.
It's really very bad.
Although Dungara World Vision staff have safely arrived in Baru City, and Baru City employees have temporarily been placed in a temporary tarpaulin shelter built in the company ' s yard, what they saw on their way is tragic, as Doseba said.
"They said they saw a number of houses damaged," he said.
It's really very bad.
While relief organizations started this brutal campaign and launched relief equipment, some complained that foreign relief workers with deep expertise were prohibited from travelling to Baru.
According to Indonesian law, the movement of funds, goods and staff abroad will be permitted only if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
But it has not yet been announced.
"It's still a provincial disaster," says Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, `This is a national disaster', we will be able to release international relief, but the current situation does not permit.”
On Friday, the night following the earthquake and tsunami, in Baru, relatives and friends of missing persons still hold a glimmer of hope that their loved ones will be able to create miracles and add a colour to this tragic natural disaster.
On Saturday, the rescue crew picked up a little boy from the sewers.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been crushed under rubble for two days while her mother's body was next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national parachute, trained two missing parachute players to prepare for the Asian Games to be held in Indonesia earlier this month.
Other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, are his students.
"As a senior sportsman in the field of parachute, I have a personal emotional burden," he said.
Gendon stated that in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the glitter community, he tried to send word about whatsApp to the Baru competitor at the beach party.
However, his message always shows only a gray pair, not a blue pair.
"I think that means the message didn't work," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while adding money to ATM on Newport on the Levee
According to news reports released by the Newport Police Department, a staff member of Brink stole $26,750 from a stolen banknote in ATM on Newport on the Levee on Friday morning.
Dennis McCarthy of the police department reported that the driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment restaurant and was about to add money to it.
Just as he was busy, a man "run out behind this Brink employee" stole a bag of banknotes that should have been added to ATM.
Witnesses reportedly found multiple suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the case.
Anyone who can provide information about the identity of the thief should call 859-292-3680 to contact the Newport Police.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to "Ye."
Kanye West changed his name to "Ye".
He announced a name change on Twitter on Saturday. The details are: "Kanye West, known to all before."
Forty-one-year-old West has been called "Ye" for some time now, and he used the name as the title of the eighth album released in June 2018.
This name change was announced prior to his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
The producer said he took over from Ariane Grande, the singer who cancelled the program because of "emotional reasons".
Apart from being an acronym for West's current professional name, he has previously said that this word has religious significance for him.
West said in discussing the title of his album with the radio anchor Big Boy earlier this year: "I believe that 'Ye' is the most popular word in the Bible, meaning 'you' in the Bible."
"So, I'm you, and we're you.
The name I used earlier was "Kanye", which means "One" and now "Ye", which reflects our good, evil, lost, everything.
This album is more reflective of who we are."
A lot of famous rappers have changed their names.
Sean Combs has used many names, most commonly Puff Daddy (P. Diddy) and Diddy (Daddy), but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, who worked with West before, has also changed his name by hyphenation or non-hyphenation and capital letters.
Mexico AMLO solemnly declares that it will not use force against civilians.
The President-elect of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Ofradore, solemnly declared that there would be no use of force against civilians on the 50th anniversary of the upcoming student persecution in Mexico.
On Saturday, Lopez Ofradore made a promise at Tratelolco Plaza that he would never use force to suppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, as the leftist student movement took root throughout Latin America, Mexican forces opened fire during peaceful demonstrations in the square, killing as many as 300 people.
López Ofrador promised to support the development of the young generation of Mexico by subsidizing the students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities could lead young people to a criminal path.
A.I. US should double funding
As Chinese research in the area of artificial intelligence becomes more active, the US should double its research spending in this area. Investors and AI practitioners Kai-Fu Lee introduced. Lee used to work for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was directed at the AI announcement made by various departments of the United States Government, which generally lacked a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
China launched a plan last year to become the leader of artificial intelligence innovation in 2030.
"In this area, all other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking for new breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, so doubling the AI research budget will be a good start," Lee introduced.
Lee, in an interview with CNBC this week, explained that double funding might double America's chances of becoming an artificial intelligence breaker again.
Lee's book, The Artificial Intelligent Super Power: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published last month by Hakot publishing house. Lee is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in the first-known AI company in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he created an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, defeating Othello, the highest-ranking American contestant, and then became president of the executive of the Microsoft Academy and Google China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government science and technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge, Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and then asked what competition would be launched to achieve the next group of dreamers.
American researchers often pay a lot to get government subsidies, Lee says.
"It's not China that's robbing our academic leaders, it's the business," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired eminent people from universities to work in AI.
Lee's presentation said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its work on artificial intelligence.
"I think it's time to offer Dr. AI a green card," he said.
China ' s State Council released the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee introduced that in the United States, American researchers could receive funds from the National Science Foundation and other government organizations. Similarly, in China, the National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding for researchers in academic institutions, but the academic work in China is of relatively poor quality.
At the beginning of this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to attract partners from industry and academia. In addition, the White House announced the establishment of the Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced that it would invest $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
Currently, the National Science Foundation of the United States invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In contrast, the United States legislature, which for months called for the establishment of the National Security Commission on Artificial Security, has not taken action.
Macedonia holds a referendum on whether to change the name of the country.
The Macedonian People's Week held a referendum to vote on whether to change the name of the country to “North Macedonia”, which will resolve the decades-long dispute between Macedonia and Greece, which prevented its accession to the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece has a province called Macedonia, and keeping the name of its northern neighbour means that Greece has legal rights over its territory and has rejected its membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU).
The two Governments agreed in June on the name of the proposed new State, but nationalist opponents believe that changing the name would jeopardize the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slav population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not participate in the referendum and that the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the result of the vote would meet the 50% minimum voting rate for the referendum to take effect.
The question about the referendum was as follows: "Are you accepting the agreement with Greece for membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU)?"
The renamed supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that Macedonia is one of the countries deriving from the dissolution of Yugoslavia and that institutions such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are worth a certain price.
"I come to vote today for the future of the country, for Macedonia's younger generation, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because this means that all of us can live a safer life," Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, said.
Although not bound by the law, there were enough members of Parliament to indicate that they would comply decisively with the results of the vote.
However, a change of name requires a two-thirds majority vote in Parliament.
The State Election Commission indicated that no wrongdoing reports had been received by 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 per cent, while the voter turnout in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 was 34 per cent, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my child, we live in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, age 62, in Skopje.
On September 30th, 2018, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, and his wife, Zorica, and his son, Dushko, cast their respective votes in a referendum to change Macedonia's name, which will pave the way for Macedonia to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the EU.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small stage and moving the chair to a tent built by the people who boycotted the referendum.
"It's for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU), but we'd like to come up with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavardarkov said.
“Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don't treat us as Macedonians, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, to become members of Asia-Europe integration.”
Zaev in general said that membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would bring the required investment to Macedonia, where unemployment is up to 20% or more.
"I believe most people will support the referendum because more than 80% of our people support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the EU," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the vote for "support" would "determine our future".
According to the opinion poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute, 30% to 43% of voters will vote in the referendum - a figure that is lower than required.
Another poll by Telma TV in Macedonia found that 57% of respondents said they planned to vote on Sunday.
Of course, 70% of the people said they'd vote for it.
If the referendum is to succeed, the turnout will have to reach 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum means that pro-Western government policies will be hit hard for the first time since coming to power last May.
Watch: The Man City team Sergio Aguero has won the goal of breaking through the tight defense of the Brighton team.
Saturday, at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling of the Man City team broke through the defence of the Brighton team and eventually won by 2-0.
Aquilotti's 65 minute goal looks so easy.
At the start of the game, the Argentine fronter received the pass in the middle of the game.
He quickly ran past three of Brighton's defense men and ran towards the open land.
Then Aquilo found himself surrounded by four other players.
He pushed out one of the defenders and overtaken several of them at the edge of the Brighton exclusion zone.
Then push the ball to the left and pass it to Sterling.
The British fronter used his first touch ball in the restricted zone to return the ball to Aquilo, where Aquiro shot the ball to the right side of the ball with his right foot, and knocked down the Brighton Gate General Matthew Ryan.
"Aquilo's feet are wounded," Pep Guardiola, head coach of the Man City team, told reporters.
"We talked about getting him on the field for 55 or 60 minutes.
He did it.
Fortunately, at that moment he scored."
But it was Sterling who laid down the initial advantages for Sky Blues in the British Super Bowl.
That goal happened in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aquilo received the ball in the rear of the Brighton team.
He passed the ball along the left wing with a beautiful direct pass to Leroy Sane.
After several touchballs, Sane led Sterling to a distant pillar.
This Sky Blues fronter easily puts the ball into the net before he slips out of the country.
Tuesday afternoon, at 12.55 p.m., the Man City team will be at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, to meet the Hovenheim team in the European League of Champions (Champions League) team.
Schherzer wants to fight against the Fall Team.
There is no more reason to force the National Team to start it again, as it is being phased out in after-season competitions.
Sheser, who is eager to win, wants to be the first in the match on Sunday against Colorado's Falling Team, but only if the Falling Team remains immersed in the effects of the end of the season, and the Falling Team is ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western District of the National Union (NL).
Friday night, the Falling Team beat the National Team by 5-2 and locked at least one extra card slot, but they still want to take the first district champion.
“Not for anything else, at least we can play in Denver, and the rest of the team will be at the highest level I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The National Team has yet to announce the launch of Sunday, but it is reported that under these circumstances it is likely that they will let Hazel throw the ball.
This will be the thirty-fourth launch of Hazel, and he's already started pitching in the cow shed on Thursday, and he'll pitch on Sunday on his normal rest.
Washington's right-hand player, in 222 and 2/3 of the season, won 18 outs and 7 outs, with a defense rate of 2.53 out of 300 triples.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia.
Referring to the importance of the Republican vote in the mid-term elections, the President indirectly insinuated the situation faced by Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court voter of his choice.
"All we've done is about the course of November.
Five weeks away from the most important election in our lives.
It's a big deal. I'm not running. I'm running around just so you can choose a good candidate," he said.
Trump goes on to say, "You see how terrible Democrats are, and you see them now.
They are determined to use whatever means are necessary to regain power, and you can see their dirtyness.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they put under their feet in order to take control of power, take control of power, and who they put under their feet. They only see power and control, and we don't give them that.”
The Democratic Party has the mission of “resistance and obstruction”.
"You've seen this in the last four days," he said. He called the Democratic Party "Anger, Shame, Shame, Hypotheism."
He mentioned the name of Senator Diane Feinstein of the Democratic Party of the Senate Judicial Committee (Senate Judicial Committee), which caused the scene of the scene to be brazen.
"Remember what she said?
Did you leak the file?
Uh, uh, what.
It's not, uh, it's not what someone else gave me. It's the meanest body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad sect.
You can't be honest around here.
I wasn't surprised when local Momentum party activists voted to condemn me.
After all, among the Labour Congressmen, the reason why I finally learned that I was not popular is because we expressed our thoughts.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was similarly treated because of his strong opposition to anti-Semitism.
And the criticism of my motion is because I object to Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, similar problems have arisen with regard to responsible economic policies, national security and European issues, in which Jeremy and former leaders disagree.
The announcement of the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party meeting on Friday stated, "We want the conference to be inclusive and to have a productive outcome."
In the eight years I've been a local Labour Congressman, most of the time, the GC meeting on Friday night was like this.
Unfortunately, now that this is no longer the tone of many conferences, people have long forgotten the political promise of "kinder, gentler" (Kinder, Gentler) and seem not even to have begun to live up to it.
The Labour Party cannot tolerate opposing views, and all views are judged on the basis of whether or not the Labour Party leader accepts them. This momentum is becoming increasingly evident.
This phenomenon began shortly after Jeremy became head of the Labour Party, and I thought earlier that I had the same political views as my colleagues, but they started to want me to change my views and to stand on a position that I would never agree with, whether on issues of national security or the single market of the European Union.
Every time I speak openly, what I say is not important, and it comes with a series of accusations in social media calling for the elections to be cancelled, condemning Chinese politics, or telling me that I am not worthy of joining the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's been through this kind of thing.
In fact, I know I'm lucky compared to some colleagues, because comments directed at me are often political statements.
Many of my colleagues have to face the usual charges of flooding every day, either by using sexist and insulting language or by using language that is racist. I admire their professionalism and determination.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that insulting language becomes the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should create a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a big church with multiple voices, and that one after the "no trust" motion, one after the other, changes in the selection rules, making the Labour Party even narrower.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice to keep my head low, not so blunt, that I can be “single”.
But that's not what I was in politics for.
32 years ago, when I was a student in school, I joined the Labour Party. At that time, as a result of the negligence of the Socher government, our integrated school classroom was largely paralysed. Since then, as a member of Parliament and as a government minister, I have made every effort to seek better public services for those most in need.
I never hid my politics, including in the last general election.
No one in Nottingham East would be surprised by my policy stance and the areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who introduced the bill on Friday, I would like to say that I don't understand that while our country is trying to make a difference, to the detriment of our families, businesses and public services, you are wasting your time and your energy on whether or not I am loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I would like to say to my electorate, whether a Labour Party member or not, not Nottingham Momentum, that I am honoured to serve you, and I promise that no threat or political gain to stop my election will prevent me from acting in a way that I think best serves the interests of all of you.

Al United 38-17 Likmelros: The Al United won again.
The last two attempts may have influenced the final outcome to some extent, but there is no doubt that Al Qaeda is well deserved to win this interesting and exciting competition.
They are now at the top of the list and the only undefeated team of the ten teams.
At the end of the day, their excellent defense and extraordinary opportunity to take advantage of it was very satisfying for the master team and coach Peter Murchie.
"We've been through a lot of trials in the game, but we've been able to keep up the undefeated track so far, and I have to be happy about it," Merky said.
Robin Christie of the Melrose team said, "The honor belongs to Al United, and they're better at seizing the opportunity than we are."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute led Al United temporarily, and was replaced by Frazier Climo, but with yellow cards encountered by Scottish players in the fight against warriors, Melrose won the numbers, while Jason Baggot seized the opportunity not to be replaced.
Before the midtime break, Kremo expanded Al United's leading position with a single point. After the goal, when he gets the midtime break, he gets the extra score alone and turns the score into 17-5.
But Melrose started well in the second half of the game, and Baggart switched Patrick Anderson's entry point down to five points.
Subsequently, Ruaridh Knott was taken out of the field by a stretcher due to serious injuries, and was delayed for a long time. When the race resumed, one shot by the Al United via Stafford McDowl would again be bigger than Quadra.
Then the acting captain of Al United, Blair McPherson, was warned by the yellow card, and the Melross team once again dominated the numbers, breaking the tremendous pressure spell with the unreplaced Bruce Colvine shot.
But when the main team regained its strength, when Struan Hutchinson was warned by the yellow card for hitting Kremer without a ball outside the border, McPherson scored the touchdown behind Al's United Attackers.
As was the case at the start of the game, Clemo was replaced again, and after Kyle Rowe received David Armstrong's kickoff, the fifth attempt of the main team sent the sideguard Gregor Henry.
Still Game starring ready to go to the military restaurant.
Still Game, starring Ford Kieran, seems to be preparing to enter the hotel business and was previously found to be a director of a registered catering company.
The 56-year-old actor played Jack Jarvis in the BBC TV show for the population, written by him and co-sponsored by Greg Hemhill, a long-standing comedy partner.
They announced that the ninth quarter of the upcoming broadcast would be the last season of the play, and that Kieran seemed to be planning a life like Craig Lang.
According to official records, Kieran is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although one of the sources of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kieran wanted to join Craig Lang's "redfire restaurant".
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, a land-bound country, wants the Court to decide to reopen the path of the Pacific Ocean.
The sailors patrold the well-equipped naval headquarters in La Paz.
On public buildings, a sea-blue flag floats.
From Lake Kaka to the naval base in Amazon, the title is full: "The sea is, legally speaking, ours.
It is our duty to take back the sea.”
In Bolivia, surrounded by land, the memory of the coastline falling into the hands of Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still visible. Bolivia yearns for another journey to the Pacific Ocean.
This decades-long hope has reached its highest point, because after five years of deliberation, Bolivia finally waited for the ruling of the International Court of Justice on 1 October.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, introduced "Bolivia has momentum, people have the upper heart, harmony and solidarity, nature can wait for a positive outcome".
It is hoped that after decades of intermittent negotiations, the Hague Tribunal will be able to support Bolivia's claim. Chile has an obligation to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia.
Bolivia’s charismatic president Evo Morales, who is a native native, will also pay attention to Monday’s ruling. The president’s re-election to the election next year is controversial.
At the end of August, he solemnly announced that “we are about to return to the Pacific Ocean”.
According to some analysts, however, it is unlikely that the courts will make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if so, nothing will change.
This United Nations body, with its headquarters in the Netherlands, does not have the authority to grant Chilean territory, and there are provisions that will not determine the outcome of the possible negotiations.
Paz Zárate, an international law expert from Chile, said that the International Court of Justice had ruled just six months after the final debate, which showed that the case was not “complicated”.
Moreover, Bolivia's goal has not been advanced at all in the past four years, and it may have been reversed on the contrary.
"The current Bolivian government has blocked access to the Pacific Ocean", Zárate introduces.
She said that the provocative statements of Morales had consumed the goodwill left of Chileans.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue sooner or later, but it will be difficult to continue the dialogue after that.
There has been no exchange of ambassadors between the two countries since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, rejected the statement that the decision of the Court was unusually swift.
Monday's results will provide Bolivia with "an excellent opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and "the mutual benefit of ending differences over 139 years", he introduced.
Calzadira also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, wanted to use maritime issues as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to use the Pacific Ocean”, he added.
"The ruling will create an opportunity for us to overcome past history."
North Korea said it wouldn't disarm if it couldn't trust the US.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea, Lee Yong Ho, said that North Korea would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust the United States.
Lee Yong Ho made a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the commitments made between the leaders of the two countries during the Singapore summit.
Lee Yong-ho's speech was motivated by the fact that, more than three months ago, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore to restart nuclear diplomacy, which is in a stalemate.
Li Yong Ho said that by continuing sanctions and even opposing the declaration of the final war, he could force North Korea to kneel, which is simply a "dream of the day".
If Pyongyang is not in the first place to take major disarmament action, Washington will be cautious about agreeing to make a declaration.
Kim Jong-il and US President Donald Trump wanted to hold the summit again.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether North Korea will really give up its nuclear arsenal. After all, it is highly likely that North Korea will see it as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompey plans to visit North Korea next month to discuss another summit of the leaders of Korea and America.
Paris Fashion Show brings a lot of the latest series of headgear.
If you're hesitating to buy another hat or to cover the sun, then you don't have to hesitate anymore.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne, at the Paris Fashion Week show, introduced the weird super-head SS19 series, which was amazing.
This summer, the most impractical hats were rolled over Instagram, so the designers took their fancy hats to T-table.
Valentino's most striking single item is a rice-coloured top hat, decorated with a feather-shaped broad edge that completely covers the heads of the models.
Other super-sized accessories include watermelon caps, wizard hats and even pineapple hats with jewels, although these designs were not designed to keep warm.
On the eve of Halloween, Thom Browne launched a series of strangely shaped masks.
Many coloured masks, with their own lips, are more like Hannibal Lecter than advanced fashion.
Some of them look like water lung diving equipment, with breathing tubes and eyeglasses, and others like melted ice cream omelet.
You'll find something even more amazing during your journey to find fashion spokespersons.
Fashion observers predict that the giant hat may soon be on Fashion Street next to you.
Rihanna, Emily Ratajkowski 'La Bomba' on top of his head is an eye-blowing, hyperbole, with a hat wide enough to be 2 feet wide, and then, as you can imagine, will become a popular decoration with hot hands.
The cult label behind the very unrealistic hat that spilled on social media sent another important creation on T-stage -- a beach bag of straw almost as big as a model in a bathing suit. This little-purpose hat was widely promoted on social media, and the fashion label behind it put another big idea on T-table -- a beach bag of straw almost as big as a model in a bathing suit.
The orange lafi grass bag, with wine and coconut on it with white leather handles, is the pointer pen in the series of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 during the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage introduced to FEMAIL, saying, "It is estimated that next summer there will be big hats and sandbags on Fashion Street, because designers have made a huge impact, and the need for super-size accessories cannot be ignored."
John Edward: Language skills are vital to global citizens.
Scottish private schools have maintained excellent academic performance records, as was the case in 2018, and have also achieved a series of promising test results, with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community work, among others, adding value.
These private schools, which bring together more than 30,000 students from across Scotland, work under the leadership of the Scottish Private Schools Board (SCIS) to provide students and parents with the highest quality of services.
The purpose of private schools is to lay a good foundation for students ' continuing education and higher education, career choices and their social status as global citizens.
As an educational institution capable of designing and implementing customized school curricula, we are fortunate to be able to witness that modern languages have always been a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to each other in a language you can understand, you'll get into each other's head."
If you talk to each other in their mother tongue, you'll get into each other's heart."
That reminds us that when we want to build relations and trust with foreign friends, we cannot rely solely on English.
According to the results of the latest examination this year, the language pass rate in private schools is at the top of the list.
Sixty-eight per cent of students who studied foreign languages achieved level A.
Data from 74 member schools of the Scottish Private Schools Board (SCIS) show that 72% of students have an A grade in Chinese, while 72% of them have an A grade in German, 69% in French and 63% in Spanish.
This indicates that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Language and STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) are now treated equally as a subject in private school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) showed that 17 per cent of employees ' efforts to fill vacancies were due to a shortage of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly indispensable in order to lay a good foundation for the future careers of young people.
As more jobs will become available in the future, language is needed, this skill becomes crucial in today ' s globalized world.
Whatever profession you choose, if you learn the second language and master this beneficial life skills, the future will surely have a real advantage.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign friends will definitely make people who know many languages superior in competition.
A 2013 survey of more than 4,000 adult British citizens in YouGov showed that 75% were able to use foreign languages well for dialogue, and that French is the only language with a two-digit (15%) percentage.
Therefore, it is necessary to invest more in the language education of children today.
Knowledge of languages, especially in developing countries, will provide better opportunities for children to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, the languages taught vary from school to school.
Many schools focus on teaching more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that they believe will be important to Britain in 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
No matter what language your child is interested in, private schools offer multiple language options and are staffed with professional teaching staff in this field.
Private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a good learning environment, regardless of the future of their children, which can provide the children with a solid foundation and the skills they need to succeed.
It is undeniable that in today ' s globalized business environment, language remains vital to the future of the country and must therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be seen as “international communication skills”.
Private schools in Scotland will continue to offer such choices, diversity and excellence to young people.
It has to be done.

LeBron will be hosting the first show of the Lakers in Santiago on Sunday.
The fans are waiting for LeBron James' premiere on the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the leader coach of the Lakers, announced that James would take part in the first pre-season competition in Santiago on Sunday against the Danver Golddigging team.
But it's still uncertain when James will be on the field.
Warden said on the Lakers' "official website" that "the length of time will be between 1 and 48 minutes".
The Laker reporter Mike Trudel wrote on Twitter that James might have a limited time to get to the game.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked about planning the schedule of the six pre-season games of the Lakers.
"In this stage of my career, I no longer need to warm up before the season," he said.
Western Virginia rally time, YouTube channel, Trump.
Donald Trump will start a series of campaign rallies tonight in Welling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five rallies that Trump plans to hold next week, including staying in areas that are friendly to it, such as Tennessee and Westwig.
As the election to fill the vacant position in the Supreme Court led to the suspension of the vote, Trump's move was intended to gain support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republican Party faced the risk of losing control of Congress during the November polls.
What's the time of the Trump West Virginia rally tonight and how do you view it online?
Trump's gathering in Welling, West Virginia, is scheduled to take place tonight at 7 p.m. on September 29, 2018, East Time.
You can watch the West Virginia rally in Trump online via YouTube live channels.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearing on the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh. During the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation, the suspension of the expected Senate vote for up to a week led to tensions over allegations of sexual misconduct.
However, the main purpose of these rallies is to help the Republican Party, which is about to face the November elections, get some support.
According to Reuters, the campaign group of President Trump said that the five rallies next week were intended to “encouraging volunteers and supporters because the Republican Party tried to protect and expand their seats in the Senate and House of Representatives”.
A spokesman of the Trump campaign who refused to reveal his name told Reuters that "The control of Congress is vital to its agenda, so as the busy campaign season comes, the president will travel to as many states as possible".
According to West Virginia City, "the planned rally tonight at Wesbanco Arena will bring together a large number of supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will attract a large number of Pittsburgh media to report."
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month, with Trump winning by more than 40% in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, who was lagging behind in the polls.
According to Reuters, Simon Haeder, a political scholar at the University of West Virginia, said that "the President had to help him in a poll, which does not augur well for Morisi".
The 2018 Ryder Cup: The American team showed a tenacious spirit of competition in Sunday's single game.
After the first three single games, the four-person one-ball game on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what the Ryder Cup needs.
Momentum is an entirely new concept invented by the sports world, and sports players have no doubt about it, especially in such competitions.
Now, where's the momentum?
"They were six points ahead and now four points ahead, so I think we have some movement right now," said Jordan Spieth.
Of course, the European team has a certain advantage, currently leading by 4 points, and 12 points in the next game.
As Speith said, the US team feels a little off, but there are many aspects that deserve encouragement, especially the performance of Speith and Justin Thomas, who fought all day and scored three points out of four.
Speith has been extremely destructive from the table to the ridge and has set the standard of poles.
As the race unfolded, the shouts went up and down, and when he and Thomas were 2 to 2 behind, he drew the fourth round of the race to a tie with a key thruster.
His stick won the American team, and there was another shout of cheers and applause in the field, which showed us that they believed that the American team was not out.
Speith said, "You really need to get deep inside yourself, heart racing."
That's where all the players are right now.
18 holes to hit the goal.
In the last two days, more than Spice and Thomas scored, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, which is an indisputable match for the Leed Cup.
The European team's strange but lovely combination. The four victories didn't lose the ball, and they didn't make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only group of partners who didn't play the bane on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bane on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning in the last nine rounds.
This energy flows to and from these noisy crowds, and the way it flows out of them, reinforces the fact that they are the target to be defeated on Sunday, and that no more popular players will be able to hold on to Europe's victory.
Better be in different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about winning the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took care of Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning with Alex Noren.
A Tarbo and two of the top nine "doubles" beat the Spanish candidate and the Swedish player into a hole that could never climb.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of the hole.
The four-person four-ball game and the four-person one-ball game are particularly attractive and fit for close viewing, because collaboration between partners, mutual advice, mutual warning and strategy can change overnight.
So far, the European team has performed better and gained a clear lead on the last day, but this four-person one-ball game also shows that people, especially in the United States, are suspicious of the truth, and the American team is eager to fight.
The European team took the 10-6 lead in the finals of the Ryder Cup.
After the four-person four-ball game and the four-person two-ball game on Saturday beat the American team with 10-6, the European team will enter the finals of the Leed Cup with absolute advantage.
Two intuitive groups Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari raised their heads in the competition against Tiger Woods and won two victories, increasing the score so far to four points in the French national golf course.
Thomas Bjorn's European team tried to salvage the trophies lost two years ago in Hazeltine, defeating the failed American team in the four-ball game of the morning.
The U.S. team resisted in the four-person two-ball game and won two games, but was never able to make up for the backward.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in the 12 singles game on Sunday to defend the Coron.
Friedwood was the first European new show to score four points in a row, and he and Molinelli, after this sensational weekend, were called the "Moreywood" group, the second pair in the history of the Leed Cup who won four points in the opening four games.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game with four men, they worked in a very quiet manner and eventually defeated the frustrated Woods and the American new Bryson Dechambeau with a 5-4 victory.
Woods, who barely finished two games on Saturday, has occasionally had a bright break, but he has now lost 19 of the four-person four-ball game and four-person two-ball game, of which seven are negative.
Justin Rose, who was not in the four-person four-ball game this morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the four-person two-ball game, where they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in the first and third world, respectively.
The European team did not do whatever it wanted, despite the ease and pleasure of having a day in southwest Paris.
Three big winners, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, set a good foundation by dividing the US team by two on Saturday.
They took Spanish Joan Rahm and Ian Poulter down at 2-1 in a four-person four-ball game, and then came back and beat Pault and Rory McIlroy at 4-3 in a four-person two-ball game, even though they lost two holes in the opening.
Only two four-point-down teams in the history of the Ryder Cup were able to enter a single-play game, although the Florrick team, as host, only needs to draw lots to defend the Coron Cup.
However, since it ranked second in the first two days of the competition, it seems that it will be reversed in the counterattack on Sunday.
The North Korean side said that there was not enough confidence to “no way” to disarm unilaterally
The Foreign Minister of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions had deepened North Korea ' s distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances, North Korea could never unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, said that North Korea had taken “many friendly initiatives” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and pledging not to boost nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we didn't see any response from the American side," Lee said.
"As long as there is still a lack of trust in the United States, our side is uncertain about national security, and in any case we will not become a `headbird' of unilateral disarmament."
While Lee reiterated North Korea's consistent complaint about the "phased" denuclearization boycott in Washington (in which case North Korea will be rewarded for taking step-by-step measures), the focus of his statement seems to be that North Korea has not refused to abandon unilateral denuclearization as it did in Pyongyang in the past.
Lee referred to the joint statement made by the current President of the United States, Donald Trump, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, during their first meeting in Singapore on June 12, during which Kim Jong-un pledged to work towards “denuclearizing the Korean peninsula”, while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has indicated that Pyongyang must abandon its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also boycotted calls to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
Lee said, "The United States insists on `denuclearizing first' and presses through sanctions to achieve its objectives by coercive means, even against `declare the end of war'".
“The belief that sanctions can make us yield is nothing more than a daydream for people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions are deepening our mistrust of the United States.”
Lee made no mention of plans to hold the second summit between Kim Jong-un and Trump, as highlighted by American leaders at the United Nations earlier this week.
The Foreign Minister insisted that Kim Jong-un had met with Korean leader Moon Jae-in three times over the past five months, adding: “If the one side of the denuclearization issue is South Korea, not the United States, then the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not be so deadlocked”.
Even so, after the evil president Trump called Kim Jong-un a suicide rocketer, Lee informed the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea's artillery fire would inevitably target the mainland of the United States, but Lee spoke differently from last year.
The courage of Kim Jong-un to take disarmament measures was greatly appreciated at the United Nations this year when Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, said that much remained to be done and that sanctions must continue until North Korea became denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for it, saying, "even if it takes two, three or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday: "It is imperative that the Council's sanctions be vigorously and continuously enforced until we achieve final and fully verifiable denuclearization".
Since 2006, the Council has agreed to strengthen sanctions against the DPRK in order to cut off funding for Pyongyang ' s nuclear and ballistic missile projects.
Pompeo met Lee Yong-ho on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, saying that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a smooth one.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said that if North Korea had not condemned him for making “the same demands as bandits” within hours, there would have been some progress on the trip.
In a meeting with Wen Yuen during this month, the North Korean side promised to dismantle the missile launch site and the nuclear complex if the U.S. takes “corresponding measures”.
Lee said Kim Jong-un told him that the “correspondent measures” he was seeking were the security assurances that Trump promised in Singapore and the progress made in normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend classes to learn how to get enough rest time.
This year, Harvard University opened a new course that allowed all undergraduates to get more sleep in order to resist the growing men's culture of staying up late with caffeine.
One scholar found that the world's leading university often had no idea how to take care of its basics.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who thought it was the first such course in the United States.
After a lecture on the impact of sleep deficiency on learning, he was inspired to start studying the course.
After the lecture, a girl came near me and asked me, "Why did I reach my fourth year before learning about this?"
She said that nobody told her how important it was to sleep, which surprised me: "He told The Telegraph like this.
The course was launched for the first time this year and mainly explains to students how good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sports performance and improve their overall health.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry and Executive Director of Health Services at Harvard Medical School, reported that Harvard University had decided to launch the course this week after finding serious sleep deficiencies among students.
The one-hour-long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the courses, a picture of the dormitory was shown, students knocked on coffee cups, curtains, training books and books, listening to the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of sleep deficiency on sports performance, and the importance of pre-sleep activities.
In another course, students learned how chronic sleep deficiencies increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
In class, a school map with interactive icons encourages students to think about their daily activities.
"We know that this will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know that smoking is harmful to health' Professor Czeisler added.
He said that there was still pride in being “all-out” and added that modern technology and increasing student pressure meant that sleep deficiency would become a growing problem.
He said that ensuring sufficient sleep and good sleep quality should become a "secret weapon" for students to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, even in order to avoid weight gain, because inadequate sleep causes the brain to enter hunger patterns and always feels hungry.
19-year-old Californiar Raymond So, specializing in chemistry and physics, was his first year at Harvard University last year when he attended a course by Professor Czeisler and helped him design the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to do everything he could to build a school curriculum.
Next, he hoped that all graduate students would complete similar studies before joining the competition agency.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students should consider setting alarm clocks to go to bed and wake up, paying attention to the harmful effects of "blue light" from electronic screens and LED lighting, which could cause people to lose control of day and night festivals, leading to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1-0 beats the vagrants: Munga's goal forced Gerard to fall behind.
With Dolly Menga's goal, Steven Gerard's broken team at 1-0 in opposition to Livingstone, the vagrants are lost again.
Ebrox wanted to record the first guest victory since the victory of St. Johnston with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team suffered the second loss since Gerald's 18-games, causing his team to lag 8 points in the match with the Lobo Super League leader, Hates.
Munga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half of the game, and the vagrants lacked the air and seemed difficult to break down the enemy.
Now the vagrants are down to sixth, and Livingston is up to third, and the number of net wins is just behind Hebrew.
The object thrown out at the end of the guest competition caused the border judge Calum Spence head injury, which could cause further trouble to the homeless.
Gerard changed his mind eight times and swept Al United into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup in Scotland.
On the other hand, Holt also chose the 11 Livingston players who took one point off the Hates last week, and he would be very pleased if these trained teams could suppress their opponents in every round.
The Travellers may have taken the initiative, but Livingston has performed exceptionally well in controlling the ball.
They were supposed to play in two minutes, and the first time Monga passed the ball to Scott Pittman over Alan McGregor to finish the goal, but this midfield player missed a great opportunity.
Later, Keaghan Jacobs passed the ball to Captain Craig Halkett at any depth, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, missed the rear pole.
The Travellers did control the situation, but for one third of the finals, they seemed to have more hope for themselves than they believed.
At the end of the 15-minute race, Alfredo Morelos ran into a collision with Steven Lawless. Morelos thought he would get a little ball, but the referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian player's claim.
The first half of the vagrant team only scored two goals, but the former Ebrox team almost didn't bother Liam Kelly with the right shot of Lassana Coulibaly's headball and Ovie Ejaria.
Although the 34-minute unveiling of Livingstone may be bad for the pace of the game, no one denies that their hardship is worthy of this result.
Once again, the vagrants are trapped in Jacobs' carefully designed defensive path.
When Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield didn't react, and Arfield calmly judged that Monga would finish a simple shot.
Gerald replaced Ryan Kent with Culibaly during his mid-hour break, which almost immediately produced effects. The position of the borderer Morelos created a vacuum, but the impressive Kelly stormed the front from his own line of defense.
However, Livingston continues to attract fans' eyes in the way they enjoy, and Lisgo and Halcott play one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the final phase, but McGregor managed well to withstand Jacobs' attack before Lisgo broke the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for the Travellers, applied again for a pitch after a dispute with Jacobs, but Thomson turned a blind eye again.
Yearbook: Inventor of the Geiger counter
Next, the contents of the Yearbook of Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, that is, today, 136 years ago... it was the day the next physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, which eventually developed into a device called the "Geag counter".
Since then, the Geiger counter has become a central pillar of popular culture, like the 1950 film Colorado Bell, which plays the words of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, the cowboys who seem unlikely to be scientists:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
With the headphones on, you can even hear the effects of the atom released by radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "I have to shrink, I'm sure it'll be particularly popular!"
""Hanth' Geiger died in 1945 on his 63rd birthday."
But this invention, named after his name, will last forever.
The new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "discover" rogue cells.
The new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "discover" and kill rogue cells.
The vaccine trains the immune system to identify rogue cells and use them for treatment.
This method needs to extract immune cells from the patient and then change them in the lab.
So you can "discover" a protein common to a variety of cancers and re-inject it into your body.
A pilot vaccine has worked well among a wide range of cancer patients.
After using this vaccine to train the immune system to identify rogue cells for the treatment of a woman, her ovarian cancer has disappeared for 18 months.
This method requires the extraction of immune cells from the patient's body and then changes them in the laboratory so that they can "discover" one of the proteins commonly found in multiple cancers, known as Her2, and then re-inject it into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States National Cancer Research Centre in the city of Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our test results suggest that we are approaching a very promising vaccine."
Professor Berzofsky explained that HER2 "was a contributing factor to several cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer."
The immune cells are extracted from the patient's body and then "train" them to locate cancer cells, using similar methods, which have already begun to bear fruit in the treatment of a leukemia.
Kanye West, who used to wear the MAGA hat to the SNL, faced verbal abuse for supporting Trump.
It didn't work out very well.
In Saturday Night Live studio, a public tribute to US President Donald Trump and an unbridled talk that he should be involved in the 2020 general election, Kanye West encountered a hush.
After performing the third song, "Ghost Town", in the hat "Make America Great", he began to speak out against the Republican Party and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talked to white people, and they all said, "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
"Well, if I was worried about racial discrimination, I wouldn't have moved out of America a long time ago," West said.
SNL started with a funny short play by Matt Damon, in which Hollywood stars mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on the sexual assault charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the show was not broadcast, West's roaring footage was uploaded to social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It is difficult to determine whether Locke released the video in order to mock West.
At the same time, West complained to the audience that he had had a difficult time backstage because he was wearing a hat.
According to the Washington Observer newspaper, "They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They bullied me!
Then they said I was in trouble."
West goes on and says, "Do you want to know what the dilemma is?" He says, "Put on my Superman cloak, because that means you won't be able to order me to do it. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
According to Variety, at least two of his comments triggered the hushing of the audience, and SNL entertainers seemed embarrassed. One of them told this newspaper reporter, "The entire studio is in the silence of death."
West was invited as the newest replacement for the singer Ariane Grande, former boyfriend of Grande, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West dressed up as a Perrier Bottle and singing the song "I love it", a move that puzzled many people.
West received the support of Candace Turner, head of the conservative organization TUSA, who wrote on Twitter: "I pay tribute to the most fearless: thank you for your courage in fighting the thugs."
But Karen Hunter, the talk show host, wrote on Twitter that West was just, "Be brave and be himself, that's great."
"But I won't reward those who, I think, are accepting and spreading ideologies that are harmful to my community.
He's free.
So do we." Hunt adds.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and declared that he now "officially became Kanye West".
He was not the first artist to change his name, as did Diddy (also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy or P Diddy).
Snoop Dogg, who was also a rapper, used the name Snoop Leon and, of course, the late musical genius Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, which was previously known as Prince.
There's been a deliberate murder with a knife in a restaurant in Belfast.
On Friday, there was a knife wound case in a restaurant east of Belfast, committed by a 45-year-old man accused of premeditated murder.
According to the police, the crime scene was the Ballyhakamore Restaurant.
The accused is expected to appear in court on Monday for questioning by the Belfast District Court.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
"The Game of Power" movie star Kit Harrington criticises "toxic" masculinity.
Kit Harrington played Jon Snow in HBO's medieval drama series, The Game of Power, and known to the general public, he was a hero with a sword.
The 31-year-old Kit, who has already criticised the phenomenon of his stereotypes — the tough hero — said that such roles on the screen meant that young people always felt that they had to behave cold to be respected.
Kit stated in the cultural column of the Sunday Times that he believed that “problems had arisen” and left out the question of how to solve the problem of the “toxic” male identity of the #MeToo (only me) age.
Kit recently married Rose Leslie, the film star of the game of power, the same age. Kit admitted that he had a "very strong" feeling and needed to solve the problem.
"At this moment, I personally have a very strong feeling that what's wrong with our masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching our children as they grow up?
Kit believes that television may be primarily responsible for the prevalence of "toxic" masculinity because the personality displayed on television is very male.
He went on to say, "What is born and what is learned the day after tomorrow?"
What's on TV and on the street to make these young people think they have to act like this to be men?
I think it is indeed one of the most serious problems of our time. How should we change that?
It's obvious that young people are having problems.
In his interview, he also admitted that the season's Game of Power would be killed next summer, after which he would no longer participate in any of the antecedents or sequels, saying that he "was tired of the battlefields and the battle horses".
Starting in November, Kit will be participating in the replay of Sam Shepard's "True West", telling the story between a film producer and his brother as a bandit.
Kit recently revealed that he felt the happiest thing to play "The Game of Power" was to meet his wife Rose.
"I met my wife in this TV show and gave it to my subsequent family, as well as to my present life," he said.
In the Game of Power, Rose played the role played by Kit as Jon Snow's lover Ygritte. The Game of Power won the Emmy Award for Best Plays.
The couple had a wedding in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
AIDS: Increased number of new AIDS cases in China 14%
China announced a 14% increase in the number of AIDS patients.
China's WPC reported that China has more than 820,000 people living with AIDS.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new patients were reported.
The vast majority of new infections are transmitted through sexual behaviour, which is a historic change.
In the past, the main route through which the rapid spread of AIDS in parts of China was the transmission of infected blood.
At a meeting held in Yunnan Province, China ' s National Planner Committee described the number of people living with HIV through this approach as almost zero.
At the same time, however, the number of people living with HIV in China has increased by 100,000 compared to last year.
Sexual transmission of HIV has become a serious problem for the LGBT population in China.
In 1997, China legalized homosexuality, but discrimination against LGBT people remained widespread.
China ' s values are relatively conservative, and research estimates that 70-90% of men have sex with men, and the ultimate marriage is for women.
The spread of many diseases stems from the inadequacy of sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has committed itself to universalizing AIDS drugs and resolving the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that his men had leaked Republican senator's information, triggering "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
Saturday, Congressman Maxine Waters denounced the statement that members of the House of Representatives had published personal information about three Republican United States senators on the Congressman's Wikipedia page.
Maxine Waters (L.A. Democrats) claims that this term attracts criticism from "extreme right-wing" experts and websites.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter, "The lies, the lies, are all despicable lies."
It was reported that published information included the home addresses and telephone numbers of United States Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday from the Hill of Congress, and the publisher was an unknown participant in a Senate panel hearing in response to allegations of sexual misconduct by Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee of the Supreme Court.
The information was leaked some time after three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedStat have reported that it has been determined that the IP address of the information distribution device is related to the office of Waters and has published information about an employee of Waters.
Waters goes on to say, "This is a nonsense, a complete lie, an absolute lie."
"My staff is definitely not the one who leaks this information, and this is a lie, but it undermines their identity, personal information and security.
It's nonsense. It's a complete lie. It's an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew criticism from online users, including the former White House news spokesman Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote, "There is anger in her denial."
"It means she's not fit to be a congressman.
The most important thing is anger when they are accused of being wrongly accused by others.
No one can see.
The motives of the accuser cannot be questioned.
You have to calm down and sink."
Fleischer seems to be comparing Waters' reaction with the Democratic Party's criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who behaved at Thursday's hearing and was accused by critics as being too angry.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who deliberately replaced Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
He said on Twitter, "If that's the case, don't exaggerate."
Waters stated in her statement that her office had warned “the authorities and law enforcement agencies that these claims are fraudulent”.
She went on to say, "We need to make sure we find the culprits and hold them legally responsible for what they did, and they have a devastating effect on me and my staff."
"Associator of Bean 3, East Mountain Reboot" film review: Rowan Ekinson re-created a funny spy image.
The current film will reflect the meaning of some British decouples, favouring the British position. The same is true of the English action comedy series Special Agent Chewing Bean. The first Special Agent was released in 2003 and the second in 2011.
It's a funny irony that we don't have new export opportunities. How worthless are we?
In any case, Johnny Ingles, who stares at big eyes and has no expression or ability to express anything, has once again obtained permission to mess things up. His name is much more expressive, and it is precisely the creation of this well-known comedian, targeting non-English viewers.
Despite his pretentious attempt to act as an elegant gentleman, charming, he still has the stupid covert agent image of Crusoe, the peas, and the young man who played the 2012 London Olympic opening theme song, "Chariots of Fire".
He was originally a tourist in Barclayca TV ads and an international mystery man, Ekinson, who always made a mess, even though they were forgotten.
There was one or two bright spots when Ingrids went out.
I like Johnny Ingles, when he was close to the helicopter in his medieval armor, spinning leaves on his helmet, making a bit of dinging.
Ekinson's action comedy talent is visible, but the sense of humor is quite inadequate, strange and far-fetched, especially with "serious" film brands such as "007" and "Intelligent," and is now confidently integrated into the comedy component.
This sense of humor is more about children than adults. Personally, I feel that Johnny Ingles is lacking in creativity and cohesion than the jokes of Ekinson's silent bean performances in the silent film.
The theme of the year is now centred on Britain's grave predicament.
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain's super secretive spy network, exposing all British agents, which hurt the mind of the current agent, Kevin Eldon's little character.
The role of the Prime Minister in the film is exaggerating, problematic and politically unpopular: Emma Thompson made every effort to show the character of this Teresa May character from the outside, but there was no line in the film.
Her intelligence adviser told her that all active spies had been exposed and that only one person could be identified from a retired agent to take on a heavy responsibility.
The only choice is the clumsy Johnny Ingles, who has now changed his profession and is headmaster at a luxury institution, but teaches privately how to become an undercover agent: the burden here is new, because Ingles runs a school-style school of espionage.
Inglesia was quickly brought back to the White House, attended an emergency launch and reunited with Bough, an old friend who suffered a lot.
Bough is now a home and a bit wasteful on Vicki Pepperdine. Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine commander, and his role is a little popular.
Thus, Batman and Robin, who made a big mistake at Her Majesty's Secret Service, came back, and then they met Ophelia Bulletova, who played Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the British Prime Minister is in a distressing position under the enticement of the superb technology business billionaire -- Jake Lacy, the dark character Jason Volta.
Inglesia and Bove started their fun-crowding journey: they pretended to be waiters and set fire to a golden French restaurant; they created a chaotic act of suicide on a luxury yacht in Volta; and when they used virtual reality headphones to familiarize themselves with Volta's house, they triggered pure anarchy.
At the end of the day, all the suspense was removed, and the harmony, the fun, but the whole, it was only at the level of the play for the youngest children.
The overall evaluation was uneven.
Like the other two Bean Special Agent films, I can't help but reflect: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Ekinson a role worthy of him?
The Labor Party denied that there was no "Four-Four-Four-Four-Four" plan.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider implementing a radical plan, with the British working four days a week, with no loss in wages.
The Labour Party reportedly hopes that businesses will use the costs saved by artificial intelligence (AI) to provide workers with an additional day off.
In this way, employees can enjoy three days of weekends a week while bringing home their wages remain unchanged.
According to sources, this idea is “consistent” with the economic agenda of the Labour Party, and plans will favour British workers.
The plan to implement the four-day workday was supported by the Union of British Trade Unions (TUC), so that workers could benefit from economic transformation.
A senior Labour Party source wanted to introduce the Sunday Times, saying: "It is expected that the results of the policy review will be published by the end of the year.
"This cannot happen in a single moment, but the system of work `upset by a quarter' is consistent with the Labour Party's goal of favouring workers' interests and with the Labour Party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party was not the first party to support such an idea, and the Green Party promised to introduce the `Four Days and Threes' working system during the 2017 general election.
However, the plan has not yet received the support of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party finder said, "The work system of `Four-Four-Thirteen' is not a political party policy, and the Labour Party has not yet considered it."
Shadow Minister John McDonnell, at the Labour Party meeting last week, specified his views on the socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to take back the power of the “invisible directors” and the “seller” in the public utility business.
McDonnell's plan also means that the current shareholders in the water company may not be able to recover all their shares, as the Labour Government may “reduce” them on grounds of immorality.
He also confirmed the plan to support workers to serve on the company's board of directors, creating an "inclusive ownership fund" to give 10% of private business equity to employees so that they can draw up to 500 pounds of annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy spoke openly on the 60 Minutes show as to whether the FBI investigation into Cavanaugh could influence their decision.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh forced the final vote on the nomination of the United States Supreme Court Chief Justice to be postponed for at least a week, while at the same time it began to wonder whether the FBI investigation would undermine Republican Senator Bret Cavanaugh's support for Bret Cavanaugh.
On Sunday's interview show, 60 Minutes, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Congressman John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI's findings would influence their decision.
Kennedy is more open than Graham's idea.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I was going to the hearing. I said, I've talked to Cavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were released and asked him, "Did you do it?"
He's decisive, he's determined, he's clear."
However, Graham's vote seems to be nailed.
"I've got a good idea about Brett Cavanaugh's vote, and I won't change my mind even if it's a poison fire charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what the truth is, but what I know is: Brett insists he hasn't done it," Graham adds. Dr. Ford in his words means Christine Blasey Ford.
"Everyone she says can't verify what she says is true.
It's been 36 years.
It doesn't change anything."
What is the Global Citizen Music Festival, and what contribution does it make to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Music Festival, an annual music festival with a very impressive star performance and equally impressive mission: Eradicating World Poverty.
This year, the 17th Global Citizen Music Festival will attract thousands of people into the large lawn of the Central Park, raising awareness of the true purpose of the event, namely to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030, while appreciating the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, among others.
The Global Citizen Music Festival, established in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Alleviation Project, an international advocacy organization that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people active in fighting poverty.
If you want to get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for the VIP ticket), the audience must complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling or helping to raise awareness of its goal of eradicating poverty in any other meaningful way.
But with only 12 years left to reach the goal, is Global Citizen going to be successful?
Is it possible to use a free concert as an incentive to convince people to act, or is it just another term called "cyber click activism" (people feel that they really make a difference by signing online petitions or sending tweets)?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said that it has documented more than 19 million "actions" from supporters that contribute to achieving many different goals.
Global Citizen stated that these actions have helped world leaders to issue commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 22.50 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the organization recognized 390 commitments and announcements in its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or raised.
The organization expects that the funds raised so far will have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of these key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between British investors and implementers committed to “helping children to develop their full potential”, and after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens, committed $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country.
At a concert held in London in April 2018, The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tacey Ullman told you that “with the support of the British government, donors, governments and many other global citizens like you, the social injustice of malnutrition is about to become a footnote in history”.
The organization also stated that after over 5,000 actions calling on the British Government to improve the nutritional status of mothers and children, the Government announced the establishment of the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutritional interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to a common question on the website, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It's going to be a long and difficult road -- sometimes we even fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed, because our unity will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will serve as guest speakers for the line of music festivals, which will be chaired by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The Secretary of the Interior said that the United States would launch a naval blockade to stop Russian energy exports.
According to the Washington Observer newspaper, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed that the Washington side could launch the Navy “if necessary” to stop Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East.
Zinkai claims that Russia’s activities in Syria – especially at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian government – are nothing more than a pretext to explore new energy markets.
Zinkai reportedly said, “I think the Russians are involved in the Middle East because they want to repeat their actions in Eastern Europe and act as energy agents in Europe's southern interior”.
According to official sources, there are a number of ways and means to solve this problem.
He said, "The United States has the ability to work with our navy to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, blockades can be imposed to ensure that Russian energy does not enter the market".
Zinkai spoke at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Union, a non-profit organization that claims to be the "energy consumer voice" of the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they were actually the same.
"The economic choices of Iran and Russia are more or less the use of and alternative fuels", he said, was a "black horse" economically dependent on fossil fuels.
The above statement is due to the fact that the Trump government has been working to promote the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe to replace the Russian position, which is cheaper for European consumers.
To this end, Trump government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the North Creek 2 (Nord Stream 2) gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a "monopolistic market" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Creek 2 (Nord Stream 2) gas pipeline, costing $11 billion, is a purely economic project aimed at doubling the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's strong opposition to the project was purely for economic reasons and that it was unfair competition.
In September, Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow, "I believe we all recognize that energy cannot be a tool for pressure, and consumers should have the right to choose suppliers."
The position of the American side was strongly opposed by Germany, which has reiterated its intention to join the project.
The leading German industrial organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere in the European Union ' s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
After a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the President of the German Industrial Federation (BDI), Dieter Kempf, said, "If third countries intervene in our energy supply, we will be in great trouble."
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said he'd take the 2020 presidential election seriously.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would "consider seriously" the presidential elections to be held after the mid-term elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider running during the inauguration of the City Council of Hollyok, Massachusetts.
According to the Congressional Hill newspaper, Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington politics, where we have a broken government, and one of them needs an upper-level woman."
"After November 6, I will seriously consider the presidential election."
Speaking of President Donald Trump during the city hall's inauguration, Warren said, "He's taking our country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply worried about what Donald Trump has done to democracy," Warren said.
Warren was right about the accusations made against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court candidate whose nomination was widely publicized by Trond.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need the FBI to investigate before voting."
However, according to the poll results released on Thursday, Warren's own majority of voters felt that she should not participate in the 2020 general election.
According to a poll conducted by the Centre for Political Studies of the University of Safook (Suffolk University Research Center)/Boston Globe, 58% of voters in Massachusetts “may be” said that senators should not run.
Thirty-two percent of voters supported their candidacy.
According to public opinion surveys, most voters supported the election of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent of whom supported the election and 48 per cent opposed it.
Other high-profile Democrats who may be involved in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said that it would officially decide whether to run in January.
Sarah Palin yelled at the president's rally for a track Palin with post-traumatic stress disorder.
Twenty-six-year-old Track Palin joined the army in September and stayed in Iraq for a year.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"How my son felt, how he felt when he came back, believing that other soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or the families of wounded soldiers could feel the same," she said to the audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tarsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other veterans "have changed when they return, and they wonder if they are equally respected as soldiers, pilots and all the other members of the army, who respect their country as such."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Wassila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman after being drunk and carrying weapons.
America challenges the new asylum policy, 18 states and the District of Columbia stand together.
18 states and the District of Columbia supported legal challenges to a new policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, delegates from 18 states and the District of Columbia submitted an amicus curiae brief to Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker to challenge this policy.
American Civil Liberties Union filed an action against federal policy in August - Grace v. Sessions - yet to disclose the full name of the plaintiff.
Grace said she was abused by her partner, “and the son of his violent gang member”, but on July 20, United States officials refused her asylum application.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace said that countries such as El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala faced widespread gang and domestic violence, which resulted in a large number of applicants for United States asylum.
This new asylum policy in the United States overthrew the decision taken in 2014 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Board of Immigrant Appeals) to allow illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Minister of Justice of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, stated in a statement on Friday that this new policy “blind from state, federal and international law for decades”.
"The federal law requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and the prohibition violates the above principles", as indicated in the amicus curiae brief.
In the briefing, lawyers further argued that the policy of refusing immigration harms the United States economy and that these people are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to “provide the necessary labour”.
The Minister of Justice, Jeff Sessions, ordered the immigration judge no longer to provide shelter to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
When this policy was announced on June 11, Sechins said that “those who are persecuted or afraid of leaving their country because of their race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political opinion may be granted asylum”.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems, even serious ones, that people around the world face every day.
As the death toll doubled, the desperate rescue workers of Baru fought for seconds to find the survivors.
For survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It feels very tense," 35-year-old mother Lisa Kusuma said that she was pacifying her fever at an evacuation centre in Baru City, where she was badly damaged.
"The ambulance delivers the body every minute.
Clean drinking water is scarce.”
Residents returned to their destroyed homes, searched carefully for water-soaked objects and tried to save anything they could find.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake left hundreds wounded and hospitals destroyed and flooded.
A number of injured persons, including Dwi Haris, who sustained injuries to his back and shoulder, rested outside the Baru Army Hospital (Palu's Army Hospital), where patients had to be treated outside due to strong aftershocks.
Harris' eyes were filled with tears, remembering the strong shock in the fifth floor room of the hotel where he lived with his wife and daughter.
“We don't have time to save ourselves.
I think I was squeezed into the ruins of the wall. Harris told the Associated Press reporter and added that their whole family was at the wedding in town.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was no voice.
I don't know how my wife and kids are doing.
I want them to be safe."
The U.S. Ambassador to China accused China of "bullying" in "political propaganda ads."
A week ago, an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page ad in an American daily to brag about the mutual benefits of Chinese-American trade, and the American ambassador to China accused the Beijing side of using the American media for political propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump mentioned that the Chinese Daily newspaper published a fee supplement in the newspaper Des Moines (the largest newspaper in Iowa State), accusing China of trying to intervene in the United States Congress elections held on November 6, after which China denied the allegation.
Trump accused the Beijing side of attempting to intervene in the United States elections, signalling a new phase in what United States officials said to Reuters, and the pressure exerted by Washington on China is escalating.
Although advertising by foreign governments to promote trade is common, Beijing and Washington are currently mired in an escalating trade war, and both sides have imposed several rounds of customs duties on each other's imports.
Chinese experts from China and the United States said that in the early days of the trade war, China ' s retaliatory tariffs were aimed at fighting Republican exporters in Iowa and other states who supported Trump.
The Ambassador of the United States to China, the former long-time Governor of Iowa, and the main exporter of Chinese agricultural products, Terry Brandstad, said that Beijing moves hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
In a comment article published on Sunday in the Demein Chronicle, Branstad wrote that China is “strengthening bullying by advertising political propaganda in our own free media”.
“In terms of political propaganda, the Chinese Government is making use of America's cherished traditions of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by placing a fee ad in the Demein Chronicle”, written by Branstad.
"By contrast, you rarely see opposition voices on the streets of Beijing, nor can you see the true reflection of the Chinese people's disagreement about China's worrying economic development trajectory, because the media is under the strict supervision of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that “China's most famous newspaper refuses even to publish his articles”, but he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts have warned that Republican women voters will lose Cavanaugh by mid-term.
Several Republican leaders insisted on supporting and defending the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who faced multiple allegations of sexual assault, and analysts warned that they would face strong opposition, especially from women, in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The sentiment generated by the incident was very high, and most Republicans recorded that they wanted to get votes to go down.
In an article published on Saturday, Grant Reeher, Professor at Maxwell College, Syracuse University, revealed to the Congressional Hill newspaper that "there can be no turning back on these things."
Lyle said he suspected that Senator Jeff Flake (a Republican from Arizona) would be enough to placate voters' anger by working hard for the FBI investigation at a critical juncture.
According to the Washington, D.C. newspaper, Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Advisor and State spokesman for Progress Organization MoveOn, said on Friday, "Women will never forget what happened in the past -- tomorrow, and the whole November will never forget."
MIC reported that despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Republicans in control of the Judicial Council opted to continue supporting Cavanaugh's nomination, leading to a demonstration on Friday morning that was exactly the same as in the Senate corridor, where protesters shouted, "It's November!"
The non-partisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg revealed to the news website that "the enthusiasm and motivation of democracy is about to be overstretched."
“The enthusiasm has been said to be very high; that's true.
But the enthusiasm can still be higher, especially in the peri-urban areas, where female voters and young voters (18-29 years old) are uncertain, and usually they don't vote when they don't like the president”.
Prior to Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidates, analysts warned that if Republicans continued to vote, there would be strong opposition.
According to NBC News, the former president of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said, "This will bring chaos to the old party."
"It's not just about the vote or the final vote of the committee, or whether Cavanaugh will be placed on a replacement seat, but also about the way the Republicans deal with the issue and how they treat the victims."
However, with the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh back and forth, there seems to be some disagreement among the American population about who should be trusted, with a slight preference for the latter.
YouGov's latest poll showed that 41% of respondents were clear or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35% indicated that they were clear or likely to believe Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents said they thought that Cavanaugh's testimony might or must have lied, while only 30% said they thought Ford's testimony might or must have lied.
According to the Guardian, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is currently investigating the allegations made by Deborah Ramirez, Mr. Ford and at least one other accuser.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Cavanaugh had raped her after she was 17 years old when she was drunk.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court candidate of showing her naked genitals at a party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventors plan to create a new Internet that can compete with Google and Facebook.
World Wide Web inventor Tim Burns-Lee is currently starting an entrepreneurial company that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of legend in the field of science and technology, is a company based on Bernard Lee's Open Source Platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Bernard Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was to "dominate the world".
Speaking of this start-up company, he said, "We have to act now."
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to allow users to create their own personal online data storage or POD.
This could include a list of contacts, to-dos, calendars, music banks and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, it can be used on the same browser at the same time.
The unique feature of personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to decide which type of information can be accessed.
Companies refer to this characteristic as “the empowerment of individuals through data”.
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the intention of Inrupt was to help the company introduce resources, processes and appropriate skills so that all people could use Solid.
The company currently includes Bernards Lee, Bruce, a secure platform acquired by IBM, some dedicated developers contracted to work on the project, and a volunteer community of programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will use the tools available on the Inrupt website to create their own decentralised applications.
Bernard-Lee claims that he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether to make a radical change in the face of the complete collapse of all their business models overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post published on Saturday in Medium, Bernard Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems, thereby helping to preserve the quality and integrity of the new Solid-based network.
In 1994, Bernard Lee changed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Alliance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Bernard Lee has become the backbone of the cyberneutral debate.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Bernards Lee was the founder and director of the World Wide Web Alliance, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I very much like the next generation network," Bernard Lee adds.
Bernard Vann: Commemoration of Victoria's Cross of the First World War
During the First World War, 100 years apart, the only member of the Church of England who fought and won the Victoria Cross, celebrated in his hometown.
The pastor, Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann, won a medal in the battle between Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
Unfortunately, a sniper killed him four days later, so no one knew that he had won the highest military honour in Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren unveiled the monument during a parade in Rashden, Northampton County.
Michael Vann, his grandson, said that the monument was a "beautiful symbol" to commemorate 100 years of his grandfather's medal.
According to the London Communiqué, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led the army and crossed the San Quentin Canal "in the presence of heavy fog, in the rain of field guns and machine guns" (Canal de Saint-Quintin).
He then headed for the front line and led the front-line fighters “corruptly” in the fall. He then opened fire with a single hand with a field gun, repelling three sub-units.
On October 4, 1918, more than a month before the end of the war, Colt Vann was shot dead by a German sniper.
72-year-old Michael Vann evaluates grandfather's behavior by saying, "I know that grandfather's bravery never beats me, but it will keep me humble."
The parade was led by the Brentwood Empire Youth Band. After the parade, Michael Vann and his brother Dr. James Vann gave the wreath.
Michael Vann said that he was "very honoured to take part in the march", and then added, "The true hero can tell what he's brave from the support people give."
Bellator 206 became "Piggy Page" by MMA fans waiting all night.
Imagine, you stayed up all night waiting to see the Bellator 206, but at the end of the day you were told you couldn't watch the main event.
San Jose has 13 competitions, of which the main event has 6 competitions. Channel 5 of the United Kingdom has been live for the night.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, the channel content was changed to Piggy, and the British audience was shocked.
Some people stayed up all night and waited until early morning to see the boxing competition, but fell into their glasses.
On Twitter, a fan said that turning the program into animated films was a "damn joke".
The Senior Marketing and Communication Vice President of Bellator, Dave Schwartz, asked questions about the broadcast, said, "The government has rules that it is not fit to broadcast such programmes at 6 a.m., so television stations are forced to switch to children's programmes."
"Piggy Page," "Yes."
The President of Bellator Corporation, Scott Coker, said that in future arrangements, British viewers would be included as much as possible.
"I think this can be solved when thinking about replaying," said Coker.
"But it was at 6 a.m. on Sundays in England, but we had to wait until Sundays on our side, and then it was Monday in England.
But we're still working on it.
Believe me, when the show changed, I received a lot of information, and it was unfriendly.
We did the same thing. We thought it was a technical failure.
But it's not really, it's a matter of government regulation.
I can assure you this won't happen again.
We'll control five games instead of six. We usually play five games. We wanted to make fans enjoy more, but it's too long.
It's a little awkward."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's low on account of his sexual orientation.
Tom Daley, an Olympic diver, said he felt humbled from childhood because of his sexual orientation, but it was also the driving force behind his success.
The 24-year-old boy said he only found out after middle school that "not everyone is like me."
In "Desert Island Discs", radio channel 4 hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said that he was talking about gay rights to give others hope.
He also described the fact that when he had a child, he had less to do with the issue of winning the Olympic championship.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this youth show, has been sick for months.
As a guest of Laverne's inaugural show, Daley said that in his own growth he felt "first class" than others, because "the society does not accept the interaction between boys and girls of the same sex."
He said, "To this day, I will still feel truly inferior and feel different, but it also gives me the strength to succeed."
He said that he wanted to prove that he was “making a difference”, so that when people knew their sexual orientation, they wouldn't let them down.
Daley has won two Olympic bronze medals, now a prominent LGBT activist, and has come out this year at the Australian Commonwealth Games calling for more countries to legalize homosexuality.
He said that he dared to speak because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences, and he wanted to give others hope.
The three world champions said they met the American film producer Dustin Lance Black in 2013, and when he found out he was in love with this man, "I'm scared myself."
Last year, Daley married his 20-year-old Oscar winner, who said that age difference was never an issue.
Daley first attended the Olympics at the age of 14, and three years later, his father died of cancer. He said, "As a young man, so much has gone through, it's hard to find people of similar ages who are like them."
The couple had their son in June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley. After that, Daley's whole view changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd say, 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there's something bigger than the Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
He named his son the same name as his father Robert to commemorate his father ' s death in 2011 due to brain cancer (40 years old).
Daley said his father didn't believe he was going to die, and his last question was to ask if there were tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, "Dad, you can't sit in the front row," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing, and I didn't admit it until he stopped breathing and died," he said.
In the following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that that's all I've dreamed of all my life, diving in front of the main audience during the Olympic Games, and there's no better feeling than that," he said.
And that's why Proud by Heather Small became his favorite song, and he fell in love with it in the run-up to the Olympics, and now he hears it and he's one of them.
Desert Island Discs is broadcasted on Sunday 1115 (BST) and broadcast channels are BBC Radio 4 channels.
Michaelson, who's not feeling well, got replaced on the Leeds on Saturday.
The American player Phil Mickelson will make a record in his 47th competition on Sunday, but he has to adjust to avoid negative milestones.
Michaelson, for the 12th time in this biennial event, was replaced by Captain Jim Furyk in the four-person four-ball and four-person two-ball game on Saturday.
Instead of becoming the center and center of the game as it was in the United States, this five-thousand winner spent a day on cheerleaders and training, hoping to get his problems right and back to the game as soon as possible.
Even at the peak of a career, holding the most straight golf clubs, the tense French national golf course is not suitable for this 48-year-old player, whose high and uneven route increases the difficulty of shooting off off track.
If the field is not robust enough in itself, Michaelson will win all four games this week in partnership with Francesco Molinari, the British champion of the perfect Golf in the ninth game of the week.
If the U.S. team starts 12 single-play games with a four-point lag, the Michaelson game will be crucial if it is to start well.
Florrick expressed confidence in his team, but he had nothing else to say.
"He fully understood his role today, took pictures of my back, put his arms around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Florrick said.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He's a member of Hall of Famer, and he's made a huge contribution to the team in the past, and this week too.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I want him to play more games, but that's what it turns out to be, and I have to accept it.
Like everyone else, he wants to be on the playing field."
On Sunday, Mikulson will break Nick Faldo's record of the highest number of competitions in the Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of the Ryder Cup career, and his personal record has never reached this high.
Michaelson made 18 out of 20 negative 7 flat, although Florrick said that his appearance brought some invisible power to the team.
"He's funny, he's sour, he's cozy, he likes to make fun of people, he's a great guy on the team," he explains.
"I think young players like to tease him, and this week it'll be fun.
In addition to the competition, he brought us a lot."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn realizes that the big score is about to break.
Team leader Thomas Bjorn from Europe, judging from experience, entered the single-play finals of the Leed Cup with a big-time lead, easily creating a negative situation.
During his first appearance in the Valderrama competition in 1997, Seve Ballesteros, the leader of the team, took a five-point lead, but in the end it was only 141⁄2–131⁄2 with an extremely small advantage.
After watching two of the 2018 games held on Friday and yesterday at Le Golf National in France (winned by 5-3 and eventually led by 10-6 points), Bjørn described, "You have to remind yourselves that we were a big leader in Varderrama and Bruclain; although we lost in Bruclain, we managed to win in Valderrama."
History will tell me and every member of the team that it's not over.
You have to do everything you can before tomorrow comes.
Go out and do the right thing.
It didn't end until the score came up on the score list.
Our goal is to try to win the trophies, which is the focus of our attention.
I've been saying that I'm concerned about the 12 players on our team, but we know very well what we're facing -- the most powerful player in the world."
Bjørn was satisfied with the difficult confrontation of the players on the golf course, adding, "I will never be able to defeat myself in this respect.
Tomorrow's another war.
Tomorrow is a private show of self-serving courage, something different from normal times.
If the game goes well, it'll be great to fight side by side with your partner, but if you fight alone, as a golf player, the test will be your overall ability.
That's the message you need to make the players understand. Tomorrow you'll be able to do your best.
Now, you have to leave your partner, and your partner has to leave you, and each has his full ability."
Unlike Bjørn, Jim Furyk expected the individual performance of the players to go beyond partner performance, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four.
As the European team worked hard to achieve the Miracle at Medinah, and failed, as a member of Bruclain’s winning team, Florrick has stood on both ends of the finals, with the possibility of winning or losing.
When asked how Ben Crenshaw (the then captain of 1999) inspired the team to meet the finals, he said, "I remember every damn word."
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but you might want to pre-empt as in Valderrama and Bruclain.
If everyone pushes in the same direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle game.
"So our formation has been adjusted accordingly to come out in a way that will benefit us, and we are all aware that we are trying to make a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas will lead the team back, and he will fight against European players such as Rory McIlroy in the finals, Paul Casey in the semifinals, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Freewood and Ian Poulter in the semifinals.
Speaking of a single game, Bjørn said, "I deployed the players in that order, which was the decision of the whole party."
The German new warship has postponed its appearance again.
According to local media reports, the latest frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be tested in 2014 to replace the old warship of the Cold War, but because of system failures and the cost-rolling snowball growth, we will not be able to see the frigate as bright as next year.
According to the Die Zeit newspaper, the military spokesman said that the commissioning of the All-New Baden-Württemberg frigate, the Rhineland-Palatinate, was currently postponed until the first half of 2019.
The frigate was supposed to have served in the Navy in 2014, but the troublesome post-production problems were all the same for the fate of this vast project.
The four Baden-Württemberg frigates recalled by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Baden-Württemberg frigates.
It is understood that the frigate will have powerful firepower, a large number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include the longer maintenance cycle - the latest frigate could be deployed for up to two years away from the mother port.
However, successive extensions mean that the state-of-the-art warship - which is said to allow Germany to deploy its forces abroad - will be obsolete when it becomes operational.
As early as last year, when the German navy officially refused to debug the frigate and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, the F125 frigate had become the focus of news.
This was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for this return, but the German media cited some of the key “software and hardware defects” that would render the battleship useless in carrying out its combat mission.
Software defects will be particularly deadly as the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates will be controlled by 120 crew members and will need only half the capacity of the old Baden-Württemberg-class frigates.
Similarly, it was revealed that the frigate was seriously overweight, which would reduce its performance and limit the Navy ' s ability to add future upgrades.
The weight of the 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Pfaltz" is said to be twice that of the same class frigate used during the Second World War in Germany.
Besides hardware failure, the cost of the entire project, including the training of crews, has also become a headache.
It is said that the cost has reached 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), compared to 2.2 billion euros in the initial budget.
In the light of recent warnings that German naval forces are shrinking, the problems of the latest frigate have become even more serious.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the National Defence Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the German navy actually “has no more ships to deploy”.
The official said that the problem had become more serious over time and that old ships were gradually being decommissioned without new ones that could be replaced.
He lamented that no frigate of the Baden-Württemberg class could serve in the Navy.
The National Trust's secret life of bugging bats.
A new study is under way at a estate in the highlands of Scotland, which aims to reveal how bats use the land for food.
It is hoped that this finding will unlock the behavioural veil of this unique flight-type mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will track common voltage and high-sounding wings, as well as brown long-eared bats and Daubenton bats in the Wester Ross Garden of Inverewe Gardens.
They will install special recorders at key locations around the garden to track bat activity throughout the year.
NHS staff and volunteers will use handheld detectors to conduct mobile investigations.
Then a professional sound analysis of all the recordings was performed to determine the frequency of bat barking and what bats were doing what they were doing.
They then produce habitat maps and reports to generate detailed scene pictures of bat behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NHS's nature conservation consultant, hopes that the findings will reveal which habitat is vital for bats and how each bat uses it.
This information will help to judge the benefits of habitat management, such as the laying of grasslands and how best to preserve the forested lands of bats and other relevant species.
But the number of bats in Scotland and the British has declined significantly over the past century.
Construction and development work poses a huge threat to bats, affecting their habitat and even causing them to lose their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting, fly-fishing paper and the chemical handling of some building materials, as well as pet cat attacks, pose risks to bats.
Bats are actually visible.
However, due to night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they catch their prey.
They can accurately locate bugs and barriers in flight paths using complex echo positioning techniques.
NTS, responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings in Scotland, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, treats bats very seriously.
The NTS has 10 specialists who have been through the 100th century and who regularly conduct surveys, shelter tests and sometimes rescue.
Even at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, the organization established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve, which is home to eight species of bats (10 species) in Scotland.
David Thompson, the manor's manager, said the manor was the ideal fertile ground for bats.
"We built a section for bats at Threave Manor," Thompson said.
"There are old buildings, old trees and all the perfect habitats.
But there is much unknown knowledge about bats, so the work we do here and in other estates will help us learn more about how bats can thrive.
Thompson stressed that it was important to check the situation of bats before carrying out manor maintenance, because destroying an unwitting female bat habitat could result in the death of up to 400 female bats and bat cubs, leading to the total extinction of the local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to catch, attack, harass or destroy their habitat.
The Scottish official Elizabeth Ferrell of Bat Conservation Trust encourages the public to contribute.
She said, "We have a lot of knowledge to learn about bats and many other species where we don't know the specifics of their populations."
Ronaldo denied the rape charges, and the lawyer was going to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo, who is known as "false news" for being accused of rape, said that people wanted to use him to "fear themselves."
His lawyer is preparing to sue the alleged German news magazine, the Sunglasses Weekly.
The leader of the Portuguese and Uventus team was accused of raping the American woman Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, the Sunglasses weekly reported that Ronaldo was alleged to have subsequently paid $375,000 to the woman, keeping her silent about the incident.
A few hours after the charges were exposed, Ronaldo, 33, released a live video on Instagram to 142 million followers, accusing them of being "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no,
What they're saying today is all false news, and the winner of the gold ball five times said it in front of the camera.
"They just want to use my name to make themselves.
That's normal.
They want to use me to be famous, but that's part of their job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine. Ronaldo smiled to add.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyer intends to sue the Sunglasses Weekly for this accusation, saying that its "unauthorized coverage is suspected of violating personal privacy".
The lawyer Christian Schertz stated that Ronaldo would seek compensation for “the amount of moral damages corresponding to the gravity of the violation, which could be the most serious human rights violation in recent years”.
It is alleged that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documentation from the Clark County District District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayolga were reported to have returned to the player's room after meeting at a nightclub, where there was rape.
Mayolga stated that Ronaldo kneeled to her after the alleged incident and said that he was a “quiet” when he was “99 per cent”, but is being dragged down by the “1 per cent” today.
The paper noted that Ronaldo acknowledged that they had sexual relations, but both parties volunteered.
Mayolga also stated that she went to the police station and took pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of reprisals" and feared "public humiliation".
Mayolga, age 34, claims that she is currently seeking to overturn the out-of-court settlement because of the ongoing trauma caused by the alleged effects of the incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Union of Mansions royal horse at the time of the alleged incident, and Ronaldo has joined Hormen Yuventus, Italy, with 100 million euros in membership fees this summer.
Deo: The UK lost its car manufacturer "to become its eternal regret."
The British Secretary of Commerce, Greg Clark, said that the loss of global leadership in the automobile industry after Britain's departure from Europe would "be its eternal regret".
He added that the British Toyota factory had informed BBC that if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement, Toyota would suspend production at the Bernaston plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the problem of border delays could lead to fewer jobs in the UK without agreement.
Toyota's Auris and Avensis, the factory of Bernaston, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
"My point is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, our factory will stop production." Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota’s Beneston Plant, introduced.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jeopardus Lugger, also expressed concern about what would happen if there was no agreement on the operation of cross-border trade in the UK after Europe.
BMW, for example, said that the mini factory in Oxford would be closed for a month after the British de-Ou.
The main concern of automobile manufacturers is that there may be supply chain risks if no agreement is reached.
The Toyota production line operates on the basis of "just-in-time", and orders for cars from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union are received every 37 minutes.
If on March 29 the UK exited the EU without an agreement, there could be a disruption at the UK border, which, according to industry sources, could result in a delay and shortage of components.
The company stated that the Toyota factory in Derby County could not hold stocks for more than a day and production would therefore cease.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequiers Plan proposed by Theresa May for the future relationship with the EU was "exactly checked to avoid border checks".
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the most successful agreement, so that we can both achieve the present success and seize this opportunity." He told BBC Radio's "4's Today" program like this.
"The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers suggests that we need absolute capacity to continue to drive a series of supply chains that have been very effective."
Toyota did not indicate how long production would stop, but in the long run cost increases will weaken the competitiveness of factories and ultimately affect job opportunities.
Peter Bouvallaris, who has been working at the Bernaston factory for 24 years and who is currently the co-convener of the factory, said that his members were increasingly worried: "In my experience, once these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesman introduced the following: "We have a precise and reliable plan for future relations with the EU".
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein might be postponed again.
On Sunday, the White House said that the high-end meeting between Donald Trump and the Deputy Minister of Justice, Rod Rosenstein, might be “postponed by a week” because the wind wave of the Supreme Court candidate Brete Cavanaugh has not yet subsided.
Rosenstein oversees the work of the Special Adviser Robert Mueller, while Robert Mueller's campaign team is charged with proselytizing Russia and the President may obstruct a just investigation.
There has been much debate in Washington over whether Trump would dismiss the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby endangering Muller's independence.
At the beginning of this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the conversation with Trump with a wire recorder and the possibility of removing the president through 25 amendments.
Rosenstein denied the story.
But last Monday, he went to the White House in a story about his imminent resignation.
On Thursday, news announced that he had a meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he was “not willing” to dismiss Rosenstein, but then postponed the meeting to avoid conflict with the Senate Judicial Committee hearing, where Dr. Cavanaugh and a woman who accused her of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Brassy Ford, would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Cavanaugh and postponed the full Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, the news secretary of Trump, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said, "In view of all the other things being done in the Supreme Court, a week may be postponed. The exact date has not yet been set, I think it may be this week."
But we'll see this day, and I'll keep the media informed about the progress.”
Some journalists will rebut this statement: Saunders has not had a White House press conference since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asks why.
Saunders said that the fact that the press conference was not held was not because she hated the "crowding out" of TV reporters, although she said, "I won't object to their "crowd out" stories."
She then said that direct contacts between Trump and the media would increase.
She said, "President Trump had more questions and answers than any previous president." But she did not invoke any evidence. "We studied these figures."
Saunders said there would still be a press conference, but "if the media had an opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would be much better than talking to me."
We have organized as many questions and answers as we can, and have indeed organized many times in the past few weeks, and when you can talk directly to the President of the United States, the press conference will be cancelled.
Trump often sets up a question-and-answer period when leaving the White House or attending public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the President may have explained to us the reasons behind this, showing up in front of the assembled journalists without fear and sometimes acting strangely.
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff of the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) about the concerns of Teo, England.
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff of the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude to them and hope that they will remain in Scotland after Britain's departure.
Jeane Freeman of the Medical Services Program (MSP) sent a letter within six months before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has committed itself to paying the cost of settlement status applications for EU citizens working in the public service that it transferred.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the treo have continued throughout the summer and it is hoped that a decision will be made this fall.
But the British government is also stepping up preparations for a possible non-agreement situation.
I know this time must have been very uncomfortable for you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of every staff member, regardless of your nationality.
The valuable experience and skills offered by colleagues inside and outside the EU will strengthen and improve our medical services for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland will always be your home, and we very much want you to stay here."
Christy Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury.
Mike Organ, Tennessee, reported that Tennessee State Tigers beat Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday at 31-27. In the competition, Christian Abercrombie, behind the Tigers, was injured in the head and underwent emergency surgery.
Rod Reed, head coach of the Tiger Team at Tennessee State University, told journalists that Abercrombie had been injured shortly before the end of half the game.
"He ran to the edge and suddenly fell," Reed introduced.
Trainers and medical staff lost oxygen to Abercrombie by the edge line, then carried him to the stretcher and brought him back for further evaluation.
An official from the Tiger Team of Tennessee State University revealed to Chris Harris of WSMV News in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “the type/level of damage has not yet been determined”, while the Tiger Team at Tennessee State University was working to understand the exact time of injury.
Abercrombie is a second-grader red shirt player student, the first season in Tennessee State University since he moved here from Illinois.
In Saturday's game, before he quits the game, he completed a total of five shovels, raising the total number of his season shovels to 18.
A higher stamp tax on foreign buyers who buy houses in England.
According to the newly introduced Conservative Plan, the UK will collect a stamped tax on foreign buyers buying properties in Britain, and the resulting taxes will be used to help cope with homelessness.
This will reverse Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The stamp tax is for people who don't pay taxes in England.
Treasury expects to raise Pound120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when buying property in Britain, and an additional income tax will be used to help the homeless.
It also promises to provide more affordable housing and lock in high-income groups. The move is also seen as counterproductive to Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The stamp collection tax targets non-taxed individuals and companies in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds obtained will be used to improve the government's solution to the problem of sleeping in the open.
In addition to the current stamp tax, which includes an increase in taxes on the second set of housing and rental rentals introduced two years ago, the surcharge may be as high as 3 per cent.
The Treasury expects to raise Pound120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the buyers of new London properties are non-British residents, raising prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to buy houses.
Many of Britain's wealthy regions, especially London, have become “ghost cities” because a large number of foreign home buyers are not in England for most of their time.
Just before this new policy was launched, Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp taxes so that more young people could buy the first set of properties.
He accused large construction companies of buying land instead of using land to maintain high housing prices, and urged Ms. May to abandon the quota of affordable housing and address the “housing shame” of the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of housing reform proposals with numerous eyes, including rent regulation and ending “no fault” evictions.
He also hoped that Parliament would be empowered to build new houses.
Ms. May said, "I said last year, during my tenure as Prime Minister, I will restore the British dream and make life better for every new generation.
This means repairing the fragmented housing market.
Britain will always welcome those who want to live, work and build a family here.
However, for individuals who do not live in England, as well as for foreign companies, it is not right to be different from hard-working British residents in finding it difficult to buy a home.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house is too remote, and the insult of a place to sleep is still very real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate dream is to be a Scottish coach."
Jack Ross, the head coach of the Sandland team, said that his "final ideal" was to become the head coach of Scotland one day.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is trying to rejuvenate the Northeast team, which is currently ranked third in the league, 3 points behind the first.
When St Mirren led the St. Mirren back to Scotland last season, he moved to Stadium of Light this summer.
"I want to serve my country as a player.
I got a B cap, that's all. Ross wants the Sport Sound of Scotland program for BBC.
"I grew up watching the Scottish team's game. I used to watch the game with my dad in Hampton when I was a kid. I always remember that time.
But only if I bring the team to success will I have such a chance."
Before Ross, the leaders of the Sandland team included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The owner of the former Alloa Athletic team said that there were so many well-known people in such a big club that he didn't feel scared. He had previously refused the invitation of Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"My success now depends on "Can I lead the team back to England?"
And because of the team's structure and facilities, it's definitely going to be in English and Chinese, he said.
"This mission isn't easy, but only if I lead the team back to England, may I think I'm gonna make it."
His Bishop's career was only three years old. Ross was an assistant coach in Denbaton for a while and worked in the coach group of the hearts team for 15 months.
After that, he led Aro from the demotion to the third team, and during the next season, he led the St. Millen team from the edge of the demotion to the general champion.
Ross said it was more comfortable than the previous careers of the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Millen and Hamilton Academy.
And remembering the Aro experience, he said, "This could be a real crossroads.
I really think I'm more fit to be a coach than to play football.
That sounds strange, because I'm doing well, and living on this is fine, and I do have a lot of fun.
But playing football can be tough sometimes.
There's a lot to do every week.
I still feel the pressure to play football, but I'm the coach, it feels good.
"I've always wanted to be a coach, and now I've done it. It's the most comfortable day of my life."
You can listen to the full interview of Sport Voice on Radio Scottland on September 30th (Sunday) of the British Summer Day.
The investigation found that Saturday at 5:30 p.m., it's perfect for a fresh drink.
During the summer heat, Britain's struggling bar generated revenue and a chain of restaurants was under stress.
Data show that bar sales increased by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 per cent.
The business consulting firm, Peter Martin of CGA, said, "The hot summers of the day, combined with the longer than expected duration of the England World Cup, allowed July to repeat the June mistake (2.8% increase in bar revenues in June) and the restaurant was hit harder.
The number of transactions at the restaurant fell by 1.8 per cent in June, while the decline was even greater in July.
The wine-drink-dominated bar performed the best, but the volume of transactions at the restaurant continued to decline in comparison with the previous year.
Food-based bars are also affected by the heat, although the impact is relatively small compared to that of restaurant operators.
People just seem to want to go outside and have a drink.
The entire bar industry has seen a 6.6% increase in sales of wine and water this month and a 3% decline in sales of food."
Paul Newman, an analyst for the leisure and hotel industry, said, "This trend has been continuing since the end of April.
Among the main factors affecting the sales of out-of-country consumer markets, the largest factors are weather and important social events or sporting events.
It is not surprising that the restaurant industry continues to struggle, falling by 4.8 per cent compared to the sales volume of the same year, with even greater headaches related to rising cost pressures.
For food-based operators, the impact of long hot summers is a clear-fire shock, and time will tell us whether the weather in August is in good weather and will bring the necessary breathing time.
The entire bar and restaurant industry (including newly opened bars and restaurants) saw overall sales increase by 2.7 per cent in July, showing a slowdown in brand promotion.
The British Bar and Restaurant Industry Monitoring Agency, Coffer Peach Tracker, collected and analysed data on the performance of 47 business groups with a total turnover of more than Pound9 billion, setting benchmarks for industry.
A fifth of the minors use social media in secret from their parents.
According to the survey, one fifth of the minors (up to 11 years of age) use social media in secret from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in the use of the "fake Insta" page
The news has raised concerns about the publication of pornographic material.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to deal with parents.
One fifth of minors (age 11) use social media to hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed that the use of "false Insta" (meaning the photo sharing website Instagram) accounts is growing rapidly.
The news raised concerns about the publication of pornographic content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "purified" primary account number for parents, and there were other secret accounts.
A mother accidentally discovered the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, and she found a teenager encouraging others to "rape me."
The survey, which was co-sponsored by the British Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, HMC, found that 40% of minors aged 11-18 had two accounts at the same time, and half of them admitted to having a secret account number.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, introduced him, saying, "It's disturbing that so many young people create cyberspace and hide in it, and neither parents nor teachers know it."
Eliidh Doyle will join the Scottish Athletics Board as "the voice of the athletes."
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Commission at the annual plenary meeting of government agencies.
Doyle is Scotland's most prestigious tracker, and the chairman of the board, Ian Beattie, described this as a great opportunity for track and track coaches to learn from the wealth of experience at the international level.
"Erid has a great reputation in Scotland, England and the world sports world, and we believe that if he joins the committee, the track and track movement in Scotland will certainly benefit greatly," said Betty.
Doyle said, "I'm willing to be a spokesperson for athletes, and I hope to make a real contribution to sports in Scotland and help guide it."
The American athlete won four Olympic gold medals, including 200 metres and 400 metres of gold in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympics, and is currently a British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) invitee commentator, unable to walk after a brief haemorrhage.
He wrote on Twitter: Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
Can't walk.
The doctor said that the extent to which I can recover and can recover depends entirely on time.
Full recovery and re-learning to walk is a difficult task, but I am now able to complete the agility training!
Thank you for your encouragement!"
It's a milk-smoking commercial that compares mother to cow to internet dispute.
In an ad published by a milking company, which compared nursing mothers to milking cows, there was disagreement among online users.
When the new product was launched, "The first voiceless in the world to wear milk smokers", the consumer technology company Elvie published a harmonized music video inspiration ad, which shows the freedom that this new milk smoker brings to mothers.
Four real mothers danced with the music in a cow shed full of dry grass, and a part of the music said, "Yes, I feed myself, but you can't see the tail," and "Didn't you find my big milk, actually my breasts?"
The next lyrics are, "Smoking it out, sucking it out, feeding my baby, sucking it out, pulling it out, Grandma's little princess."
But after the ad was posted on the company's Facebook page, there was controversy online.
The video was viewed at 77,000 times, with hundreds of comments and different reactions, and many felt that there was a suspicion of contempt for the “terror” of the dairy industry.
"The decision to advertise this product with cows was a mistake.
The cow, like us, needs a pregnancy to give birth to milk, but the difference is that the cow's baby will be stolen a few days after giving birth.” An online friend wrote.
Elvie milks can be placed in Elvie/ Mother's breast.
Another blogger commented: "This is undoubtedly a trauma for mothers and babies.
Why do you compare mom to a city cow in a milk-smoking commercial? Mother doesn't want a child to leave herself?"
Another blogger added, "This ad is too unreal."
Others thought the ad was good, and a lady admitted that she found the song "Funny."
"I think this idea is particularly novel.
If I'm still breastfeeding, I'll buy one.
The process of sucking milk makes me feel like a cow.
Advertisement is a little too much, but I think it's okay.
It's a novel product." So one of the web users wrote.
Another commenter: The funny ad is about mothers who need to suck milk (usually in companies or bathrooms) and feel like "cows".
It's not the intention to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the mothers showed themselves dancing and actually wore milk absorbers in their breasts.
This post-advertisement idea stems from the fact that many women call themselves cows when they suck.
However, Elvie's milk absorber is completely silent, without electrical wires or tubes, and can be perfectly placed in the breast of the breast, allowing women to free their hands, hold the baby, and even continue to milk when they go out.
Mother's partner and Executive Creative Director (EDC) Ana Balarin commented: "Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product worthy of bold attempt.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers and cows, we want to place the milk-smoking process and its problems under the spotlight, while demonstrating in an interesting and relevant way that this new milk-smoking device can bring about an unparalleled sense of freedom.
It's not the first headline of Elvie's milker.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of the two children boarded the T-shirt designed by the designer Marta Jakubowski, when she wore the product.
Hundreds of mobile children were secretly transferred to a camp on the Texas border.
Although the policy at the border crossings is relatively unchanged every month, the number of mobile children held in detention has increased considerably, partly due to harsh rhetoric and policies by the Trump government, which have made it harder for sponsors to place children.
Legend has it that most sponsors are themselves illegal immigrants who fear that coming forward to adopt children will jeopardize their chances of remaining in the United States.
In June, the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and their other adult family members had to submit fingerprints and that the authorities would share their fingerprints with the immigration authorities, which led to a significant increase in risk.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confirmed before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied children.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Real 80% of individuals who are family members of sponsors or sponsors are illegally entering the country, most of them transnational criminals.
That's why we're chasing these people all the time”, Albert said.
According to shelter workers, in order to resolve the problems of these children as soon as possible, officials introduced new regulations requiring some of these children to appear in court within one month of detention (rather than 60 days after the previous provision).
Many children will not appear in court in person, but rather will appear in the form of video teleconferences to defend their legal status before immigration judges.
Children who are considered ineligible for relief will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and reports from the system in recent months, the longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, leading to violent acts or escape attempts.
Defence counsel stated that in large facilities such as Tornillo, this concern is even greater, as such places are too large to ignore signs of resistance by children.
They added that transferring children to tent cities without children having had enough time to prepare themselves emotionally and to say goodbye to their friends might aggravate the trauma already suffered by many children.
Syria ordered the “occupation forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees as soon as possible, despite the fact that the war in Syria has lasted eight years.
Mualim, who also served as Deputy Prime Minister of Syria, said that foreign troops illegally entered Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism “will be dealt with accordingly”.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", Mualim said to the United Nations General Assembly.
Mualim insisted that Syria's “war on terror is coming to an end”, which has resulted in more than 360,000 deaths and millions displaced since 2011.
He said that Damascus, for its part, would continue “to fight this sacrifice until we clear Syrian territory” of all terrorist organizations and “all illegal foreign forces”.
The United States has more than 2,000 soldiers stationed in Syria, mainly responsible for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers stationed in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Mualim stated that conditions allowed them to return home and condemned “some Western countries” for spreading irrational fear and forcing them to leave their homes.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate the return of refugees”, he said.
“They are politicizing purely humanitarian issues”.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction assistance will be provided to Syria until Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement to end the war.
United Nations (UN) diplomats said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib had created an opportunity to move political negotiations forward.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented the Russian-backed Syrian army from launching large-scale attacks on provinces with a population of three million.
Muallim stressed, however, that the agreement had a “clear deadline” and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including Al-Qaida-related Nusrah militants who “will be eradicated”.
The United Nations Special Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that the new committee, composed of members of the Government and the opposition, will convene as soon as possible for the first time to draft the post-war constitution of Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualim listed the conditions under which the Syrian Government would join the Commission, saying that the Commission's work should be limited to “reviewing the provisions of the current Constitution” and warning against interference.
Why would Trump win a second term?
According to this logic, Trump will win a second term in 2020 unless, as many free viewers wish, impeachment and scandal pre-empt his presidential term.
Unquestionably, "This will be the most dramatic ending of the presidential term ever!"
So far, however, there seems to be no sign of aesthetic fatigue.
Since 2014, the coverage of CNN's prime time has more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million, while that of Microsoft National Radio and Television (MSNBC) has tripled, reaching 1.6 million.

Of course, unlike other shows on television, this storyline in Washington is likely to determine the future of Roe v. Wade, regardless of whether this family of immigrants can eventually reunify itself or whether the global economy can develop healthyly.
And the switchboard is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, when you realize that you've been watching the Panel for six consecutive hours to discuss the root causes of the "deep background" used by Bob Woodward in his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000-valued ostrich hair jacket (known in the Washington Post as "insolent thick clothing") and Stormy Daniels' sensational description of Trump, you'll find that it goes far beyond the knowledge of an ordinary citizen.
For my part, I will no longer look at Super Mario in the same way.

The bulk of the cash goes to the fiercest contest for the House of Representatives in the mid-term election of Congress.
It is not surprising that the redrawing of parliamentary constituencies has led to the contest between two current members of Parliament for the same seat in the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania, and that large cash streams continue to flow.
The recently redrawd suburb of Pittsburgh constituency became the target of Congressman Conor Lamb of the Democratic Party, who won another constituency in a special election last spring.
Ram faces a rival of the current Republican member Keith Rothfus, currently representing the original Pennsylvania 12th constituency, which overlaps with the new 17th constituency.
In January, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the old map of the Congress constituency was unconstitutional and unconstitutional.
The contest for the 17th new seat in the constituency raised the question of campaign finance between the main party finance department, the Democratic National Assembly Election Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Congress Committee (NRCC).
In March, in the special election of the 18th Pennsylvania electoral district, which was of great interest, rum won with a small advantage, after which he became a household name in Pennsylvania.
Previously, the seat had been seated by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won in this constituency with a 20 percentage point advantage.
Political experts created a little advantage for the Democratic Party.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but eventually chose to give up.
Diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had endorsed Beijing and were barely blocked by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and remained in Panama until partners expelled the Trump administration team.
State Department spokesman Heather Nauert, in a statement earlier this month, stated that State Department officials had decided to call back the heads of United States diplomatic missions in Insalva, the Dominican Republic and Panama about “no longer recognizing Taiwan's recent decision”.
But only El Salvador is being considered for punishment, because in 2017 it received about $140 million in assistance from the United States in narcotics control, development and economic support.
The proposed punitive measures, including the reduction of economic assistance and targeted visa restrictions, will have a heavy impact on the Central American countries and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings proceeded, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue similar gatherings held last year, which was seen as a major step forward to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior government officials had made it clear that they wanted the meeting to continue, which effectively ended the idea of punishing El Salvador.
The Vice President, Mike Pence, is currently planning to address the meeting scheduled for mid-October, which diplomats say is a signal of the importance that government authorities attach to the meeting.
Three United States envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without being stopped or punished by the latest hard-line information from Washington.
A White House spokesman at Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three United States officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss this internal review under the condition of anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the Government and reluctant to reveal his name, confirmed their story.
Study history
The next question to be addressed might be the report by Robert Mueller, Special Counsel, on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, which is now well documented in the public record.
Miller reportedly turned the investigation to whether Trump had colluded with Russia in campaigning against our general election.
If Congress were easy to control, Trump would face parliamentary accountability, and when he was ready to run again, he might end up with a jury composed of colleagues.
There are many hypotheses, and I mean it doesn't mean that Trump's failure is the inevitable result -- it doesn't mean that his failure in Europe is the inevitable result.
Everyone on both sides of the Atlantic can make choices that will determine the duration of the fight.

We failed and missed the best chance to avoid the years-long massacre that followed.
The process of history has always been centred on these turning points, and democracy ' s unstoppable pace of progress has either accelerated or slowed.
Today, Americans face several such turning points.
What are we going to do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Miller's investigation into fate?
Rosenstein has become an ant on a hot pot since last year's newspaper reported that Rosenstein proposed a covert recording of the president and suspected that Trump would not be suitable for the job.
Rosenstein says the Times is inaccurate.
"What will we do if the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) that has just been asked to investigate Brett Kavanaug is not comprehensive or fair - or if the Supreme Court does not heed credible allegations of sexual assault and fraudulent testimony and believes that it is true?
First of all, will we vote in the mid-term elections to support a congress for which Trump will be responsible?
If the attempt fails, the Democrats will enter a long winter.
But I firmly believe that we will not fail because I have learned the lesson of Prague.

Graham Dorrans of the Travellers is optimistic about the confrontation with the Vienna Rapids.
On Thursday, the vagrants met the Vienna Rapids in their main field, and after fighting the Spanish Villar earlier this month, they knew that the victory was waving to the Austrians, which would create a favourable position for them to get out of the European league G team.
The knee injury prevented a midfield player, Graham Dorrans, from attending the first appearance of the season before the 2-2 battle Pingviraire, but he believed that the vagrants could use it as a springboard to achieve better results.
"This is a great opportunity for us, because the Villariel team is strong and 31-year-old Graham Dorrans says so.
"Before the game begins, we believe that we will never come back, and eventually we will win a point.
Maybe we shouldn't have stopped there, but, finally, it's a draw.
They played better in the first half, and we did better in the second half.
Thursday will be another important European night.
I hope we get three points, but that's gonna be a tough game, because they made good results in the last game, but with so many people supporting us, I'm sure we can move on and get good results.
Last year was undoubtedly a very difficult year, and a lot of things happened after I got hurt and things changed at the club itself, but now we feel good.
The team was great. The players enjoyed the game and the training went well.
Let us hope that we can move forward beyond the last season and succeed.
Women can't sleep because they're worried about retirement savings.
Although all participants in the survey knew what kind of care they wished to receive, few had talked to their families about it.
In this National study, about half said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they'd talked about it with their children.
"People want their families to take care of themselves, but they didn't try to communicate with their families," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the NationalWide Life Insurance Business.
How to start, see below.
Communication with spouses and children: The family will not be ready to take care of you unless you inform your family in advance of your wishes.
Consult with your advisors and family about the details of where and how to get care, as these choices are important factors in determining costs.
Bring in the financial consultant: your consultant can also help you figure out how to pay for these costs.
Your financial options for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, which is a cash value mix of life insurance that can be used to pay these costs or self-insurance for your own wealth (if you have money).
Develop legal documents: avoid legal disputes at the gates.
Arrange a health care agent so that you can appoint a trustworthy person to supervise your medical care and ensure that a professional nurse can comply with your wishes when you are unable to communicate with him.
In addition, a financial authorization has been prepared.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure you get paid when you are disabled.
Don't forget the little detail: imagine that the elderly parents have urgent medical problems and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer the questions about drugs and allergies?
In the written plan, these details are detailed so that you can be ready.
"Not only does it affect financial issues, but who is the doctor?" Martin asked.
"What drugs?
Who will take care of the patient?
Set up these plans.”
The man was shot several times with an air rifle in Irflekom.
On his way home in the evening, a man was repeatedly shot with an air rifle.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was attacked in the Oxford Grove area of Irflekm, Devon County, and was shot in the chest, stomach and hands.
The time of the assault was around 02:30 in the British summer, when the police called it "abstentional murder".
The injured man did not see the faces of the attackers.
At present, men's injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called on witnesses to provide clues.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
According to Indonesian officials, at least 384 people have died as a result of the intense earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday in the city of Baru, Indonesia, and the death toll is still rising.
As a result of the disruption of communications, rescue officers were unable to obtain any information from Dungara district, which is located north of Baru, closer to the epicentre of this 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Baru, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
The following are some of the key facts about Baru and Dungara on Sulawesi Island:
Baru, the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, is at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
At the time of the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dungara is a county distributed along the coastline of more than 300 km (180 miles) northwest of Sulawesi.
The county is an administrative area below the provincial level, with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic pillars of Central Sulawesi Province, particularly the coastal region of Dungara.
The nickel industry also occupies an important position in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morovally County, across Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Baru and Dungara have been hit by tsunamis on many occasions over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dungula.
In 1996, another tsunami hit the west of Dungara, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Rim Volcano belt, where earthquakes are frequent, and is therefore subject to frequent seismic attacks.
The following are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries/areas, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh Province.
2005: In late March and early April, there were several strong earthquakes on the west coast of Sumatra Island.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island near the coast of Sumatra.
In 2006, a 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java Island, Indonesia's most populated island, and the tsunami caused by the earthquake hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: 7.6 magnitude earthquake near Baton City, the capital of West Sumatra province.
As a result, more than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-class earthquake struck one of the Meadwe Islands near Sumatra Island, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Bidijaya district in Aceh, causing severe damage, and the earthquake reminded people of the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004, thus also causing extreme panic among the population.
The earthquake did not cause the tsunami, but the collapsed buildings also caused more than 100 deaths.
2018: The Great Earthquake struck the tourist-like island of Longbe Island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.

The eldest son of Sarah Palin, former Governor of Alaska and vice-presidential candidate, Track Palin, was arrested on charges of beating others.
According to a report on domestic violence and resisting arrest released by the Alaskan Police on Saturday, Palin, 29 years old, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence in Wasila, Alaska.
According to police reports, Palin took her cell phone from a familiar woman who tried to report her alleged crime to the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is currently detained at the Mat-Su pre-trial facility and holds an unsecured bond worth $500.
According to the Internet, the court asked him to defend his case when he appeared in court on Saturday, and he declared himself “corrupt”.
Palin faces three A class misdemeanour charges, which means that he may be imprisoned for one year and fined $250,000.
At the same time, he was charged with a class B misdemeanour and could be sentenced to one day ' s imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
However, this is not the first time Palin has been charged with a criminal offence.
In December 2017, he was charged with beating his father, Todd Palin.
Sarah Palin, mother of Sarah Palin, reported her alleged assault to the police.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans' Court (Alaska's Veteran's Court).
In January 2016, a report on the crime of domestic violence accused Palin of suspected domestic violence and of causing the incident to get drunk and carry a gun.
Palin's girlfriend claims she hit her in the face with a fist.
Sarah Palin was condemned by veterans ' organizations in 2016 for claiming that his son ' s violence was related to his post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during his service in Iraq.
Earthquake tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
A Friday earthquake in Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, has killed at least 384 people.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, then triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been paralysed, and the death toll is expected to continue to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred in central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, the images of disaster situations are covered up.
At the time of the tsunami, hundreds of people were celebrating festivals on a beach in Palu city.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for suspects of terrorist attacks in New York City.
The U.S. federal prosecutor in New York wants to impose a death sentence on the New York suspect Sayfulo Saipov. The terrorist attack resulted in the death of eight people, a rare case that New York City has dealt with on such charges since 1953.
In October, it was alleged that 30-year-old Saipov was driving Home Depot to rent a truck on the west side of the highway on the lower town of Manhattan, entering the bicycle lane, crushing pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
According to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed by the Southern District of New York, in order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutor had to prove that Saipov had killed eight victims “intentionally” and had “intentionally” injured others.
According to this court document, both of these offences are punishable by death.
A few weeks after the attack, a United States federal grand jury announced that the suspect Saipov was charged with 22 counts, including 8 counts of murder, support for extortion (used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases) and violent destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutor said that the attack required “a great deal of planning and premeditation” and described the manner in which the Sepov attack was described as “offensive, cruel and despicable”.
In the letter of intent, it is stated that "Sefuro Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco ' s family and friends have suffered great harm and loss".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been 10 years since the last indictment of the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last execution in New York federal court was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of murder. The couple was executed for Soviet espionage two years ago during the cold war.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenberg couple were executed by electric chairs.
The court documents show that Sepov was Uzbek and did not show any self-restraint in the days or months following the attack.
According to the police, he indicated to the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Sepov stated to the authorities that he had been inspired to launch the attack after watching the ISIS video via his cell phone.
The police said he also asked to hang an ISIS flag in his ward.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
The federal public defender David Patton, representing Saipov, said that they were “particularly disappointed” with the prosecution's decision.
Barton said, "We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea of life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned."
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative Congressman says it's up to Nigel Farage to negotiate the Great Britain Deloitte.
In a protest at the Conservative Party meeting, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize today's People's Army".
The former leader of the Independence Party said that politicians must “fear the warmness of the voice of the `suspicious Euros'” and, as one of Teresa May's parliamentarians said, he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the back seat of the Conservative Party, said in Birmingham's march that if Mr. Farage were to be the Secretary of the Great Seastary, then the UK would be "developing by now".
However, the Jean-Operatoli party joined a separate protest against Teo, England, further highlighting the challenges faced by Ms. May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks.
The Prime Minister is trying to adjust the Chequirs Plan to put it on the right track, with de-Ou, Leu and the European Union caught in it.
Ally insisted that, despite the strong opposition, she would continue her efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels and force suspected Europeans and labour parties to choose between her plan and “disorder”.
Mr. Bone said to Leave Mens Leave at Solihull that he wanted to "dismiss from the Cix plan".
He said that Mr. Farage should accompany himself and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
He said, "If he were responsible, we'd be out of business by now."
The councilman from Wellingburg added, "I'll be strong enough for Britain to retreat, but we need to abandon the Cix plan."
In expressing his opposition to the EU, he said, "We don't need world war to make them obey.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
There is a suggestion that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote, and Mr. Bone rejected it: "This idea that the British changed their mind and wanted to stay is not true at all."
Andrea Jenkyns, the Conservative demagogue, also took part in the march, and she introduced the reporter, saying, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
“The people do not welcome the Cix plan, the opposition parties do not vote for it, and our parties and our activists do not welcome it. Remember, it was these people who cheered us on the street, and they were the first to pick us on stage.
Please give up Cheeks and listen to the voices of the people."
In a message to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Minister can only keep his position if he fulfils his promise”.
Mr. Farage informed the gathering politicians that if they wanted to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, then they had to feel the heat of the call.
He said, "Now, this is a matter of trust between us - the people and the political class."
"They're trying to betray the Trio, and we're here today to say to them, "We won't let you do it."
In a message to a passionate audience, he added, "I hope you can make the political class that is trying to betray the de-Europeans feel how hot the voice is."
“We will mobilize the British People's Army, which has contributed to our victory in Europe, and we will never rest until Britain becomes independent and self-governing.”
At the same time, Leopold marched in Birmingham, after which a two-hour rally was held in the centre of the city.
Following the formation of this team this weekend, several activists waved the flag of "The Conservative Party Against De-Coom".
At the opening of the meeting, labour colleague Lord Adonis mocked the party applications of the Conservative Party for security problems.
He added: "That's what these people tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology to achieve Canada ++, no friction borders, free trade without borders in Ireland.
"This is a complete farce.
There was no such thing as Teo, he added.
Warren's plan is to give serious consideration to running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, he would "think seriously" about running for the presidency.
According to the Boston Globe, the senator of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about his intentions for the future in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren regularly criticized President Donald Trump, who is currently running for the November election and who is competing with Republican Congressman Geoff Diehl, who served as co-chair of President Trump ' s Massachusetts campaign team in 2016.
She has been the focus of speculation about the possible replacement of Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Hollyok City was her 36th meeting in the form of town hall meetings since Trump took office.
One participant asked her whether she intended to run for the presidency.
Warren replied, "It's time for women to march into Washington to repair the shattered government, and one of them is a woman at the top."
Arrest of the suspect who shot him at Louisiana State University (LSU) Sims.
Saturday, the Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced that the suspect who shot and killed the Luianna State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims had been arrested on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced at a press conference held at 11 a.m. East Time that a 20-year-old suspect, Dyteon Simpson, had been arrested.
The police station released a shooting video on Friday, asking the public to help identify the men who appeared in the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot dead on Friday morning near Southern University.
According to 247Sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul revealed to the media on Saturday that "Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died."
Wade came forward to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
In the face of interrogation, Simpson admitted to being on the scene and holding a weapon, and admitted to shooting and killing Wade Sims.
It was no accident that Simpson was arrested and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
The young boy Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, was 6 feet 6 inches tall, participated in 32 games in the last season, received 10 firsts, each on average 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points, 2.9 basketballs.
Russian grand prix: Lewis Hamilton won Sebastian Vitel with the help of the convoy's command.
From the moment Valtteri Bottas defeated Lewis Hamilton last Saturday and became eligible to compete, it became clear that Mercedes's "the motorcade directive will play a great role in the race."
From the point of departure, Potas took the lead all the way, almost pitted Hamilton during the first two rounds of defence, and enticed Vitel to attack his teammates.
Vitel first entered the maintenance station and Hamilton ran to the end of the convoy, which was supposed to determine the outcome.
After a round, Mercedes entered the station and returned to the runway after falling behind Weitel. After a fight, and in order to avoid staying silent after the double defense of the third curve, the Ferrari driver (Weitel) reluctantly gave up the tunnel and Hamilton took the lead.
Max Verstappen, the 21st birthday of the day, ran in the back row of the track and, at the end of the first circle, ran to the 7th position.
During most of the race, he moved at full speed and tried to finish the race quickly. More than Kimi Raikkonen, he ran to the 4th position.
He finally entered the maintenance station in the 44th circle, failed to raise the speed in the remaining 8 circles, and finally Leconin won fourth.
Hamilton said, "It's been a tough day, because Watley's performance throughout the weekend was remarkable, and he gave me his place with a gentle hand.
The first and second success of the convoy was excellent.”
That's not a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally held on Saturday because she insisted that she had not leaked a letter about Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In a speech at a rally in West Virginia, President Trump did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee. Instead, he commented that what was happening in the Senate was a good proof of how "deficient, dirty, hypocritical people are".
Trump said, "When you see anger, when you see angry, mean, dirty, hypocritical people, one thing can happen, and the good thing is happening in the Senate the last few days."
"When you learned about the release and leak, they said, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do this."
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you leak the news?
Remember her answer... did you leak the file-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, please wait.
Is that what we leaked? No, it's not us. He added that the senator remembered.
In July, Vanstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Cavanaugh, which was leaked in early September, but Vanstan denied that her office had led to the leak.
According to the Congressional Hill newspaper, Vanstein revealed to the committee that “I did not conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, nor did I reveal what happened to her”.
"She asked me to keep my letters confidential, and I kept them confidential as she asked."
But her denial did not seem to have been accepted by the president, who commented at the Saturday night rally: "Listen, body language is really bad.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate who had been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, saying that the Democratic Party was using the accusation for their own ends.
According to Mediaite, the President said, "They will take back power by whatever means necessary.
You see the mean, dirty methods, they don't care who hurts or who gets power and control.”

Air traffic controllers used their lives to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board managed to escape the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia who lost his life to ensure the safe departure of an aircraft carrying hundreds of people was later recognized as a hero.
On Friday, the Great Earthquake in Sulawesi caused a tsunami that killed more than 800 people and left many missing.
A strong aftershock continued to engulf the area, and many people were trapped in ruins in the city of Baru.
However, despite the fact that colleagues are running for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung has not left his post and remains at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in a rocky control tower.
He insisted on remaining in place to ensure that flight 6321 Bazar, which was already on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
When he realized that the control tower had started collapsing, he jumped off the tower.
Then died in the hospital.
According to ABC News in Australia, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that Agon's decision saved hundreds of lives.
We have prepared a helicopter to take off from Bali Barracks in Kalimantan and take Agon to a major hospital in other cities for treatment.
Unfortunately, however, Agon left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Baru.
"We're very sad to hear this news," Sirait added.
At the same time, the Indonesian National Disaster Reduction Agency indicated that roads to towns such as Dungara, Sigi and Boutong were blocked and government authorities feared that the death toll might reach thousands.
The agency spokesman, Sutopol Purwo Nugroho, said, "We believe that the death toll is still rising, because many bodies are still buried under the rubble and many have not yet been found."
A wave of up to six metres destroyed Baru, who was due to hold a mass funeral on Saturday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to deliver relief supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Lisa Kusuma, told Sky News reporter: "The ambulance delivers the body every minute.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
The small nearby market was looted.”
Jan Gelfand, President of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything it can to help survivors, but we don't know what search and rescuers will find.
Although this is already a tragedy, the situation may be worse”.
According to CNN, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Baru on Sunday and spoke to the Indonesian army: "I command you to complete all evacuation-related tasks day and night.
Are you ready?
The Indonesian island of Longming was hit by an earthquake earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini claims that a man disappeared after the plane crashed into the lagoon.
A New Guinea Airlines flight crashed into the atoll lake of Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean. The airline stated earlier that 47 passengers and crew members on board had been safely evacuated from the plane that sank into the bottom of the lake and now claimed that a man had disappeared.
New Guinea Airlines stated at its launch on Saturday afternoon that it could not explain the disappearance of male passengers.
The airline indicated that it was working with local governments, hospitals and investigators to locate missing men.
The airline did not immediately release identity information on the passenger ' s age, nationality, etc.
When the plane landed at Chuuk Island airport, it hit the lake, then the local ship was involved in the rescue and the other passengers and crew were rescued.
On Friday, the official presentation stated that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still receiving treatment at the hospital and that all passengers were in a stable state.
The cause of the accident and the order in which it took place are not clear.
Both the airline and the United States Navy indicated that the aircraft had strayed from the runway and landed in the lagoon.
According to some witnesses, the plane ran out of the runway.
According to the American passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane flew very low.
Jaynes said, "It's nice to fly low."
Jaynes reported that after the plane sank, the water inside the plane was deep enough to reach the emergency exit.
He explained that the crew members were scared and shouted and suffered minor injuries to their heads.
According to the United States Navy, the sailors in the vicinity who were renovating the wharf were involved in the rescue, driving the inflatable boat and bringing the waterfallers to the shore, then the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) deep in the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have lost their lives in a plane crash registered by Papua New Guinea National Airlines in the last two decades, but no passenger deaths have been recorded by New Guinea Airlines.
The analyst set out a schedule for women to be burned alive at night.
The prosecution reopened the trial on Saturday on charges of burning female suspects in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, the United States Department of Justice analyst, was an expert expert in intelligence analysis and gave testimony for hours.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis together with the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
According to Clarion Ledger, Loret reported that he had received data on the location of several mobile phones, which showed that Tris was with Chance the night he died, which contradicts what Tris said before.
Tris said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and the data showed that Tris' cell phone was in the same position as Chambers' cell phone, so the police went to Sanford to get information.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
The prosecutor asked Sanford whether Tris said he was in Sanford's truck on the night of the murder. Sanford said Tris was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another paradox is that Tris said they had known him for about two weeks when he died.
And cell phone records show that they just met a week ago.
Lorett said that at some point after the death of Chambers, Tries deleted the text message, phone and contact information of Chambers in his cell phone.
Hale said, "He wiped her out of life and wiped her clean."
The accused is scheduled to start closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge stated that it was hoped that the trial would be sent to the jury later that day.

A black man again?
After receiving a racist text message, he was fired, and a nanny in New York took the employer and his wife to court.
A nannie in New York was fired after misaccepting a text message sent to her mother complaining that she was a "black" and in one case, the couple was brought to court and called it "clan discrimination".
The couple refused to acknowledge racial discrimination and called the case “extortion”.
In 2016, the mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, expressed disappointment after the child care provider Giselle Maurice had found out that the other was black.
"No, he's black again," written in a text message to his husband, Flaxman.
However, text messages were sent wrongly twice to Maurice.
According to the New York Post, Mrs. Fraxman was dismissed after she became aware of the disillusionment on the grounds that the African American nanny who was about to leave was not doing well and she was waiting for a Filipino.
Mrs. Flaxman paid Maurice a day's salary and then called for an ecstatic car to drive her home.
The day before, Morris was suing the couple and asked them to pay damages up to $350 a day for the six months of temporary work promised to the employer's parents at the time of the initial employment, even though there was no contract to rely on.
On Friday, Maurice told the New York Post reporter, "I want to tell them that you won't," adding, "I know this is racial discrimination."
The couple rebutted the complaint that they were not racially discriminated, saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was a perfectly reasonable act, and that they feared that they could not believe her after being offended.
"My wife had no intention of sending her some information.
She's not racist.
We didn't have racial discrimination, and the husband, Joel Plasco, told the New York Post reporter.
"But will you trust yourself to hand over the child to someone you've offended, even by accident?
The child you just gave birth to?
Come on, probably nobody."
Plasco referred to the case as “extortion”, indicating that her wife had given birth two months ago and was currently “in a very difficult situation”.
"Will you hire someone like that?
That's not wise, this investment banker adds.
Although the case is still pending, the Court of Public Opinion has quickly begun to denounce the behaviour and logic of the couple in social media.
According to the latest letter, Paddington Bear publisher fears readers won't accept a talking bear.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the readers, said in his letter: "Before the book was published, it was hard for people to figure out the feelings of the readers who read it for the first time.
Now the Paddington bear has made a huge success. It's really funny."
Speaking of her father, she said that her father had been a photographer for the BBC and had been inspired by a toy bear to write this child's book, and that he had always been hopeful about his repeatedly rejected work, adding that her father had died last year and that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was called "the bitter half".
Speaking of the Paddington Bear, she said that it was "a very important member of our family", and she said that her father was proud of his ultimate success.
"Father is a quiet man who never brags himself," she said.
"But because the Paddington bear was too real for him, just like your child's achievement: you're proud of them, even though it wasn't yours.
I think that's how he sees the success of the Paddington bear.
Although it was the result of his creativity and imagination, he always attributed success to the Paddington bear itself.
My daughter is dying. I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was sent urgently to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, and eventually the doctors failed to save her life.
"Nad called as usual, said it was bad, and she didn't think it would happen," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying my daughter had a few minutes left, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
I did.
I said, "Dear Zasy, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll always be with you.
The medicine that the doctor gave her to maintain her heart rate gradually lapsed.
She died early, and it's over.
Knowing that all this has happened, I can only sit there and wait.
I can't growl, scream or cry because my family and friends are all around me.
I have to stay calm."
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was eventually immersed in the pain of her widowed daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers and seemed calmly to forget what she was going through.
"Nobody knows it," she said.
"I bow my head and my tears will not stop the downward flow.
I know it's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I had a strong sympathy for Nad.
He needs my understanding and love.
I know how much he loves his daughter."
Sad women post cards to persuade those who have light thoughts to change their minds.
The two women who lost their loved ones tried to stop others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on the Welsh Bridge with motivational text and telephone numbers to facilitate support for people in need.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler died of depression when she was 13 years old and committed suicide when she was 18.
"I don't want another parent to experience the pain I suffer every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis lives at Lydney's house, 45 this year, and her son is a future cook with an infectious smile on her face.
"We all know he's a laughing man.
People always say that his smile makes everyone happy.”
But he quit his job and soon died, and he went to "a particularly dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother was just 11 years old, and he discovered that Tyler had ended his life.
Davis said, "I've been worried that his suicide will have a side reaction."
So Davis made the card, "I want people to know that someone is willing to help you and listen to your talk, even if we're friends."
Don't be silent, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys has been a friend of Mrs. Davies's for years, and shortly after her mother died, her husband left herself, and now she has 15 years of sight.
She introduced it and said, "He never told us that he felt depressed or depressed or lonely or anything.
Just a few days before Christmas, we noticed that he wasn't feeling right.
On Christmas Day, the children opened their gifts, and he didn't have any eye contact or anything, when his emotions fell to the bottom.”
She said that the death of her husband had inflicted enormous trauma on them, but they had to go on living: "When he died, the sky collapsed in the family.
All of us are grieving.
But we still have to live and fight."

FBI investigation, Brett Kavanaugh.
"I think if we can really get what he wants -- an investigation that is limited in time and scope -- then maybe we can save a little bit of unity," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would take this opportunity to "start breaking down" deep-seated party deadlock.
Why doesn't Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is entirely due to timing.
With only five weeks left for the mid-term elections on November 6, if, as we expected, the Republicans perform poorly, their efforts to try to put forward candidates for the United States Supreme Court will be seriously undermined.
George W. Bush keeps calling the senators, trying to lobby them to support Cavanaugh, because Cavanaugh used to work for the Bush administration at the White House and met his wife, Bush's private secretary Ashley, through Bush.
What happens when the FBI reports?
The Senate will vote and currently has 51 Republican seats and 49 Democratic seats.
It is not clear whether Cavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate to break the tie with Vice President Mike Pence, thereby confirming the nomination of the Supreme Court candidate.
The number of defectors from North Korea under Kim Jong-un's regime has fallen.
A Korean legislator said that since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, the number of Koreans defecting to Korea has declined.
Park Byyong-seug quoted data from the Ministry of Korean Unity that a total of 1,127 Koreans defected to Korea last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the key reason for the decrease in defection was the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in fees charged by human smuggling groups.
North Korea did not publicly comment.
The vast majority of Koreans who defected to South Korea eventually acquired Korean citizenship.
Korea indicated that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 Koreans have illegally crossed the border to South Korea.
Most defectors fled through China to North Korea because the border between North Korea and China is the longest and easier to cross than the heavily defended demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, so they are often forcibly repatriated.
In recent months, relations between North Korea and South Korea have improved significantly, although technically they are still in a state of war.
Early this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to open a dialogue on the stalled denuclearization negotiations.
The improvement in relations between the two countries benefited from the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, during which both sides generally agreed to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the Foreign Minister of Korea, Lee Yong-ho, accused that no progress had been made since the end of the meeting, as the United States was still imposing sanctions.
"If the United States is not trustworthy, then we will not be able to ensure that our national security is guaranteed, so we will never be able to unilaterally disarm our nuclear weapons", as Lee Yong-ho said in his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh “hysteria” an inappropriate position for a Supreme Court judge.
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the minority party in the House of Representatives, stated that the nominee of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was “hysteric” and that he was not fit to serve as a Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi was interviewed at the Texas Forum (Texas Tribune Festival) in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't help but think that if a woman behaves like this, they'll use 'hysteria' to describe it," said Pelosi, in response to the testimony given by Cavanaugh in the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh's mood went out of control and complained of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed that he had not sexually abused him when he was young.
In his opening statement, Cavanaugh lost consciousness and, in discussing his family and high school life, on several occasions he almost shouted and couldn't even speak.
He also unequivocally condemned the Partido Democrats present at the meeting, saying that the accusation was a “freaking union attack” organized by the Liberal Party because the Liberal Party resented the defeat of Hilary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi claims that she believes that Cavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot qualify for the Supreme Court because it shows that he is biased against Democrats.
She said, "I think his testimony and his attitude towards Clinton and the Democrats suggest that he is not qualified enough."
Pelosi objected when asked whether the Democratic Party would impeach Cavanaugh if it was finally proved guilty of the crime and if it obtained a majority of seats in the House of Representatives.
Pelosi said, "Well, if what he said to Congress or to the FBI is not true, then he is not only unfit to serve in the Supreme Court, he is not worthy to serve in the court that is now in office."
Cavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington DC Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he feared that Cavanaugh might make a negative ruling on the "Affordable Care Act" or "Roe v. Wade" because he was a conservative magistrate.
In confirming the hearing, Cavanaugh avoided the question whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Now, it's not the right time for a hysterical, biased person to come to the court, and we'd like to say, "Isn't that good?" Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise their power.
It was a slanderous act of justice, and the rage of months and years continued to spread, and she would not be able to get rid of it unless she cried.
Steinem said to me 45 years later, "We cry when we're angry."
"I think it's normal. What do you think?"
She went on to say, "A lady has given me great help, and she's the head of a company, and she says she cries when she's angry, but she finds a trick: when she starts crying, she talks to her interlocutors," and you'll know I'm upset because I cried.
I'm angry."
Then she goes on to.
I think it's amazing."
The reason we use tears to express our anger is partly because we fundamentally misunderstand tears.
One of the most impressive things was that in one of my early years' jobs, which was a male-dominated company, I cried once because of indescribable anger, and then I was caught in the back neck by an old woman (a cold manager I've been afraid of for her) who dragged me into the staircase.
She warned me, "Don't ever let them see you cry."
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad and happy because they beat you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a female member of the National Assembly of the Colorado Democratic Party, joined Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart withdrew from the campaign for involvement in an affair on board a ship called “Monkey Business Dinner Boat”, Schröder was frustrated that he should personally practice the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a deliberate decision," she laughed and said to me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates running, and they did not need another candidate so much.
Someone called it "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
She vowed not to run until $2 million had been raised, as Schroeder was lagging behind in raising funds since she was in the late stages of the campaign.
There is no doubt that this is a battle to be defeated.
She found that some supporters donated $1,000 to male campaigners, but gave her $250.
"Do they think I need a discount?" Schroeder suspects.
When she made a speech declaring that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was beset by complex emotions - gratitude to her supporters; disappointment with the system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates; and anger at gender discrimination - she began to choke.
Schroder recalled the media reaction to her and said, "You should think I'm having a breakdown."
"You might think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they carve on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
What benefits will the Chinese-American trade war bring to Beijing?
Professionals have said that the fire from the US-China trade war is huge and that, although the war has only just begun, the differences between the two countries may be more favourable for Beijing in the long run.
Early this year, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, warned for the first time that taxes on China ' s major export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium, would be imposed.
This week's trade battle has seen a serious escalation, and the new tariff will tax half of China's imports to the United States, affecting goods worth $200 billion (150 billion euros).
The Beijing side each time retaliated in the same way, most recently raising tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion by 5% to 10%.
China has promised to confront the United States to the end, and the second largest economy in the world will never retreat in the short term.
Getting Washington to make concessions means there is a need to meet their demands, but an open submission to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, professionals have said that if Beijing is able to play this hand, the pressure of the US trade war may reduce the interdependence of the two economies and bring long-term positive support to China.
A fellow researcher in Asia, Abigail Grace, from the think tank Center for New American Security, said, "If the Washington or Beijing side makes rapid political decisions, it could lead to economic disruption in both countries, which is actually more dangerous than the previously recognized sit-in situation."
The Foreign Minister said Syria was "ready" to welcome the refugees back.
Syria stated that it was ready to return refugees voluntarily and appealed to all sectors to help them rebuild their homes, which had suffered more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said at the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in Syria were improving.
“As a result of the progress made in the fight against terrorism, it is now more stable and safer on the ground”, he said.
The Syrian Government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists and bring them back to normal.
At present, all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees are ready. Refugees fleeing the country are forced to leave their homes because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at daily life and livelihood.
According to United Nations estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people remaining in Syria are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance from other countries to rebuild its devastated homeland.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or help to back up rebel-acting countries.
The European team won the Paris Red Cup.
In the 2018 Le Golf National, outside of Paris, the European team defeated the American team with 16.5 to 10.5 final results.
The United States has now lost six consecutive profits on European soil and has not won the Leed Cup in Europe since 1993.
The team leader of the Danish team, Thomas Bjorn, took the first 14.5 points needed to defeat America, and Europe regained the title.
Phil Mickelson, the American football star, struggled in most of the games. After the 16th hole, the third hit, he confessed directly to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was one of the four players who scored 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979 in its current form.
The American player Jordan Spieth was defeated by the lowest-ranked European player in Denmark, Thorbjorn Olesen, by five to four.
The world's number one player, Dustin Johnson, is expected to participate in his last Leed Cup game with two to one behind Ian Poulter in England.
Sergio García of Spain participated in the eight Leed cups, a senior general who became the most successful European in history, with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I really can't help it.
It's too hard this year.
Thank you so much for choosing me, believe me.
I'm glad to have the trophy back.
It's the honor of our entire team, and I'm glad to be able to do my part.
He passed the torch on to his compatriot, John Ram, who beat the U.S. Tiger Woods with his two-to-one achievement in Sunday's single game.
"I've watched Tiger Woods play since I was a kid, and I'm very proud to beat him," Ram said 23 years old.
Woods lost four competitions in France, with 13-21-3 performances in this game, setting the lowest record of the Leeds Cup.
It's kind of strange for the greatest player in history, because he won 14 important competitions after Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality balls throughout the game, the United States team was less optimistic throughout the week.
Captain Jim Furyk, after his team showed disappointment, said, "I'm proud of everyone, and they're all fighting hard.
For some time this morning, we put a lot of pressure on Europe.
We're done.
Pay tribute to Thomas.
He's pretty good as a captain.
Twelve players fought very well.
We'll regroup, I'll join the American PGA and Ryder Cup Committees, and we'll move on.
I love this 12 men and I'm honored to be their captain.
They must be saluted.
We've been defeated.”

According to the British media, the U.S. Vice-Minister of Naval Operations, General William Moran, said that even as the U.S. Navy is reviving its strength to deal with the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, the U.S. continues to focus on the Asia Pacific region - the Pentagon extends the area to include Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific.
The United Kingdom ' s Jane ' s Defense Weekly website reported on September 24 that the United States listed China and Russia as strategic competitors in its new defence strategy announced at the beginning of the year.
Since then, the United States Navy has resumed its second fleet in order to confront Russian activities more directly.
According to reports, these moves raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts who feared that the US Navy might be far away from the “Asia Pacific Rebalancing” strategy that marked the Obama administration.
But Admiral Moran said that the focus of the United States Navy remained the Western Pacific Ocean.
On January 24, 2018, at a round-table discussion hosted by the National Asian Research Bureau in Washington, D.C., entitled "Addressing the challenges of the high seas", he said, "There has been no major change for us."
Moran said, "The focus is still rebalancing, shifting focus or whatever you want to describe it."
He acknowledged, however, that the United States was close to Europe.
He said, "We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do."
Although Moran pointed out that the overall policy regarding Russia was within the purview of the US Secretary of Defense, he warned: “Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has shown that if we clash with them, they will be very tough.”
Admiral Moran said that, as part of America’s renewed campaign against Russia, China and other competitors, the US Navy was dynamically deploying its forces into a “new mode of operation”, which would help surprise opponents about where American carriers or other assets would be deployed at any given time or place.
He said, "We, the Navy and the Marines, support it -- - the concept of unpredictability of operations, don't appear in the same place again and again, almost like the hairline -- -- this is how we do it."
It was reported that the first attempt at this new approach was made by the Harry Truman carrier combat group, whose early deployment included working visits to ports and patrolling areas normally only through.
Moran said that the United States Navy was currently working to ensure that allies knew that these warships would continue to patrol in traditional areas and were also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment procedures.
Lieutenant General Michael Nunan, Commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also spoke at the event, saying that Australian troops could work seamlessly with American carriers.
He said that the situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase another nine frigates equipped with the Zeus Shield operational system.
Since October 5, a number of airlines have raised or restored fuel surcharges.
Yesterday, airlines such as Xiang Peng Air and Okai Air announced that from October 5, 2018 (the date of the ticket), each passenger on the domestic route would charge a 20-dollar fuel surcharge for fuel less than 800 km, and each passenger on the more than 800 km surcharge for fuel.
The company Xiang Poon Aviation, Okai Aviation etc. announced that the rate of surcharge for fuel on domestic routes below 800 km (including) has risen from 10 yuan/person to 20 yuan/person, and the rate of surcharge for fuel on domestic routes over 800 km has risen from 10 yuan/person to 30 yuan/person per passenger since 5 October 2018 (the date of the ticket).
All children, military and police disabilities are 10 yuan/persons; babies continue to be exempted.
According to the person responsible for the airline ticket, the airline had indicated in its notification that the fuel surcharge was collected on the date of the original ticket, and the fuel surcharge would not be refunded in exchange for the ticket.
This means that domestic airline tickets issued before 5 October do not need to be supplemented by fuel surcharges according to new standards if they are to be changed after 5 October.
Since 5 June 2018, a number of airlines, such as Air China, East China, Naval China, Shanghai Aviation, Spring and Fall Aviation, Shenzhen Aviation, Western Aviation and Okai Aviation, have resumed charging fuel surcharges on domestic routes, which have been cancelled for three years, to a standard of $10 per person.
On this occasion, Xiang Peng Aviation and Okai Aviation were the first to announce an upward adjustment of the fuel surcharge, and as soon as the press release was issued, they had not heard from the four major airlines in the country that announced follow-up adjustments.
It is also understood that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department provides that airlines will be free to decide whether to charge a fuel surcharge from November onwards.
On September 27, the earliest announcement was that the fuel surcharge would be recharged as of November 2.
The air travel website shows that all air tickets issued or reissued on or after November 2 by Tai Tai and Hong Kong Hong Kong Dragon will include fuel surcharges, long-distance flights to Hong Kong and the Southwest Pacific, North America, Europe, Middle East and India, and to Africa, fuel surcharges amount to $652 and short-distance flights charge $146.
The cost applies to all types of tickets, is calculated for each segment of the voyage and includes quotations for air tickets from all direct distribution channels in Thailand.

This year marks the fortieth anniversary of China ' s reform and opening up. As the world ' s largest developing country, we are ready to achieve common development with all countries in further expansion of the opening.
In the context of the rise of protectionism and unilateralism, we would like to work with all parties to continue to consolidate and strengthen our partnership based on the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, to promote a strategy of peer-to-peer development, to promote “one-way” building cooperation based on the principle of shared ownership, to work together to defend multilateralism and free trade, to build an open world economy, and to give new impetus to the stable and balanced development of the world economy.
The Minister of State and Institutions in China warmly congratulated the People ' s Republic of China on its 69th anniversary, conveyed the greetings of the leaders of their respective countries and institutions to China ' s leaders and people, and said that China had achieved great development achievements, believing that further reforms and expansion of openness in the future would bring more development opportunities to the world.
We are ready to play an active role in promoting friendly cooperation and cooperation between our respective countries and regions and China, and better achieve mutual benefit and win.
Subsequently, at the invitation of Li Keqiang, the Ambassador of various countries and agencies in China attended the reception of the National Day.
The State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi attended the event.
On Friday, Ito Trung, Japan, recognized $1.3 billion in impairment losses on investment in China's China Shin shares, and its largest business investment transaction was written off because of the trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man walked past the headquarters of the Society.
According to Maru Hong, the US grain sector under the banner of the trade war has suspended its financial transactions in agriculture.
Some Japanese manufacturers of heavy equipment, telecommunications companies, etc., have previously warned about the impact of China-United States trade friction when they announced their latest performance, and these Japanese trading firms have joined the ranks today.
The United States and China imposed customs duties on each other ' s hundreds of billions of dollars of commodities, and US President Trump threatened to extend the tax to more than $500 billion of Chinese and US goods if the dispute could not be resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Director of Commerce and Finance of Ito, said that the impact of the trade dispute on China ' s economy might be even greater next year.
Ito Trung and the Thai Bing Group invested $10 billion in Nakatsu in 2015 and won 20 per cent of their shareholdings.
Hachimura claims that Ito Trunchin's shareholding in this sector contributed $143.3 billion ($1.3 billion) in lost yen because it believed that the Chinese share price would not return in the near future.
Ito Trung Commercial maintained the forecast of profits for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2019 at 500 billion yen.
China imposed a 25 per cent import tariff on American soybeans in July to counter China's initiative in trade friction.
"Our grain business has been hit by trade friction in the US and China," Yanhong Yao said.
He said that Gao Hong had stopped the financial transactions of his own account since September.
Gau Hung spokesman Pat Burke pointed out in his statement on Friday that the company’s move was “restricted in accordance with internal policies and due to lack of market opportunities”.
He also said that the suspension of financial transactions would not result in fewer jobs.
Maru Hong maintains an annual profit estimate of 230 billion yen, and is supported by pulp and paper production and power generation operations.
On Thursday, Residents and Friends Business announced a 16% increase in profitability between April and September, emphasizing that "the US-China trade problem has led to uncertain prospects."
Mitsubishi Commercial Friday raised the annual profit forecast up to record levels as a result of increased coal production and price increases in commodities such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Commercial has also announced a new business plan, which aims to increase the profitability of the fiscal year up to 31 March 2022 from the 640 billion yen estimated this year to 900 billion yen ($7.98 billion).
On November 5, China and New Network reported that the mid-term election vote in the United States is in the countdown.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic rivals actively “urged votes” with their core constituents.
Both parties pointed out that voter turnout would be the key to shaping the election.
It was reported that in 48 hours before the vote in the United States, Trump was busy attending a campaign for Republican candidates, while former President Barack Obama went to Indiana to stand up for an impending Democratic Federal Senate candidate, Joe Donnelly, and shouted to the crowd the final demands before the election.
On November 4, Trump went to Megon, Georgia, to stand for Republican governor candidate Brian Kemp, and said, "Thurday you must come to the polling station, you must vote."
"The comparison of this election cannot be made clearer."
Voter political enthusiasm has risen to a rare peak, and early voting in some states has gone far beyond normal.
The President of the United States faced the first mid-term elections, and the number of seats in Congress in his party tended to decrease.
According to the Washington Post and the new poll announced by the American Broadcasting Corporation News Network (ABC News) on 4th, while the Democratic Party's federal House of Representatives continues to have an advantage, Republicans can benefit from economic assessment and from Trump's strict interest in border security.
According to the polls, registered voters prefer the Democratic House of Representatives candidates more than Republicans, with 50% versus 43%, but there is still a decline from the 14 percentage points ahead in August.
Another poll by the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) and Wall Street Journal also showed that Democrats still outrank Republicans by 7 percentage points.
It is known that Obama said to the crowd at Senator Donnelly's campaign: "When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, they will have bad consequences.
Democracy cannot work when people can only lie to themselves."
"The only way to stop these Republican behaviors now is you and your vote."
The Democrats face the most difficult elections in the Senate for decades, and the Republicans now hold more than half of the 51 seats.
But the vote in the House of Representatives was favourable, and the Democratic Party needed to win 23 more seats to take control of the House of Representatives, which had 435 seats.
According to the analysts of FiveThirtyEight.com, the chances of Democrats winning the House of Representatives are as high as 85%.
Wang Yang attended and spoke at an important intellectual theory seminar convened by the General Secretary of Xi Jinping to strengthen and improve the work of the Association.
Xi Jinping, General Secretary, Xi Jinping, held an important theoretical seminar on strengthening and improving the work of the People ' s Civil Affairs Association in Kyoto from 29 to 30 June.
Wangyang, Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party and Chairman of the National Political Consultative Council, attended the meeting and spoke.
He stressed that the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping ' s important ideas for strengthening and improving the work of the Human Civil Affairs Association made it clear in depth the role of the Human Civil Affairs Association, its objectives, mission of responsibility and practical requirements, and that science answered a number of important questions of direction, overall nature, strategic nature, and was a powerful intellectual weapon guiding the work of the Human Civil Affairs Association of the New Age.
It is important to learn carefully to implement this important idea, to grasp its significance, to enrich its content and spiritual essence, to learn to do what is practical and practical, to promote the quality of the work of the Political Consultative Council through theoretical learning and intellectual weapons, and to take up the new mission of the New Era Civil Affairs Association.
From 29 to 30 September, the National Political Consultative Conference held an important intellectual theory seminar in Beijing for General Secretary Xi Jinping on strengthening and improving the work of the People ' s Civil Affairs Association.
Wangyang pointed out that since the Party's Eighteenth Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping has proposed a new set of ideas and ideas for strengthening and improving the work of the People's Civil Affairs Association. For the first time, the People's Civil Affairs Association has been proposed as an important channel and specialized consultative body for socialist consultative democracy. It is an important component of the national governance system. It is an institutional arrangement with Chinese characteristics. It is the first time that the characteristics and advantages of the new party system have been clarified. It emphasizes the correct handling of the relations of coherence and diversity. It is
Wangyang stressed that PACs at all levels should use theoretical studies as an opportunity to further identify weaknesses and shortcomings in the work of PACs and work hard to strengthen and improve and seek breakthroughs.
The building of the PAC System Party needs to be fully strengthened to ensure that the deployment of the Party ' s central decision-making is carried forward into the work of the PCC.
To strengthen intellectual and political leadership, improve the system, procedures and mechanisms for political discourse and consensus-building, “two-way energy”, and translate intellectual and political leadership into all aspects and processes of performance.
It is important to focus on the Centre ' s mission to discharge its duties and responsibilities, to be more obedient to the Service Party and to the National Council, to improve the quality of its political and political discourse, and to enhance its effectiveness in carrying out its functions.
To strengthen the PAC ' s self-building, catch up with the educational training of commissioners and cadres, play the basic role of the ad hoc committee, and strengthen the PAC ' s performance of its functions.
There is a need to strengthen the guidance of the work of the local PACs, to direct, demonstrate and solve problems, and to raise the overall level of the work of the PCCs.
In order to further study and implement the spirit of Xi Jinping Xinping’s socialist ideas and Party’s 19th speciality in the new era of China, the National System of Political Consultative Associations began in May with the Xi Jinping General Secretary’s important intellectual study and discussion activities to strengthen and improve the work of the Human Civil Affairs Association, convened eight regional symposia and seven expert scholars’ encounters, identified 18 priority topics and six basic theoretical topics. There were 79.38 million members of the Political Consultative Committee at all levels, and 279,000 officials of the organs took part in studies and
In the light of the current wave of popular entrepreneurship and innovation, the People's Network Beijing on November 5, a growing number of technology companies began to focus on patent R & D and related conservation efforts, dig deep into the potential value of patents and occupy market dominance.
Similarly, there are a number of technology enterprises that have experienced significant abuses in patent technology licensing, patent technology use, etc.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, Ho Changhong and Libin from Guangdong Province, the developer of the APP, Beijing Little Orange Technology Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Little Orange Technology), the operator Drilling Technology Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the drop-off), and the seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) v. Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court on the grounds of patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately cease manufacturing, selling, promising to sell and using the plaintiff ' s patent.
On October 30, 2018, the Chinese network of referee papers published the "Civil decision of first instance in disputes over patent infringement of inventions, such as Tang Wei, Ho Changhong and Beijing Little Orange Technology Ltd." and revealed the details of some of the cases in which APP was sued for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs argued that patent owners and inventors of the patent “carpooling service systems and methods based on mobile terminals” and that the entire operation of the “roll-off” APP application was matched by the technical program of patent protection involved, constituting patent infringement.
However, at the time of the Court's decision, little orange technology argued that the Guangdong Pacific was not a proper defendant, that it only provided free downloads on the Internet of the APP “drop-out” involved, that the patent method was not applied, that there was no direct or indirect violation, and that it should not be listed as the defendant in this case.
Secondly, the violations in this case were not committed in Guangdong.
In accordance with the law, the infringement of the patent in question should be the place where the patent method in question was carried out in its entirety, and therefore the jurisdiction of the court was challenged and the case was requested to be referred to the court of the defendant ' s residence, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court found that the defendant Guangdong Pacific had supplied on its web platform an APP product charged with torts, and that it was not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list the defendant Guangdong Pacific as the defendant.
And the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, resides in Guangzhou City and is under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant, Orange Technology, argued to refer the case to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, on insufficient grounds, rejecting the defendant, Orange Technology Limited, ' s objection to the jurisdiction of the case and bearing the costs of handling the case.
Other proceedings in the case have not yet been made public, and journalists will follow closely the details of the patent infringement case.
Visit to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Scientific and Industrial Research Organization: The results of the Australasia Science and Technology Partnership are remarkable
“China’s science and technology has developed rapidly over the past decades, and the two countries of Australia and China can achieve fruitful results by joining forces in the scientific field.”
Larry Marshall, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, during a recent interview with a Chinese News Agency journalist in Beijing, said that cooperation in the field of science and technology in Australia, from climate change to Sky-Eye cooperation, was promising.
As the largest national scientific research agency in the Australian Federation, CSIRO has achieved many innovative research findings of world interest in areas such as oceans, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"It's a long-lasting friendship, a friendship that includes trust in partners and a long tradition of cooperation." Marshall said.
In May of this year, China's 500-metre spherical radio telescope, China SkyEye, installed the first international 19-beam L-band receiver.
The 19-beam feed receiver, currently the most advanced in the world, was developed jointly by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receivers was based on CSIRO ' s accumulation of technology over the years and that the speed of the FAST Sky Survey would increase by five to six times as soon as it became operational, and that more scientific observation objectives would be expanded.
"This is a CSIRO contribution to FAST."
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO is working closely with Chinese scientific and research institutions on the construction of a square kilometre array radio telescope, the development of new fuel technologies and the reduction of energy savings.
"In the past, scientific research has tended to focus on the problems of hundreds of years later, and now more scientific research is needed to solve the problems that lie ahead."
Marshall believes that Australia and China complement each other in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a number of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather events are frequent around the world, droughts and floods have led to reduced food production, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, problems such as population explosion, ageing and chronic diseases are also serious challenges.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused primarily on solving these immediate dilemmas."
Marshall explained that the International Centre for the Study of the Seas of the Southern Hemisphere, which CSIRO worked with the Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, focused on observing the El Niño phenomenon and the La Niña phenomenon, studying their relationship to extreme weather events and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather events; the new varieties of cereals to overcome extreme weather, developed by CSIRO in conjunction with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, could also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather events.
"In the current environment, science, technology and innovation are difficult to accomplish alone, costly, and there are a lot of problems to solve, so cooperation is particularly important today."
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it will be to make breakthrough progress, which is also the significance of the increased cooperation between the two sides within the framework of the "one way" framework.
"Increased bilateral cooperation, mainly in science and technology for us."
For example, Marshall, CSIRO has recently developed a gold-purification method that does not use cyanide, because the traditional gold-purification method of cyanide is very harmful to the environment, and many countries hope to find a method of gold-purification that is less polluting to the environment.
"We would very much like to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results of our participation in the "one way" cooperation.

The revitalization of the northeast is a matter of national development.
Industrial enterprises in the northeast are more important and better based. For the northeast, catching innovation is catching development, and finding innovation is looking for the future.
Is it possible to re-energize the old industrial base, release it and hold the General Secretary's heart?
The Foreign Minister of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea, Lee Yong Ho, stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued imposition of sanctions was deepening North Korea ' s distrust of the United States and that North Korea could not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Lee Yong Ho said at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had adopted a "very friendly approach" over the past year, including stopping missile and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we didn't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"There is no confidence in our national security if we don't trust the United States, and in this case we cannot give up weapons unilaterally first."
Although Lee Yong-ho repeats North Korea's complaints about the US's opposition to “phased” denuclearization, his speech is of great significance, as there was no total rejection of unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea had done before.
Lee Yong-ho referred to Kim Jong-un and Trump's joint statement of 12 June, when Kim Jong-un agreed to work towards “denuclearizing the Korean peninsula” and Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has stated that North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States also refused to relax its demand for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on `denuclearizing first' and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve their objectives in a high-pressure manner, even refusing to publish the `Declaration on the End of War',' Lee Yong-ho.
“The idea that sanctions can make us beg for forgiveness on our knees is that those who don't understand us are dreaming.
But the problem is that this continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Lee Yong-ho made no mention of the second special association plan mentioned by the President of the United States earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he stressed Kim Jong-un’s three meetings with Korean President Yuen in the last five months and said: “If the other side of denuclearization is Korea, not North Korea, then denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not become so frozen.”
China announced a reduction in import duties for 1,585 tax purposes as of 1 November 2018.
Since this year, China has taken successive initiatives to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1, this year, there was a general tax reduction on pharmaceuticals, with a total of 28 tariff adjustments for all generic drugs, including anti-cancer drugs, and bioalkali drugs with anti-cancer effects, and Chinese medicine with actual imports, among other things, to zero.
At the same time, the value added tax on the production and import of anti-cancer medicines has been reduced considerably.
On 1 July, there was a tax reduction on car and spare parts for 218 tax purposes.
After the tax reduction, China ' s whole car tax rate is below the average in developing countries and is in line with the actual situation in China ' s automobile industry.
This tax reduction will drive industrial restructuring and optimal allocation of resources, accelerate success and underachievement, improve the quality of products and services, and are expected to boost automobile price adjustment to some extent and allow consumers to gain more benefits.
On 1 July, tax deductions were made for 1,449 tax purposes on a daily basis for consumer goods.
The daily tax deduction on consumer goods is inextricably linked to the people's need for a better life.
This tax reduction is not only large but also strong, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
Tax cuts on consumer goods are directly beneficial to consumers and contribute to the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On 1 November, taxes will be levied on industrial goods such as mechanical and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials for 1,585 tax purposes.
Appropriately reducing tariffs on imports of much-needed industrial goods in some parts of the country can attract more foreign investment, contribute to increasing efficient domestic supply, boost industrial upgrading, and help enterprises to allocate resources globally, reduce production costs, and reduce pressure on the domestic environment.
The relevant head of the office of the Customs and Excise Committee of the State Council of China stated that the four above-mentioned autonomous tax reductions, and the third step of the tax reduction implemented on 1 July this year in accordance with the outcome of the negotiations on the expansion of the scope of the information technology agreement, would reduce China ' s total tariff level from 9.8 per cent in the previous year to 7.5 per cent.
The overall level of adjusted tariffs is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than that of most developing countries, and is at a moderate low level, largely matching China ' s developing country status and stage of development.
The Chief stated that the overall level of customs duties, as one of the key indicators of China ' s openness in the area of trade in goods, should correspond to the stage of China ' s economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China ' s trade in goods is the largest in the world and already has the basis for further expansion of the open economy, but the quality and efficiency of trade development are not as good as that of developed economies, so the overall level of tariffs should be properly lowered.
Tariffs are a means of protection for compliance. Tariff levels should be commensurate with industrial competitiveness, good competition should be encouraged, excessive protection would be detrimental to industrial development and quality improvement.
Tariff rate adjustments need to balance production needs with consumer demand.
The focus is on reducing the tax rates on commodities that contribute to industrial transformation and upgrading of domestic demand. Efforts are made to increase the import of niche niche products where the needs of the population are more concentrated. Business and public access are constantly being enhanced to meet the upgrading needs of the industrial structure and consumption structure.
Tax reduction efforts need to balance fiscal revenues with the affordability of industrial development.
The choice of specific tax-reducing commodities and tax-reducing margins should be made to harmonize the two markets, both up and down, production and consumption, both at home and abroad, and to maintain the momentum of China ' s steady and moderate economic development.
The Officer-in-Charge stressed that this year marks the fortieth anniversary of the reform and opening of the country, and that China has taken the initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs in accordance with the major measures required by China to achieve high-quality development, and has facilitated the integrated use of both international and foreign resources, promoting the improvement of the quality of the domestic supply system and meeting the consumer consumption needs of the people.
These actions and initiatives show that China will steadfastly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, firmly support economic globalization, firmly uphold the principles of free trade and the multilateral trading system, with the WTO as its core, and continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the world and allow China to develop to benefit the world better.
The President of Serbia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo.
South Press said that President Vucic of Serbia had ordered the country's armed forces to move to maximum operational readiness, in view of the fact that the Kosovo Special Forces had occupied the water storage corridor at the Gazivoda hydroelectric power station in northern Kosovo, which was controlled by Belgrade.
On 29 September, the Minister of Defence of Serbia, Wulin, declared that the Serbian army was in full operational readiness.
Wulin stressed that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as the order issued by Vucic remained in force, and the Army would respond regardless of the course of events.
According to the Russian Tas organization, on 29 September, Vucic said in an interview that he had briefed the United States and the Russian and other parties on the current situation and would travel to Moscow on 2 October to meet Russian President Putin and seek Putin's support on Kosovo.
When asked whether Serbia needed Russia’s military support like Syria, Vucic replied in the negative: “I don’t want a major military conflict on our soil.”
Vučić also stated that the full operational readiness of the RSLA was only intended to create a deterrent to prevent the outbreak of the conflict, but it was also a clear warning that no violence would be tolerated in Kosovo.
The raising of the operational readiness of the RSLA is related to two major Kosovo initiatives.
According to the Serbian side, the Albanian population in the northern part of Kosovo is in the process of mass arrest of Serbs who have lived there for generations, and these arrested Serbs have not broken any laws.
Vučić claims that since the beating and detention of Marko Jurich, head of the Serbian government office in Kosovo and Metohija, on 26 March this year, the Albanian community has escalated the situation in the region and carried out inhuman arrests and expulsions of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the previously self-proclaimed ROSU Special Forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, armed police and snipers, occupied positions near the water storage lake at the Gazivoda hydroelectric station, entered the ecological and sports centre near the dam in the northern part of Kosovo and blocked all nearby roads, which were otherwise controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucic pointed out that this military adventure in Kosovo had been instigated by Western countries and that the Kosovo Army ' s move had not been notified to the Serbian side in advance, in violation of chapter 9, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, as well as United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the military-technical agreement between Seko.
Vucic has already shouted to NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg to criticize the false remarks of Western countries on Kosovo.
The root cause of the current conflict remains the centuries-old historical feud between the Serb and Albanian communities in Kosovo.
With regard to Kosovo's belonging, the Serbian and Albanian communities are divided.
Serbia regards Kosovo as the national birthplace and the cradle of culture, because Serbia established its most powerful State here in the twelfth century, and Albanians moved in in large numbers only after the Ottoman Empire invaded and the army defeated the north.
The Albanians, for their part, insisted that the original tribe of Ilya, who lived in Kosovo in the fourth-fifth century B.C., was the ancestry of the Albanians and that Kosovo had been Albanian territory since antiquity.
Subjective political divisions have led to violent clashes among different ethnic groups, religions and cultures, and have created fierce confrontations between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo.
In 1912, Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of ethnic Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, and the Serb population rose relatively. In the view of the Serbs, “only take back their land” was regarded by the ethnic Albanians as the plundering of “Greater Serbianism” and the bi-communal contradictions intensified.
Kosovo became a "powder bucket" in the Balkans.
In 1999, an armed conflict between the Albanian separatists of the KLA and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro by NATO forces and the outbreak of the war in Kosovo.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.
Since then, despite news that Serbia will normalize its relations with Kosovo and sign global and legally binding agreements, agreements held hostage to various forces, such as the US, EU and Russia, have not been concluded owing to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints.
And just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he was advocating the separation of Serbs from Albanians in Kosovo and that he would open up once again the conflict between the two communities.
Electricity communications are still out of order, and Indonesia's strong earthquake coupled with tsunami relief is in a lot of trouble.
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early hours of 30 September, 28 days of a strong earthquake and tsunami in Dungara district, Central Sulawesi Province, in the country, have resulted in 420 deaths.
The head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, Wilem Rampangilei, said that the figure was only a preliminary count of the city of Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi, about 80 km from the epicentre of the earthquake. Many of the city ' s hotels, malls, warehouses, etc., damaged by the collapse of the earthquake, had not been searched for because of the lack of large search and rescue machines.
On 29 September 2018, local time, in Balo, Indonesia, a bridge damaged by an earthquake and tsunami collapsed for several weeks.
As a result of the severe damage to electricity and communications facilities, Chimtungara County and the adjacent Sigi region remain unconnected "silos", unable to count the number of victims.
According to the media, Indonesian Vice President Kara said that thousands of people had died.
Electricity cuts, communications disruptions, road blockages, airport damage...
As a result of power cuts, some hospitals and rescue settlements in the city of Palu rely on fuel for electricity generation.
Roads into and out of the city were blocked by the landslide, and large transport vehicles, including oil tankers, were prevented from entering, placing a strain on fuel supply.
According to the Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs Agus, emergency relief supplies such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothing, food, household kits, etc. from South Sulawesi and Columbus provinces in the vicinity of the earthquake zone have not arrived in the disaster zone due to road damage.
Disaster relief materials transferred from the capital, Jakarta, are being transported to the disaster zone via air transport aircraft.
In view of the damage caused to the Palu airport command tower and runway during the earthquake, in order to ensure safety and security and rescue, all commercial flights have been stopped and only military aircraft transporting relief supplies and personnel have taken off and down.
The Indonesian Minister of Political, Legal and Security Affairs in charge of rescue in the earthquake zone, Wiranto, requested that electricity supply and airport commercial flight services be restored as soon as possible in order to ensure the functioning of relief agencies such as hospitals so that more rescue workers and volunteers and aid supplies could arrive in the disaster zone.
In Dungara County, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, there were several consecutive strong earthquakes, including a 7.07-level earthquake at 1702 hours local time, which triggered a tsunami that caused major disasters in the cities of Palu, Dungara County and Sigi District.
The Chinese news agency Beijing on October 1st (journalist Yoon Li) has been running its best blue sky pattern in the past few days, and has drawn thousands of people from the city of Beijing to show their happiness on social platforms, saying, "Under the blue sky clouds, `intoxicated' beautiful skyline is the best card in Beijing."
Since August, Beijing has welcomed the "Blueest Sky".
Within the city, people can be seen and photographed anywhere or with a smart phone, or with a single anti-camera.
On social platforms like Weibo, the Weibo Circle of Friends, the palaces, Tiananmen, the nests, the alleys in the video are visible everywhere and the buildings display different beautys under the blue sky.
Some online friends say that such a "windlight movie" is the best urban propaganda film in Beijing; others argue that if such a blue sky is brushed for a long time, people with cervical vertebrae disease can be cured; and even more, they hope that "the blue will be able to catch spring and summer after winter, so that the skyscreen of the city will be blue in four seasons."
Why does the people of the city love the sun?
Only because people who lived in this city in the past suffered from the fog, and so they were eager for the blue sky, and after Beijing was launched as the "Blue Sky Defense War", the fog became less, the blue sky grew, and the people were happy in their eyes, and the happiness gained was particularly important.
On the Fourth of July, the weather was clear in Beijing.
At 8 a.m., the vast majority of the 35 air quality monitoring stations throughout the city were shown as “first-class” green.
The "Blueest Sky" photography competition on social networking platforms, spontaneously launched by the people, is still going on.
Why is it so blue in Beijing lately?
According to the relevant head of the Beijing City Environmental Protection Agency, the average concentration of fine particles (PM2.5) in Beijing in August of this year was 35 ug/m3, setting the best record for the same period of almost five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 in September was even more frequent in the number of places available.
A major factor in the emergence of the “Blueest Sky” is the overall favourable weather conditions in recent times and, more importantly, the sustained efforts of Beijing to combat atmospheric pollution, the vigorous promotion of clean air action plans over the past five years and the continued release of environmental benefits, which have led to a reduction in the total discharge of pollutants in the region, have laid the foundation for sustained improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially launched and implemented the Beijing City Plan of Action for Clean Air 2013-2017 in 2013.
According to the plan, the official has continuously directed non-capital function decomposition and promoted energy clean-up substitution and pollution reduction, with a total of 4923 coal-fired boilers phased out.
As a result, Beijing became the first large city in China and China to achieve full net gasification.
The data show that between 2013 and 2017 the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased cumulatively by 35.6 per cent; the number of days air quality was increased by 50 days; the number of days of first class excellence was increased by 25 days; the number of days of heavy contamination was reduced by 35 days and the incidence of heavy contamination was significantly reduced.
As the air quality continues to improve, Beijing officials released the Beijing City Three-Year Plan of Action to Win the Blue Sky Defense War in September, based on a new round of PM2.5 sources analysis, focusing on the current governance phase and pollution features of diesel trucks, dust lifts, volatile organic matter management, optimizing transport structures, industrial structures, energy structures and land use structures, strengthening regional alliances, investing in the fine management of cities, promoting green development across the board, and trying to make the "Blueest Sky" permanent in Kyoto no longer "precious" and returning it to the background rather than the protagon
During the Golden Week of the National Day this year, the relevant departments, such as the Municipal Tourism Board, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the City Administration and Public Security, will intensify their law enforcement checks on the “one day” market, focus on the “six blacks” of tourism, and the offenders, once found guilty, will be subject to heavy and heavy penalties in accordance with the law.
Yesterday morning, the municipality convened a special session on the fight against illegal “one day” and deployed a special operation to fight against illegal “one day” further.
At the conference, it was revealed that the focus on black votes, black guides, gangsters, black cars, black shops, black Internet interest chains were interwoven with "six black" images, and since July 28, the city has launched a special campaign against illegal "one day trips".
Since the launch of the special initiative, the city has received 39 complaints for the "one day trip", a decrease of 63 per cent in the same year; since this year, the city has received 270 complaints for the "one day trip", a decrease of 62 per cent in the same year.
In the last two months, the city has seized 248 "black cars" in the city, investigated 158 violations of travel passenger operations, closed 29 shopping "black shops" and theatres, seized 13 "black guides" and 27 illegal advertisements, confiscated 26,000 illegal ads, removed 31 illegal "one day tour" billboards and 3 bus stop signs, investigated 1789 offences involving various travels, opened 181 cases in various functional departments, fined 4.48 million yuan from heavy fines and detained 111 persons involved in travel offences.
After correction, the illegal "one day" chaos was largely contained, and the "one day" market order showed a steady and positive trend.
It was reported that in recent years the city has been increasing its efforts to deal with illegal “one day” trips.
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Board received 1612 and 897 complaints for the "one day trip", a decrease of 79% and 44% respectively, but the illegal "one day trip" continued to strike repeatedly and rebound from time to time and created a "six black" disorder that interwoven the chain of interests such as black ticketing, black conduct, black market, black market, black Internet, etc.
Specifically, illegal street tourists are "black votes", illegal websites that publish false tourism information are "black nets", travel agencies engaged in illegal "one-day trips" or agencies or individuals not qualified to operate travel agencies are "blacks", "black guides" employed by "blacks" who do not have a tour license or practice in violation of the law, and "blacks" are used by vehicles that do not have the qualifications to travel passengers or "black cars" that provide passenger transport services for illegal "one-day trips", and eventually they bring tourists into designated tourist shopping shops,
During this special operation, the city has continuously increased regular checks and mobile patrols on illegal “one day” trips. In response to the illegal “one day” high-frequency and high-impact tourism route locations, the relevant authorities have sent a daily undercover team to the car to visit the group in order to detect evidence of violations of the law, subject to strict scrutiny in accordance with the law.
Among them, "black car" and "black shop" became the two hard-hit focus of the special operation.
Without black cars, it was said, illegal "one day trips" would not be possible, and black cars would be easy to detect, remember and search, as well as a fixed asset with a single higher value.
The relevant authorities use road traffic monitors to increase the supervision of tourist buses on the priority "one day trip" route, so that the search point "black car" can be detected in a timely manner using technological and intellectual means such as technical and material defence.
The “black shop” of tourist shopping has also become a strong focus due to its small size and its sit-in.
In order to reinforce the deterrent and the fight against illegal “one day” trips, any special operation found to be in violation of the law will be subject to severe and severe penalties imposed by the competent authorities in accordance with the law.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to the severe beating of illegal “one-day tour”, which examined measures to combine administrative penalties with convictions.
The City Tourism Board said that more regular travel agencies would be encouraged to carry out a "one day tour" in Beijing in the future, and that the supply of formal "one day swim" would be increased to further crowd out the illegal "one day swim", and that specific programmes were currently under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Board continuously refines the e-TravelList Information System to ensure that each team is included in the regulation of the eTL platform.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economic symbol, what has U-town been through these years?
As the permanent venue of the World Internet Congress, Utsun is receiving attention on how to take on the summit dividend.
During the five years since the first World Internet Congress, changes have been visible in Uijin.
In 2014, there were only 12 businesses associated with the digital economy and the Internet throughout town, and by the third quarter of this year there were more than 500 businesses.
This is a microcosm of the development of the digital economy in U-town.
The convening of the Internet Congress allowed local firms to accept the inspiration of the digital economy, the wave of digitalization, the desire to upgrade their businesses, and the traditional manufacturing enterprises increased their investment and research and development in machine-changers, smart management, etc.
The secretary of the U Township Party committee, Kang Yong, said that U Town would build a new economic empowerment centre in the future.
The digital economy cannot develop without the support of infrastructure.
This year, Ujin launched a 5G pilot on the basis of full coverage of the 4G communications network and free WiFi.
At the same time, the city of Qingjiang, where Ujin is located, became the hot ground for the development of the Internet industry as the first county city in the country to build dedicated access to international Internet data.
Since the first World Internet Congress, 565 digital economy projects have been introduced, with a total planned investment of 37.725 billion yuan. The core manufacturing sector of the digital economy in the first three quarters of this year achieved a total output value of 8.73 billion yuan, with an increase of 13 per cent in value added in the same year.
"Ou Town was a tourist symbol before, followed by theatre and cultural symbols. Because of the Internet Congress, it is now an Internet and a digital economy symbol."
The Secretary of the Qing Village City Council, Seong Yong Jun, believes that the dividends of the World Internet Congress have accumulated over time and that it is therefore all the more important to set up a platform to take over the addition and import of various elements such as talent, projects, technology, etc.
Shen Yi, a Qing villager, has worked outside the country for 20 years and has returned home to start a business because of her association with the Internet Congress.
On December 2, last year, with his high-capacity anti-digital modification technology solution, he entered the fourth Internet Light Fair and was favoured by a number of clients.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in U-town not only because of her home country complex, but "In U-town, it's easier to recruit people than I thought, and our application is quick to land, and U-jin's smart parking program has applications for us."
The spill-over effect of the Internet Congress is reflected in a U-town Boulevard.
This road across the south and south side of the city is not only a tourist attraction, but also an industrial road.
With it as an anchor, U-town Boulevard created a conglomeration.
Journalists learned that, in the future, Ujin Road will become the leading position in the development of the Qing township industry, leading a vast array of applications of the fruits of smart medicine, intelligent old age, intelligent government, etc., bringing together industries and a large number of high-level talent that account for 80% of the city ' s GDP.
The tsunami caused by the earthquake in Indonesia has killed at least 410 people.
According to the head of the Public Information Bureau of the Indonesian police in Jakarta on the evening of 29, the earthquake in Central Sulawesi province has now killed 410 people, 97 of whom have been identified.
A further 29 people disappeared and 540 were injured.
Palu airport is still closed.
Active treatment, with 98% survival rate of premature births in China for 29 weeks and above, has reached the level of developed countries.
The National Children's Medical Center and the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Gangdan revealed on September 30th that it introduced advanced Canadian methods in the title “China NiCU pre-birth quality improvement project”.
The results of the project show that, after active treatment, 98 per cent of premature child survival in China during 29 weeks and above has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in early delivery without complications in very young babies.
For almost 20 years, the Chinese Government has been paying attention to the rescue of newborn babies.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has fallen to 3.71 per thousand, clearly below the national average and at advanced levels in developed countries.
China's NiCU project for pre-natal quality improvement of pre-born children in hospital has significantly improved the quality of survival of pre-born children through four years of tireless efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, Director of the Neonatal Care Unit (NICU) of the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Gangan, said to journalists that, while increasing the survival rate of premature births, attention is being paid to reducing the quality of survival of premature births, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the overall outcome of developing neurogenetic development, and improving the overall survival and demographic quality of premature births, which is important for improving the overall survival quality of preborn children and the quality of the population, both within and outside the country, and is also a key concern of the project.
China's NNICU Project for the Improvement of Premature Quality of Premature Births in Hospital has worked tirelessly for four years to record tens of thousands of premature births of 33 weeks of age and under, resulting in a one-third reduction in the mortality rate of small births and premature births of small birth weight in China, while the incidence of serious complications of premature births has significantly decreased and the quality of survival of premature births has significantly improved.
Through the establishment of the National Neonatal Quality Improvement Coordination Network, and the introduction of the concept of collaborative quality improvement, the project has radiationd 25 co-operative hospitals throughout China, creating a comprehensive, systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement methodology adapted to the national circumstances to improve the early birth of children and improve the level of care for newborn children.
The Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Gangan is joining forces of the National Neonatal Unit to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on project experience and to provide reference and guidance for the regular diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
According to the information received, in China's Prenatal Child Quality Improvement Project, the Paediatric Hospital introduced the EPIQ methodology into 25 large NNICUs in 19 provinces of the country and worked to resolve the problem of premature child infections that plague China's neonatal care unit.
After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, the survival rate of premature births across Canada has increased by about a third, and Canada is now one of the best countries in the world to expect premature births.
The EPIQ methodology has now been applied to all NIOCs throughout Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
According to the paediatric hospital, two years after EPIQ intervention, premature child infections fell by 35%, while antibiotics use fell by 20%.
In the future, the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University will continue to promote and implement this methodology throughout the country with a view to comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications in premature births and improving the quality of care for newborns throughout the country.
At this point, it is true that there are differences and inequities in the level of treatment in all regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important building unit of the National Children ' s Medical Centre, the Paediatric Hospital will play a radiation-leading role. This study covers several western provinces, including Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal care throughout the country.
It is understood that the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Gangan is joining forces of the National Neonatal Unit to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the project ' s accumulated experience and to provide reference and guidance for the regular diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It was revealed that in 2019, the focal point was located in the China Neonatal Collaboration Network at the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Gangan, and that it would join 63 hospitals throughout the country to carry out the next phase of national quality improvement with a view to promoting the level of homogenization of newborn care and treatment in China.
The Director of the Shanghai City Health and Planning Committee expressed alarm that Shanghai could become a central city in the centre of Asia, not only in terms of research, but also in terms of the construction of the entire service system. The quality of services and service outcomes should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China ' s level of medical care.
Qing-tsing: Build the "hero monument" in mind - written on the Fifth Martyrs Day.
On 30 September, on the eve of the birth of the Republic ' s 69th-year-old, we had the fifth anniversary of the martyr, and Xi near the Equality Party and the national leader came to Tiananmen Square to attend the ceremony to give a basket of flowers to the heroes of the people.
At this moment, no matter where you are, please pay a warm tribute.
It's a day of remembrance, and it's a wake-up call.
The name of every martyr is behind the thick history of life.
They also have hot youth, true love, and family.
However, because they firmly believe that "theism of our faith is the truth of the universe", they will sacrifice everything they have in order to "freeze the suffering of the next generation".
"I live one day and cry for China one day."
Through time and space, the British set up a spiritual sign to guide the way forward.
"Where to come from, where to go" "Do what kind of person," read English, and it's easy to come up with answers.
The memory of Angry and, above all, the building of a "hero monument" in your heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary war, some 20 million martyrs have lost their lives to national independence, the liberation of the people and the country ' s wealth and strength.
For a variety of reasons, many of the vanguards did not even leave their names.
Countless men pour blood on the ideals, practise their faith with their lives, remember their names, and pass on their spirits, that is, to protect the roots and spirits of the nation.
This "hero monument" is not subject to any degradation or destruction.
For some time now, historical nihilism, general entertainment, etc., have flourished.
All practices that distort history and demean the elite, challenge the just conscience, miscalculate value judgements, and cause public outrage and alarm throughout society.
Greatness cannot be desecrated, and heroes must not forget.
We cannot afford to be allowed to touch the bottom line, but we must dare to shine the sword and defend our strong dignity with justice in accordance with the rule of law.
The Hero Martyrs Protection Act was officially implemented on 1 May this year.
In terms of judicial practice, some cases have been judged with great pleasure, both effectively preserving the bright and bright image in accordance with the law and unleashing the positive energy of heroism and respect for the vanity of the past.
A people with aspirations cannot have heroes, a country with ideals cannot have pioneers.
The memory of the vanguard and the call for heroes has become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are millions of memorial facilities throughout the country, and more than 100 million visits to Martyrs' Gardens each year are to be observed.
The hearts and minds are the strongest cornerstones.
Let the spirit of heroism, defend heroism, learn heroism, love heroism, integrate spirit into national bloodlines, and a "hero monument" will stand between the heavens and the earth, deep in hearts and minds.
Reuter Brussels, September 28 - The EU took a non-confrontational position against Italy on Friday after Italy was surprised by its massive budget deficit plan, in defiance of EU demands, but the EU might take a more radical stance if Italy were to stick to too bold a goal.
Italy’s skeptical European government’s target of a budget deficit of 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) for the next three years suggests that debt cuts have not been achieved only in the face of demand for a reduction in the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).
The ECEC Executive Committee for Economic Affairs, Moscovisi, said on Friday, "We have no interest in the crisis between the EC and Italy," and he responded cautiously because EU recommendations and sanctions could have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will be able to convince Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy formally submits it to the EC in mid-October.
After the Government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in almost two weeks on Friday, while the rate of return on Italian bonds reached its highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged by the October deadline, the ECEC may veto Italy ' s draft budget, something that the ECEC has never done to any country.
At a meeting later on Friday in Riga, Latvia, the EU Executive Committee Vice-President said that Italy's current fiscal plan “does not seem to be in line with the Stability and Growth Pact”, referring to EU financial regulations.
But he didn't say what the EU's reaction would be.
The bidders can submit their applications to participate in this open tender by 26 October this year.
The Russian Ministry of Agriculture used China as one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
In May, the Russian Agricultural Supervisory Authority announced that Russian food exports to China for the first time this agricultural year exceeded 1 million tons, a record of innovation.
The Bureau predicts that China may enter the top ten Russian food importers.
The Chinese women's platoon won the Turkish team again on the 30th of September 30th in Sapporo, China, after the first battle against Cuba at 3:0, and won two consecutive games in the 2018 World Cup team.
However, Chinese women are more difficult in this battle than in the first war.
A total of 24 teams participated in the 2018 World Cup for Women, with Chinese women in group B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
From the world ranking and overall strength of Team B, the Turkish and Italian teams are the main rivals of the Chinese team.
As soon as the game began, the Chinese team took the lead at the beginning of the game, kept the edge all the way, put a lot of pressure on the opponent to take the first round at 25:18 and to stop the Internet.
The Turkish team that entered the second round was fierce, and the first was in the lead by 6:2; the Chinese team requested a pause and adjusted the formation, gradually chasing the score to 7 even, and then repeatedly stopped the net score and scored the score of 7:0; the Turkish team at the end of the bureau would once score the score to 15:19; the Chinese team would pursue the tough Turkish team two points in a row after the game was taken at 24:20; and the Chinese team would again request the suspension and take the second round at 25:23 with Joting's running.
In the third round, the situation was very tenuous, and the gap between the two sides rose to a level of 19 at one time.
At a critical time, the Turkish team made a mistake. After taking the lead at 21:19, the Chinese team obtained the point at 24:21 with Ju Ting's heavy arrest and Zhang Changning's attack; then the Turkish team pursued the score to 23:24, and after the Chinese team requested a pause, Zhang Changning hit the score, and the Chinese team locked the game at 25:23.
After Pingsai, the master coach of the Chinese women's platoon said that the whole game was not easy.
"We're well prepared, we're good at blocking the net, the Turkish team's technology is more comprehensive, and we have to mitigate our mistakes and try to win through our own initiative."
In the face of the familiar teammates of the past, Jo Ting, who worked for the Turkish Vakivo Bank team, was subjected to a lot of restrictions in the first round of the competition that day, and she then volunteered to change and continued her aggressive offensive.
"We are familiar with each other, and it is normal to be watched, but the Chinese team is extremely active, and both the net and the offensive are doing well in the face of bad news."
The Chinese women's platoon will then hold a truce for physical and technical training on the first day of the war; on October 2, they will meet the third rival Canadian team.
On the 30th of September, China and New Network and Water (Cui Zhiping Wang Peng) held a ceremony to focus on projects during the second half of 2018.
On that day, six projects began to work together, with a total investment of RMB 4.29 billion.
On that day, the Deputy Mayor, Yang Shi Kwan, the Standing Committee of the Committee, announced the start of work.
According to Yao Hyang, Director of Hebei's new District Management Committee, the six projects that have been concentrated today, with a total investment of $4.29 billion, are industrial projects, both in the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries and in the nurturing and introduction of new and emerging industries, covering a wide range of industries such as civil-military integration, cloud factories, food, medicine, chemicals, etc., with high technological content, high industrial level and high value added of products.
It is believed that the construction and commissioning of these projects will certainly give a strong impetus to the early realization of the goal of “building hundreds of billions of class industrial parks and winning high-rise areas at the national level”.
Yang Shikun, Deputy Mayor of the Standing Committee of the Water and Sanitation Committee, announced the start of the project.
Yao Hsing said that the region had successfully launched a series of major events, such as the China Xiao Shui International Life Science Summit and the Great Health Industry Development Forum, the Chinese Academy of Sciences High-end Equipment Industry Check Summit, and the 2018 Xingjin Xinjin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xin Xiang,
The Chinese-American stem cell project will be officially operational by the end of the year.
The Chinese science department-wide pilot base for the tons class project began construction on the country ' s first stage, the world ' s largest supercritical carbon dioxide compressor experimental platform.
The state-of-the-art super-counting centre of the top ten in the world has been re-established in the provinces and cities.
Yao Hsin said that by the end of the year, the region will have completed Phase 2 of the Science and Technology Valley Project, which is 240,000 square metres of digital information, new energy materials, three research and development bases for life health and a demonstration centre.
It will actively build an "upgraded version" of the Chinese Academy+" innovation model, build a "one platform base for the two chambers" and promote the integration of scientific and technological achievements into innovation through multidisciplinary cross-cutting, multi-unit collaboration and multi-industry integration.
Nearly a thousand state-owned sites have reduced the price of tickets by more than half, by more than 20%.
[Summary] As of September 28, all regions have put in place or published free open or low price measures for 981 landscape areas (74 free open, 907 lower prices), with price reductions in Yunnan Shilin, Dalian 3 towers, Yulong Snow Mountain, Guangxi Quilin River, Fujian Wumao Mountain, Hunan Zhang family border, Xiangxi army Machi, Jiangxi Sanshan and Xinjiang Karnas, among others.
In order to follow up on the Central Economic Work Session and the deployment of the Government ' s Report on the Work, the National Development Reform Commission issued on June 28 a " Guidance for improving the mechanism for the formation of the price of tickets in the State-owned landscape area " (hereinafter referred to as the Guidance) to reduce the price of tickets in the priority State-owned setting area, which calls for improving the mechanism for the formation of the price of tickets in the State-owned setting area from a reasonable definition of the cost composition of the price of tickets, innovative methods of price management and strict compliance with the pricing procedures,
Actively working in accordance with deployment requirements has reduced the price of tickets to a number of key State-owned sites.
As of September 28, all regions have put in place or published to society 981 free open or low price measures (74 free open and 907 reduced), of which 159 are in 5A and 534 in 4A, bringing the total to 693, or 70.6%.
Of the 907 landscape areas where prices fell, 491 fell by more than 20 per cent, or 54.3 per cent, and 214 fell by more than 30 per cent, or 23.6 per cent.
The provinces of Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi and Shaanxi have a larger number of price zones, of which Yunnan has more than 100 price zones, with an overall decrease of more than 30 per cent.
The Anhui, Chongqing and the eight provincial governments (districts, municipalities) priced the entire 5A-class landscape area down.
The high level of social interest in Yunnan Shik Lin, Tai Li Santa and Yulong Sheishan, the Guangxi Guiling River, Fujian Wumai Mountain, Hunan Zhang Jiji border, Xianxi Seng Mai, Jiangxi San Qingshan and Xinjiang Karnas Xinjiang, have all implemented price reductions.
The gradual return of the prices of tickets to priority State-owned sites to reasonable areas will help to accelerate the tourism sector ' s transition from the ticket economy to the industrial economy, small tourism to mass tourism, destination tourism to full-scale tourism, contribute to the creation of a virtuous cycle of optimal tourism supply structure and steady expansion of tourism consumption demand, and contribute to the continued healthy development of the tourism sector and tourism.
At the same time, the National Development Reform Commission stressed the need to strengthen price order norms in the landscape areas, guide them to upgrade services and ensure that price cuts do not drop.
In addition, the National Development Reform Commission has carried out special inspections on issues such as the small and apparent drops in the prices of individual tickets in the landscape recently reflected in the media, and has asked the regions to deal seriously with them, to respond in a timely manner to social concerns, and to ensure that the price reductions are implemented.
The Trade Promotion Bureau has ordered short-, medium- and long-term optimization.
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Agency has submitted short-, medium- and long-term optimization reports on `Major Investment Immigrants' and `Technology Immigrants', and has been continuously listening to society and optimizing the content and related work, in addition to stepping up and implementing the work in the report.
The Trade and Promotion Bureau will brief all sectors of society as soon as possible on relevant optimization efforts.
Five of them were short-term measures in the course of the year; five were medium-term measures in 2019; and one was long-term.
In addition, the Trade Promotion Bureau has been instructed by the Director of the Department of Economics and Finance, Liang Weite, to conduct a comprehensive review of the internal regulatory system.
The five short-term measures implemented during this year include:
1. Carry out a review process. Give priority to cases that are due to expire at the end of seven years, those mentioned in the ICAC report, and those that have been renewed. If there are indications of irregularities or violations, the case will be referred to the relevant judicial authorities on their own initiative for follow-up;
Field visits to projects involving "major investment migrants". By late September, more than 20 investment projects had been inspected;
3. A comprehensive review of the current system of evaluation. Six principles for analysing investment projects have been re-established in the evaluation of applications for "Major Investment Immigrants" and the approval mechanism will be improved in the evaluation of applications for "Technology Immigrants" by identifying elements conducive to the development of the country and giving priority to the admission of talent. The list of "Five Industries Ten Workers", which gives priority to the annual introduction of talent, has been drawn up to better target the intake of talent in line with the HKSAR Government ' s policy direction.
4. Increasing transparency of information, including plans to gradually publish approval guidelines, rating criteria and weights from the fourth quarter of this year, and to further refine and publicly approve data;
5. With regard to refining the work of the confirmation mechanism, a request has been made to verify the status of work in Australia prior to confirmation; significant investments must be checked on site and the financial statements submitted.
The five medium-term measures implemented in 2019 included:
1. Establishment of a mechanism to hear the views of the Talent Development Committee and the Economic Development Committee on a regular basis. A working session with the Economic Development Committee was held in September to discuss the establishment of the mechanism.
2. Require the applicant to submit annually financial statements made by an independent third party in order to keep the operation of the investment project under constant review;
3. To further standardize and electronicize the process of application and approval of individual cases in order to reduce human error;
4. To conduct a comprehensive review of the current staffing situation in order to complement the implementation of a number of optimization measures;
5. To intensify research on the revision of the Temporary Residence System for Investors, Managers and Specially Qualified Technicians.
With regard to long-term measures, work has intensified on the revision of the law, and it is expected that the drafting of the relevant legislation will begin in the first half of 2019, with a view to completing it as soon as possible, further clarifying the criteria for granting temporary residence permits, the review mechanism and the confirmation mechanism, and increasing the investigation function of the Trade Promotion Bureau in order to more precisely approve and regulate applications for temporary residence permits.
The experts in the field of observation and discussion and exchange activities of the entire country went into the test field to hear a presentation from the representative of the Chinese Engineering Academy team, Shijiroshi.
China's new Xinjiang Shaya power supply on September 30 is located in the Xinjiang Shaya district of Xinjiang Xiaodan Wang Xiaojun, where the membrane cotton growers are "no less bad" than the next membrane cotton, and a white cotton contest is "open" and hangs its branches.
From 27 to 28 September, a national on-site observation and discussion exchange on filmless cotton took place in Xinjiang Shaya County.
During the observation session, journalists learned that the non-membrane cotton technology system, which is dominated by the “Chinese cotton 619” and its accompanying cultivation measures, has initially achieved the goal of non-filmization of cotton fields, has reduced the contamination of the ecological environment and the original cotton by the Xinjiang cotton film, and significant progress has been made in the research and demonstration of the membrane cotton complex technology.
The Chief Scientist of the China Engineering Academy, the famous cotton genetic breeder and the cotton system of the State ' s modern agricultural industrial technology system, Shijima Shijima, gave a presentation on the development of the membrane cotton to the Secretary of the Party Committee of the Zaijiang Agro Lin University School, Zhou National Model.
"The membrane cotton complex technology that we have developed can completely achieve cotton cultivation without the membrane, and can completely solve the problem of membrane contamination and achieve green cotton planting."
The Chinese Academy of Engineering has written about it.
Xinjiang is China ' s most important cotton-producing region. According to the National Statistical Office, in 2017 Xinjiang ' s cotton cultivation amounted to 35 million acres, accounting for 61 per cent of the country ' s cotton area.
Since the introduction of the membrane in China in 1982, Xinjiang has had over 50 million acres of crop cover for all types of crops, and the annual usage of the membrane is around 300,000 tons.
Of these, cotton membrane coverage reached 100%, and cotton-field membrane accounted for about 60% of the use of the membrane in Xinjiang.
The membrane-free cotton is measured, and the production of cotton is entirely within 320 to 350 kg of acre production.
As the Xinjiang membrane input continues to increase, the residual membrane recovery rate is low, the amount of film fragments in the soil is gradually increasing, and a series of problems such as the structural destruction of the soil caused by the membranes seriously affect the sustainable development of agriculture.
The membranes not only cause serious contamination of the soil, but also have a significant impact on the quality of cotton fibres.
Currently, more than a third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang are mechanized.
In 2017, Xinjiang machine picked about 14 million acres of cotton.
During the mechanical cotton harvesting process, a large amount of shattered membrane on the surface and on cotton strains was collected, the fractal membrane mixed with the original cotton was difficult to remove during the processing of the original cotton, and the subsequent textile processing could not be completely removed, with serious implications for the quality of textile products.
On 28 September, a national on-site observation and discussion exchange on filmless cotton took place in Xinjiang Shaya County.
In order to focus on tackling cotton land contamination, streamlining cotton-planting techniques, and improving cotton-field efficiency, Shijiang led his team through eight years to implement the "Chinese cotton 619" anti-membrane cotton technology cultivation, "building the wings" for the green development of Xinjiang agriculture.
It was introduced that through innovative breeding of new ideas, a very early, salt-resistant, low-temperature, high-yielding land cotton new product was developed by the Chinese Cotton 619.
"The `Chinese cotton 619' achieved a series of accompanying measures such as mechanical support for non-film seeding in the southern Xinjiang region under non-film cultivation conditions, improved depth of seeding, shallow burial of drip tube belts under non-film conditions, suitable screening of seed density, sound chemical regulation, etc. "
At present, demonstration bases for membrane cotton have been set up in Aksu, Kurle and Alar, among others, with production reaching 4,800 kg per hectare.
Cropping cotton without film has achieved high yields, savings, environmental protection and combined efficiency gains.
Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinghai's Agronomist said that through the research and demonstration of filmless cotton cultivation techniques over the last six years, the production of membrane seed cotton could well be 320 to 350 kg, possibly even higher.
"There is a great prospect for the extension of the technology of non-film cotton cultivation. "
Zhang Danghai believes that the current technology of filmless cotton cultivation can solve the problem of contamination of the soil with filtration, but there is still a gap between the economic benefits of film cultivation and those of the soil.
"The support of the purchase price of cotton will be beneficial for future promotion."
He said that, next, he and his team would continue to conduct in-depth studies and wide-scale extension applications of the membrane cotton industry, making it a strong industry, and thoroughly resolving the soil pollution caused by the membrane.
Guangdong land, sea and air are actively responding to the Golden Week transport - China New Network
On September 29th, the seventh day of the Hong Kong section of Gao, and the first weekend following the opening, the insiders of the West Kowloon station were hoisted.
The holiday of the Golden Week of the National Day (1-7 October) will be on its way. Journalists learned from the relevant authorities that the various transport sectors, such as the Guangdong Railway, Aviation, Water Transport and Road, are actively planning, increasing their capacity to deliver, putting in place safeguards, and making every effort to ensure the safe and orderly transport of passengers within the country during the Golden Week.
China Railway Guangzhou Bureau Group Limited (hereinafter referred to as the "Huang Iron Group" ) stated that during the Golden Week of the National Day this year, the Guangqiang Group expected to transport 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 1.55,000 times and an increase of 9.2 per cent over the same year.
In order to meet the travel needs of passengers, the Guangqun Group plans to drive 104 additional trains on the high-speed train and 85 on the low speed train, focusing mainly on hot-gate lines such as Kinguang, Xiaokun, Guangcheng, Hong Kong and Hang High Iron.
Guangzhou Bai Yun Airport will be the busiest airport in the interior during the Golden Week of the National Day this year. It is expected that more than 1.4 million passengers will be transported and more than 9,200 flights will be flown.
With the increasing number of international routes, the airport is expected to see a significant increase in the number of international passengers compared to the past, which will be a significant feature of the Golden Week holiday this year.
Singapore, Bangkok, Phuket, Jakarta, Colombo, Maldives, Manila, etc. are known to be hot cities for this year's national holiday, and tourist hot spots such as Kathmandu, Kuala Lumpur and Bali continue to explode. Some flights are "hard to ask for."
Some airlines have specifically increased their operating classes, such as: Shenzhen Air has added one new flight per day to Guangzhou-Huni; Iran Mahan Air has added one flight per Saturday to Guangzhou-Tehran; Viet Nam Air has added one flight to Guangzhou-Huni each, on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
In order to ensure vacation security, White Cloud Airport has increased priority job security, such as "Package allocation", "Voice service", "Vanisher security check", and is ready for large-scale delays in the disposal of flights.
According to China’s Southern Airlines, the flight to China’s tourist destinations in China’s interior, such as Hainan, Chengdu, Chenzhou, Xiaohua Mountains, Rim Mountain, Yellow Mountain, etc., this year’s Golden Week in the Australasia, North America and Japan is very hot.
During the Golden Week of the South China Air Plan, 50 flights were added, including 10 flights on the Guangzhou to and from Chiang Mai.
According to the Guangdong Maritime Agency, prior to the festival, serious security risk checks were carried out on priority ships such as the Waterseed Tour Boat, the June Strait passenger ferry, the Pearl River Express high-speed passenger ship and the ferry ferry to ensure the safety of the water traffic during the long vacation period.
During the Golden Week, traffic in Guangdong Province is expected to be at the top of the Chinese list.
The Guangdong Province Transport Group recently issued a holiday highway travel guide, which is expected to increase by around 12 per cent.
In recent days, the Directorate General of Market Supervision has issued a Circular on Strengthening the Regulation of Market Prices during the Mid-Autumn Day of 2018, which requires that price regulation in the area of housing rental and real estate be strengthened, strict regulation of rent collusiveness, hoarding of rental sources, fabrication of false information to help raise rents, excessive charging of fees by binding services, publication of misleading price information, and price offences such as unknown codes.
The circular makes it clear that the early warning of price monitoring needs to be strengthened and market price dynamics closely monitored.
There is a need to pay close attention to the basic necessities of food and oil consumption, such as egg milk salt, as well as to market and price changes in special commodities consumed by local residents on holidays, and to strengthen price monitoring and analysis early warning.
Once the tendentious and illustrious nature of market volatility is detected, timely measures are taken to address it effectively.
To strengthen supervision and inspection of the wholesale retailing of necessities of life, increase the frequency of monitoring and supervision of places that are closely related to the daily consumption of the masses, such as supermarkets and agro-trade markets, and urge operators to act in accordance with the law and in good faith.
The circular states that the priority areas will be strengthened to create a favourable consumer environment; that the state-owned landscape will be strengthened to regulate the price of tickets; that the state-owned landscape will focus on illegal violations such as non-implementation of government-mandated price levels or floating margins, unauthorized addition of charge items, raising the price of tickets by means of irregularities in setting tickets to “campaigns”, high price discounts, tied sales, non-compliance with prescribed specifications, non-implementation of preferential measures, extra price additions, compulsory collection fees etc.
The circular requires that the price regulation of essential necessities of life, especially agricultural products, be strengthened.
The prices of agricultural products that are essential for life, such as vegetables, pork, etc., have fluctuated in some regions in recent times as a result of seasonal changes, natural disasters and sudden outbreaks.
Local authorities need to effectively strengthen the regulation of farm by-product market prices in keeping with local realities, cooperate with relevant sectors to secure stable production and market supply, and organize efforts to conduct market-focused inspections and random spot checks.
Increased frequency of inspections of commodities such as pig meat, which is supplied in a tight supply and has higher prices, and serious investigation of offences such as hoarding Gucci, pushing prices, collusively raising prices, etc.
The circular states that price regulation in the area of housing rental and real estate needs to be strengthened.
In Mid-Autumn and National Day, which coincides with the high season of rental of housing and sale of goods and goods, all regions should pay close attention to the price behaviour of real estate enterprises, intermediaries and enterprises connected with rental of housing, severely correct rent price collusiveness, hoarding of rental sources, fabricating false information to raise rents, randomly charging fees by binding services, issuing misleading price information, unknown price tags etc., increase the scrutiny of price labels in hot-marketed buildings and real estate intermediaries, inspect consumer interests such as failure to comply with the
The circular mentioned the need to ensure effective price regulation in other parts of the tourism industry, focus on regulating price order in catering, accommodation, shopping, sightseeing, entertainment, parking, etc., guide operators in their biding and billing efforts, and seriously investigate price offences of all kinds.
The circular states that the inspection of transport prices, such as roads, railways, civil aviation and water transport, will be intensified, and serious checks will be made on violations such as price increases, extra-price charges, non-fixed bid prices, etc.
Implement a “green passage” for the transport of fresh agricultural products and a no-fee toll policy for minibuses on major holidays.
To innovate regulatory tools and methods of work, strengthen the dissemination of price laws and regulations for offline merchandise retail enterprises and e-commerce platforms, and urge operators to improve price promotion programmes, investigate offences such as false original prices, misleading price indications, non-compliance with price commitments, etc., in accordance with the law.
The journalist was informed on 1st day that, on the fifteenth anniversary of the full tour of the Hong Kong train, three speed lifts had been experienced, and the passenger traffic had so far been increasing; the cumulative total number of passengers travelling to and from the port had crossed 1.7 million.
At the same time, Hong Kong and Australia passengers are cleared of customs for a period of not more than 15 seconds.
On 1 October 2003, the State Council approved the establishment of a temporary border crossing between Shanghai and Kowloon directly, and the Shanghai Railway Port, the first direct long-distance rail passenger crossing to Hong Kong within China, marked the country's already open port pattern for water transport, aviation and land “three wings flying together”.
To date, the Hong Kong train has operated directly for 15 years.
The Shanghai Railway Border Check, tasked with the border check of the port's entry and exit, revealed on the first day that from the start of the operation to the present day there have been three speed lifts of the train from the previous 30 hours to 19 hours of one-way travel; the average annual traffic of passengers transporting the passengers to and from the port has increased from less than 80,000 to more than 150,000; and over the past 15 years, the total number of passengers transporting to and from the port has cumulatively crossed 1.7 million customs posts.
According to the information received, for 15 years, the Shanghai Railway Border Checkpoint for Entry and Exit has signed a police coordination mechanism with the station along the Tsang 9 train, and police officers have been assigned to follow-on supervision to achieve full coverage of 1991 km of service and control.

Chinese journalists will be taken away by the police in the year of the British Conservative Party, and China asks for an apology.
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, the spokesman for the Embassy in the United Kingdom answered the question of a Chinese journalist who had been taken away by the police during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party on the first day.

Do you have any comments?
In response, the speaker said that in the 21 years since Hong Kong returned to its homeland, the practice of "one country, two systems" had achieved great success, and Hong Kong's development achievements were universally recognized.
Hong Kong is the Hong Kong province of China, and Hong Kong affairs are purely Chinese internal affairs.
The Conservative Human Rights Committee used the party's annual meeting to organize a side event to raise awareness of the anti-China separatist forces, and China expressed serious concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We firmly reject any organization that interferes in Hong Kong affairs in any way.
Any attempt or action to promote “Hong Kong independence” is futile.

We demand that the Conservative Human Rights Committee stop interfering in China ' s internal affairs, stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, and that the organizers of the conference apologize to Chinese journalists.

As a global Internet community event, the World Internet Congress has received a high degree of attention and broad recognition in the global Internet arena.
Over the past five years, the World Internet Congress has set up a large stage for the exchange of cutting-edge Internet technology displays, and the wide application of technology outcomes at the Congress has added new impetus to global economic development.
The results were published to bring together the world's Internet frontline technology.
In the area of the Internet, which are the most advanced and visible achievements of the world today?
The leading science and technology results released by the World Internet Congress can give answers.
For the first time, the Third World Internet Congress released 15 leading scientific and technological outcomes.
The results demonstrated were dynamic, wide application and radiation-led, reflecting the latest and most important breakthroughs in science and technology in the global Internet field at that time, and the pace of development and future prospects in the area of web-based information.
The results of the Fourth World Internet Congress were even more spectacular in light quantum computers, 5Gs, artificial intelligence capable of calculating emotions, etc.
The Convening Committee of the Congress set up a committee to recommend world Internet leading science and technology results, made up of 44 eminent experts from 10 countries, including China and the United States, and gathered nearly 1,000 innovations in the Internet field from all over the world. The committee eventually evaluated 18 representative outcomes, including "Wo is the 3 GPP 5G pre-commercial system", "Arm security architecture", "Microsoft Little Ice", "Beidou Satellite Navigation System", "based on the significant applications of the `The Light of the Lake' supercomputer system", etc.
Currently, the Beidou satellite navigation system applications cover more than 50 countries and territories and involve more than 3 billion people.
In total, the supercomputer "The Light of God's Lake" completed more than 2 million operations and supported research on more than 100 applications.
The Microsoft-China research and development team started with Microsoft Little Ice from China, and is currently on the ground in China, Japan, the United States, India, Indonesia, and many other countries. China’s Internet science and technology development often flashes through the world’s science and technology frontier camps, attracting the world’s surprises and becoming a confluence of top technology and a signpost for the world’s Internet.
"The Light of the Internet" exposition offers a new platform for technology exchange

The development of Internet science and technology for the benefit of all peoples
The innovative development driven by Internet technology is ultimately to create a better future for the peoples of the world and to create a more equitable, open and inclusive environment for human well-being, economic development and social well-being.
In a large Internet country like China, which has a large user base, Internet technology has a stronger amplification effect on specific applications.
China's Beidou, for example, provides users with high-precision, high-reliability positioning, speed measurement and timing services and a unique short message communication capability; the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has a reshaping function for traditional industries, promoting industrial progress and playing a positive role in various areas such as finance, transport, health, safety, etc.; and the communications technology of the sky and the earth effectively solves the problems of access to the airplane and high iron, and improves users' Internet experience.
According to the forty-second statistical report on the state of Internet development in China, published by the China Internet Information Centre, China, as the largest Internet market in the world, is contributing to the progress of social development through the digitalization process.
And the dividends of Internet technology development are by no means limited to China, and its achievements also provide a powerful driving force for the development of the Internet throughout the world and for the development of the economy and society.
For example, China ' s cross-border power suppliers and shared economies are moving abroad and increasingly supporting world economic growth. China ' s new generation of information technology such as cloud computing, big data, object networking, mobile Internet, etc., accelerates progress towards deepening the global industrial division of labour and economic restructuring, and reshapes the pattern of global economic competition.
As outlined in the U-town Initiative issued by the Second World Internet Congress, sharing the development results of the network will lead to the early formation of a global network market and the creation of more jobs, which will provide strong support for sustained healthy global economic development and give more countries and peoples a fast ride to the information age.

China's State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking on Friday in the United States Foreign Relations Committee, said that China-United States relations are now once again at a crossroads, and that if both sides look positively at each other, deepen positive cooperation and manage differences properly, they can open up better prospects.
"Chinese-American relations are our common asset and need our solidarity."
He expressed the hope that all sectors of the two countries would have the knowledge to maintain the healthy and stable development of relations between China and the United States through practical action and to jointly promote the continuation of relations between China and the United States in the right direction.
Wang Yi also stressed once again that China is bound to move out of a path of development that is different from that of the traditional Powers.
This Chinese-characteristic path determines that China will not and will not repeat the mistakes of the powerful. It also determines that China will not become the United States, will not challenge the United States, and will not replace the United States.
Wang Yi, in a speech entitled Opportunities or Challenges, Partners or Counteractors, said that the underlying problem of the current problem was that some American friends believed that China would also be strong and powerful and would even challenge and replace the United States as a leader in the world.
"This is obviously a major strategic miscalculation."
He claims, however, that this self-imaginable suspicion is spreading, magnifying existing contradictions, creating new doubts, and making it more difficult for China and the United States to solve specific problems and encounter more resistance.
Wang Yi pointed out that China is following a path of peaceful development.
Chinese never had the genes for external expansion.
We believe that nations can live together in harmony and exchange ideas.
In the past, now or in the future, China will neither replicate the foreign model nor ask others to replicate China ' s practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with former US Secretary of State Kissinger in New York, he said that US-China cooperation would win and Chinese-American cooperation would lose.
China has always been committed to developing long-term healthy and stable relations between China and the United States and to achieving non-conflict, non-confrontational, respectful and cooperative win-win.
China's new office held a press conference on Tuesday to present and interpret the White Paper " Facts about China-China Economic and Trade Frictions and China ' s Position " .
The Vice-Minister of Commerce of China should have announced that China is willing to work to promote bilateral trade in a more balanced direction, and it is hoped that the United States will also show positive gestures.
According to foreign media sources, several cities along the coast were severely damaged by the earthquake and tsunami that hit Sulawesi Island on September 28 in Indonesia. The latest news indicates that the number of people killed has increased to 1,200.
It was reported that the town of Donggala (Donggala), near Pulu, near the epicentre of the earthquake, was hit by two waves of tsunamis, and the authorities believed that the number of people killed would continue to rise as the “72 hours of gold” of relief passed.
On 30 September 2018 local time, Palu, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, rescuers carried a survivor of the earthquake rescued from the ruins of the restaurant.
According to officials of the relief department, the tsunami caused waves of up to 6 metres and the impact of earthquakes and tsunamis was greater than originally estimated.
At the time of the earthquake and tsunami, hundreds of people were said to be celebrating festivals on the beach of Palu, and many were killed by waves.
Officials said that the tsunami had hit the shore at 800 km per hour and that many buildings and infrastructure had been destroyed.
He said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed and that the landslide caused by the tsunami had cut off a major road in Palu.
A bridge across coastal rivers collapsed in Sulawesi.
On 30 September, local time, Indonesian President Zorko visited the city of Central Sulawesi Palu, where the earthquake struck.
Indonesian President Zorko visited the disaster zone on 30 September, said that he had sent troops to assist in search and rescue and called on the victims to be patient.
Zoko pointed out that rescue operations were difficult due to the shortage of heavy machinery and manpower.
He was informed of the lack of food, water, food and fuel supplies in many parts of the disaster zone, and the closure of a number of businesses after the earthquake, which had sent aircraft to drop supplies.
He called on the disaster victims to be patient and to stay in their original positions and wait for rescue.
Search and rescue personnel in Palu city said they heard a call for help from a fallen hotel in the city, but they were helpless because there was no heavy machine to remove the rubble and some needed to save people with their hands.
According to Vice President Kara of Indonesia, electricity and communications were cut off in some areas, leading to poor access to information, and the death toll caused by the earthquake and tsunami could eventually rise to thousands.
The journalist from the November 5 news report (journalist Xu Zhiqiang, correspondent Tianjina) learned today from the Liaoning provincial court meeting on the basic resolution of enforcement difficulties that the Liaoning provincial court, during its six months-long “storm” campaign, severely combated the refusal to execute, transferred 241 persons to refuse to obey the law, and maintained the high pressure to fight the refusal to enforce illegal crimes.
It is understood that according to the unified deployment of the Liaoning High Court, from early April until late September the Liaoning Court launched a semi-annual campaign to essentially resolve the “storm” of implementation difficulties, build up the upper hand and launch a comprehensive general offensive on the basic resolution difficulties of implementation.
At the same time, provincial courts have organized, in accordance with the law, “five groups” of fined, detained, restricted consumption, discredited and disciplined, and transferred a group of persons who refused to commit crimes.
At the beginning of the campaign, there were more than 132,000 outstanding enforcement cases in provincial courts, and the case was cleared at the end of July.

"Where can I take a taxi?"
We want to see the flag-raising ceremony at Golden Purple Square!"
On the morning of October 1, the Song couple who took the flight from Ningxia to Shenzhen and took the first train on the high-speed railway train in Hong Kong, visited a Chinese news agency reporter at the Xiaolong station in Hong Kong.
On the morning of 1 October, in celebration of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government held a ceremony to raise the flag in Kim Yiqing Square.
According to immigration control station statistics, as of 30 September, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via Kowloon Kowloon Station in Gao Tie has crossed 300,000.
On the occasion of the 69th anniversary of the birth of the motherland, the West Kowloon Border Post is expected to have a peak in tourist visits to Hong Kong on 1 and 2 October.
At 7 a.m. on the morning of the first day in Hong Kong, a large number of Mainland passengers took advantage of the Golden Week on the occasion of the National Day and took a trip to Hong Kong.
Mrs. Song, who has taken a short step, said to the journalist that the holidays for the National Day are a rare long holiday of the year, that she is particularly happy and excited to be able to reach this wish on the Fourth of July, as she has always wanted to see the flag raised at Golden Purple Square in Hong Kong.
But now Ningxia's flight to Hong Kong is not easy, so it's better to travel through the Hong Kong section of High Iron. Mr. Song, after checking the train schedule, found that the first bus could arrive at 7.03 a.m. and connected the city's transportation to Golden Purple Square, just in time.
He lamented with the reporter: "It's so convenient, it's fast and it's on time!"
The 70-shift one-hour train to and from Guangzhou, Shenzhenbei and Fukuda and West Kowloon each day greatly facilitated the arrival of residents of Hong Kong, Australia and the Gulf region.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, is on his way to visit Hong Kong's friends at the top of the Central Ribbon.
Mr. Liu said, "The Mainland and Hong Kong are on holiday for the Fourth of July, and we're going to challenge ourselves to see if we can make 50 km of access to Hong Kong."
He explained that if it wasn't for high iron openings, ease of movement and time, they wouldn't be able to easily try to walk a mountain like this.
Mrs. Yang from Dong-jung came to Hong Kong with her 10-year-old son on a high-speed piano contest, and she was proud to tell reporters that her son had spent the National Day in this way for three years.
She's been on a bus in Hong Kong, but she's time-consuming, and she's worried about affecting her son's condition. She's more impressed with the Hong Kong section of the journey, when Shenzhen travels on a high train. She says, "It's like she's on a subway, especially fast, and I haven't had a chance to take a picture!"
On September 23rd, at 6.44 p.m., the G5711 "Harm" high train left from Shenzhen North Station to travel fast, and a few minutes later, the train entered the Hong Kong section of Hong Kong, the first such train to be officially operated in Hong Kong.
The high-iron Hong Kong section, integrated into the country ' s 25,000-km high-iron network and reaching 38 long-distance stations throughout the country, has also welcomed tourists from the interior of different provinces in the north and south of the country.
Mr. Gao, who came from Changsha to visit his family in Hong Kong, told the journalist that he was happy when he came home to eat his children's lunch, after he could only ride to Shenzhenbei, take the subway to close Hong Kong and then transfer the city's transportation, in exchange for trouble and time, and now sit directly at the Kowloon Centre.
He said that the "two-by-one" customs clearance process was exceedingly convenient, and that "in less than 10 minutes, both have passed."
The West Kowloon station, which is close to the airport speed line and connects land and air traffic, has also become the preferred location for a large number of transit passengers.
Miss Wu, from Fujian, is going to spend the Golden Week with her friends from Hong Kong to the Philippines, pushing her luggage at West Kowloon, saying to reporters: "I didn't expect to catch the plane so soon. Time is more than enough!"
According to the Trade Agreement subsidiary arrangement announced on Monday, the new US-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement will preserve the ability of US President Trump to implement the 25 per cent tariff threat on imported cars, while at the same time exempting imported passenger cars, pickups and car parts from Canada and Mexico from duties.
If Trump imposed so-called “chapter 232” tariffs on cars for reasons of national security, Mexico and Canada would have a car quota of 2.6 million exempt cars per year exported to the United States.
Piccards produced in both countries will be completely exempted from customs duties under subsidiary arrangements.
If Trumpuga imposed car duties, Mexico would receive a $108 billion annual tax exemption quota for car parts, and Canada would receive a $32.4 billion quota.
Both quotas are well above the current levels of production in both countries and provide room for growth in exports from both countries.
Reuters/Mexico, 28 September - Mexico Friday said that after several days of controversy, the government of US President Trump and Canada were making real efforts to resolve trade policy differences, giving the outside world hope that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would be maintained in the form of a tripartite agreement.
Despite the lack of detail, the above evident progress is sufficient to prompt the Governments of Mexico and the United States to abruptly suspend their plans to publish the text of their trade agreement and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexico's President-designate, Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador, told journalists in Mexico that the United States Government had made new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and said that he would continue to press for the participation of all three countries in NAFTA.
The Minister of Economy of Mexico, Ildefonso Guajardo, stated that the time for submitting the text of the US-Mexican trade agreement to Mexican and United States legislation had been delayed because Canada and the United States Government had tried to reach an agreement “very seriously”.
Guahardo said, "In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a text of a tripartite agreement or whether we have to publish the text of the agreement between the two sides."
Guahardo said that his American and Canadian counterparts had “specially requested” to delay the publication of the text.
The spokesperson for the United States Trade Representative Office (USTR) did not comment on the text of the US-Mexican Trade Agreement and the consultation between the United States and Canada.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada did not respond to requests for comments on counter-proposals.
According to the foreign media, in a care centre in the suburbs of Pretoria, South Africa's capital, two small lions play together, and it's hard to see anything unusual, but they're nothing else.
The University of Pretoria declared: "This is the first young lion ever born by artificial insemination - the first pair of lions in the world."
School scientists are working on the reproductive system of the mother African lion.
Gans Winter, Director of the Mammal Research Institute of the University of Pretoria, said that the two young lions, one male and one female, born on 25 August, were healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally reached this breakthrough.
When Ganswinter was interviewed by the media, he said, "We collect sperm from a healthy lion."
The researchers then perform artificial insemination when the hormone content in the female lion reaches the appropriate level.
Ganswind said: "Luckyly, the result was successful."
He said that the researchers "carried out several attempts, but unexpectedly, they did not spend much effort."
He said that the aforementioned research breakthrough could be repeated and that scientists wanted to use the technology to save the endangered giant cats.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, lions are extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of surviving wild lions has fallen sharply by 43% over the past 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
African lions are classified by this organization as vulnerable animals.
Gans Winter said, "If we don't do something for these animals, they will face extinction."
He said that the new technology did not have to allow lions to be raised, but simply injected sperm into a pregnant lion's mother, just as North America and Europe had done to raise elephants.
South Korea's exports fell the largest in more than two years in September, but analysts attributed the decline to fewer days of work and said that global demand for Korean commodities remained strong despite rising trade tensions in Central America and the United States.
Indeed, South Korea's average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, the early release of the opening data shows a double-digit increase in exports in the first weeks of September prior to long holidays.
Korea ' s September exports fell by the largest on a year-on-year basis since July 2016, a decline greater than the 5.7 per cent projected by 11 Reuters analysts.
The opening value announced on Monday showed exports of $50.6 billion in September, down from $51.2 billion in August.
Despite fears that the ever-increasing US-China trade dispute might cause other export-dependent Chinese neighbours to suffer, South Korea ' s exports to China grew by 7.8 per cent in September, expanding for the first 23 months in a row.
Korea's exports to the United States fell by 11.8 per cent because of the decline in sales of petroleum products.
The overseas sales of Korean memory chips and petroleum products grew by 28.3 per cent and 13.5 per cent, respectively, despite market concerns that the so-called chip “supercycle” might have peaked.
“The effects of the trade conflict will, however, be difficult to avoid, as South Korean exports depend heavily on the United States and Chinese markets.”
Imports fell by 2.1 per cent to $40.8 billion, less than 3.1 per cent of the projected growth of the Reuters survey.
The trade surplus in September started at $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
According to the Ministry of Industry, the global manufacturing industry will remain buoyant thanks to the United States and EU countries, which is a favourable factor for Korean exports.
The statement states that “Increased export prices resulting from higher oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year.”
"But the continuation of the trade conflict between the US and China, coupled with increased market volatility following the US interest rate hike, are all negative pressures on exports."
Exports per working day increased to $2.6 billion in September and $2.1 billion in August.
Korea's mid-autumn season fell from 24 to 26 September this year, so there were only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than in the same period last year.
Korea 's exports in January-September grew 4.7 per cent compared to the same period last year.
According to the Japanese Menstruation/Markit Procurement Manager Index, Korean manufacturing activity rebounded in September, but was supported by domestic orders because orders from China and Japan fell, which threatened to cloud prospects for another export.
North Korean media criticized the US for not relaxing sanctions against the DPRK.
The Korean Labour News published an op-ed article in the September 30 Journal criticizing the United States for seeking dialogue with the DPRK while not relaxing sanctions against the DPRK, calling it a "compromise" approach.
According to the article, United States Secretary of State Pompeyo 14 said that "the key to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is the implementation of sanctions against the DPRK" and stressed that the position of the United States to continue to implement United Nations sanctions resolutions remains unchanged.
In the Singapore-DPA-US Joint Statement, both sides pledged to establish a new relationship between the DPRK and the US that corresponds to the aspirations of the Korean and American peoples to a peaceful and prosperous future.
There is no doubt that it is contradictory for the United States to increase the pressure of sanctions and demand dialogue.
The article says that if new relations between the DPRK and the United States are to be established, a peaceful regime permanently consolidated on the Korean peninsula is to be built, and a complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is to be achieved, confidence-building should be put first, starting with what can be done, and a phased solution should be achieved on a case-by-case basis.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions are not going to work for North Korea.
The article says that even the North Devinsk before the Kazan is to be admired by the US army.
The National Interest magazine quotes the American Navy: "We will meet a powerful potential opponent. Just look at the North Devinsk submarine is enough."
The current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, Fogo, also praised the "North Devinsk" submarine.
He said, "This submarine is impressive. Looking at the development of the Russian navy and how resources are used, the main effort in research and development is to strengthen the submarine fleet."
But the National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this area.
Fogo said, "I believe that Western countries still have asymmetric advantages."
There were earlier reports that the Russian Navy would be loading the Kazan submarine in 2019.
The " Kazan " , "New Siberia " , " Krasnoyarsk " , and "Alhangelsk" multi-purpose submarines are "White Wax Tree-M" modified, draining 13,800 tons, depth deep down 520 meters, staffing 64 people, underwater speed 31 knots, carrying torpedoes, torpedoes and "calibre" and "Zimanau" cruise missiles.
The Xinjing newspaper (journalist Nil Wei) General Directorate of Radio and Electricity issued a circular on September 29 on the introduction of special corrections for radio and television advertising, and since that date, special corrections for radio and television advertising have been carried out so far and at the end of the year.
The elements of the reform include advertisements on low content, style and taste, medical feeding programmes that are broadcast without a record management, etc.
According to the circular, the focus of this special treatment was on nine areas of identification and consolidation.
These include: advertisements with directional problems; advertisements with low content, tone and low quality; advertisements with excessive time and non-standard broadcasting problems; advertisements with exaggerated false propaganda, misleading audiences, or advertising with a programme-style variant, such as medical, pharmaceutical, medical devices, health-care foods, cosmetics, beauty, etc.; medical feeding programmes with unrecorded broadcast problems; advertisements with exaggerated false propaganda, misleading audiences, seducing audiences to engage in fraudulent negotiations, investment finance, collections, etc., with expectations of return on investment; advertisements with incentives to create undesirable behaviour among minors or to create undesirable values
This overhaul will cover the entire country, and the requirements for correction and regulation will be fully implemented at all levels of the wide-banded media, frequency of channels, programme columns and time slots. "No blind areas, no dead spots, no exceptions."
The circular requires that the various types of illegal advertising found in the supervision and inspection be dealt with by the authorities at all levels of the wide electricity administration in strict accordance with the General Directorate ' s " Treatment of Non-compliance by Radio and Television Broadcasters " .
If the violation is serious, serious treatment is given to dissuasive conversation, notification of criticism, suspension of the broadcast of advertisements until the broadcast of the frequency channel is suspended, and public exposure to society, as appropriate.
In recent years, the General Directorate of Electricity and Electricity has repeatedly called for the closure of illegal advertisements.
This year, the General Directorate of National Radio and Television issued an announcement calling for the closure of advertisements for serious irregularities such as the "0-buboured fruit milk", "Sava chickentail" and "Bonret plant protection against disinfection" and exaggerating propaganda and misleading audiences.
The General Directorate of Radio and Telecommunications has developed regulations and circulars to regulate advertising on radio and television.
The Circular on the Further Enhancement of the Administration of the Video Channel Broadcasting of TV Shopping Advertisements stipulates that television Shopping Shorts Advertisements shall not be broadcast from 18 to 24 a.m. every day.
In other slots, television shopping spots are advertised without the use of a moderator, "sale style" exaggeration, tone, movement, etc., or "orthopaedic", "plasticity", "exploitation fat" or other propaganda or disguised promotion of breast-rich and dietary products, with no more than one (twice) of television shopping spots per hour per day, and no more than three minutes per article.
The Circular on Further Strengthening the Management of Broadcasting of Radio and Television Advertising stipulates that television stations must strictly comply with the General Directorate ' s Order No. 61 when advertising in the middle of a film and television drama: two commercials may be inserted in each episode of non-gold time (45 minutes) for a maximum of 1 minute and 30 seconds each; one commercial can be inserted in each concentration of gold time (1900-2100 hours) for a maximum of 1 minute; when advertising is inserted, instructions should be given about the duration of the advertisement.
The circular also stipulates that radio and television broadcasting agencies will strictly examine the qualifications, certifications, etc. of health information advertisements, such as medical, pharmaceutical, medical devices, health food, etc., and firmly prohibit the broadcasting of sex-related advertisements.
In order to regulate the form of health information advertising, it is forbidden to advertise in the form of health information features.
Health information features should focus on scientific knowledge such as disease prevention, control and treatment, should not contain advertising content such as medical, pharmaceutical, medical devices, health-care foods, and should not testify in the name of patients and doctors, pharmacists, specialists, etc.
Mantourov said, "We made the first adjustment to the format of the MAKS international aerospace salon. We suggest China become a host country. China's peers agreed and accepted our invitation."
Not long ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the fourth Eastern Economic Forum at the invitation of Russian President Putin.
This was his first time attending the Forum.
Ignore the American threat!
EU or will enter into a crude oil procurement agreement with Iran
The United States Government recently announced that a new round of sanctions against Iran would resume in November and even urged other countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil.
However, the allies of the United States do not seem to listen.
According to the United States New York Times, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed when he was interviewed on 29th that Tehran was nearing an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil, despite the threat that the United States would impose sanctions on any country doing business with Iran.
The central purpose of the agreement was to try to create a new payment mechanism, i.e. to replace dollar transactions with barter or local currency denominated.
The purpose of this approach is to hope to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from blocking financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is working to promote the agreement, some French and British officials are concerned that if the agreement were to materialize, it would be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States against the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement.
According to the media, Zarif's words sound more optimistic during an hour's interview than in recent months.
Because the agreement has the ability to “severe” the traditional allies of the United States and effectively break the American attempt to cut Iranian revenues.
"This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit from it," Zarif argues, according to the agreement reached in 2015, that countries have a legitimate right to trade with Iran.
The EU Foreign Policy Leader Federica Mogherini also said before, "No sovereign state or organization can accept others to decide who they can trade with. "
However, she also predicted that, before the next sanctions were imposed by the United States Administration in November, United States leaders might use a range of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries with business dealings with Tehran.
In May this year, the United States Government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement on the grounds that the agreement was flawed and stated that the agreement could not permanently ban the production of nuclear fuel in Iran.
The United States subsequently threatened to ban companies buying Iranian oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.
This threat led to the evacuation of some companies from Tehran and a sharp fall in the Iranian currency.
Companies like Airbus and French oil giant Dadal have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said that the U.S. government might "take the upper hand".
However, according to a recent Turkish media report, the United States sanctions do not seem to have had a significant impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iranian oil minister Zangane recently revealed that no country other than South Korea had stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani believe that the aim of a series of American actions is to “entice” Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also concerned about a series of verbal attacks on the US side, and when asked whether the US would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing fiscal pressure, Zarif even laughed, "It is a strategy of regime change, and that is the real purpose of the US."
"Remember Fonghua at the heavy cruise cannon station": the opening of the Cultural Tourism Market at the Xiamen Huri Mountain Artillery Artillery
In that year, the first broadcaster from Fujian front radio station to broadcast Mandarin in Guannan, Chen Fei, came to the gun station to remember and tell the history of the gun.
The famous tourist attraction area and the Xiamen Huri cannon station, which is separate from Kimmen, were the home of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PRCLA) for the establishment of the “front-line radio station”.
On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the opening of the Front Line Radio station, on the 30th day of the day, the scenery area organized the event of the Greater Tourist Artillery Station, which invited several historical witnesses of the Front Line station in that year, to speak about the historical evolution of the cannon station and to witness the evolution of cross-Straits relations.
The history of the cannons was told by witnesses at the frontline radio station in that year.
This is one of the activities in the second series of the "Course of Cultural Tourism of the Xiamen Huri Artillery Artillery Artillery" , which was built with great effort in the Hurry Mountain View Area.
Prior to this, the first event was successfully organized to create exclusive cultural tourism branding activities that combine cultural tourism IPs, creative market fairs and traditional folk culture experiences.
On that day, under the direction of the Xiamen City Brigade Development Committee, the second edition of the cultural tourism fair, "The Ancient Artillery Artillery " , hosted by the Xiamen Hurley Mountain Artillery View Area, was officially inaugurated. During the six-day event, the main theme of the event will be "Friends" of Mid-Autumn and National Days, where the people who came to visit the tour will experience the strong south-south scene in the "Eats" and "Swap" and " Buy
The concert "Hearing the Voice of the Sea" has become a major focus of the Artillery Cultural Tourism Fair.
Wang Yong, Director of the Huri Artillery Artillery Authority, introduced the event on the 60th anniversary of the launch of the front radio station of the Huri Mount Artillery Artillery of the Liberation Army, which invited several of the old radio crews of that same day to tell about the history of the cannon station and to remind people of the past.

And "Xiamen 40 years you and I" -- the old photo selection event, where an award-winning exhibition of works is set up in the view area, digs deep through a temperature picture of those moments of happiness and movement.
The regulations for the promotion of ecological civilization in Fujian province were adopted by a vote of the thirteenth session of the Standing Committee of the Fujian People ' s Congress on September 30th of the Chinese News Agency Fuzhou (journalist Longmin) on September 30.
"Green Water Qingshan is Silver Mountain", which was first enshrined in Fujian provincial legislation, throughout the entire regulation, became operational and enforceable.
Fujian is China's first national eco-civilization test site.
According to the Head of the Rule of Law Office of the Fujian People ' s Government, it is necessary and urgent to form a basic regulatory framework for the construction of ecological civilization from a holistic and global perspective in order to solve the problem of regulating the construction of ecological civilization through scattered regulations and regulations and policy documents alone, as well as to provide the legal basis for the formulation of relevant regulations, normative documents and measures.
The ordinance fully reflects Fujian's characteristics and translates mature experience practices in the construction of ecological civilization into statutory forms for its application: for example, the replicable and replicable "Janting experience" in the management of Fujian water and soil conservation, which has developed, and for which the regulations take stock of the experience of water and soil conservation management in Fujian province, stipulates that local people's governments at and above the county level should strengthen their unified leadership of soil and water conservation, and define water and soil erosion prevention priority areas and governance areas based on the findings of the water and soil erosion survey;
The regulation provides for a lifelong accountability system for damage to the ecological environment.
Those who violate the requirements of scientific development and cause serious damage to the ecological and environmental resources are held accountable for life to the leading cadres and the persons responsible for their leadership responsibilities.
It was reported that the Fukuk Province Regulation on the Promotion of Ecocivilization Building will be implemented on November 1st this year.

In order to further encourage foreign investors to invest in China, China ' s Treasury Department and four other ministries jointly advised that, as of 1 January 2018, profits allocated to offshore investors from resident enterprises in China would be used for direct domestic investment without the application of pre-taxation policies, and that projects in the foreign investment incentive category would be expanded to cover all projects and areas where foreign investment was not prohibited.
The relevant circular published on the Ministry of Finance website states that foreign investors must meet several conditions at the same time, including direct investment by offshore investors with a profit share, including equity investment such as replenishment, new construction, equity acquisition, etc. by offshore investors with a profit share, but excluding additions, transfers, acquisitions of shares in listed companies (except eligible strategic investments).
It also includes profits from offshore investors that belong to equity investment gains such as dividends, dividends, etc. resulting from the actual distribution by resident enterprises in China of realized retained earnings to investors.
The profits of offshore investors for direct investment are paid in cash, and the money in question is transferred directly from the profit distribution enterprise's account to the account of the investor's enterprise or equity transferer, and cannot run in other accounts within or outside the country before the direct investment; the profits of offshore investors for direct investment are paid in non-cash form, such as in kind, marketable securities, and the ownership of the assets in question is transferred directly from the profit distribution enterprise to the investor's business or equity transferor, and no other enterprise or individual may hold or temporarily hold on behalf of the other
The circular also states that offshore investors actually recover direct investment benefiting from the withholding of income tax policy through equity transfers, buy-backs, liquidation, etc., and file with the tax authorities, within seven days of the actual collection of the corresponding payment, in accordance with the prescribed procedure, the payment of deferred taxes.

Since 1 January 2017, profits distributed by foreign investors from residential enterprises in China have been invested directly in encouraging investment-type projects. Any person who meets the prescribed conditions has implemented a deferred tax policy and has refrained from raising income taxes.
At the Standing Meeting of the State Council of China, weekly decisions were taken to extend the scope of application of foreign reinvestment without pre-taxation from encouraging foreign investment projects to all non-prohibited projects and fields, and to further strengthen intellectual property protection.
Journalists learned from the National Board of Health and Hygiene that the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in our country has decreased compared to decades ago, while the incidence of overweight obesity has increased significantly.
In this regard, experts pointed out that the most important idea of maintaining healthy weight is to "repair the disease" and to promote scientific fitness and reasonable diets.
According to the Chinese Youth Health Education Core Information and Interpretation (2018 edition), published recently by the National Health and Health Board, the key to maintaining healthy weight is a reasonable diet and science movement.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are detrimental to health.
The health risks behind the Little Fatty cannot be ignored.
China ' s Center for Disease Prevention and Control ' s Nutrition and Health Unit Director Ding Jianqiang said that overweight obesity endangers the normal growth and development of young people and adversely affects their psychological, behavioural, cognitive and intellectual well-being, even leading to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood fat among children.
At the same time, overweight obesity among adolescents can easily continue into adulthood, increasing the risk of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes among adolescents as adults.
Ding Gang said that the nutritional and health status tests of Chinese residents in 2010-2012 showed that the rate of overweight among young people aged 6-17 years was 9.6 per cent, and the obesity rate was 6.4 per cent, which together was 16 per cent.
At the same time, overweight obesity among children and adolescents is characterized by higher levels of male than female and urban than rural, and the overweight obesity rate has risen significantly in recent decades.
How do teenagers cope with overweight obesity?
According to Zhang Zhang, Deputy Director of the Scientific Physics and Health Promotion Research Centre of the National Directorate of Sports, the main reason why young people are obese at present is excessive heat intake and insufficient physical activity.
For this simple obesity, the emphasis should be on scientific motion plus reasonable dietary control.
Zhang said that one of the most important concepts of maintaining healthy weight is the concept of "the cure of the disease", one of which is important is to provide schools, parents and students with a full range of general education, to spread the dangers of overweight and obesity, and to raise the awareness of young people about prevention.
Adolescents should undergo regular medical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight, and detect early, scientificly determine whether there are problems of overweight and obesity in order to intervene in a timely manner.
For young people who are already overweight, Ting Qiang recommends that, in addition to the active scientific organization of meals and sports, young people are in a special physiological phase and should refrain from using hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and reduce their weight, and should not blindly take diet drugs.
Reuters September 28 - Facebook (FB.O.) says on Friday that hackers steal digital landing codes, giving them access to nearly 50 million user accounts, which are unprecedented in history and represent the most serious security gap in their history.
Facebook monthly users over 2.2 billion said that it had not been determined whether the attackers abused any accounts or stole personal information.
The company also did not find the location of the hacker, nor was it certain that the hacker was targeting specific victims.
Its preliminary analysis showed that it was a wide-ranging attack.
Executive Director Zuckerberg called the incident "really serious" at a media teleconference.
A spokesperson for the company stated that his account number, as well as the account number of the operator Sheryl Sandberg, had also been affected.
Facebook stock prices fell by 2.6% on Friday, dragging down Wall Street's main share finger.
U.S. Congressman said on Friday that the attack might increase external calls for data privacy legislation.
"This is yet another sad piece of evidence that Congress needs to act to protect the privacy and security of social media users," said Democratic Senator Mark Warner in a statement.
Rohit Chopra, a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), said on Twitter that I wanted an answer to Reuters's coverage of this security gap.

"The veterans of the resistance are witnesses to the Chinese resistance and are true, vivid and visible teaching materials for patriotism."
Liu Xiao, former Vice-President of the Political Consultative Council of Hunan Province, said that it was a valuable spiritual asset to the present generation of war veterans who were brave and forgotten my patriotism.
In his address, the Vice-President of the Changsha Municipal Association and Chu Jianjun, the Main Committee of the Chang Sha City Committee, stated that in recent years, the project "Care for War Veterans", by providing care services to war Veterans in the form of living allowances, free old-age pensions, free burial, etc., has become an excellent brand in the work of Changsha citizen Ge ' s social services.
He believes that the spirit of resistance can only be inherited if history is engraved in the heart.
At 11 a.m., the people who came to the event stood up in a solemn and heavy music.
The members of the Chinese troupe troupe were dressed in tuxedos, with flowers, with neat steps to send 10 other war veterans and 4 other war veterans to their companions in a neat queue.
The participants in the event paid their respects to the war veterans, and there were many children in the crowd. Together with their parents, they paid tribute to the war hero.
China People's Mankind Park against War Theme Park was established in 2014 as the country's first mausoleum on the theme of fighting against war, created by the Changsha City Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in collaboration with Hunan Tang People's Mankind Gardens Limited.
The first phase of the mausoleum took over 2,000 square metres of land and consisted of components such as the "hero immortale", "The Victory Square", "The title of the war hero" and so forth.
The "War Fighter Heroes Garden" provides a cemetery behind the Qingren War Heroes free of charge and is praised as "The Last Army Camp of the Fighter Veterans".

Since 2015, there have been seven collective funeral ceremonies for war veterans, where 102 war veterans and partners have fallen asleep.
On October 1st, the newly revised " Protocol for the Movement Control of the Three Gorges-Gong Chai Dam Water Hub " (hereinafter referred to as " the Movement Control Protocol " ) was officially implemented by the Chinese news agency Yichang on October 1st. After two years of piloting, the three gorge lifts formally unified their schedule with the gate.
On the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, the three isthmus-Gega Chau Dam waters were well-organized.
At 2100 hours on 30 September, the Yangtze Third Gorge Shipping Authority released its first security screening plan and conducted security checks on 160 ships, and 124 vessels qualified for security screening.
At 1400 hours on 1 October, the shipping department arranged the first exit plan after the new regulations were implemented.
Following the implementation of the new regulations, the security screening plan is published once a day at 9 a.m. and 21 p.m., and the dam plan is published once a day at 14 p.m. and at 20 p.m., allowing ships the flexibility to arrange the dam plan.
The Movement Control Protocol adds the principle of "classified control" of the ship's passage by dam control, specifies the priority of the ship by dam according to the anchor and the functional positioning of the lifter, and adjusts the short-line passenger ship by the gate to the same priority level as the model ship and the bona fide ship.
It was also two weeks after the launcher's test operation that the ship's schedule was formally harmonized with the gate.
For the first time, the Great Long-Wang demonstration ship and the new energy-powered ship of the Kawajiang and the San Gorge Bank have also been prioritized.
At the same time, the Movement Control Directive adjusted the "Trainway Control Management Water" from the previous 180 km near dam water to 541.8 km water from Yunyangjiang Bridge to Ishijiang Bridge, and divided the "core waters, dam waters, control waters, dispatch waters".
This would facilitate the ship ' s choice of suitable waters to stand by and reduce the backlog of ships waiting in dam areas.
The Movement Control Directive also introduces integrity restrictions such as the cancellation of declarations for ships in violation of the regulations and the 24-hour delay in crossing the dam, based on the characteristics of existing ships passing through the dam and waiting for locks.
With the water held by the tri-gorges, the conditions of navigation in the reservoir area have improved and have contributed to the rapid development of the Yangtze shipping.
The data show that the annual cargo throughput of the three gorges and the Goose Dam has increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons respectively in 2017.
In the past two years, the Tri-Fister has been on board 5767 ships, with 1,622,000 passengers and 1,71.28 million tons of cargo.
Chen Dongwon, Deputy Director of the Three Gorges Navigation Authority, said that the Movement Control Directives had a positive effect on promoting integrity through the gates, maintaining the traffic order of the two dam hubs, defusing pressure from vessels in the dam area and increasing navigation capacity.

With the approval of Prime Minister Li Keqiang, the State Council recently issued the Decision on the Management of the List of Licences for the Production of Industrial Products for Further Depression and Simplified Approval Procedures.
The Decision proposes to further depress the catalogue of industrial production licences, eliminate 14 categories of industrial production licences, and delegate the authority to manage four categories of industrial production licences to the quality technical supervision department of the provincial people ' s government.
As a result of this reform, products subject to industrial production licensing will be reduced from last year ' s 38 types of pressure to the current 24 categories.
The Decision makes it clear that simplified approval procedures are applied to products in the catalogue.
The first is to change the pre-licensing product test from the pre-licensing product test organized by the licensing authority to a product inspection conformity report issued by a qualified inspection and inspection body submitted by the enterprise at the time of application.
Second, in addition to dangerous chemicals, production permits can be obtained through formal qualification after a subsequent on-site examination of the products licensed by the provincial People ' s Government ' s Quality Technical Supervision Authority (market supervisory authority), after which enterprises submit applications and product-test conformity reports and make commitments to ensure product quality safety, after which they are subject to on-site examination within a specified period of time.
Third is the different categories of products in the catalogue of enterprises' production and operation, and in accordance with the principle of “one business, one business, one business”, a licence is reviewed and issued together with a new licence application or an application for a change of licence.
The Decision requires that the regions and relevant departments firmly advance the work of reducing the inventory and simplifying the approval process.
Increase the commitment of enterprises to publicizing and following up on site reviews, strengthen credit monitoring and restraint instruments, implement corporate quality subject responsibility, and revoke production licences without exception for false promises or non-compliance.
For products that are regulated by the cancellation of industrial production licences, the actual strengthening of after-action supervision involves products such as public health and safety, environmental protection, etc. that can be converted to mandatory certification, positive lists and social publicity, uniform certification standards, reasonable reduction and certification of testing projects, and mandatory certification costs are, in principle, institutionally borne by the various levels of finance.
Support measures to encourage voluntary certification by enterprises, promote branding and market expansion.
It is important to promote the quality of industrial products by applying advanced international standards to the subject matter.
Make full use of the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality safety of industrial products.
To preserve products regulated by industrial production licences, improve the standard system, take advantage of the industry's regulatory advantages, strengthen the responsibility of “who approves and who supervises” and dynamically assess product quality safety risks, press down catalogues at the right time, delegate approval authority or convert to certification management.
In September, China consolidated PMI ring comparison raised manufacturing PMI ring comparison down.
The data released by China ' s National Statistical Office on 30 September show that China ' s combined PMI output index was 54.1 per cent in September, higher than the previous month ' s and annual averages of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that the production and business activities of Chinese enterprises remained stable overall.
In that month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index made up of the combined PMI output index were 53.0 per cent and 54.9 per cent, respectively, and the ring was one-litre lower.
Of this, China’s manufacturing PMI is 50.8%, and the ring ratio is 0.5 percentage points down.
Zhao Qinghe said that manufacturing PMI has five main features this month:
The first is that the basics of manufacturing are generally stable.
Of the 21 industries surveyed, 14 have PMIs located in expansionary areas, with manufacturing PMIs, such as pharmaceuticals, specialized equipment, electrical machinery, etc., at a higher operating level of 53.5% and faster.
The second is small fluctuations in supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0 per cent and 52.0 per cent, respectively, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, and supply and demand continued to maintain the climate, but expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and import index were 48.0 per cent and 48.5 per cent, respectively, lower than 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points in the previous month, and the climate was at a low point in the year.
The fourth is the increased cost of procuring raw materials for enterprises.
The main raw material acquisition price index was 59.8 per cent, an increase of 1.1 percentage points over the previous month, and the exit price index was 54.3 per cent, which was the same as the previous month, all of which was higher during the year.
The fifth is the robust operation of large enterprises, and the performance of small-scale enterprises continues to improve.
The large enterprise PMI is 52.1%, which is the same as last month. The index has remained in the expansion zone of 52.0% and above since this year, and both the production index and the new order index ring ratio have risen this month, which is the main driving force behind the manufacturing sector ' s continued expansion; the medium-sized enterprise PMI is 48.7%, which is less than 1.7 percentage points in the previous month, and is located in the contraction zone; and the small-scale enterprise PMI is 50.4%, which is higher than 0.4 percentage points in the previous month and has risen
In that month, China ' s non-manufacturing business activity index was 54.9 per cent, an increase of 0.7 percentage points over the previous month and a two-month recovery.
Zhao Qinghe believes that the overall development of non-manufacturing industries continues to be steady and positive.
The index of business activity in sectors such as road transport, securities, real estate, etc. continues to be below the critical point, and the total volume of business has decreased.
Reuters Nagoya on November 5, Japan’s central bank president, Kuroda Dong-hyun, said that the central bank realized that long-term implementation of ultra-lax monetary policy could squeeze financial institutions’ profit margins and could destabilize the country’s banking system.
But he said that given low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Central Bank of Japan needed to maintain its large-scale stimulus plan while paying close attention to the advantages and disadvantages of its policies.
"The Central Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that financial institutions will be increasingly influenced by their strength under continued monetary easing," said Tomie Kuroda in Nagoya's speech to corporate leaders.
He argued that if financial institutions were more active in taking risks to compensate for the shrinking profit margins caused by low interest rates over the years, there would be a risk of volatility in the banking system in the event of serious negative shocks.
"Although these risks are not so great at present, the central bank will follow the situation closely and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures," he said.
The minutes of the meeting of the Central Bank of Japan, which were published earlier on Monday, showed that the cost of long-term easing policies was rising during the September meeting of the Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Japan.
According to the minutes of the meeting, one member said that if the economy continues to expand, "the central bank of Japan will have more policy flexibility in the future."
According to the minutes of the meeting, another member said that, given the limits of the duration of the policy, the Committee should discuss how long the central bank of Japan could sustain the stimulus policy.
Heroda said that the central bank of Japan would assess the financial risks associated with easing policies, while also taking into account the uncertainty surrounding Japan ' s economic prospects, which could affect global demand as a result of China-United States trade friction and growing protectionism.
"The impact of this kind of problem on Japan’s economy is temporarily limited," said Tohiko Kuroda.
"How the problem persists, the impact on the Japanese economy may become greater," he added.
"There is a need to sustain strong monetary easing policies while considering both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner," said Dong-il Kuroda.
Despite the increase in the ills of radical stimulus schemes, such as long-term low interest rates that erode the profitability of financial institutions, the low inflation has forced the central bank of Japan to maintain the scheme.
The central bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the dispute over the global trade war, Dong-hyiko Kuroda ruled out the possibility of raising interest rates in the near future.
June 1, 2018, corporate logo of the Tesla electric vehicle, Cardiff, USA.
Under a settlement agreement, the Tesla car of the United States and its executive director, Mask, have agreed to pay $20 million in fines to the financial regulatory agency, and Musk will resign as chairman of the company, but will still serve as CEO.
The settlement agreement will end Tesla's two-month unrest.
The securities fraud allegation settlement agreement disclosed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday would reassure investors.
Investors feared that the protracted legal dispute would only further damage the still-deficient electric car company.
SEC sued Mask for fraud on Thursday, claiming that its tweets of 7 August misled investors.
According to the tweets, he was considering privatizing Tesla at $420 per share and obtaining financing.
According to SEC, these tweets are virtually unfounded and the resulting market turmoil harms investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts argued that the agreement might strengthen Tesla, which had been hit hard by Mask's recent behaviour.
Steven Heim, the head of Boston Common's asset management, said that the settlement agreement should make Mask more supervised, without taking any “destructive” measures to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds Panasonic shares from Tesla's battery manufacturer.
According to the proposed agreement, Tesla had to appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop controls over Mask ' s external communications.
"It is in the best interests of our markets and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, to resolve the matter quickly under agreed terms," said Clayton, Chairman of SEC, in a statement.
The Thursday charges led to the evaporation of about $7 billion of Tesla ' s market value, which was $45.2 billion on Friday, down from $47.5 billion in general purpose vehicles.
In the settlement agreement, SEC withdrew its demand to remove Mask from the post of head of the company.
Many investors claimed that the punishment would be disastrous.
"I think it's the best possible outcome for all concerned," Ivan Finnseth of Tigress Financial Partners said, Feinseth gave Tesla a "neutral" rating and said that SEC punishment was "minor punishment" for Mask.
"He still works as a CEO for Tesla."
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC charges in the settlement agreement and did not respond immediately to the request for assessment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
The Beijing Morning News (Reporter Wang Ping) Beijing Morning News journalist learned a day ago from the Beijing Construction Industries Group that one of the core buildings of the Beijing World Park Park Park complex - the Beijing World Park Show Square project will for the first time use a multi-colour ETFE puzzle structure, 5440 m2 of film structure will display deep red, dark green, orange, blue, red, green six colours, and under the Lasso steel strang-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
According to Liu Jiabao, the project leader of the Beijing Construction Worker Group Five Project, the theatre square was built in an area of 4,500 square metres, with a total of 1,182 tons of steel installed, the steel-structured housing was supported by a suspension steel rack with 26 umbrellas, and the shape of the "butterfly wings" was displayed under the pull of the Raso steel hanger.
"From the sky, looking down at the show square, the colorful house is as if it were a flowered, twilighted, and the colours of the colours will not fade over time and the rain and rain of the wind."
Previously, the monochrome ETFE film structure had been widely applied to bird nests, water cubes, etc., but the multicoloured ETFE film structure was the first in the country.
Journalists learned that each inch of the film structure material is “precious” because there are very few suppliers with the capacity to produce multiple colour film structures around the world.
Liu Changbao said that, in order to avoid overlaps in the position of the headlines and "fights", it would also be innovative to use the "double ear" headline structure to ensure that the "fight" headlines are in the right place through a specially designed fixed plugin.
The construction of the Beijing World Park complex in 2019 is currently under way.
Of these, the international pavilion project has completed all the “blonde” suspension works.
It is planned that the project will be ready for presentation by the end of October.

The Secretary-General of Xi Jinping made a very important speech at the Private Enterprise Symposium, which injected firm confidence into the movement of the private economy towards a wider arena.
The Secretary-General of Xi Jinping stressed that "let entrepreneurs take off the burden of thinking and move on lightly" created a strong resonance among a wide range of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market dynamism comes from people, especially entrepreneurs, and from entrepreneurship.
In the 40-year period of reform and opening up, there have been tens of millions of stories of entrepreneurial innovation, and the growth and growth of the entrepreneurial community has constantly pushed China ' s economy forward.
For some time now, people in society have made some negative and skeptical remarks about the private economy.
Misadventures such as the so-called “private economy exit theory” and the “new public-private partnership theory” have raised doubts and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some exporting firms; rapid adjustment of demand structures has put pressure on transformation and upgrading; some policies are not harmonized, policy effects are added up, or the working methods are simple, leading to the opposite effect of some initially well-intentioned policies.
There is a combination of factors, difficulties in the private economy, difficulties in the running of some private enterprises, and a lot of anxiety on the part of entrepreneurs.
Against this background, correcting the misperceptions of perception, unbundling entrepreneurs' intellectual baggage, allowing enterprises to pursue development with one mind, and the Government to promote development with one heart, have a particularly profound relevance in terms of market confidence and development expectations.
The symposium once again stressed the important conclusion of the three unchanged: "The status and role of the non-public economy in the economic and social development of the country have not changed!"
In recent years, the Party's central focus on entrepreneurs has been unprecedented, and institutional safeguards have been strong, from the deep push for decentralization, the establishment of a power list system, to the creation of a rule-of-law environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, the creation of a level playing field, and the creation of an atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs throughout society.
The symposium made it clear that policy initiatives strongly supported six areas of private enterprise development growth and launched a series of practical actions aimed at “light-loading forwards” for private enterprises.
All this is a great source of inspiration for the entrepreneurial community and greater expectations for all sectors of society.
The fog spreads, the guidelines are set, and the key is implementation.
It is important to constantly create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve the difficulties of their development and help them to transform and upgrade China ' s economy. It is important to make entrepreneurs feel fair in the competition of markets, feel safe in their legitimate operations, feel respectful in their social life, stimulate creativity and create potential.
China's economy has entered the process of moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to carry out their ambitions and providing greater space and arena for entrepreneurs to play their creative role.
We have reason to believe that, as reforms are further deepened and obstacles removed, the private economy will rise to better development prospects and opportunities and move to a wider stage.
All 46 regulatory certificates of Inner Mongolia ' s import and export chain are verified online - new Chinese network
China-News and Hot November 5 (Reporter Lee Aiping) and Hut Customs News 5 reported that, from that date, all 46 regulatory certificates of the local import and export chain have been verified online, except for exceptional circumstances such as the need for confidentiality.
Inner Mongolia enterprises can declare relevant documents to customs in a paperless manner, avoiding problems such as previous field runs, paper applications, repeated submissions, etc.
It is understood that the document preparation time refers to the preparation time of the various types of documents required for the import and export chain prior to the declaration and is a major factor affecting the overall customs clearance time, which must be reduced if customs clearance time is to be reduced and customs clearance costs reduced.
There were 86 different types of regulatory documents previously required for customs clearance at the import and export levels, involving 19 departments.
This time, according to the principle of “cancan cancel, can merge, can quit the exit port inspection” and rely on the international trade “single window” platform, customs interfaces and data interconnections with the other 16 licensing agency systems, resulting in data multi-routing and business less running legs.
Customs said that in the past enterprises had to return to and return from the field halls of the departments concerned to submit paper applications, and that the process was lengthy and could not be followed up on the status of the audit in real time.
Business users can now directly access the "Single Window" portal and apply online.
After clearance by the licensing department, electronic data on certificates are transmitted to Customs and automatically compared to customs clearance data, intelligent verifications are carried out during customs clearance, the results of audits are sent to enterprises through a single window and the entire process of regulatory document declarations, clearances, customs clearances and feedback is processed online.
Han Xin chicken soup exports to China have increased 20 times in four years or have been associated with an increase in the number of young people in empty nests - the China-New Network
The export of Han Xin chicken soup to China has increased 20 times in four years.
The Korean League reported on 5th that last year Korean chicken soup exports to China were over $100,000, which was about 20 times higher than in 2013 four years ago.
According to the analysis, this increase is related to the increase in the number of young people in China's empty nests, which is responsible for facilitating the sale and sale of food, as well as to the increased interest of young people in nutritious food.
The data was published on 5th day by the Korea Agricultural and Aquatic Food Circulation Society (AT).
The exports of Chinese chicken soup to China last year amounted to $1003.39 million and weigh 21.859 million kg, a sharp increase of 2094 per cent and 3668.8 per cent, respectively, compared to 2013.
The analysis found that the increase in sales of Chinese chicken soup in China is related to the increase in the number of young people in empty nests leading to easy food hot selling, and to the increased interest of young people in nutritious meals.
As of this year, one-person households in China have broken the 200 million mark and are expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020, and local food companies have been targeting the "single people" for a variety of convenient food items.
In addition, the analysis indicates that avian flu is the biggest impediment to the Chinese mainland market for chicken soup.
According to aT, the avian influenza outbreak in Korea between November 2016 and April of last year resulted in a drastic reduction in exports due to a total ban on exports of chicken soup to China by the authorities concerned.
In 2016, Chinese chicken soup exports to China amounted to $840,000, and exports fell sharply to $100,000 last year as a result of avian flu.

"The celebration of the National Day flag ceremony at every significant time of New Year’s Day, Spring Festival, National Day, etc. not only shows China’s image, but also inspires the love of the people of all ethnic groups in the border region."
The soldiers and soldiers of the band who took part in this flag-raising ceremony said so.
According to the information received, the National Gate Tribute Brigade, which is responsible for the flag-raising ceremony at the estuary, consists of more than 40 officers and men from various positions at the border checkpoint at the estuary, from the three-person flag-raising team to the size of the band, which has gone through more than 60 years and has carried out more than 70 national foreign service courtesy missions since its formation.
The newly revised personal income tax law adjusts the criteria for determining Chinese personal income tax taxpayers from one full year to 183 days.
China ' s Ministry of Finance and the relevant head of the State Tax Administration said on 30th that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing preferential arrangements for persons outside China, including Hong Kong and Macao.
The Officer-in-Charge said that the implementing regulations of the current personal income tax law had special preferential provisions for the taxation of persons outside China. Individuals who did not have a residence in China but lived for more than one year and less than five years could pay personal income tax only for part of the unit or individual paid in China.
The portion paid outside China is not subject to personal income tax in China.
The Chinese Ministry of Finance, the State Tax Administration, the State Development and Reform Committee and the Ministry of Commerce have also issued circulars expanding the scope of application of the policy of withholding income taxes from foreign investors in order to distribute profit direct investment.
The profits allocated to offshore investors from residential enterprises in China are used to withhold the application of the pre-taxation policy for direct investment in China. Projects in the foreign investment incentive category are expanded to cover all projects and areas where foreign investment is not prohibited.
During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, some positive messages were released around the Korean peninsula.
The Korean President in Cao relayed the DPRK's “irreversible” determination to abandon nuclear weapons and said that US President Trump and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un might meet before the end of this year.
The United States Department of State subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompeyo would visit North Korea in October to facilitate the implementation of the Singapore commitments of the leader of the United States and the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea to meet.
From the beginning of this year to the present, inter-Korean efforts to break the ice opened the path of dialogue, inter-Korean and inter-Korean leaders met, the general trend towards de-escalation of the situation on the peninsula continued, and the principle of dialogue to resolve the problems on the peninsula was upheld.
First, the point that "the essence of the question of the peninsula is security issues" has not changed, and the key to achieving peace in the peninsula is the proper and balanced resolution of the legitimate security concerns of all sides, rather than the mere pressure on each other to emphasize their own claims.
Secondly, in the dialogue to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned were divided on the steps and ways to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, and the idea of “who first after whom” remained strong because of the chronic lack of political trust between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States.
At the Council's open meeting on the Korean peninsula, held at United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices surrounding the issue of sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea were highlighted once again as the two points of the Korean peninsula were “no change”.
United States Secretary of State Pompeyo insisted that sanctions against North Korea would not be lifted until the Korean peninsula was completely denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, on the other hand, stressed the principle of “action in response to action”, noting that “the weakening trend of sanctions should be the same step as the step taken by North Korea on the step-by-step nuclear path”.
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement fully, fully and accurately the resolutions of the Security Council relating to the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea, but pressure is not an end, and the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are the requirements of the resolutions of the Council, both of which must not be sidelined or chosen.
As stated by China ' s State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in view of the current positive developments in inter-Korean and inter-Korean relations, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider initiating reversible provisions in due course, thereby encouraging North Korea and all concerned parties to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress made in the peace process will require sufficient political courage on all sides.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community for a political solution to the issue of the peninsula, the parties concerned should, in particular, demonstrate political courage, make political decisions, implement commitments and resolve difficult issues, continue to move forward in a step-by-step manner, advance the process of denuclearization of the peninsula in parallel with the establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula, and work together to create a permanent peace on the peninsula.
A message from the People's Government of Pingji County, Pingxi City, Shanxi Province, on 1 day said that during the National Day, the Yellow River Cattle Casket Area, located in the county, would remain at a relatively high water level and would not have open conditions.
In order to ensure security, the scenery area was temporarily closed during the National Day.
Yellow River pot mouth waterfall is China's second largest waterfall, the largest yellow waterfall in the world.
The Yellow River has come to this point, and the rocks on both sides are stung, and the mouths of the river are bound as small as the mouths of the pots, forming the "one pot of the Yellow River for a thousand miles".
According to journalists, June-October of each year is the Yellow River season, which began on July 12, 2018 and has been closed for almost a month due to the high water levels of the Yellow River, which began to be closed.
Nie Woo Feng, the chief engineer of the regional management committee of the Cattle View, said to the media that this was the longest time that the Yellow River's high water level had lasted for nearly 20 years. "It wasn't about that long before, we closed in 2017 for four days, and this year for almost a month."
It is understood that, in order to meet the “XI” Golden Week, the Yellow Valley Cattle Falls Zone in Shanxi was already in place, with an early increase in staffing arrangements and vehicle maintenance, and even the hiring of temporary staff.
According to the circular issued by the "Omnibus Telegram from the General Command for Drought Control of the Yellow River" on the implementation of the Yellow River during the National Day Day, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan and Shandong provinces were asked to do the Yellow River during the National Day.
At present, the main flow of the Yellow River is large, the flow of the upper stream is maintained at 2,000 to 3,000 cubic metres per second, the flow of the central river is maintained at 2,500 to 3,500 cubic metres per second, and the flow of the lower river is maintained at 3,000 cubic metres per second.
Health centres and health stations provide influenza vaccination services especially during the national holiday.
The Department of Health ordered 150,000 doses of a four-priced influenza vaccine for 2018-2019 this year, giving priority at this stage to high-risk persons for free vaccination and vaccination against influenza during public holidays. The health centres and health posts under the Department of Health provide vaccination services especially from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on national holidays (1 and 2 October).
In addition to the above-mentioned measures for the population, health centres and health posts under the Health Authority have, since the introduction of the plan, extended the flu vaccination service on Mondays to Fridays until 8 p.m. As of 4 p.m. on 30 September, 4,158 people had been vaccinated, which is more than 3,714 in the same period last year.
Free vaccinations are provided to the following Macao residents: persons under 6 months to 18 years of age, persons under 50 years of age and above, pregnant women, all chronically ill persons, including obese persons (i.e. persons with a body quality index BMI of 30 or more), as well as employees of institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools, all health workers, and residents of Macao who work in play fairs.
At the same time, other persons, including the public sector, whom the Health Bureau deems necessary to inoculate, will actively contact the relevant agencies to obtain the list and arrange the vaccination at the health centre.
To facilitate inoculations and reduce waiting times for provincial vaccinations, the Department of Health will send health-care personnel to Benwa Secondary School, Primary School, Kindergarten and Child Care Centers between October and December this year to carry out group influenza vaccinations for young children, small and medium school students, teachers and employees, etc. In addition, the Department of Health will arrange for group vaccinations to be carried out in homes for the elderly and the handicapped, the larger public sector or other institutions, etc.
Students and young children who have not been able to participate in group vaccinations may be vaccinated at the vaccination station or health centre of the General Hospital of the Count of Insight from December 3, 2018 on the Macao identity card, the Health Board user card, the influenza vaccination card (if any), the student certificate, the employee certificate or the professional certificate.
The Department of Health reminded residents that between September 2017 and August 2018, persons who had been vaccinated against the influenza from 2017 to 2018 still had to be vaccinated against the influenza of another season since September 2018, as the influenza antigen component contained in the influenza vaccine of the northern hemisphere from 2018 to 2019 was updated to target the seasonal flu of the winter of 2018 to 2019 and the summer of 2019 in the northern hemisphere.
In Macao, the flu peak usually occurs in January-March of each year, later than in temperate regions (e.g. North China and Japan). The Health Bureau calls on high-risk persons, such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese people and chronic patients, who are more vulnerable to complications following the influenza infection, as well as those who are in constant contact with high-risk persons, to be vaccinated as soon as possible.

The journalist learned on the evening of 29 September from the propaganda department of the Qing Baijiang District Committee in Cheng City that on the night of September 29 Beijing time, a central European row (Sengdu), full of goods such as car connectors, telescopes, liquid crystal displays, etc., was changed via the Chemia Nufka port in Poland and turned to Nuremberg, Germany.
This is the first time that Central European Banlet in the country has opened the Polish Chemianufka port line, marking the successful opening of another European transport line after the Central European Benjai after Mara and Jopp.
The Central European class was launched on September 14 by Chengdu Qingqing Shihjiang City station, exited through the Arashan Pass, entered Europe via the Semyan Nufka crossing in Poland, and eventually arrived in Nuremberg, Germany, for a total duration of about 16 days.
For the first time, the Central European class travels here to perform the conversion of the broad and track of the class.
The opening of the crossing effectively resolved the problems of long operations and long periods of time caused by the current traffic congestion at the Malala border crossing, raised the ban on transport and provided new solutions to the problem of traffic congestion at the Mara border crossing, further enhanced the carrying capacity and transport efficiency of China's western hinterland to the Euro-Mediterranean market, and laid a solid foundation for the opening of the European market by Central European banje.
There was a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday in Sulawesi, Indonesia, and more than 400 people have now been confirmed dead. Many of them were driven away by tsunami waves triggered by the earthquake.
The authorities expect that the total number of Sunday deaths will increase significantly as remote areas report new data.
It is reported that dozens of people are still trapped beneath the ruins of a hotel and a shopping mall in Baru City.
The earthquake caused a wave of up to six metres (20 feet) that struck the city of Baru.
To date, there have been only deaths from Baru, the number of deaths reported in Dungla, north of Baru, is slow, and the authorities are preparing for a worse situation.
Dungla, with a population of 300,000, is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
According to Vice President Kara of Indonesia, the total number of deaths is likely to rise to thousands.
When the waves hit the coast on Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate the festival, many were washed away by the waves and everything was destroyed wherever the waves went.
Reuter Tokyo, October 1 - The Japan Central Bank published a short view survey quarterly report on Monday that showed that the confidence of Japan ' s large manufacturers in the September season reached the lowest level in more than a year because of the rising cost of raw materials and the effects of a series of natural disasters on production, which put pressure on businesses.
The survey hardly showed that the escalating friction of global trade undermined the confidence of large manufacturers.
The risk of a full-scale trade war, however, undermines business prospects and may threaten corporate capital spending.
Active capital spending is one of the bright spots in Japan's economy.
The survey called into question the view of the Central Bank of Japan that sound economic expansion would help accelerate inflation rates to reach the 2 per cent target, although there were indications that firms were gradually passing on costs to customers.
"In the context of concerns raised by the global trade war, the confidence of manufacturers has stagnated as a result of the slowdown in exports and weak factory production," said Nan Wuzhi, Chief Researcher at the Golden General Research Institute in Agroforestry.
"Confidence is still high. And I don't think confidence will continue to decline as business profits improve and prices rise."
Short view surveys show that the large manufacturing landscape judgement index fell from positive 21 three months ago to positive 19 in September, which is the third consecutive season to deteriorate.
The market estimate median is positive 22.
In September, the large non-manufacturing weather judgement index fell from a positive 24 to a positive 22 survey in June, the first deterioration in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey is positive 22.
The survey showed that both large manufacturing and non-manufacturing weather judgement indices remained stable in December.
Investors don't care about the decline of the short-sighted business landscape judgement index. The Japanese stock market index.N225 went up Monday to 27 years high. The continuous depreciation of the yen helped improve the export profitability prospects of Japanese enterprises.
Capital spending is robust.
Despite the decline in corporate confidence, the latest short view highlights the robustness of business capital expenditure plans, the benefits of upgrading productive capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to cope with labour shortages caused by population ageing.
According to the Central Bank short view survey, large enterprises planned to increase capital spending by 13.4 per cent in the current fiscal year until March 2019.
The previous short view survey was 13.6%.
Nan Wuzhi said that the capital expenditure plan for all enterprises for the current fiscal year grew by 8.5%, close to the pace of Japan's bubble economy.
He said, "There is still room for further growth in capital spending, given the increase in small-scale enterprises in the forecast of profits from now on, but much depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence."
Short view surveys show an increased ability of enterprises to transfer costs, with the large enterprise output price index of positive 7, a high point over a decade, which is an encouraging sign of progress in Japan ' s efforts to counter deflation.
The index for measuring the employment status of large enterprises, reaching negative 23, is the most compact level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
The second quarter of the Japanese economy has rebounded since the contraction of January-March of this year, benefiting from strong corporate spending.
However, the upgrading of trade frictions in summer and the disruption of supply chains by natural disasters have overshadowed the prospects of the Japanese economy, which is dependent on exports.
In dollar terms, the rate of increase in services imports and exports is 16.4%.
The Ministry of Commerce website press release quoted the head of the Division of Services and Trade as saying that the total value of imports and exports of new and emerging services in January-August was over $1 trillion, increasing faster than overall.
Of these, the total value of new services imports and exports was 1,138.39 billion yuan, an increase of 20.9 per cent, which was higher than the overall rate of increase in services imports and exports by 10.4 percentage points, and the share of new services pulling up nearly 3 percentage points.
With regard to services exports, in January-August services exports continued the rapid growth momentum since this year, with exports growing at a faster rate than imports at 5.7 percentage points.
Among them, the top three areas of acceleration were telecommunications computers and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, and insurance services, at 61.1%, 38.8% and 26.5% respectively.
The Officer-in-Charge of the Division of Services and Trade also noted that the share of imports of new and emerging services had also risen gradually in January-August.
Emerging services imports grew rapidly in January-August, accounting for 23.6 per cent of services imports, an increase of 1.6 percentage points over the same period last year.
Of these, financial services, royalties on intellectual property rights, telecommunications computers and information services have increased by more than 20 per cent, 47.1 per cent, 23.3 per cent and 23.2 per cent, respectively.
Xijia: Macy took over the battle to help bring down the battle, and three rounds of the Union of Bassasa were won.
After the 7th round of Barcelona's main battle against Bilbao last night, the first half of DeMarcos' goal to help the guest team lead, and the second half of Macy's back-to-back fight to assist Munir's score, the 1:1-square game between the two sides ended, three rounds of Bassa lost.
Macy and Buskerz are on the run.
The score fell behind, and Macy showed up in the second half of the game.
The one-off Bassa has already won three rounds of the tournament, and the royal horse has not won a victory. Bassa is still at the top of the list with a net-win advantage, but the difference between the third and last Seville is only one point.

Indeed, China has developed particularly well in recent years and has made me happy.
Happy Chinese National Day!
The price of oil, or the arrival of a "three-in-a-kind" trip, can be filled in early.
On September 30, at 2400 hours, the Chinese and new network called Beijing (journalist Qiuyu) will open a new round of price-fixing windows in conjunction with the long holiday at the National Day.
A number of agencies predicted that oil prices would increase significantly to achieve the "three consecutive rises".
The owners of the cars who plan to travel on their own can fill the car with oil before the price rises.
On the basis of data from the data from the Royal Information Survey, it is expected that the relative increase in the domestic finished oil will be around 190 yuan/tonne, and that the increase in the data from the Treasure Information Survey will be 220 yuan/tonne.
Oil prices have already increased twice in September: on 3 September, gasoline rose by 180 ton, diesel by 170 ton, gasoline by 145 ton and diesel by 145 ton on 17 September.
Domestic oil prices are tied to international oil prices, and international oil prices have risen since the current round of pricing cycles, and Brent crude oil continues to explore after it has broken through the $80 threshold.
As of 28 September, the collection of WTI crude oil futures in the United States had increased by US$ 1.13 and reported US$ 73.25 per barrel.
Brent's crude oil futures increased by US$ 1.0 for US$ 82.72 per barrel.
“In the light of the international situation, tensions such as the US sanctions against Iran have increased, and oil prices have generally tended to be biased, followed by a meeting at the OPEC Conference to derogate from production, which clearly refused to increase production, gave market confidence, and the price of oil has steadily moved up.”
Cheuk's information-finished oil analyst Xu Wen just said.
On the retail side, the current price of petrol in Beijing for petroleum and petrochemical gas stations 92 and 95 is $7.66 and $8.15, respectively.
According to Li Ying, China's public information analyst, there has been no significant change in the marketing strategy for preferential promotion of gas stations. The current preference range for main stations, such as Central petrochemicals, is 0.5-0.7 yuan/litre, while the preference for private stations is 0.5-1.2 yuan/liter.
"The retail price of this wheel is about to rise ‘three consecutively,’ and the equivalent price increase is about US$0.14-0.16, suggesting that the owners of private cars should reload their oil before the long holiday comes."
Students who make mistakes are subjected to corporal punishment by their teachers, and the schools involved disqualify them from annual ratings - the new Chinese network.
In response to the incident of “Suhning a primary school student who was subjected to corporal punishment by a teacher on the wrong subject”, the official Weibo of the Suining City's Hedong New District Council issued an information circular yesterday stating that it had been found that the teachers of the Suzhou primary school in foreign languages, Lo XX, had physically punished students and had been removed from the teacher's post, and the school involved had disqualifyed from the annual `optimity'.
There was a recent response from parents that Suning 1st grade 6 girls were beaten up at school by class math teachers for making mistakes.
Subsequently, the Social Services Bureau of the new district of Suning City set up an investigation team in the school to investigate, interrogate, gather evidence from the scene and remove the teachers involved from the teaching post.
Yesterday, the official Weibo of Suning City's New District Council issued an information circular stating that it was found that RoXX, a teacher at Suzhou's primary school in foreign languages, was responsible for the physical punishment of students.
According to research, the year-end test of the Suzhou primary school in foreign languages was "no vote" and the annual "optimal" qualification was cancelled.
The circular also states that the administrative class of the Suzhou primary schools in foreign languages is subjected to a collective dissuasive conversation, that the division leadership and the class guidance are dealt with in accordance with the relevant regulations; that the teachers involved are transferred from the teaching posts and seriously dealt with in accordance with the relevant regulations; and that they are ordered to carry out a thorough examination of the schools in the foreign language in Suzhou and to carry out a teacher-student construction campaign and take practical measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.
At the same time, schools are expected to communicate with parents on their own initiative to properly handle follow-up work.
Opening of the 69th International Astronautical Congress in Germany - China New Network
The 69th International Astronautical Congress of the Xinhua Society, Bremen, Germany, October 1st, (Jan Koo, journalist) opened the curtain on October 1st at the Bremen Exhibition Centre in Germany, attended by more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and businesses, expert scholars and young students from all over the world.
Jean-Yve Legar, President of the International Astronautical Federation (IAF), in his opening address, said that the global space cause was no longer the involvement of only a few countries and institutions and that the number of participants had increased significantly this year compared to the previous session, indicating that an increasing number of institutions and personalities were joining.
He called on all nations to strengthen cooperation and innovation and to work together to advance the cause of space.
In attending the exchange, the Vice-Minister of Industry and Informationization of China and Director of the National Space Agency, Zhang Keyu, presented China ' s space programme and said that China would expand its international cooperation in space and contribute to the space cause of mankind.
The participation of relevant institutions such as China Space Science and Technology Group, China Space Science and Technology Group Corporation and a number of private business representatives demonstrated China ' s recent achievements in space, including launch vehicles, satellites and space science and technology applications.
The International Astronautical Congress, which has been held annually since 1950, is the largest gathering of the world ' s aviation community.
The Congress lasted five days and was co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Centre for Applied Science and Technology and Microgravity Studies of Bremen University and the International Institute of Space Law.
According to a press release issued by Reuters Beijing on November 5, China ' s Foreign Trade Centre on Sunday, the Hiroshima meeting showed that China ' s foreign trade situation remained complex and serious, with 80.6 per cent of enterprises expected exports throughout 2018 to be better than last year or flat.
But considering the external environment, where the costs of domestic raw materials, labour, etc., are constantly rising, and where trade friction between China and the United States is increasing, participating enterprises at the same time consider that the export situation next year is not promising.
At the closing press conference of the 124th ordinary session, the Deputy Secretary-General of the inaugural meeting, the press spokesman and the Deputy Director of the China Foreign Trade Centre, Xu Jun, said that the number of foreign buyers attending the current meeting and the conclusion of the export deal had fallen by the same amount.
189,812 people from 215 countries and territories came to the current procurement firm, a decline of 1.11 per cent over the same year.
Exports were paid RMB 2,064,494 million (equivalent to $29,860 million), a decline of 1% over the same year.
From the market point of view, Japan, the 10 ASEAN countries, the "BRICs" and Korea have been able to increase by 74.4 per cent, 11.4 per cent, 7.2 per cent, 2.5 per cent and 30.3 per cent, 8.9 per cent, 7.3 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively for traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union.
In terms of industry, means of transport, mechanical equipment, building and decoration materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, protective bathing equipment grew by 24.8 per cent, 21.1 per cent, 20.0 per cent, 15.1 per cent, and 7.6 per cent respectively. Textile clothing and domestic appliances fell by 13.0 per cent and 6.7 per cent respectively.
Xu, as a barometer and wind sign of China ' s foreign trade, data on the participation and export of the buyers of the current Guangxi meeting show that China ' s foreign trade development will still face a number of uncertainties and uncertainties next year.
However, as structural reforms on the supply side are advanced and recent national and local policy measures such as the "Six Steady" have been introduced, the new dynamics of China's foreign trade development are accelerating their accumulation, and the diversification of enterprise markets is making new progress, which are important foundations and strong conditions for foreign trade development.
China’s foreign trade exports and imports are expected to continue to grow steadily throughout the year, and the quality and efficiency of foreign trade will be further improved. “Integrate factors, China’s foreign trade imports and exports are expected to grow steadily throughout the year.”
China ' s General Customs Administration announced that exports in United States dollars grew by 14.5 per cent in September, imports by 14.3 per cent in September, trade surplus by $31,690 billion in September, and export growth and trade surplus by September were the highest since February this year.
Although China ' s export performance in September was significantly higher than expected, despite the rising friction between China and the United States of America ' s trade, and despite the fact that the foreign demand was strong, the firms seized exports and the renminbi exchange rate depreciated before the United States imposed customs duties, or the main supporting factors, to some extent showed the resilience of China ' s foreign trade, the Chinese-American trade war struck confidence and the impact on the industrial chain, and analysts believe that the challenges of China ' s foreign trade are likely to emerge in the fourth quarter or next year.
The Reuters survey showed that in September, the US fund manager proposed an increase in cash holdings and maintained a cautious stance, as the US and China began the latest round of mutual import duties and duties, and the dispute showed no signs of détente.
However, the 12 fund managers participating in the survey recommended that North America ' s asset allocation increase to its highest since June 2017, while the UK, the euro zone and, in particular, emerging markets, have declined.
Global stock allocation averaged 56.6% and bonds 35.5%, largely consistent with last month’s survey.
The most obvious change was that the cash allocation had risen to 5.1 per cent, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager from a large foundation firm said, "Some economic data bring confidence to the market, but the trade war remains the biggest concern, so it is better to be ready to enter when the market falls."
Fund managers, however, continued to favour equities in September, especially in the United States, even though United States equities were considered to be overpriced.
Today, in China's open landmark, the world's first large national exhibition on the theme of imports — China's International Import Expo — officially opened up in expectations.
An exhibition is like a "window" that gives the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the Expo, people saw moving towards a higher level of "open China"; with the "window" of the Expo, the world was welcomed as a mutually beneficial win-win with China's "reform open again".
"For a country, openness is like breaking a cocoon into a butterfly, which will experience pain for a while, but will be replaced by a new life."
Xi Jinping's secretary-general's summary of the opening road revealed an important reason why “China can”.
Looking back at 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which has dared to penetrate the world market, has always faced all the risk challenges in an open gesture, constantly unleashing internal dynamics and constantly improving its competitiveness, despite its experience of vortex and wind waves.
It can be said that China, with its own solid achievements, has forcefully interpreted the value and meaning of openness.
At the beginning of the new history, the organization of the Expo on the theme of imports was a major decision taken by the Party Central, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its heart, to promote a new high-level opening to the outside world. It was a major initiative by China to open its markets to the world. It was a practical move by China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization. It demonstrated the strong and clear intention that “China’s opening doors will not be closed, but will only grow larger”.
And the most positive and optimal response to China’s growing open economy in the larger, wider field and deeper is the "one difficult to ask" seat for all countries to sign up.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have built up high walls of trade protectionism and turned back to the old path of unilateralism, raising the international community ' s concerns about the prospects for free trade and adding many uncertainties to the world economy, which is warming back.
In the context of such an era, this event at Huang Pujiang is an expression of China ' s defence of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets and shared future Chinese self-confidence and China to assume its role.
Solo fast, so far away.
China ' s open-mindedness and embrace of the world have not only made a powerful contribution to its own development, but have also brought to the nations and regions of the world a huge “China opportunity”.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the building of a "one-way" together, initiated the creation of the Asian Investment Bank and set up the Silk Road Fund ... China has provided a range of international public goods, provided real export markets, opportunities for development and jobs, and allowed national enterprises to take a "fast ride" to China's development.
The Expo is also such a public product, a large platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in China ' s market with their distinctive quality products and services.
In addition to national enterprises, domestic consumers are the real beneficiaries.
By setting up this platform of “optimal selection”, it provides a high-quality supply with multiple channels for upgrading consumption and meets the needs of the population in terms of individualization, pluralism and differentiation in consumption.
As China opens its doors and opens them up, the goods flow freely, and the goods are used to their best, the steps towards a better life will be stronger.
From a broader perspective, the significance of the Expo goes beyond economics and trade, but rather towards the future, communicating the concepts of openness, inclusion, inclusion, balance and win-winness, and forming a common understanding to meet today ' s challenges.
The world is better, China is better; China is better, the world is better.
We look forward to the great and successful event that will bring to the world; we look more forward to a higher level of “open China” and the world working together to build a bright future for the community of human destinies.
Foreign media: The United States and the United States agreed on a framework agreement for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The [summary] agreement includes Canada ' s opening of its dairy market to the United States and the United States ' temporary withholding of customs duties on cars produced in Canada.
According to the foreign media, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of September 30, local time, that the United States and Canada had concluded a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It was revealed that the agreement included Canada ' s opening of its dairy market to the United States and the United States ' temporary withholding of customs duties on cars produced in Canada.
On 27 last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary principled agreement to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement by the 31 August deadline set by the United States side to extend the duration of the negotiations until 30 September.
Previously, Canada’s Foreign Minister Freeland’s spokesperson said that Canada would only sign a favourable agreement, “focusing on substance, not timetable. We will continue our consultations and hope to reach an agreement that is in Canada’s national interest.”
More than 90% of Brazilian female voters said that presidential candidates did not take women's needs into account.
According to the South American Diaspora, data published recently by the Brazilian National Institute of Geography (IBGE) show that more than 90 per cent of Brazilian women do not think that the presidential candidate takes women's needs into account.
According to the report, the number of women in Brazil has now reached 107 million, and if Brazilian women are brought together to form a country, the country's population will be ranked 13th in the world, twice the size of Spain's population.
In Brazil, where 52% of voters are women and 48% are men, the proportion of women among voters is very high, but in the Brazilian Congress it is only 10%.
The participation of Brazilian women in politics is only 154th out of 193 countries globally, higher than in Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women have still not succeeded in acquiring their rights.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori pointed out that this phenomenon exists because of the combined effects of ancient patriarchal societies, racism and capitalist values.
"Political should have been the national’s claim to citizenship, identity, access to public goods and the formation of multiple social groups in the same society. But Brazilian politics belongs to the monopoly of a certain group, and most of the population is not represented."
A previous study by the Brazilian Automobile Institute (Locomotiva) also pointed out that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not feel that politicians resulting from elections could represent their rights, 90 per cent did not agree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93 per cent did not agree with the governance policy of the current government.
"We need to reverse the underrepresentation of women in parliament, and Brazil’s political system is still affected by inequality. So far, Brazil’s political sphere has been marked by serious gender, class, and racial discrimination." Natalia Mori said.
Despite the lack of women ' s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76 per cent of women believed that they could make a difference in democratic elections and 72 per cent were interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to subject women to less prejudice.
On October 1, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn flag-raising ceremony to greet the 69-year-old Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese.
More than 80 representatives of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, news agencies in Kazakhstan, financial institutions, Chinese enterprises, Chinese diasporas, Confucius College and students attended the event.

After the flag-raising ceremony, the Chinese Ambassador to Ha Zhang Xing said that on the occasion of the 69th birthday of the great motherland, we held a flag-raising ceremony in a different country, and it was a profound patriotic education campaign.
Although you have lived abroad for a long time, you are always a great country.
Zhang Xing said that the Chinese people are today closer than ever to achieving the great goal of national renaissance and closer to the centre of the world stage than ever before.
"Our mission, our responsibilities and our work are more glorious, arduous and onerous than ever before."
Zhang Xiang stressed the importance of keeping in mind the original purpose, the mission of promoting the construction of the "one-way" of the "one-way" of the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China, making steady journeys and deep journeys, and drawing a more beautiful "one-way" of the "one-way" of the "workbook" of the "one-way" of the construction" of the "one-way" of the "one-way" of the "one-way" of the "one-way" of the Communist Party of China
The T2 terminal of the Guangxi Guilin International Airport was officially inaugurated on the 30th day.
Zhao Le Qin, Secretary of the Central Chinese Communist Party’s Guiling City Committee, said that the opening of the new terminal would meet the demand for 12 million passengers a year and construct a new advantage of the Chilin air traffic. It would be important to further improve the modern "four-bit one" traffic pattern of the Guangxi River Sea, Sea and Iron Union, Water and Land and Air Port Links.
Guilin is expected to receive 90 million visitors this year.
The expansion of the T2 terminal and the side facility of the station at the two Rivers International Airport is a major public benefit project for the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Guangxi Liang Autonomous Region, as well as a landmark project for the construction of the Guilin International Tourism resort.
The project began work in December 2015, with a construction area of 100,000 square metres, with a total investment of RMB3.258 billion, and will be launched to meet the needs of 12 million passengers a year, 10.12 million flights a year, and 95,000 tons of mail and mail.
On the same day, more than 200 flights took off and landed at the T2 terminal at the two Rivers International Airport in Guilin.
The design of the new terminal is inspired by the waters of Guilin Mountain, a distant view of a "crowd of mountain waters", near the "Long Ridge Trailing Fields" and the roofs of the Guibei People's Diverse, which intersect with the waters of Guilin Mountain.
The new terminal at Guilin Airport was described as meeting the peak traffic of nearly 4,000 people per hour entering and leaving the port, using smart luggage sorting systems, security integration platforms, face recognition, etc., as a technical tool for "intelligent empty ports", and planning commercial areas covering a wide range of business practices such as catering, department stores, tax exemptions and leisure.
As growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets is mostly not encouraging, the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine of global economic growth.
On September 23, 2018, a container cargo ship docked in a port in New Jersey, United States.
However, since the current growth in the United States has benefited from the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts, the economy has also received close attention from outsiders.
"As the United States is returning to full employment, the economic downturn is inevitable."
He said that the only question was when it would happen, and that, in his view, it might only happen sooner than later.
Despite Barclay's optimism about the United States economic outlook by the end of this year, the Bank acknowledged that it would be more difficult to forecast further time.
"In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the potential for economic growth, the current growth stimulated by fiscal policy will not be sustainable," Barclay Economist said in a study.
"In the absence of investment growth, the risk of the economy landing hard in 2020 will rise," they said.
A series of business surveys will show in general terms that major economies are at the stage of the economic cycle at the end of the third quarter.
The Eurozone and United States manufacturing surveys, which are due to be published next Monday, will receive attention, and services surveys will be published on Wednesday.
But next week's data will certainly focus on the non-farm employment data of the United States, which will be published next Friday, and will provide clues as to whether the tight employment market is driving wage growth.
Its importance, not only because it is important for the profitability of businesses and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because salary jumps or overall inflation rises, may cause anxiety among officials of the United States Federal Reserve (Federal Reserve/FED).
“Payroll will be of great concern, as the ring may have risen again significantly over the previous month.
September may not be a break of 3% over the same period of the previous year, but we can well expect a break next month. "The Netherlands International Group (ING) economist wrote in a study.
European politics may become a source of market volatility at a time when vacations in China and other parts of Asia have led to a bleak data profile for the region next week.
The Italian government ignores previous financial commitments to the EU, and the rest of the EU member states will have to quickly determine whether or not to oppose Italy’s decision. Tria does not support the decision, and he wants to abide by EU rules.
The annual meeting of the British Conservative Party in Birmingham may also be sparkling as the British retreat talks enter a critical phase.
At the same time, concerns surrounding emerging markets are unlikely to diminish as Brazil holds the hoped-for presidential election next weekend.
[Summary] When the ship is completed, it will be placed at the disposal of the East China Sea Subdirectorate of the State Ocean Administration of China, and Chen Yi, Chief of the Observatory of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship would be operational and would be of great importance in developing China's offshore ocean observing system and advancing global ocean observations.
On 29 September, China's first 3,000-ton-class large buoy ship, the `Down to Yanghong 22', went under the China Warships Group.
When completed, the ship will break the current equipment bottlenecks in China ' s safeguards work on large buoys, submarine signs, recycling, and looting.
The `Girl 22' wheels are used mainly for regular buoy/submarine cruise maintenance, regular placement, recycling, emergency placement of buoy/submarine buoys, recovery, recovery, recovery, etc. safeguards, while also having the capacity to carry out integrated marine survey tasks, such as gap surveys.
The new ship is 89 metres long, 18 metres wide, 7.2 metres deep and has a continuous capacity of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Xiao, Deputy General Manager of the Wusheng Group, said: "The 22 ships to Yang Hong are the first large buoy operating ship in the country and the only one in the country with 10 metres of large buoy operating capability will further enhance the country’s large buoy security capability."
It is understood that the ship, once completed, will be placed at the disposal of the East China Sea Division of the China National Oceanic Administration, and Chen Yi, Chief of the Observation Branch of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship would be operational and would be of great importance in developing China's offshore ocean observing system and advancing global ocean observations.
“The ship has at the same time large buoy placement repair and repair operations, as well as integrated ocean survey capabilities, and is our first integrated vessel dedicated to mid- and long-sea buoy operations and integrated ocean survey.
With a buoy ship like this, our ocean observation and ocean survey will have a powerful sharp object in the future."
On October 1, China's Qingjia electricity was affected by the typhoon “Pangmi”, the first day of the tournament was postponed until October 1 at the Tsai Qingjia Cup of the international limit sailboat series, scheduled to open on September 30th, and a pre-game meeting was held at the Qingjia Osing Centre before the race, during which the captains of 12 water-wing double-hull fleets from six countries and territories showed up.
Under the influence of the typhoon "Pangmi" and the strong winds in the Hong Kong pool, the maximum speed of which was 24 knots, the departure signal was delayed by almost 90 minutes from 1 p.m. 30 p.m., the wind speed was still not reduced, and the competition was postponed until the afternoon of 1 October, when Anne Mdrand, the Managing Director of the competition, announced the cancellation of the first day of the competition.
"The strong wind from the shore continues, and the state of the sea is far too intense."
Mudrand explained: "In this case, no one knows when the wind will strike the ship.
The race near the city is the smartest option in the current circumstances. "
There is still some disappointment on the part of all prepared crews.
"The ship is ready to stop, and we're in good shape."
Max Richardson, Qingdao's rudder, said: "But I know the game is the right choice, and I hope the wind will be smaller today, and we can do it as soon as we can."
Omika Wilkinson, known as the New Zealand team for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, said, "The loss of a day has made the game more interesting.
'Cause today's game's gonna be worth more and there's only two days left.
We're all going to have to work so hard."
Despite the sea winds, the French ABM rudder Pierre Ives Durand, who met before the race, complained about his warm experience with the Tianqing Island competition: five years ago, the international limit sailboat series had its own accidental injury, broken muscles, and thanks to the handling of the local race medical team, he was able to stand on the field today, five years later.
According to the information received, the International Extremist Ship Series was launched in 2007 and is a world sail league event known as Volvo, the American Cup, the World sailboats versus tour.
The Qingdao station competition will use the FlyingPhantom water wing.
The year 2018 was the eighth year that the race landed on Qingdao Island, the capital of the sailboats, and Qingdao Station was also the battle to take office in the series.
Despite the worldwide financial market shocks, the Hong Kong Financial Services Authority stated on Monday that foreign exchange fund investment revenues fell significantly by 97 per cent each year in the third quarter of this year, but were better than in the previous quarter, and that foreign exchange losses were significantly reduced due to the rising volume of overseas shares in the US during the China-China trade war.
According to the latest data of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the foreign exchange fund recorded investment income of HK$ 1.6 billion in July-September 2018, which is significantly lower than HK$61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Chen Deok-hyun, Managing Director of the Gold Administration, said in the Legislative Council that at the beginning of the China-United States trade war, Hong Kong and emerging market stock indices ran counter to the United States stock index. Until late September and early October, when the United States stock market index peaked, market sentiment began to reverse, as investors became aware that the trade war was detrimental to the United States itself.
"Change in market moods is a good thing, and if the trade war has only a one-sided impact, it won't help the solution."
At the same time, he pointed out, "If the Chinese-American trade war fails, the volatility of financial markets will continue to rise."
In the third quarter of this year, the foreign exchange fund ' s share investment losses in Hong Kong were between 8 per cent and HK$4.7 billion, while the return on overseas stock investment increased significantly between HK$172 and HK$12.8 billion. Foreign exchange losses decreased by HK$16.2 billion and bond gains by HK$9.7 billion, respectively, by 24 per cent and 31 per cent each quarter, reflecting mainly the general increase in the dollar against major currencies during the season and the fact that the United States rate of fruits rose by 3 points in mid-September.
Foreign exchange funds are mainly used to support Hong Kong Won.
Hong Kong has had a linkage exchange rate system with the United States dollar since 1983.
With regard to Hong Kong ' s current financial situation, Chen Deok-hyun said that the economy and asset market uncertainty had increased and downside risks had increased, but Hong Kong ' s financial system was robust, defensive and resilient.
“Hong Kong’s international investment position is abundant, with foreign net assets worth $1.4 trillion equal to four times GDP, 2.5 times higher than Singapore’s and 0.6 times Japan’s, and there is enough to deal with economic downturns or reversals.”
In recent years, Hong Kong dollar debundling rates have continued to fall and have increased the dollar interest spread. Chen Dejong pointed out that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate price had risen by over 400 basis points on September 21, and that the market was generally believed to be related mainly to the increase in the Hong Kong dollar debundling interest rates. The Hong Kong dollar then wandered around the United States dollar at a level close to 7.80-7.84, the recent Hong Kong dollar debundling rate continued to fall and the dollar interest spread expanded, and could attract markets for the Hong Kong dollar and
However, he believes that with the start of the Hong Kong Bank interest increase cycle, Hong Kong dollar interest rates will be regularized, and future Hong Kong dollar interest rates below the dollar rates will change.
"The Hong Kong dollar interest rate will tend to be more consistent with the dollar interest rate, and everyone will have to be more careful in managing risks and preparing for market fluctuations."
As Hong Kong dollar funds are abundant, Hong Kong dollar interest breaks have fallen further, falling 0.9 to 2.08179 per cent on Monday for three months, the difference with the dollar has been expanded from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; and the difference with the dollar has been reduced from 120 basis points to 127 basis points for five months.
From May to mid-September, the Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate approached 7.85 to 1 dollar for most of the time.
During this period, the transfer of some of the equity proceeds from the Hong Kong dollar after the arbitrage campaign and the large collection campaign was completed led to a number of new triggers in May and August following the first triggering of the weaker exchange guarantee in April.
The Hong Kong dollar was purchased by the gold regulatory authority at 7.85 levels in accordance with the associated exchange rate regime, and the dollar was sold in order to maintain stability in the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
A total of about HK$52.1 billion was bought in May and August by the Gold Administration under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism.
Do the new tax laws offer advantages to foreigners?
In response to a 30-day question from a journalist, the relevant head of the Treasury and the Tax Administration said that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing preferential arrangements for people abroad, including Hong Kong and Macao.
A journalist asked that the newly revised personal income tax law adjusts the criteria for determining our personal income tax residents from a full year to a full 183 days.
Are there any preferential arrangements for persons outside Hong Kong, including Hong Kong and Macao, as the next step in the implementation of the Act?
In response, the Chief stated that the implementing regulations of the current personal income tax law have special preferential provisions for taxation of persons outside China. Individuals who do not have a residence in China but live for more than one year or less than five years may pay personal income tax only for part of the unit or individual paid in China.
The Officer-in-Charge said that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing preferential arrangements for persons outside Hong Kong, including Hong Kong and Macao.
There are no "threshold" moon centres: quality certification leads to quality improvement.
With the growth of the "two-child economy" and the prosperity of the mother and child markets, the city has grown from the north up to the three or four-line cities, and every part of the country has grown into a variety of monthly houses.
The popular consumption needs have been met by the current hot Moon Club, with fees ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, but at the same time it is in an awkward position. The institution has so far had no threshold and there are still gaps in supervision.
In recent days, the General Directorate of State Market Supervision has launched a series of national "Quality Months" in 2018, where journalists come to a five-star lunar centre in Tianjin City to visit the certification experience of mother and child care services.
The general monthly child centre provides services such as neonatal care, nutritious meals, postnatal restoration of the plastic form, etc.
In this monthly centre, journalists observed that nurses check the breastfeeding of newborns on a daily basis, and professional caregivers provide fine care services such as bathing and touching for newborns.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of the new mother, services such as early care for the wounds of the first and later months of the month, care for the American body of the second and second months of the month, care programmes such as Chinese medicine and beauty treatment, etc., are provided to help the mothers recover their positions.
A new mother living in the house told the reporter that she had not been able to book this house until eight months earlier.
The services of the moonshine house directly affect the comfort and physical recovery of the mother's son, and some small monsoon houses can only offer simple monthly services. There are health irregularities in disinfection, vulnerability to cross-infection, dietary monoscientific problems, etc.
The head of the lunar centre said that they were the only one in all five-star lunar centres in Tianjin city to be certified as a B-class service.
"Although some customers initially did not understand the meaning of Level B certification, it was important for the long-term development of the enterprise to benefit the client through certification that forced the firm to tighten standardized process management." he said.
Pan Li Feng, Deputy Director-General of the Department of Accreditation and Supervision of the General Directorate of State Market Supervision, said that service certification was based on a new certification system based on customer perception, concern about organizational quality management and the satisfaction of service characteristics, was an important component of the country ' s quality infrastructure and had a positive role in raising the share of quality service provision and enhancing the international competitiveness of Chinese services.
Since 2004, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has undergone a process of gradual development, with the emergence of a number of influential service certifications, such as financial service certification, certification of mother and child care services, certification of commodity after-sale services, certification of e-commerce services, certification of health services, etc.
According to the General Directorate of State Market Supervision, there are currently more than 130 service certification bodies, more than 2,000 service certification officers and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates in the country.
Panreivin said that to further guide and promote the development of certification of services, gradually expand service certification coverage in areas such as health, education, sports, finance, electricity, etc., and contribute to service supply side reform and quality improvement.
Reuter Hong Kong November 5 - Hong Kong Building prices fell for two months in a row after the top. Chen Deok-hyun, Managing Director of the Hong Kong Financial Administration, said that it would take time to observe whether the building city has entered the down-cycle, and if confirmed, to consider tightening policies to ease counter-cyclical measures at the appropriate time.
Chen Deok-hyun added that, if the price of the building returns, the first people to be affected would be those who would be in business at the peak of the market, but the expected price of the building, as in the case of the Asian financial storm of 1997, was so sharp that the opportunities for citizens to cut prices significantly to sell their property would be much lower.
Chen Deok-hyun led a number of senior members of the Kim Bureau who attended the Legislative Council briefing, saying that if it was confirmed that the building city was entering a downward cycle, the measures could be eased at the appropriate time.
"But only a few weeks of data have been seen, it's still too early to relax, and it will take more time to see if the city is entering the next cycle."
Since October 2009, the Monetary Authority has so far introduced eight rounds of countercyclical measures, significantly tightening mortgages for various types of property, including reducing the number of mortgages, requiring mortgage applicants to pass rigorous pressure tests, etc., in order to enhance bank risk management and earthquake resilience.
With Hong Kong officially entering the interest-raising cycle, the entire Hong Kong private residential building price index fell for two months in August-September, and the monthly decline in September increased to 1.44 per cent.
But the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year still stands at 10.2%.
According to the Gold Administration, the financial situation of households measuring Hong Kong ' s resilience to financial risks remains healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of households living in households without mortgages reached 66%, which is higher than the average of 60% in 2009-11; the average number of mortgages for new and new mortgages is 47% and 34% respectively, which is a marked improvement from 64% and 41% respectively in 2009-11.
Chen Deok-hyun said, however, that the high resilience does not mean that citizens already in business will not be harmed by the downfall of the economy, as property valuations will fall and those who buy buildings at peaks will bear the brunt.
Although the Monetary Authority tightens bank lending to mortgage lenders, mortgage lenders can also obtain high-yield mortgage lending through mortgage insurance or mortgage lending by developers.
Chen Dejong said that today, together with mortgage borrowings provided to developers, borrowers can pay 85-90% of mortgages, and if building prices fall by 10%, negative assets (i.e. property market value drops below the level of total outstanding mortgage loans).
However, the Vice-President of the Gold Administration, Nguyen Guozhing, pointed out that the authorities estimated that the total amount of mortgages supplied by developers was only 2 - 2.5 per cent of total bank mortgages, and that the percentage was still low.
At the peak of Hong Kong ' s negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, representing 22% of the supply population.
By the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets in seven consecutive seasons.
On October 1, Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinxia (Liu Hongxia, Ma Wei) retail e-commerce export enterprises welcomed another wave of tax benefits on October 1, involving value added tax (VAT) and consumer tax exemption (CAT).
The Ministry of Finance, the State Tax Administration, the Ministry of Commerce and the General Customs Administration have recently issued a joint communication stating that they will pilot a value added tax (VAT) and a consumer tax tax tax exemption policy for exporting goods that have not received valid import certificates to electric power exporters in the integrated cross-border e-commerce pilot zone, while at the same time meeting the following conditions.
First, e-commerce export enterprises are registered in the Comprehensive Test Zone and register export dates, goods names, unit of measure, quantity, unit price, amount on the integrated services platform on the cross-border e-commerce line of the place of registration.
Secondly, export goods are subject to electronic commerce export declarations through the customs service where the CSI region is located.
Third, export goods do not belong to the Ministry of Finance and the General Directorate of Taxes, which explicitly cancel export refunds (exemption) of taxes, in accordance with the decision of the State Council.
It is clear from the circular that the General Customs Service regularly transmits electronic information on the electronic commerce export declaration list to the National Tax Administration.
The tax authorities of the CYRCs strengthen the tax exemption management of export goods on the basis of electronic information from the export goods declaration list, which is cleared by the State Tax Administration.
The circular states that specific tax exemption management practices are developed by the provincial tax department ' s commercial finance and commerce department.
The leadership group offices and business authorities for the construction of integrated pilot zones should coordinate and promote inter-sectoral collaboration and related policy implementation, accelerate the establishment of a system for monitoring e-commerce export statistics and promote the healthy and rapid development of cross-border e-commerce.
A man in Liaoning province killed his lover and dumped his body, and then fled to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
On 5 May, the journalist learned from the East Victory Public Security Bureau of the city of Ordos in Inner Mongolia that the man had been successfully captured following a joint police investigation between the two regions.
On 26 June 2018, a female disappeared in the city of Saddle Mountain, Liaoning province, and her family called the local police.
As a result of police investigations and research, this is not a simple case of human disappearance, it is highly probable that the missing person was killed by a lover's house, and the police set up an ad hoc unit to investigate further.
On October 30, the task force found out that Wang may have hidden himself in the East Victory District of the city of Ordos, and immediately organized a strong police force to cooperate fully with Liaoning's police in order to solve the case.
After five days of investigation, the civilian police finally figured out Wang's whereabouts and detailed their contacts.
On 4 November, the two police forces joined forces to capture the suspect, Wang, at an excavator fittings shop in Dong Shing District.
According to Wang Xiao, he had a relationship with the victim's lover, and because White's sister had a large sum of money in her name, they decided to take it as their own.
On June 22, 2018, when Wang and Paik disagreed over the disposition of the funds, Wang went on to kill White in the rental house and toss the body apart.
At present, the suspect Wang has been handed over to the Liaoning Hill Police.
"Green development in action" of the "Five Great Developments, Good Enlightenment" train runs the line.
The second column on the theme "Five Great Developments, Good Angels" - "Green Development in Action" train was officially launched on 5th.
In order to give a full picture of the brilliant results of the construction of the Five Great Developments and the Good Angels, the Ally Fat City Orbital Corporation and the Golden Pilgrim Media Technology Corporation jointly designed and produced the series of "Five Great Developments and Good Enlightenment" trains.
Among them, the first train — the "Innovation Development in Action" — was officially launched on October 1, on the first line of Track 1 traffic in Homogene City.
The theme train on line this time selected the blue green modifier symbol of mountain water as the main color, reflecting birth machines, vitality and purity.
The campaign focused on the core idea of the Five Great Developments and Better Emblems and 18 representative examples of green development outcomes in the province, including the construction of green development priority projects such as the Jianghua Canal Project, the Forest Longline, the conservation and development of the Yangtze economic zone, and the tens of millions of acres of forest growth project.
In addition, the "Coordination of Development in Action", "Open Development in Action", and "Sharing Development in Action" train will also be on line in the near future.
On October 1, the first day of the "gold Week" of the Chinese National Day and the last day of the Hong Kong National Day public holiday, many residents of the Mainland took advantage of the holidays to travel abroad to play and shop, many Hong Kong residents returned to Hong Kong on that day, and there was a "blowing shed" of passenger flows at the Shenzhen ports. At the Lo Lake and Shenzhen Bay crossings, 22 new self-help channels were opened to improve port clearance efficiency and facilitate efficient and expeditious clearance of passengers.
According to data from the Shenzhen border control station, by 1600 hours the number of departures and departures from Shenzhen port was more than 429,000, the number of means of transport was more than 168,000, and the ports remained busy and maintained good immigration order.
It is understood that there has been a steady increase in the number of tourists taking advantage of national holidays to take their vacations and shopping in countries such as Europe and South-East Asia, influenced by many positive factors, such as the increase in the number of countries offering exit and exemption policies for Chinese citizens.
In the early morning of the first day of the year, the exit directions of the Lo Lake, Shenzhen Bay, Wanggang, Fukuda and others reached a peak of passenger (car) flows, which lasted from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., while the Shenzhen Bay crossing peaked from 6.30 a.m. to 13:00 a.m.
According to the report, in order to cope with the peak flow of passengers (cars) entering and leaving China, the Shenzhen border General Inspectorate station, in accordance with the unified deployment of the National Immigration Administration, initiated the passenger (car) current peak-time operational mode, arranged overtime police to support the first line of duty, opened an advance foot-checking route, directed passengers and vehicles to an orderly waiting list, ensured that Chinese citizens were in line for entry and exit customs clearance for no more than 30 minutes, while taking into account the efficiency of customs clearance for foreigners; and strengthened the maintenance of order in
The General Inspectorate of Shenzhen at the same time reminds incoming and outgoing passengers to pay attention to the validity of documents and visas and notes prior to travel, to make reasonable arrangements for travel, to avoid peak periods of passenger flow as much as possible, and to choose the right time and the right port of exit.
Passengers travelling to Hong Kong on Hong Kong's high railway are required to carry valid entry/exit documents and visa endorsements. High iron tickets are used only as a vehicle ticket and cannot be used as an exit/exit document. If they are unable to leave Hong Kong due to non-compliance of documentation, etc., they should follow the guidelines of the Border Guard Civil Police and wait for Hong Kong Railway staff to lead the driving procedures to return to the Mainland at a designated location.
Systemic red-coupled lupus is a chronic and difficult disease with tired and dirty instruments, which used to be considered an incurable disease.
Due to the lack of clarity in the mechanisms for their occurrence, difficulties in diagnosis and treatment, and lack of effective treatment, they cannot be dealt with at all.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the Life Sciences College at Qinghua University, and Chewie Chim Yigang, Director of the People's Hospital of Beijing University, found that there were molecular mutations in the human immune balls that increased the susceptibility of systemic red-coupled lupus, and that this mutant was involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, both teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body was an important cause of systemic haemorrhagic disease.
According to Sun Xiaojun, one of the authors of the article, the North Great People's Hospital, the Chestnut Nation team collected nearly 2,000 cases of systematic haemorrhagic ailments and carried out research and found that patients with immunoglobin mutations produced a wide range of disease-causing cells and a large number of their own antibodies, and that the incidence and severity of inflammatory conditions such as nephritis, arthritis, mammolaritis, blood vessels etc. had increased significantly.
The Liu Wanli team, through various research methods such as immunocell tracer, animal trials, sequencing etc., discovered the path of immune signals activated by this immune molecule mutation, and promoted the pathogenic mechanisms of B-cell partitioning many of its own antibodies.
The journalists learned that the two teams were strong and united, taking full advantage of their respective strengths and bringing basic research and clinical applications closer together.
The Liu Wanli team is dedicated to Blymph cell immunisation recognition, immunisation activation research, while the Chestnut Nation team is engaged in long-term clinical research on systemic red coronal ailments.
"The study was one of the results of years of collaboration between the two teams, and it was the first time that the academic community realized institutionally that immune ball protein gene abnormalities would induce systemic red coronal ailments, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeting.

It is not a matter of protection, but of doing so according to the law.
The lawyer brought the axe to court?
The news was really exciting at first sight, and it blew up the pot in the legal circle.
The Fujian Quan City Central Law subsequently fined the lawyers involved $500 and advised in writing that the Quan Quan City Bar Association should conduct an investigation.
According to the Newjing newspaper, the City Bar Association of the former Quanzhou issued an official notice stating that the conduct of the two lawyers did not involve violations of the law and was not punishable under the law.
According to multiple reports, the Quanzhou City Law Association did not deal with short or hostile treatment, but was approved by the Quanzhou Middle Court.
An incident that could have caused tension within the legal community was finally resolved properly.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete return of the truth: the axes carried by the lawyer involved are identical to the murder weapon of the defendant, the same type, but not the same type, but are only used as supporting evidence at the evidentiary level, without the subjective intent to intimidate or “imperil the safety of the court”.
There are four very important details to judge whether the lawyer's conduct is illegal or illegal: first, the local court held two previous sessions and showed only the axe photo, which from the point of view of the defence was necessary; second, the axe was purchased only an hour before the trial, not because the lawyer was unwilling to seek the judge's consent, but objectively failed to contact the judge; third, the axe was not used unduly or improperly; and fourth, the lawyer in question publicly acknowledged the error at the first time and apologized to the court.
Combining these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyers involved “attend with axes” have nothing to do with the offence but only to defend themselves.
After clearing up the whole story, the Quanzhou City Law Association did not push the boat, but took the unpunishable decision in the face of pressure.
And this decision can stand the test of fact and law.
As for bringing the axe to the court as a control knife without the court's permission, it is indeed easy to provoke anxiety and misunderstanding.
For reasons of safety and caution, the fine penalty and judicial advice previously issued by the Quanzhou Middle House are also worthy of consideration.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from making it difficult for lawyers, the Supreme Law issued the Rules on Security Inspection of the Judicial Police of the People ' s Courts in 2014, which establishes the principle that lawyers are not required to carry out physical security checks in court.
Since the issuance of the rule, a wide range of lawyers have led by example, with few incidents that endanger the safety of the Tribunal due to security breaches.
In very isolated cases like Quanzhou, it is easy to dispel misunderstandings as long as communication is conducted in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
The Bar Association, as a self-regulating organization of the bar profession, has the dual mission of punishing unlawfulness and safeguarding legality.
In the past, individual law-abiding organizations suffered from severe illness due to their bias towards discipline and lack of security.
And the decision of the Quan State Bar Association, both in terms of process and outcome, is commendable, setting an example for more of them to do their job properly.
From October 1st, what tax benefits will affect our money bags?
The new personal income tax law of Xinhua Society Shanghai on October 1st (journalist Sanju) will be implemented as of January 1st 2019. In order for the general public to enjoy the tax bonus as soon as possible, the tax deduction will be made from October 1st at the starting point of $5,000 per month for the actual salary earned by taxpayers, and a new tax scale will be applied.
What exactly are the advantages and benefits that would affect the people while the New Deal is on the ground?
Good one: significant tax deductions from wages and salaries
Taxpayers who receive wages after 1 October can deduct the basic deduction of $5,000/month and apply the new tax scale. Most taxpayers have different degrees of tax deductions, especially for low- and middle-income earners.
According to the tax reduction table for the different income groups, the monthly income after deduction of the “triple risk” is 8,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan. The tax adjustment is taxable in the amount of 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan and 9090 yuan respectively. The corresponding tax reduction rate is 73.9 per cent, 61.1 per cent, 49.0 per cent and 18.8 per cent, respectively, compared with the start of the 3500 dollars.
It is worth noting that, due to holiday holidays, the salaries that were legally paid by the units at the end of September and should have been paid in October can be applied to the new basic fee deduction and tax scale.
To this end, the collection client software, which the tax authorities have consistently promoted, has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding taxes still have to be reported for payment during the statutory filing period.
Good two: the low tax grade is significantly larger.
In addition to raising the start point, a new tax scale will apply as of 1 October.
There has been no change in the current seven-stage tax rate for wages, salaries and salaries, but there has been a marked change in the tax range, with 3%, 10% and 20% of the three-stage low tax range significantly expanded, while 25% of the tax range has been reduced, while 30%, 35% and 45% of the three higher taxes have remained unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax code also adjusts the tax rates earned by production operations, with the lower limit of the 35 per cent tax rate at the highest level being raised from $100,000 to 500,000 yuan.
This means that individual business owners and individual sole proprietors will benefit from tax changes.
"As far as previous tax cuts on individual taxpayers in Shanghai were concerned, the dividends of a tax reform will be fully felt by a large number of taxpayers, especially among low- and middle-income people. "
Lanmin, head of the personal income tax division of the Shanghai Municipal Tax Administration, State Tax Administration, said.
Good three: Tax services are easier to optimize
Since the publication of the new personal income tax law, the tax department of Shanghai City has carried out a series of comprehensive and extensive tax promotion initiatives.
On the one hand, “one-on-one, one-point-on-one” policy advice is provided to priority tax sources and priority enterprises.
The tax authorities of Pudong New District visited large enterprises such as Apple Trading (Shanghai) Ltd., Payment Bo Network Technology Ltd., Red Star Mei Kailong Family Group Ltd., which have a large number of employees, large surrogate payments, large tax payments, voluntary mentoring by tax authorities, and questions and answers; the tax authorities of Xu Xu Hong District visited China ' s intelligence finance consulting company, China ' s intelligence Shanghai economic technical cooperation company and others in the region to collect business concerns in a timely manner, respond to business demands and resolve business difficulties.
On the other hand, a tax policy of "fullness, multidimensionality and stereotypicity" is implemented for the general public taxpayers.
The timely delivery of policy hot spots using channels such as Shanghai tax official website, Weibo Public, Weibo etc. to ensure that policy advocacy is in place.
At the same time, from September 28th, Shanghai's Tax Micro-Credit Public came on line with the 12366 Smart Counselling Platform, which implemented the "Target-to-Small" Smart Integrated Tax Reform Advocacy Service through the "Man+Smart" Tax Service Counselling.
On the evening of Beijing Day 4, China New Network, on November 5, it was officially announced that the former England team leader, Rooney, would return to England's National Team and fight the United States team on November 15th.
In August last year, Rooney announced his withdrawal from the England National Team.
Rooney was the first shot in the team's history and the second in its number.
According to the news released by the Network, this game with the US team was to raise money for Runy's Children's Charitable Foundation, and Rooney himself was very excited: "It's nice to be fighting England again in Wimbley, thanking Sosgait and the Senior Master for inviting me to help my foundation.
It's the greatest honor of my career to show up for England. The 120th time will be the last time I show up for England. This will be a special memory for me."

With the general introduction of large-scale seedlings in the towns and cities of Pakistan, this year's floodgate crabs are much bigger than before.
The crab farmers who have been dealing with large-gate crabs for almost 20 years have planned to export the crab seedlings and breeding techniques of the sunshine lake crabs to Thailand, allow the water and village foods to cross the border and promote cultural exchanges with the overseas foods.
The town of Quinque is a cultural sign of Ba'al.
At present, there are 1,300 hotels and restaurants with crabs, fisher's lights, spring and autumn water city, lake crab city, five major crab markets at the Jeong Yi Palayan crab market, and food and food, all of which are in the business of cooking and eating crabs around the sunshine lake gates, and the colored crabs of the Qing Qing Qing are indistinguishable.

A tripartite trade agreement between the United States of America and the United States of America will bring new opportunities to 500 million people.
According to external media reports, the Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and the United States Trade Representative, Leitheze, published on the Canadian government website, stated that the United States, Canada and Mexico had entered into a tripartite trade agreement that would be known as “USMCA” (the USMCA trinational agreement).
Previously, CTV News Television Canada quoted senior sources from the United States as saying that Canada and the United States had resolved their differences and reached agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post quoted two knowledgeable sources who reported that the agreement reached between the United States and Canada on 30 September would retain the North American Free Trade Agreement as a tripartite trade agreement and that the heads of the three countries would sign a new agreement within two months.
The statement said: "Today, Canada, the United States, and Mexico have agreed on a new trade agreement - the USMCA agreement, which will provide our workers, farmers, and companies with a high standard of trade agreement, which will lead to freer markets, fairer transactions, and more sustainable economic growth. The agreement will strengthen the middle class, create high-paying jobs, and create new opportunities for about 500 million people."
According to the information received, the existing North American Free Trade Agreement was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
When Trump took office as President, he announced plans to reconsider the agreement and sign a new agreement.
The three countries started the negotiation process in 2017.
The Okinawa Governor's election, which was held in advance because of the death of the former Governor, Hung Shih, was announced in the early hours of the first hour of local time, and Dani Yu, who opposed the relocation plan of the US military base in Japan, was successfully elected.
The final results of the vote cast on 30 September showed that Tam City won 396,632 thousand votes, the highest in the history of the Okinawa County Governor's election, and that there were more than 80,000 votes than the main contestant, Sasaki Sun.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a turnout of 63.24%, which is 0.89 percentage points lower than the 2014 Okinawa Prefectural Election.
On 1 January, Tam City told the media that the results of the election showed that the people of the county did not want to waste the efforts of the Governor before he died, that he would inherit the Governor's legacy and continue to work with the Japanese government and the US government on opposing the relocation plan of the US military base and the closure of the Putian base.
The U.S. military base is located in Yino Bay City, Okinawa County, and has been suffering from chronic illness. The Japanese and American government had previously agreed to relocate it to the bordery Nogaku area of the City of Noise, but the people of Okinawa strongly opposed it, hoping to move the base completely out of Okinawa.
With regard to the relocation plan, which was strongly opposed by the people of the county, and the request to withdraw permission to refill land on the coast of the border, Yuzheng stated that he had not been in opposition to and divided with the central government in the first place, and hoped that the two sides would fully exchange views and demonstrate their intention to resolve the matter through a negotiated settlement.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also indicated to the media in the morning that he would seriously accept this result and would make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and ease the base burden.
At the press conference on 1 January, Japan's Chief of Staff Jin Yi Wei said that there had been no change in the government's approach to moving United States military bases as soon as possible.
At the same time, he expressed his intention to talk to Yuzheng.
Jade City will officially become the governor of Okinawa County on 4th of this month.
Paul Thomas, a farmer from North Dakota State in the United States, has been growing soybeans in his land since the mid-2000s, as Chinese demand for oilseeds grows.
This shift reached its peak this year and he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres, the size of which has never been seen before.
But Thomas and a lot of farmers like him plan to switch in 2019 to crops that used to be stapled in agricultural areas of the United States: maize and wheat.
American farmers have grown more soybeans this year than maize, for the first time in 35 years.
The reason for planning to switch to other food crops is because American farmers are facing difficulties in selling soybeans against the backdrop of US President Trump's trade war against China.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of US exports of soybeans, but as a result of the trade war, US soybeans have been bought almost at nothing in recent months, causing soybean prices to drop to a decade low.
Thomas intends to grow more wheat next year, hoping to earn more by reducing dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Thomas said that soybean prices "give us a painful blow".
He stated that, without Chinese purchases, the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per futon, while the price necessary to cover the cost was $8.50.
Farmer farmers in the United States recorded a record high in soybean cultivation this year, and the harvest is expected to reach a record high.
At such a time of vulnerability, they were hit by a trade war.
In response to Trump's imposition of customs duties on imported Chinese goods, China imposed import duties on imported United States soybeans in July.
The United States Department of Agriculture will issue the first estimate of the area under cultivation next year, which will include consideration of tariff implications.
The forecast is expected to confirm the expected reduction in soybean soybean soybean cultivation by private institutions.
According to a report read by Reuters, Informa Economics projected an increase of 4 to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019 and a decrease of 7 to 83 million acres in soybean cultivation.
Informa also expects a 4% increase in wheat cultivation in the United States.
The area of soybean planted prior to the imposition of retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, some 15 million acres higher than 10 years ago.
The area under maize cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008, to 89.1 million acres. This year, the area under wheat cultivation is 47.8 million acres, the lowest level in 100 years.
Aaron Carlson, head of the Illinois Corn Growing Association, has a total area of 3,600 acres under his own cultivation, and this year nearly half of him is used for soybean cultivation, but plans to cut it in the future.
He claims that his farm in northern Illinois may have increased maize cultivation by up to 20%; that state is the largest soybean growing state in the United States.
Soybeans produce less than maize per acre but require less fertilizer, which makes soybean cultivation generally less expensive.
If farmers move to the final value of maize, they may raise costs, but they will benefit a number of enterprises, including Andersons Inc. Fertilizers.
Executive Director Pat Bowe of Andersons said to Reuters that he expected that the conversion of maize would be beneficial for fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the conversion of farmers to maize.
The director of the Luongman Airport Administration in Bangkok, Thailand, held an announcement on 29th to apologize for the beating of a Chinese citizen at the airport and said that Thailand would welcome Chinese tourists and that the authorities concerned would strengthen their management, raise awareness of services and avoid similar incidents.
It was reported that, on 27th, security guards at Sunman Airport had physically clashed with a Chinese man who had been denied entry into the country.
Sutilava said that the security guards involved had committed serious breaches of discipline, that they had been suspended by the Airport Authority and that a board of inquiry had been established to investigate the matter in accordance with the procedure, and that the security guards would be dismissed if the facts were correct.
The Thai Immigration Service has now arranged for the man to return to China by air.
Sutilava apologized for this incident, which damaged Thailand's image, and said that the Thai side attached great importance to the matter, was willing to do everything possible to mitigate the impact of the incident on tourists hit, and would send an apology letter to the concerned person through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that Sunman Airport was willing to facilitate Chinese tourists to Thailand, and that the Thai Immigration Service had established special access routes for Chinese tourists at the five major Thai international airports in Bangkok, such as Suvanapur, Sunman, Chiang Mai, Puji and Yi.
The next step, he said, would be for the Airport Authority to overhaul the area of the site signing, to make clear the cost of the site signing and to improve the quality of service and communication capabilities of the staff.
When the Chinese Embassy in Thailand became aware of the incident, the first contact was made with the person concerned to learn what had happened.
At the same time, the Head of the Thai Immigration Service, the Airport Administration and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports made representations to ask the Thai side to thoroughly investigate the incident and severely punish the perpetrators, and will continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side to properly handle the matter and defend the legitimate rights and interests of the persons concerned.
Xinhua International Times Review: To defend multilateralism, China knows how to work together.
The international rules and the multilateral order are under attack at a time when unilateralism is inflaming against the current.
To some extent, unilateralism and multilateralism have entered a critical period.
As a responsible major Power, China has joined the international community in maintaining multilateralism and promoting it as it continues to move forward, in line with the ideas of the Great China and the United Roads and strong actions.
Faced with new challenges in the new situation, China has made a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
As the State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi said in his speech during the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should insist on the goal of cooperation and win-win, based on a rule order, based on equity and justice and guided by effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the construction of a global pattern of development cooperation complemented by the United Nations as a central channel for North-South cooperation and South-South cooperation, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community of human destinies.
China ' s thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As Espinosa, President of the 73rd session of the General Assembly, said, in the current circumstances, "the United Nations needs more than ever to promote multilateralism and preserve a rules-based international system".
The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Lagarde, said that the international community should remain steadfast in upholding the multilateral trading system, upholding the rules of international trade and resolving differences through consultations.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the contrast between global economic and political forces, a number of emerging market and developing country groups have emerged to play a greater role in the main international multilateral mechanisms and to provide a new impetus for the development of anti-wind multilateralism.
Standing on this scale, China's advocacy of building a large family, rather than collating small circles, adhering to the idea of multilateralism, such as co-contribution rather than win-winners, and adapting to the tide of the times, is an inevitable choice to meet global challenges and solve the world's difficult problems, representing the common claim of most of the world's countries.
There are advanced ideas and more solid actions.
China's "one way" initiative has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China has launched international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the "one way" of building together, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the "16+1 Cooperation" to promote international regional cooperation, complement existing international regimes and order, bring innovative dynamism to multilateral cooperation and contribute to the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.
As the guardian of the international order and the implementer of multilateralism, China ' s actions are becoming stronger in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
To mediate international hot spots, address climate change, participate in peacekeeping operations, work hard to reduce poverty and reduce poverty, and help other countries to implement the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Guterres, said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the world faces a “trust deficit”, and populism and polarization are on the rise, it is at a time when the world needs multilateral cooperation most urgently.
At such historic junctures, the international community needs to work together to translate consensus into action, firmly defend multilateralism and jointly contribute to the creation of a community of human destinies.
On September 30, the first standard 4K demonstration area in Guangdong, Guangdong, Guangzhou, was unveiled on September 30 in Jinjin Garden District, Haiju District, Guangzhou City. On that day, the 4K operation in Guangdong Guangta Province was officially launched, and the ceremony of the opening ceremony of Guangdong Province, Guangdong Province, the central radio and television station ' s 4K super-highlight channel, was held simultaneously.
The event was co-sponsored by the Guangdong cable radio and television network Ltd. and the co-building co-management and shared social governance leadership group in the Great Pond area of the Haiju region.
Based on the deployment of the Guangdong Provincial Council Government, Guangdong Guangbo Network actively implemented the 4K Action Plan for the new digital family. In December 2017, the first new digital family demonstration area in the country to support IPv6, the first national wide power line to support the 4K digital family gateway end product - "U Point Family Server" (with the AVS2 standard 4K box, telecommunications remote control), was released and actively participated in the construction of the 4K television network application demonstration area in Guangdong Province, with 4K ultra-high video, next-generation Internet, cable wireless integration
In 2018, the Guangdong Guangbo Network launched a series of wide power initiatives for the benefit of the people and launched the "wide 4K service month" to promote the "U Point Family Server" throughout the province.
On the day of the event, the 4K operation of the Guangdong Guangbo Network was officially launched, and the first 4K smart television home sharing platform based on the 4K application was officially launched. The platform was developed jointly by the Guangdong cable co-management shared social governance leadership group office with the Haijugang area. The platform project is based on the 4K super-clear U point family server of the Toguangdong Guangbo network, the realization of a new generation of intelligent family services based on cable television networks, the integration of government-related welfare and civic service functions, aimed at providing citizens
Chen Xiaoging, Chief Engineer of the Guangdong News and Publications and Electricity Bureau, stated at the event that the event was a useful collaboration for the work of the Government Center of the Party Committee for Active Services of the Wide Power Network Enterprises, and that the Government was actively using the Internet+ to create a digital government to serve the population. It was hoped that, through cooperation and outreach, the Guangdong Wide Power Network would help build a model of shared social governance in the Haihu District, Guangzhou and the province as a whole.
The ceremony showcased and popularized the 4K Smart TV Safe Home Sharing Platform, a new digital family application with 4K TV at its core.
The first edition of the "4K Smart TV Safe Home Sharing Platform" will feature four major modules: "Guangzhou Street", "New Guangzhou Man's Home", "Wise Community" and "Wise Family", which will focus on exploring intelligent neighborhoods.
According to the information received, the Guangdong wide power network currently operates five 4K live channels, and on the same day the National Day will be the province-wide exclusive broadcast of the 4K super-highlight channel of the Central Radio and Television General.
The report reads as follows: 30 September is the fifth anniversary of the martyrdom of the country.
At 10 a.m. on the same day, the Xi Near Equality Party and the National Leader joined representatives from all walks of life in the capital to attend a ceremony to honour the people ' s heroes and honour their martyrs.
A quick comment on the situation: this is the first anniversary of our heroic martyr protection.
Five years ago, on the eve of the National Day of Remembrance of Martyrs, we set the Chinese nation a great journey from misery to glory, and we will always wake up: "Where did we come from and where did we go?"
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out in depth that "the abandonment of tradition and the loss of it would be tantamount to cutting off his soulline."
"Don't forget history to open up the future."
We honour heroes and remember martyrs in order to remember history forever, to keep the spirit of spirit alive and to rally the strong positive energy of national renaissance.
As quickly as possible, the English are the backbone of the nation.
To honour the martyrs, to sacrifice them, is to make the British a noble, holy, powerful and eternal memory at the bottom of our hearts.
According to incomplete statistics, some 20 million martyrs died bravely for their national independence, their liberation and the country ' s prosperity, and their happiness.
Every sacrifice for the nation will be remembered, and every spirit of loyalty to the nation will be looked upon.
The purpose of setting up national days for them and organizing various forms of commemorative activities is to pay tribute to them in the name of the nation, to pay deep tribute to their great achievements and to learn to pass on their precious spirit of love for their homeland, loyalty to their people, selflessness and sacrifice.
The Government of the Party Committees at all levels has improved the system of benefits and benefits, constantly raising the level of care and treatment, and the Party and the State have practiced their respect for heroes with practical action.
Every year, countless people look at the martyr's mausoleum, so that we feel the deep feelings of the people's remembrance and feel the momentum of the recovery that has been raised in the blood of the nation.
The celebration of heroes, the defence of heroes, the study of heroes, and the care of heroes have become the norm throughout society.
The evaluation quickly concluded that today, when China’s special socialism enters a new era, we can tell the British enthusiasts who have fallen asleep that a powerful China is rising in the East and that the Chinese dream of the great renaissance of the Chinese nation is turning into reality in our hands.
Let's move forward with the spirit and move forward towards the great goal!

The fifth Disability Voice Month is coming to focus on sexuality education for disabled adolescents - the new Chinese Internet.
In recent years, the topic of sex education for Chinese adolescents has been extensively discussed, but the challenge for education for disabled adolescents remains daunting.
Recently, a seminar on challenges and practical strategies for comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities was held in Beijing.
Sex education for disabled children and young people was an important topic at this seminar.
The report on sexual-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of disabled children and youth in China, published at the conference, shows that disabled children suffer from a higher proportion of sexual harassment and sexual assault than healthy children.
Social attention to disabled children and adolescents is also “sexually protected”.
The purpose of the seminar was to explore the promotion of comprehensive sexuality education for disabled children and adolescents in China from the point of view of family support, school education and institutional services, to provide support to disabled children and adolescents from the source and to give them the right to enjoy their own love like others.
According to the experts, Chinese society's public awareness of the disabled population has been stuck at a level that is not deep enough.
China ' s comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities, especially children and young people with disabilities, is not sufficiently advanced, owing to factors such as traditional attitudes.
In recent years, however, with the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the public good, there has been a welcome development of sexual and reproductive health education practices and pathways for the full development of persons with disabilities throughout the cycle.
The Report shows that children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical impairments, while having some difficulties in gaining access to sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships, have generally developed more easily and enriched.
The Seminar on the Challenges and Practical Strategies of Comprehensive Sexual Education for People with Disabilities was hosted by the Shanghai People's Public Interest Foundation and supported by UNESCO's Representative Office in China, the Beijing Office of the International Coalition for Disabled Persons (France) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Representative Office in China, aimed at exploring sexual and reproductive health education practices and ways of achieving comprehensive development for persons with disabilities throughout a full cycle of comprehensive development, within the context of a broad strategy for healthy China, to promote awareness among stakeholders in the field of special education and integration education, educators, researchers, social service organizations, parents
Reuter Beijing September 30th - The Central Bank of China announced on Sunday data on net scheduled short-term outflows of foreign currency assets that showed that, as of the end of August of this year, the foreign currency of the Central Bank ' s forward contracts and futures contracts had been empty for 12 months, and there were still no positions in that month.
According to the Bank ' s previous data, as of the end of August last year, the Bank held a foreign currency of $6,044 million in forward contracts and futures contracts, which remained unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the size of empty positions denominated in SDRs was 4,276 million SDRs.
Since then, the central bank ' s foreign exchange forward position has been zero.
The central bank released the data for the first time at the end of March 2016; the data show that at the end of February 2016, the foreign currency of the central bank had a multi-position of $2,438 million in forward contracts and futures contracts for this currency and $28.9 billion in empty positions.
The September data released at the end of October of the same year showed for the first time a net increase of $16,401 million to $45,301 million.
The Central Bank has previously stated that foreign currency forward and futures empty positions in this currency largely reflect foreign exchange forward operations conducted by the Central Bank with commercial banks to meet the demand for hedging of corporate foreign currency liabilities, and will continue to provide long-term risk avoidance products on a demand-driven basis, with less impact on the size of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20th this year, on the K158 train, Joe, who was a senior student in Chengzhou, took the car to the crane wall.
One of the masters on the train bought a ticket without a seat, but took her seat: "Go ahead and shoot."
Two hours away, the train captain persuaded him to remain invalid for an hour.
Eventually, a male passenger in the same car couldn't look down and pull him up.
On the contrary, although most of the end result was that the hegemonics were condemned by the public, punished by the administration of the public security services, and even included in the integrity blacklist, the public still felt that they were not "free of hatred": why not let the hegemons be punished on the spot?
Why can't they stop their immoral and even illegal behaviour on the spot and punish them only afterwards?
And how can a male passenger pull up a male passenger for the unreasonable behavior of the Grand Master?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police officers and short-distance trains are not usually available; even with police officers, they tend to worry about the possible rogue reaction of the hegemonists rather than taking coercive removal measures.
Repeated cases of hegemonism have made people realize that it is imperative that the hegemon must be forcibly removed from the scene and even punished in order to act as a deterrent.
This requires that our trains take strong and timely measures and that the trains without them be deployed as soon as possible in order to ensure that violations are stopped and combated in a timely manner.
On 1 October, on the first day of the leave of the President of the National Day, there was a sharp increase in the number of vehicles in the direction of Songpan, Mau County, via the Sichuan-North Trunchuan Autonomous District.
At 1300 hours, the Niekawa traffic police received a call for help, stating that their family had been in a traffic accident in Songpan and that due to the limited medical conditions in the area, there was an urgent need to send them to Miangyang for treatment.
Chasing the one-way traffic control of the Tang Jiaxuan Lake Ring Road in Kitagawa, I would like to ask the traffic police to release the 120 first aid truck.
After receiving a call for help, the civilian police on duty quickly reported the situation to the team, and immediately after Captain Huang Xuemin had been briefed, arranged for the police officer in charge of the control post to contact the helper and asked to do everything in his power to escort him.
"There were more than a thousand vehicles entering the control section at that time, and after contacting the 120 emergency vehicle, it was expected that the time of arrival in Kitagawa would be around 1500 hours, and we immediately arranged our deployment. "
In order to prevent the traffic of vehicles that have entered this section of the road from running in parallel with the two rows of vehicles, the traffic police imposed a partial control of the vehicle one hour in advance at the beginning, centre and end of the road at the three points, and reminded all passers-by drivers to leave the side of the road and wrong for the emergency vehicle.
Subsequently, the drumming squadron of civilian police also suspended vehicles from entering the control section and queued for the 120 emergency vehicles that were about to arrive.
At 1500 hours, an ambulance with a Kawakawa U license plate entered the territory of Kitagawa, where the police sent a police car to drive and escort the ambulance back into the control section.
It is understood that only one vehicle can pass in some places on the road around the lake, and the civilian police placed temporary control of these places ahead of schedule and ensured the smooth passage of the 120 first aid vehicles.
Upon arrival at the 10 miles of the village, a road could not be ceded, so the traffic police contacted the village committees in advance, borrowed the village lane by detour, and banned social vehicles from entering the village.
"it took only 40 minutes to get a 120 emergency vehicle from the Kitagawa traffic police to get to the normal road to 302 provincial lanes."
Wei Wei introduced that, according to normal circumstances, the entire passage time would take four hours.
"This arrangement has successfully secured valuable treatment time for patients."
According to the information received, at 1720 hours, serious and dangerous patients were delivered to Miangyang in time for treatment.
The confirmed death toll caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose rapidly to 832, and the authorities feared that the figure would rise, as rescue workers had difficulty in providing assistance to remote areas that had lost contact.
Of particular concern is Dungla, a region north of Baru with a population of 300,000, close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Two other districts have lost contact with the outside world since Friday.
“We have not received reports from the other three regions.”
Communications and electricity are still out.
Nugroho indicated that the missing persons included five foreigners, three of whom were French, one Korean and one Malaysian.
The earthquake and tsunami killed 832 people.
According to Vice President Kara of Indonesia, the death toll could rise to thousands.
Earlier, Indonesian President Zorko-Vidodo had surveyed the affected areas and called on the population to endure.
Reuters November 4 - The British Daily Telegraph Sunday reported that British Secretary of State Dominic Raab had privately requested Britain's right to leave the Irish border “safe” arrangement after three months.
Rabb was reported to have made this request to Simon Coveney, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Ireland, at a private meeting in London last Tuesday.
According to the report, this request was "obviously contradicted" by British Cabinet Secretary David Lidington when he visited Dublin three days later.
The British Department of Teo-European Affairs has indicated that it will not comment on private meetings.
Yesterday morning, at 8.05 a.m., two suspects of theft were arrested while the 20th bus was stealing from the 20th bus station, Yongding Gate, to the entrance of Pearl City.
The two men who stole the passengers cut off their outer clothes and stole 800 dollars of cash from them so that the civilian police who were already standing by would be caught.
This was the first case of theft discovered by the Beijing police during the National Day.
Yesterday at around 5.00 a.m., the counter-deep investigators of the Beijing Public Security Mobile Investigation Brigade arrived at their intended location.
According to past experience, places where human traffic is concentrated, public transport hubs, public transport subway lines, including the crowd watching the flag raise at Tiananmen Square, are the focus areas of their work.
In the crowd, plainclothes civilian police watched the passers-by calmly.
At around 7 a.m., two suspicious men were found by investigators who were sitting at the bus station to have access to a 20-way bus with a male passenger from the Yongding gate.
In the car, two suspicious men, one left and one right, caught the male passenger in the middle, one of whom tried to cover the other.
But they do not know that every move they make is already in the eyes of the civilian plainclothes police who observe it.
"Kidnapping of thieves," the plainclothes civilian police caught people waiting for the men to steal, and while waiting for the men to do the theft, the police kept their eye on the men who were ready to steal, and were caught by the investigators after they had stolen them.
The Beijing Morning News reporter saw that the civilian police had seized $800 in cash from suspects of theft.
"They took the money out of the passenger's pocket."
The civilian police pointed to a broken jacket pocket and said, "They cut the place open and stole $800 from a tourist who came to Kyoto. When we caught them, the money was just loaded into their own pocket."
The journalist learned that in order to capture the two men, the plainclothes civilian police followed him for an hour and finally caught him at the time of his crime.
Two suspects are currently under police scrutiny.
The plainclothes civilian police told journalists who was suspicious in the crowd, a simple question for the civilian police.
"If you catch more thieves, you'll find that their eyes, looks, and ordinary passengers are different. In addition to staring at people's pockets and backpacks, they like to drill into the crowd instead of running away."
The civilian police also told journalists that suspects and other vehicles often have no purpose, prefer to wander at the station and follow after finding the object of the theft.
"These are the words of experience. The plain clothes have been dry for a long time. You'll see."
In addition, the civilian police suggested that "it is the convenientst and most vulnerable to theft to put things in your jacket."
Take care of your belongings while travelling in the car, so as not to be stolen.

British Prime Minister Teresa May on Sunday called on his party to unite in support of her retreat plan and directly called on critics to support it, saying that the free trade agreement they wanted was at the heart of her retreat plan.
On September 30, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May went to attend the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham.
At the beginning of this exciting annual meeting of the Conservative Party, Tereza May's plan was once again criticized by two former cabinet ministers, including former Foreign Secretary Johnson, who called Tereza May's plan “wrong”.
But she also received strong support from other ministers who supported the retreat: "Tresa May is one of the most polite people," and international trade ministers Fox and foreign minister Hunt pointed their anger towards the EU.
Teresa May's fragile leadership has been further pressurized this month by the rejection by the EU of part of the so-called "Chicks" plan.
But Teresa May looked positively at these consultations and said she was prepared to consider the European Union's doubts.
"My message to my own political party is that let's work together to find the best deal for Britain," Teresa May said.
Former British Foreign Secretary Johnson called Tereza May’s plan “wrong” and criticized her for having no faith in retreating from Europe.
He and former British Foreign Minister Davis are pushing for a Canadian-style free trade agreement with the EU.
Teresa May said that the proposal would allow Northern Ireland to implement different tariff provisions, which would amount to a division of Northern Ireland from Britain.

And the new CSIG, or Cloud and Smart Industries Group, will integrate industrial solutions such as tether clouds, Internet+, intelligent retailing, education, medical care, safety and LBS, and promote digital upgrading of industries.
The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Tseng Board of Directors Ma Tingteng said that the second half of the Internet was industrial Internet and that the first half provided high-quality services to users through connectivity, on the basis of which we would help industry and consumers develop a new connection ecology that was more open.
Respond to the rumor of “retrenchment”: clear non-retrenchment.
Following the release of the organizational restructuring message, it was reported that the restructuring would involve layoffs.
The tether-related side said to the new and new Chinese web reporter, "It is clear that this organizational restructuring will not involve layoffs. We will move the business modules together and optimize them first."

This newspaper (internship journalist Li Xing) has in recent years witnessed numerous incidents of incompetence of the plastic runway at school.
To this end, the Ministry of Education has issued a circular requiring the implementation of the new national logo at the surface sports site of the synthetic materials in primary and secondary schools to be delivered after 1 November this year.
The mandatory national standard, " Primary and Secondary Synthetic Materials Surface Sports Sites " , was organized by the Ministry of Education with the participation of 26 scientific institutes and testing agencies, and was revised over two years, during which more than 100 expert meetings were organized, as well as field visits and sampling tests throughout the country, collected numerous testing experiments on hundreds of enterprise products on the market.
In comparison with the 2005 old national logo, journalists found that not only did the new national logo change from a "national recommended standard" to a "national mandatory standard", but it also added a number of elements, including thickness requirements, physical performance, aging-resistant performance, inorganic filling content requirements, high concentration requirements for anti-sliding granules, limits on harmful substances for surface finished products, limits on harmful substances for non-solid and solid raw materials, etc.
It is particularly worth mentioning that the new flag limits the harmful substances that may result from the construction of the school plastic runway, increasing from 7 to 18, and regulates the amount of volatile organic material in the completed runway in accordance with the domestic dress standards.
For example, the release of hazardous substances is specified in the `Limit and odour Requirements for Harmful Substances in Current and Prefabricated Surface Products', requiring total volatile organic compounds not to exceed 5 mg/m3, formaldehyde not more than 0.4 mg/m3, carbon dioxide not more than 7 mg/m3, benzene not more than 0.1 mg/m3 and the odour level not higher than 3.
The new logo also provides details on sampling requirements for plastic runways in primary and secondary schools, the rules for testing, the rules for determining them, etc.
In addition, the campus artificial lawn was included for the first time in the compulsory testing of national tenders.
In the near future, all regions will be engaged in special deployments on the implementation of the new national tender and will report on the implementation of the new national tender to the Department of Physical Health and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education during the year.
In the afternoon of September 30th, the Chinese and new Internet customers will be playing "The Civil War of the Nation" in the finals of the 2018 Women's World Cup.
In the end, Chu Yu Ling, a team friend who fought at the main Tening 4:0 Rik master, was once again on the throne of the Women's World Cup in four years' time, and this was the 21st time that the Chinese woman took off the title of the tournament.
Tinning and Zhu Yuling are teammates and friends, and both are quite familiar with each other's tactics.
Both sides followed each other, whether in preparation for war or before the race.
When they entered the finals, they said they had finished the game without meeting each other.
But the match between Tinning and Chu Yuling in the game is a saber.
In the first round, Dinning, the winner of the big game, is three to one, and then Joo Yu Ling, through Tinning's error, will have a score of three.
Then Chu Yuling's mistakes in the attack began to increase, and Tinning seized the opportunity to take the lead by a score of 9:5 and took the lead at 10:6.
Even though Chu Yu Ling pursued three points, Tinning took the first round at 11:9.
In the second round, Zhu Yuling's mistakes remained high, and Tinning took the lead at 6:1 distance, drawing on the advantage of the holdup.
Chu Yuling scored two points after the fall of 2:7, depending on the rhythm changes, and later using the attack to catch up to 8:9.
At this critical moment, Tinning won two points at 11:8 and won one more.
In the third round, the two started with a sharper bite of 3:3 flat.
Dinning then lost three points by mistake in the attack, but then she used sharp force to hit three points and then hit six points.
Chu Yu Ling won two points in a row to recreate the advantage and take the lead at 10:8.
But Dingning attacked so badly that he won four points and took the third round at 12:10.
In the fourth round, Chu Yu Ling won the 4:2 lead.
But since then, Tinning has shown a super-strength offensive, and after four points, she stops.
After the suspension, Zhu Yuling recovered some of her status and gradually pursued the score to 8:8.
Dinning didn't have a soft hand at the critical moment, and he scored two points to get the point.
As Jo Yu Ling returns to the field, Dining sweeps the opponent to the crown at 4:0.
Last month, Tinning picked his crown in Bulgaria's open competition, ending her 14-month-long champion waste, and came to Chengdu, even though she said before the race she did not set a goal for the battle, and in the semi-finals, which ended this morning, Tinning said she had completed the job.
In the end, Tinning won over teammate Joo Yu Ling and won the personal third World Cup champion, and she was satisfied with her performance: "A champion is important for every athlete.
I didn't think of this before the race, but I said that the finals were still very satisfactory. "
"I think I can handle the stress side of the whole game. Tinning's performance today was excellent, leading to a failure to find rhythm."
Activating rural consumption depends on normal-stated mechanisms to clean up markets, guide healthy consumption demand and enhance farmers ' sense of access to consumption.
The data show that the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released and that retail sales of consumer goods in rural areas grew 10.5 per cent in the first half of the year, at an increase of 1.3 percentage points higher than in urban areas.
In a poor village in a county in the west, there was only one convenience store in the whole village, where some commodities seemed familiar, "goldfish" was marked as "gold dragon oil", "Wang-boy" became "gang milk", and "lots" of goods.
Over the years, similar phenomena have often been exposed, and some of the country ' s false and poor commodity brands, with similar names, similar packagings, and false truths, have been a deterrent.
According to a consumption survey published by a city in the west, the problem of rural merchants is serious, with 66 per cent of users buying fake goods at supermarkets under the township line, with food accounting for more than half of them.
Why does Li Chi continue to fight every year when the authorities are trying to fix the rural market?
Unlike urban markets, farmers ' awareness of rights is relatively weak, coupled with the remoteness of many rural areas and the lack of regulatory capacity in blind areas, giving fertile ground to fake goods.
A commodity has many headlines, some sector-run prices, some production, some managed markets, cross-functionalities, annual vacations, centralizing the wind, hiding the fake goods from the wind, slowly coming out, just after the old vacations, and new fakes coming out.
The lack of long-standing regulatory mechanisms, the difficulty of cleaning up rural markets, the low cost of breaking the law and the high interest, has led some illegal traders to take a deluded view of “downhill”, and some rural areas have become “lost markets”.
From subsistence to welfare, the vast majority of farmers are moving towards developmental consumption.
Today, the Party Central and the State Council issued "A number of Opinions on perfecting the institutional mechanisms for promoting consumption and further stimulating the consumer potential of the population " , in which it was proposed to promote the upgrading of the consumption ladder for rural residents, with the aim of making the farmers "capable" and "despite" to consume, and to make rural consumption truly flourish.
On the one hand, there is a need to deepen reforms to eliminate market regulation and multiple management malpractices, improve food safety and product quality monitoring networks depending on the local context, and continuously reduce the space available in rural areas to make and sell fakes.
On the other hand, it is important to strengthen the enforcement of the law, to regulate the "fine veins", and never to allow false pretences to spread in rural areas.
Tight punishment of pit farmers is the only way to protect farmers. No matter how hidden the fakers are, they should not be used as a justification for the creation of false goods. The authorities concerned should clarify their responsibilities, the regulatory forces at the grass-roots level are sinking, and any link that goes wrong must be held accountable and the counterfeiters and sellers should have no place to hide.
Tightly close market access, apply stringent qualification checks on producers, keep market circulation closed, let products come and go straight, clear the way, find a way from the source and root, and keep legitimate distributors safe to operate and farmers secure.
Activate rural consumption and direct demand for healthy consumption.
As consumption escalates, many farmers not only seek to feed well, eat well, but also pursue high-quality lives such as culture, health, etc., and cannot equate rural markets with low-quality " cheap" paintings.
This requires promoting the extension of e-commerce to a wider rural area, opening up rural-urban and urban-urban two-way distribution channels, promoting a combination of sub-urban industrial development platforms and online power trading platforms, and supporting the expansion of new patterns of consumption industries into rural markets; promoting the organic integration of business and trade logistics with recreational agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc. in eligible townships; and improving the modern rural circulation network system, optimizing the integration of stock facility resources and effectively reducing rural circulation costs.
Create a clear and secure market environment for the rural areas, so that farmers will not be able to consume, so that rural consumption will become more and more prosperous, and so as to enhance farmers ' sense of access to consumption and well-being.
Since November 1, we have reduced some MFN rates for commodities, and the total tariff level will fall to 7.5%.
Pursuant to the decision of the twenty-sixth ordinary session of the State Council, the State Council Customs and Excise Committee issued an announcement on 30 November 2018 to reduce the most-favoured-nation rates of some commodities as of 1 November 2018.
According to the State Council ' s Customs and Excise Committee ' s Proclamation on Reducing Tariffs on Imports of Selected Goods, the most favoured nation tax rate on some goods, including industrial goods, was reduced from 1 November this year in order to adapt to the needs of industrial upgrading, lower business costs and satisfy the population ' s consumption at multiple levels.
A total of 1,585 tax items, representing approximately 19% of our total tax lines, fell from 10.5% to 7.8% on average, with an average reduction of 26%.
This tax reduction mainly concerns textiles; stone, ceramic, glass products; parts of iron and steel and base metal products; mechanical and electrical equipment and parts such as metalworking machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, transmission and transformation equipment, electrical appliances, instrumentation, etc.; resource commodities and primary processing products such as non-metal mines, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, bottling stones, etc.
At the same time, as the overall level of tariffs, especially on pharmaceuticals and daily imports of consumer goods, has been reduced, the tariff lines of import taxes on imported goods have been reduced accordingly.
In follow-up to the decision-making deployment of the Party Central and State Council, we have imposed zero duty on the vast majority of imported medicines since 1 May this year, reduced import duties on cars and spare parts and part-time consumer goods from 1 July, and implemented an information technology agreement to extend the third step of tariff reduction on products.
Journalists have learned from the State Council Customs and Excise Committee that the overall level of our customs duties has fallen from 9.8 per cent in the previous year to 7.5 per cent, after successive autonomous adjustments since this year, with an average reduction of 23 per cent.
Appropriate tariff reductions would facilitate balanced development of foreign trade and higher levels of openness to the outside world, as well as the integrated use of both domestic and international resources and the promotion of structural reforms on the domestic supply side.
The relevant officials of the Committee stated that this year marks the fortieth anniversary of the reform and opening up of the country and that the initiative to reduce the overall level of customs duties is a practical step in implementing the spirit of Xi Jinping General Secretary ' s important speech at the Po-jin Asia Forum. It is also an important step in our country to further expand the opening up and actively expand imports in accordance with our own high-quality development needs. Such action and initiatives demonstrate China ' s firmness in pursuing a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy and, while enhancing its own development momentum, make China ' s
On September 29, the regional public branding of the "Close Countrymen" agricultural products of Gansu Quantsu province will be held in Nankai District, Tianjin city.
The Red Army Xiaomei, Black peas, mountain children's songs about Montenegrin sheep, tacked bitter tea, paper-cut books, hand-held slippers... a piece of finely packaged agricultural produce placed on the exhibition stage with a common brand name called the "Calling Country Man".
“Build a regional brand of the ‘Close Country’, effectively resolving the development bottlenecks of the ‘multiple scattered, small and weak’ agricultural products of the Rim county, and became a powerful vehicle for fighting poverty.” On 29th, the public branding of the ‘Close Country’ agricultural products region hosted by Gansu Quan Quantang County will be held in Nankai, Tianjin City.
The Qing Canton is located at the border of the three provinces and districts of Xiang Ganing, as "the advanced counties of the nation's food production", "China's village of small groceries", "China's village of Phi Shak", and has a long history and a wealth of resources.
The snacks of lamb meat, yellow rice wine, pasta, turd face, and the softness of the swallow face are often reminiscent of the sights of swimmers in other parts of the country.
As China ' s level of urbanization is increasing, the urban population is growing rapidly, and a large number of young rural people leave their homes to start urban life.
Chinese agricultural brand research specialist Yang Xiaojia said: "Now that urban life is fast and under stress, more and more people are beginning to miss their village life as a child, but, "The ones who don’t go home are called the village, the most beautiful memory is the village," and the ‘Close Villages’ brand design is named after the rural and rural peoples who wander around the country."
The surrounding county has special weather conditions, long daylight hours, very different day and night temperatures, and special little groceries are cultivated under exclusive conditions.
There are more than 20 small groceries produced in China, which are among China ' s small groceries. Production is the highest in Gansu, and quality is among the highest in the country.
Wang Xiaoli, a local girl who attended school in Tianjin, attended the presentation as a volunteer, saying: "The natives are the closest, the natives taste the most beautiful, the ‘Close Country’ brand brings back so much of our sorrows, memories, and still remembers the food there, hoping that the ‘Close Country’ brand will move further away and do more."
Dr. Tam Bin, researcher at the Scientific Research Institute of the National Food and Material Reserve, said that by testing more than 900 sets of indicators, all tests of agricultural products such as wheat, bitter and black beans in the Quarters were highly superior, many of the biologically active material content of the groceries was higher than the standard data, and that the “circle people” had the inherent advantage of taking advantage of the country's high-end markets for groceries.
Chai Chun, Secretary of the Qing County Committee, said that through the publication of the `Circle Countrymen' brand, it would further enhance the quality, standardization and scale innovation level of development of the Quality Agricultural Products of the Quality District, contribute to shaping the overall image of the Quality of the Agricultural Products of the District, and rapidly increase visibility, competitiveness and value addition.
Canada ' s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.2 per cent in July compared to the previous month, a higher than expected increase that warmed up the market ' s expectations that the Central Bank of Canada would raise interest rates next month.
If the interest rate really rises, it will be the fifth increase in the central bank's interest rate in a little over a year.
The analyst of the Reuters interview had previously estimated an increase of 0.1 per cent.
Statistics Canada reports on Friday that 12 of the 20 industries registered growth.
The data is noteworthy because the Central Bank predicted earlier this month that temporary factors might drag down third-quarter GDP data.
Central Bank of Canada President Poloze promised on Thursday that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates gradually and would pay close attention to economic data.
The next announcement of interest rates by the Central Bank of Canada will take place on October 24.
The Central Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017 as a result of the strengthening of the Canadian economy and the close to record low unemployment rate.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at Kai's macro level, said that the country's GDP ring growth rate in the third quarter of the economy was expected to be around 2 per cent per annum.
"This would be more than 1.5% higher than the Central Bank of Canada expected, and would therefore be another reason to expect the Bank to raise interest rates next month," he said in a report.
The overnight index exchange shows that the market forecast for the BCC rate increase in October rose from 76.46 per cent to 78.27 per cent.
In '65, the Koreans first jointly visited Han River to the sea.
The Korean Ministry of Defence confirmed on 5th that the Korean People ' s Democratic Republic of Korea had launched a joint expedition to Hanjiang and Pinjin River into the waters of the sea mouth on that day.
The initiative is a prelude to the guarantee of free navigation by civilian vessels on both sides.
A circular from the Ministry of Defence of Korea to the media on the same day showed that this was the first joint visit of the two sides to Han River to the sea mouth since the Korean War Armistice Agreement was signed in 1953.
In September of this year, Korea signed a military agreement to jointly visit the waters of Han River to the sea mouth and other waters in order to guarantee their environmental protection, development and tourism in the future, etc., starting in November.
In October, Korea and the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea planned a joint expedition to the waters at the General level.
On 5 November, the joint Korean-Korean water expedition was officially launched.
The joint mission was made up of 20 Korean and Korean military personnel, experts, etc.
According to the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea, neither side carried weapons during the visit, and it was prohibited to stimulate each other ' s words or actions.
"Because there are no military demarcation lines near the sea entrance, the area was an unexpectedly high point, but through joint expeditions it will become a new zone of peace in the future."
The total length of the joint Korean-Korean expedition was about 70 kilometres, with a total area of about 280 square kilometres.
The Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea informed that the Korean side would send six cruise ships to detect seawater depth, etc., to provide basic information for safe navigation in the waters; once the investigation had been completed, it would provide navigational maps for the movement of civilian ships.
The inter-Korean summit meeting held in Pyongyang in October 2007 reached agreement on the joint use of the Han and Pingjin Rivers at the sea entrance, but the subsequent negotiations were stunned by the tense situation on the peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed in September between the Koreans and the Koreans, both future ships need to inform each other well in advance before sailing in common waters.
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia on November 5, Chinese citizens Guo Yucsing and Mao Yusin lost contact during their tour in Mong.
It is understood that they were members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, and on 19 October they contacted relatives and friends in the country, said they were about to explore in the mountains near Kusugur Lake and shared their location via micromail, and since then they have lost contact and appear to have gone to the no-man's area.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to protecting the legitimate rights and interests and security of Chinese citizens in Mongolia and to consular protection and assistance.
Upon being informed of the loss of contact between the two visitors, the Embassy immediately launched the emergency plan for the insurance and tried to seize the time of the gold rescue and to work as hard as possible.
The Embassy maintains close communication with the family of the client, assists the family in reporting the case immediately to the police, and provides the family with a translation list for the choice.
The Embassy met with the heads of the Ministry of External Relations, the General Directorate of Police and the General Directorate of Emergency Situations of Mongolia for the first time, to inform them of the relevant situation, to request Monfon to conduct search and rescue as soon as possible and to maintain close communication with Monfon throughout the search and rescue process to ensure that the latest developments are kept up to date.
At the same time, the Embassy assisted the family in issuing a search notice at Mongwau and widely mobilized the active participation of Chinese and Chinese companies in the search, providing effective leads and providing relevant assistance to a number of Blue Sky rescue teams who went to Monghua to assist in the rescue.
After intense facilitation by the Embassy, Mon Fung first dispatched rescue teams and promised to exempt search and rescue costs.
The General Directorate of Police Mon and the General Directorate of Emergency Situations instructed the police and the emergency department of Kusuguor Province to do their utmost to search and rescue.
Due to the fact that Kusugul Lake is located at the border with Russia in northern Mongolia, remote and sparsely populated areas, and extremely difficult transportation and communications, and that Mongolia is now entering a harsh winter with a temperature of about 20 degrees below zero, the local police and emergency services have overcome enormous difficulties, mobilized almost the entire police force and mobilized local herders to carry out a wide range of carpet search and rescue operations around their lost location, including by riding horses, walking and visiting herders.
At the same time, in response to the special circumstances of the pastoralist area, Monfontain has been publishing circulars through radio loops for days.
The staff of the country's Blue Sky rescue team have also come and actively participated in the rescue, along with Monfon.
The safety and well-being of the two missing persons has always held our hearts.
So far, more than a decade has passed since the two were lost, the Embassy has received a number of leads, but no two have been found, and search and rescue operations are still under stress.
The Embassy will remain committed to the principle of “people-centred” and will keep this matter under constant observation, and will urge the Monse side to continue to do its utmost to search and rescue and to provide maximum assistance to the families of the persons concerned.
The Embassy appealed to Chinese compatriots and enterprises to contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia as soon as they learned about the relevant leads.
The ex-guard claims Michael Jackson put duct tape on his nose to get on the headlines.
Michael Jackson's former bodyguard claimed that the late singer had deliberately committed some strange acts in order to deliberately incite the media.
Matt Fides, who is now a real estate developer and owner of the martial arts/dance chain, told the Metropolis newspaper that Jackson thought that if he was no longer a public mystery, his personal obsession would end.
It was reported that, in order to be on the headline, he would wear a mask and put tape on his nose in order to spark the debate.
We'll tell you what's real. You can have your own point of view.
He knew how to manipulate the media. He knew exactly how to get on the headlines. He made Jackson's 10-year bodyguard Fides say, "Put a mask on his face, stick it on his hand with duct tape, or stick it on his nose with duct tape, which works in 90% of cases. He said he wanted his whole life to be the biggest mystery in the world."
And he added, "It's very sad that things don't turn out the same way."
Fides also spoke of the charges of child sexual abuse brought by Wade Robson and James Sefchak against Jackson, which were broadcast in the controversial Emmy award-winning documentary Departure from Dream Island.
Both Robson and Sefchak claimed that they had been abused by Jackson for years as a child.
Fitz said, "The paedophiles are all bullshit and this guy has multiple girlfriends and a legal marriage with Lisa Marie Presley, and that's his life."
He claims that Jackson's abuse of children on the Farm Island is “impossible” because he “almost” doesn't stay on the farm.
He said, "They said there were several boys around, but that's not true."
Jackson House denied all charges against the deceased star. Jackson denied all charges against him before he died in 2009.
The government has another 15 tax officials who have retired because of corruption.
New Delhi:
The Government forced the retirement of 15 tax officials during the fourth round of operations to combat negligence by officials suspected of corruption and other malfeasance.
According to official sources, according to Rule 56(J) of the Basic Rules, the Central Indirect Taxation and Customs Committee, which supervises the collection of taxes on goods and services and import duties, forced 15 senior officials to retire due to corruption and other charges.
This is the fourth round of dismissal of corrupt tax officials since June of this year. A total of 49 senior tax officials were forcibly retired in the first three rounds, including 12 officials of the Central Direct Tax Committee.
According to sources, this action was in line with Prime Minister Modi's speech to the nation in Red Fort, when Modi said that some of the bad horses in the tax administration might abuse their power, harass taxpayers, either target honest evaluation targets or take excessive action against minor or procedural irregularities.
He said, "We have recently taken strong measures to force a significant number of tax officials to retire, and we will not tolerate such behaviour."
Nearly half of the retired officials were arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation of India on suspicion of receiving illegal benefits. One of them was arrested for bribes of 15,000 rupees. One official was accused of not knowing the origin of the huge assets.
In June of this year, the government forced 15 Central Indirect Taxation and Customs Board Commissioners to retire on charges of embezzlement, taking bribes, smuggling and even conspiracy to commit crimes. Prior to that, the government forced 12 IRS senior officials to retire on charges of corruption, sexual harassment, huge unknown assets, etc., in accordance with section 56(J) of the Central Civil Service (pension) Rules.
In August, the government forced 22 Central Central Indirect Taxation and Customs Board officials to retire. Section 56(J) of the Central Civil Service (pensions) Rules 1972 provides for periodic review of the performance of government civil servants to determine whether they should remain in office or retire in the public interest.
According to these provisions, the situation of government employees provided for in Section 56(J), 56(1) of the Basic Rules 1972 or Rule 48(1)(b) of the Central Civil Service (pensions) Rules shall be reviewed six months before they reach the age of 50-55 if they meet the conditions set out in Rule 56(J) of the Basic Rules 1972 and in accordance with Rule 56(1) of the Basic Rules or Rule 48 of the Central Civil Service (pensions) Rules.
A Maine woman received 500 letters in five days from the joint health insurance.
Stephanie Ray said that from Thursday through Monday his mailbox was stunned by a letter from the insurance company.
"The first wave started last Thursday with 46 letters," she told CNN. "I immediately called the Joint Health Insurance and told them I had received 46 letters of the same content."
But the letter came back to over 500 as of Monday.
The letters were mailed to her son, who lived in a private nursing home with autism, and she explained. But opened the letter, which did not mention her son's name, but said, "The Honorable Maine State Department of Health and Human Services - Cincinnati", she told the local media.
These letters were all claims for 54 or 0 dollars outside the joint health insurance coverage, Ms. Ray.
When she asked why the joint health insurance had received a lot of letters, she was told that it was because there was a problem with the code, and she said.
In its statement, the Joint Health Insurance informed CNN that they were addressing the issue and that they could not provide more details in view of privacy requirements.
"We have identified the root causes of the problem. We apologize for the incident, and we have contacted the family and asked about them," said the health insurance company.
Ms. Ray said there was a message at the bottom of every letter calling people to be paperless. "I think these letters they sent wasted half the trees of the forest," she said.
Antonio Brown claims he's not ready to retire.
Antonio Brown said he would not retire from the National Football League of America, and just a few days ago he shouted on Twitter to announce that he had left the National Football League.
The four full-time catcher wrote on Twitter on Thursday: "I'm in good shape, why should I retire now?" He accepted the suggestion that the game needed him.
Brown was charged by two women for inappropriate behavior. He was released by the New England Patriots after a game last week. In the last six months, Antonio Brown was abandoned by three different teams.
Brown, who lost Nike's sponsor last week, said that he would start in Miami and train one day a week in high school.
Thirty-one-year-old Brown also had an argument on Twitter with Eric Weedell, a security guard for the Los Angeles Goats, who often fought with him while he was on the Baltimore Crows.
HSBC Bank converts crime detection tools to start new business.
The British HSBC Group (HSBC) has converted the algorithm that was used to detect financial crimes into a means to open up new business opportunities. The algorithm was created earlier as a result of the money laundering scandal, the head of the bank said.
The system combines data related to customer banking operations and company ownership with public data on directorship, tags suitable potential customers for HSBC staff, and provides a means of communicating with these customers through existing customer relationships.
The overall collection strategy of HSBC Bank is to seek more benefits from its large physical network and client data, while the use of data and artificial intelligence to try to increase revenue is also part of the strategy, and raising the overall collection is also the primary task of Interim Chief Executive Officer Noel Quinn.
"This is the first time that financial crime prevention inputs have been used for commercial purposes, and the business so developed has itself been low-risk and quick-impacted," said Stuart Neveson, the global head of HSBC's network bank.
HSBC refused to disclose the expected benefits of the new system, but stated that the overall “network gain” initiative had already generated hundreds of millions of dollars in additional benefits.
This is also an important step in the efforts of HSBC Bank to maintain its global operations, as some analysts and investors have previously stated that the Bank should downsize or exit markets with lower returns than capital costs, such as the United States market.
In 2012, HSBC failed to prevent drug traffickers from carrying out money-laundering activities through its Mexican subsidiaries, concluding a settlement agreement with US authorities of $1.9 billion. The hundreds of millions of dollars that were forced to invest in financial crime compliance were part of that agreement.
The system can achieve its original design by mapping relationships between individual clients and companies, looking for unusual trading patterns, or discovering previously unknown links between the two.
The system has freed the labour force of more than 400 employees who no longer need to manually check transactions and records, but are taking more responsibility for customer-oriented services, as stated by Adrian Rigby, Chief Operating Officer of HSBC Trade Operations.
Niveson of Hinthu pointed out that they suddenly realized that, with a slight modification of the tool, they could use it to find a “small green flag” for a more attractive potential client, rather than searching for a “small red flag” where violations occurred.
"We have acquired customer data sets, combined them with data from the (United Kingdom) company register, and then turned the previous algorithms to look for customers' potential, which could be achieved through registration, company development or existing customer links," Neveson said.
The tool has already mapped 22.5 million British entities and individuals and can identify a link network within three minutes, and bank staff often takes three hours to manually create the map, he said.
Ruhani says Iran has been promised that the US will lift all sanctions in exchange for dialogue.
European countries are eager to negotiate with Iran, and all hint that if Tehran were willing to engage in dialogue, the United States would end its sanctions on Iran, as President Hassan Rouhani said.
According to Rouhani, the European signatories to the 2015 Iran Nuclear Agreement urged him to meet with US President Donald Trump and promised Washington to lift “all” sanctions in exchange for dialogue.
"Three of the six -- the German prime minister, the British prime minister and the French president -- insisted on holding this meeting, saying that the United States would lift all sanctions," said the Iranian president.
He said that he had rejected the offer because the negotiations would take place under “the United States pressure and sanctions on Iran” and it was impossible to predict any outcome.
Trump quickly denied that he had provided any relief to Iran and on Twitter said that Tehran had asked him to lift the sanctions as a condition for dialogue, but he “of course” refused.
In his statement, Rouhani also said that many countries expressed their support for Iran at one-on-one talks during the United Nations General Assembly. “We discussed a number of topics with others, and all condemned the withdrawal of the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and its pressure. This was a great success for Iran.”
The government initiated consultations on the review of the law on the raising of dogs.
The Scottish dog law is under review for fear of uncontrolled animal control and lack of responsibility on the part of the owners.
The Scottish Government has initiated a consultation to seek public opinion.
The Scottish Minister of Community Safety has committed to “ensure the safety of the community and keep people away from irresponsible owners”, with a view to determining whether the law against uncontrolled dogs needs to be amended.
Member of Scottish Parliament Ash Denham said, "We are reviewing the dog-keeping laws twice, because we are absolutely determined to ensure the safety of the community and to keep people away from the irresponsible dog owners and their uncontrollable dogs.
The consultation aims to consult on how to improve the implementation of the 2010 canine control bill in Scotland, and next year we will review all canine control bills more broadly to assess whether changes are needed.
"The raising of dogs carries with it certain responsibilities, including keeping your dogs under effective control, and I encourage everyone interested in this field to respond to our opinion advice."
The public opinion consultation will last until January 15, including proposals to strengthen and clarify existing regulations, such as asking whether a national canine control database should be established.
The Scottish Parliament's Post-Legislative Supervisor has been hearing testimonies from victims and parents of children who were attacked or killed by dogs, urging the Government to review the law on dog raising.
Members of the Scottish Parliament were told that legislation was in urgent need of reform to protect vulnerable people and children.
The Committee was informed that, in Grand Glasgow and Clyde alone, 1417 people, including 255 children, were taken to the emergency section of the hospital last year after being bitten by dogs.
912 people were treated for NHS in Lanakshire and 439 people were treated for NHS in Alshire, both of the highest number of people treated in four years.
In July, members of the Council concluded that the current dog law was not relevant to its purpose and called on the Scottish Government to conduct a comprehensive review of all dog law.
The head of the committee, Jenny Mara, said, "Scotland dog-raising laws are not relevant to their purpose. There are still many dog attacks against children, but the existing laws that may prevent them are almost never enforced or understood.
"It's obvious that the current dog-keeping laws are not working. The current dog-keeping laws urgently need to be reformed in order to deal properly with uncontrolled and dangerous dogs, and we can try to build a system to prevent our children from being hurt by dogs."
The consultation was posted on the government website on Friday and reads as follows: "Uniform and effective enforcement of the law is key to solving the problems associated with uncontrolled dogs in Scotland.
The review focused on measures that could be taken to help aid enforcement agencies, such as local authorities, use their power to maintain community safety.
Saudi Arabia offered tourism visas for the first time and abolished the Abaya robe regulations
Currently, Saudi visas are granted only to foreign employees, their families and Muslim pilgrims.
Saudi Arabia said on Friday that it would provide for the first time a tourist visa to open up the extremely conservative kingdom to holiday tourists in order to promote economic diversification and reduce dependence on oil.
Launching tourism is one of the core elements of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ' s Vision Reform Plan 2030, which aims to prepare for the development of the largest Arab economy in the post-oil era.
Just two weeks ago, the United States Administration accused Iran of a destructive attack on Saudi Arabia ' s oil infrastructure, which disrupted the global energy market and raised concerns about wider regional conflicts.
“Opening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for my country,” said Ahamd al-Khatib, Director of Tourism, in a statement.
"Tourists will admire the treasure we share — the five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the vibrant local culture and the amazing natural beauty."
The Bloomberg Society quoted Khatib as saying that Saudi Arabia would open online tourist visa applications to citizens in 49 countries on Saturday.
Khatib said that Saudi Arabia would also relax the strict dress code for foreign women and allow them not to wear the blanketed Abaya robe, which is still the public dress that Saudi women must wear.
He added, however, that foreign women would be required to wear “peasant clothes”, without specifying them.
In this desert kingdom, which has numerous Bedouin monuments and archaeological sites, visas are currently limited to foreign employees, their families and Muslim pilgrims travelling to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
It was a rare initiative for Saudi Arabia to start the tourism industry by issuing temporary visas to tourists to participate in sports and cultural events last year.
But this serious kingdom prohibits alcohol consumption and has strict social norms, which many view as an obstacle to tourism.
Prince Muhammad is trying to change the situation through a comprehensive liberalization campaign that has brought new cinemas, mixed concerts and sporting feasts to Saudi Arabia.
Observers said that criticism by the international community of Saudi human rights records, including the horrific murder of the commentator Jamal Kashuji and the repression of female activists last year, could be further detrimental to attracting foreign tourists.
After the attack on September 14 on the State-owned oil giant Amer Oil Company, concerns about the regional conflict may also weaken the attractiveness of Saudis to holiday tourists.
In the face of low oil prices, the Government has expressed the hope that tourism will contribute 10 per cent to GDP by 2030, as opposed to only 3 per cent at present.
It is said that by 2030, Saudi Arabia aims to attract as many as 100 million tourists from home and abroad every year.
However, Saudi Arabia currently lacks infrastructure to accommodate so many tourists, and officials estimate that the country will need an additional 500,000 hotel rooms over the next decade.
The Government indicated that tourism was expected to create up to 1 million jobs in tourism as it responded to the high youth unemployment rate.
Saudi Arabia has invested billions of dollars to build tourism from scratch.
In 2017, Saudi Arabia announced a billions-dollar project to create luxury resorts in 50 islands and other original sites in the Red Sea.
Last year, Gidia's Entertainment City began construction near Riyadh, which will include high-end thematic parks, auto sports facilities and a hunting area.
The country is also developing historical monuments, such as Martin Shalle, who has hundreds of years of history, where the grave of sandstone remains from the building of the same civilization in the Jordanian city of Petra.
Facebook hides a bit of "good" in Australia's new test.
Facebook today says that it has already begun to hide the dynamic number of point `coffers' published in Australia, and this test is intended to relieve social pressure and is likely to spread globally in the future.
Today, Australian Facebook users can no longer see the number of reactions and video views of the dynamics that others publish, but they can still see the reactions of others to their dynamics.
"We don't want people to feel like Facebook is a game."
"This time we want to test people's use of the new version. We want to spend some time watching the new version's user feedback to see if it can be replicated," said the company.
Facebook users around the world exceed a billion, but the social media giant is also under pressure to prevent the platform ' s impact on users ' mental health.
According to the Australian Cybersecurity Commissioner, one in five children in the country reported having experienced cyber violence.
Before taking this decision, Facebook tested a version of the hidden number of praises on another important social media under its flag - the photo wall in July.
The photo wall was tested in Canada and subsequently extended to Australia, Brazil and several other major user markets.
Facebook calls this test "to get some information as soon as possible through a small scale test."
"Although testing of the photo wall is already under way, Facebook and (photo wall) are different platforms, so we may get different test data," said the company.
Social media giants have not confirmed how long the test will last.
"We'd like to know if removing some of the praises would improve the user's experience and limit other positive interactions," the Facebook Australian regional head, Mia Garrick, said.
Lorenzo strengthened to Hurricane 4 in the eastern Caribbean.
According to the National Hurricane Center of the United States, Hurricane Lorenzo was strengthened to Class 4 on Thursday, and the waves generated by the hurricane could affect the Windward Islands and parts of South America.
At 11 p.m., hurricane eyes are located about 1660 miles southwest of Azores. The eastern summer hour is updated. The storm moves northwest and northwest at 14 miles per hour, with a maximum sustained wind speed of 145 miles per hour.
The storm is not expected to land in the next few days, but a shift to the northeast on Saturday may bring Lorenzo closer to Azores next week. Weather forecasters predict that the storm will weaken to below level 3 on Monday.
The waves generated by the storm may cause life-threatening waves and currents in the Windward Islands and in the north-eastern part of South America.
Lorenzo was the second level 4 or higher storm in the Atlantic hurricane season. Dorian reached 5 in the vicinity of the Bahamas.
According to Philip Klausbach, a meteorologist at Colorado State University, the western hemisphere (including the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific basins) has produced 16 named storms since August 21.
Philip Klausbach wrote on Twitter: "This was one of the most recorded named storms in the Western Hemisphere between August 21st and September 21, breaking an old record of 15 named storms created between 1984 and 2002.
The patriot missile system was placed in Saudi Arabia after Iran attacked the oil facility.
American soldiers argued after a routine inspection of the Patriot missile battery located at the Turkish military base in Gaziantep, Turkey.
The Pentagon announced on Thursday that, as a result of the attack on Saudi oil facilities earlier this month, the United States plans to send a patriot missile battery, radar system and approximately 200 support personnel to Saudi Arabia.
Jonathan Hoffmann, spokesperson for the Pentagon, wrote in a statement that Defence Minister Mark Esper had “approved an increase in force to prepare deployment orders”. “Although no decision has yet been taken on the deployment of the additional troops, they will remain on high alert”.
The additional strength included two Patriot artillery batteries and a last-stage high-altitude area defence system, also known as the Sad anti-missile system.
SAD's anti-missile system is one of the most advanced missile systems in the world, capable of targeting incoming missiles and destroying them in the air. SAD interceptors are fired from launch vehicles, using kinetic energy to “crash and destroy” ballistic threats.
“It is important that these initiatives demonstrate our commitment to regional partners and security and stability in the Middle East. Others have accused Iran of causing disaster in the region, but we hope that they will help strengthen Saudi defense capabilities.” Hoffman wrote.
The United Nations world summit said that President Donald Trump had criticized Iran for its role in attacking Saudi oil facilities. The United Nations General Assembly said on Tuesday that they should press Tehran to engage in diplomatic negotiations.
"All nations have a responsibility to act. No responsible government should finance Iran's killing. As long as Iran does not stop its dangerous practices, sanctions will not be lifted, but will only be harsher."
On September 14, a strike at the world’s largest crude oil processing plant and oilfield forced Saudi Arabia to shut down half of its production operations. As a result, the price of crude oil experienced the largest surge in decades during the drone attack, and renewed concerns about the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East region.
The stunt jumper crashed into a large California Highway trailer and died.
The 28-year-old woman and seven other people jumped around 2 p.m. On Thursday, the California Road Patrol Public Information Officer Ruben Jones told CNN.
These people are taking off from Lodi's parachute center. CNN has contacted the agency to comment.
Jones said that the wind was heavy and that the woman hit a truck while the parachute team landed near Loti airport.
The television interviewed Lisa Reyes, who was driving on Highway 99 when the woman crashed, carrying her father and brother.
She said to the TV station, "The man struggled in the wind, but her body landed very, very fast."
Central Coast perverts disguised as child rapists were ordered to look directly at their victims in court.
In May 2017, the man, dressed in a leaf camouflage suit, grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind and dragged her into the bushes on her way to a school on the central coast.
He then tied the girl to a tree and sexually assaulted her.
Shortly after his arrest, the police searched one of his residences and found a number of items related to the investigation of the case.
The man accepted seven charges related to the attack, in addition to which he pleaded guilty to three other charges of enticement and sexual assault committed by the man against another 11-year-old girl between August 2016 and April 2017.
The 12-year-old victim was walking along a small road, and when she turned back, she saw him suddenly pulling out of the bush with a big branch and a knife in her hand.
The man was wearing a leaf camouflage dress.
Although the girl repeatedly begged the man to stop, the man locked her neck with his hand and dragged her into the bush.
The man said to the girl, "Shh, don't scream. Don't scream, or I won't blame you for being rude."
With a knife in his right hand, he tied the girl's hands and feet with nylonza, then tied her to a tree, violating her for almost an hour. After he let the girl go, the girl ran to school crying.
The man arrived at the work place at about 9.30 a.m., before which he was unable to respond to several messages and calls from colleagues.
His clothes were covered with dirt, grass and leaves and the like, and he claimed that he had had a road rage accident, ran with another driver, drove it into the bush and fell over the embankment.
The sentencing hearing for the man will continue on Tuesday.
California police didn't bring federal charges after shooting black people.
On Thursday, the federal authorities refused to bring civil rights proceedings against the Sacramento police, who shot the unarmed black man, and the shooting provoked many protests and prompted changes in the state laws restricting the use of lethal force by law enforcement agencies.
According to the U.S. federal prosecutor's office and the FBI, a federal review of the shooting of 22-year-old Stephen Clark in 2018 showed that there was no “substantiated evidence” to prosecute two policemen, Terence Merkadante and Jared Rowinette. They would return to police duties.
In March, the Attorney General's Office of California refused to initiate criminal proceedings in California against two policemen after completing a case investigation for almost a year. Attorney General Javier Bethella pointed out that the evidence showed that the two officers had reason to believe that their lives were in danger because the man was approaching them and suspected of holding a gun in his hand. The investigation found that he had a cell phone.
Also on Thursday, the Sacramento police issued a statement stating that their internal investigation did not reveal any violation of the rules or training requirements of the police station by the two policemen.
"Although no police violations of the rules of the police force were detected during this accident or during the process that led to the accident, we are determined to pursue a new strategy to avoid the recurrence of such tragedies," Daniel Hahn, Chief of Police of Sacramento, said in a statement.
Clark's brother, Stefan Clark, published developments on Facebook on Thursday, saying that he was in a meeting with federal and local authorities. "These people (in terms of accountability) totally failed," he wrote.
The authorities said that Clark was convinced that he had a pistol in his hand when he approached the police, and that he ran away from the police chase and ran to his grandmother's backyard. On the same night, the police went after Kraka after having reported that someone had broken the glass of a car and a glass slide door in an old neighbor's house.
When Clark approached the two policemen, the police shot him seven times.
Federal investigators examined relevant evidence, including witness testimony, live video and audio recordings, police records, police reports and autopsy reports, and used them to determine whether the police officers in question deliberately used force beyond objective and reasonable limits.
Last month, legislators added an amendment to the oldest law in the United States regulating the use of lethal force by the police, which will become the most stringent standard for the use of force in the United States once the entire police force has been trained.
California's old version of standards makes it very difficult to prosecute police officers who shoot guns, and it is even harder to convict police officers. This is based on the principle of “reasonable fear” that they can use lethal force if the prosecutor or examiner believes that the police have reason to fear for their own safety.
The new law, which has been in force since 1 January, requires the police to use lethal force only if the “necessary moment” is necessary to respond to a deadly threat to the police or surrounding personnel.
Pope Francis has warned about the use of artificial intelligence by technocrats to achieve public benefit.
Pope Francis warned the executives of technology companies, diplomats and financiers on Fridays that the creation of artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development competition increased the risk of social inequality unless the work included an ethical assessment of the public interest.
Francis spoke at a meeting of government envoys, Facebook and Google delegates, philosophers, physicists and ethical scientists in the Vatican. A few scholars and Catholic bishops participated in the conference "Public Interest in the Digital Age".
The Vatican side wants to have a place in the debate about artificial intelligence prospects and dangers, and this three-day meeting is the latest proof of that idea.
The debate included technological advances in war, increasing reliance on machines for future work, case studies of the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand and decisions taken by social media companies following the spread of Holocaust videos.
In this conference speech, Francis praised the potential of technological progress and pointed out that in the early days of the industrial revolution, machines kept workers away from danger and from monopolistic labor. But Francis also warned that increasing reliance on robots for profit could deprive people of their labor dignity.
He warned: "If technological progress is the cause of increasing inequality, then technology is not real progress." "If so-called technological progress becomes an enemy of the public good, then society as a whole will unfortunately degenerate into a barbarous age dominated by the most powerful laws."
The organizers of the conference indicated that they would like to use the expertise of the participants to find suitable consultants for the Catholic Church on high-tech issues in the future.
The House of Representatives held a vote on Friday to prevent the President of the United States, Donald Trump, from issuing a “State of Emergency Declaration”, which Trump would like to use to finance the proposed border wall.
The DDP-controlled House of Representatives passed a resolution to put an end to the Trump operation with 236 votes against 174 votes and sent the resolution to the President. 11 Republicans and one independent party supported the resolution. As 11 Republicans joined the DDP, the Senate passed the measure by 54 votes against 41.
Trump may veto the resolution, which will be the sixth time he has blocked parliamentary legislation in his capacity as president. He has already rejected a measure to end the state of emergency statement in March.
Neither House of Parliament appears to have failed to achieve the two-thirds majority vote required to overturn the veto.
Trump declared a state of emergency throughout the country in February because it was unable to secure the funds needed to build the southern border wall from the Mexican government and Congress. The Trump government plans to allocate $3.6 billion from military construction funds to border projects.
Democrats accuse Trump not only of bypassing Congress’s “bribage rights,” but also of using key defence funds to create unnecessary obstacles. A few Republicans in the House of Representatives and Senate have also expressed concern that Trump’s statement will lead to “overpowering” in the future.
Some senators and Republicans who will be participating in the elections next year are under enormous political pressure to vote in the state of national emergency.
Google launched its 21st anniversary graffiti: stories you don't know.
Google celebrates its birthday today with graffiti. The graffiti is a 90-year-old-style computer photo with Google search pages and a date stamp on September 27, 1998, surrounded by Google colours of five-colour paper chips. The search results page shows a smaller graffiti, and Google signs are designed as numeric 21-shaped candles. The search giant was founded 21 years ago by Larry Page and Sergei Bryn in 1998, when they were students at Stanford University in California. However, September 27 was not the real birthday of Google.
If you think that the company's founding date is the company's birthday, Google was born on September 4, 1998, but the company never celebrated its birthday on that day, at least not in the form of graffiti. Until 2005, Google celebrated its birthday with graffiti on September 7, then changed to September 27.
Initially, the search engine was referred to as the Internet reptiles and later changed its name to Google.
"We named our system Google because it's a common spelling of Google (or 10100), which coincides with our goal of creating a large-scale search engine," Sergei Bryn and Lawrence Page wrote in a paper published in 1998 on launching a prototype of a "large search engine".
The company was founded thanks to the co-founder of the solar computer system, Andy Bertolsheim, who invested $100,000; in June 1999, the company raised $25 million from Redwood capital and Kei Penghua. Google moved to the Mountain View Office the same year and is still there. In 2001, company technology was patented.
Starting with a web search engine, Google is a subsidiary of a huge corporate group of letters holding shares. Today Google operates in more than 100 languages worldwide, answering trillion search queries every year.
Google wrote on the "Our Story" page: "The relentless search for better answers remains at the heart of everything we do." "Today, Google has over 60,000 employees in 50 different countries, ranging from pipelines, Andre to Psychiatry, and, of course, Google searches to develop hundreds of products for billions of people around the world. Although we have abandoned Lego servers, companies have added only a few dogs, our enthusiasm for building technology for everyone has been with us -- from dormitory to garage until today.
Trump denied Iran's claim that oil prices fell after the US proposed lifting sanctions.
On January 10th, 2019, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke at a ceremony in Tehran, Iran.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani claimed on Friday that the US proposed to lift all sanctions on Iran in exchange for negotiations, which led to a fall in oil prices. President Donald Trump and the US State Department later denied these claims, causing oil prices to rebound from a low point.
The latest price of the Middle crude oil futures in Western Texas fell to US$ 55.91, or 0.9 per cent, before falling to US$ 54.79. Brent crude oil futures fell to US$ 61.89, or 1.4 per cent.
According to Reuters, Rouhani said on his official website, "The German Chancellor, the British Prime Minister and the French President are all in New York, and they insisted on convening this meeting. The United States said it would lift the sanctions." "What sanctions will be lifted in the future are still to be discussed, but they (the United States) have made clear their intention to lift all sanctions."
Trump later responded to Iran, "Of course not!" He expressed Iran's hope that he would lift the sanctions in order to hold a meeting.
According to the Bloomberg News Agency, the United States Department of State described the report as “unfounded” and added that the United States was determined to reduce the Iranian regime's oil exports to zero.
On September 14, a series of drones attacked Saudi Arabian oil facilities, forcing the country to cut oil production by half, and Rouhani commented on it. The United States and some European countries, as well as Saudi Arabia, blamed Iran for the attack. Tehran denied that it had played any role in the incident. The Trump government also announced plans to deploy American troops to the region.
The U.S. Department of State did not respond immediately to the U.S. consumer news and business channel evaluation request.
John Kildaf of Rehabilitating Capital said, "People may have for a long time failed to appreciate the easing of tensions in Mei, which will allow for the immediate re-entry of large quantities of oil into the market."
"This is not only about Iran's production and export, but also about millions of barrels of oil in floating oil storage facilities and millions of barrels of oil in Chinese ports awaiting customs processing," said Kirdaf.
Trump ordered the United States to withdraw from the nuclear agreement signed by Iran, the United States and five other countries last year, under which countries lifted sanctions against Iran in exchange for their commitment to cease nuclear projects.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has been the target of United States sanctions for decades, and Washington accused it of recently attacking the oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, which Tehran denied. Iran also shot down an American military drone and announced plans to execute 17 suspected American spies.
Enhancing security in Afghanistan in response to presidential elections
Afghanistan has conducted large-scale security operations throughout the country in preparation for the national presidential elections on Saturday.
The Government will arrange for approximately 100,000 security personnel to guard polling stations in response to the threat posed by Taliban forces.
Fearing reprisals, many voters (especially in rural areas) would remain at home, while others said that the voting system was prepared for powerful people and not suitable for the poor.
Royal News: How Princess Beatriz "Anger to deal with hostile family members"
On Thursday, the Duke and Duchess of York announced that their eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, was engaged to her boyfriend, the 34-year-old property owner, Eduardo Mapelli Motz. As the ninth successor to the British throne, the princess will marry Mapelli Motz next year. In a statement, the couple said, "We are all excited to start this journey together.
"We have many similar interests and values, and we know that this will benefit us in future years of love and happiness."
Princess Beatrice's parents Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson also expressed their excitement.
Duchess York wrote on Twitter: "I know what my mother feels like, so I shed tears of joy. I am proud of this sensational news.
Andrew and I are the luckiest people because we have two wonderful sons-in-law."
This royal wedding will be an opportunity for the whole royal family to come together again, hoping that this will completely repair the relationship between Figi and the Duke of Edinburgh.
Ever since Sara became involved in one of the greatest scandals in the Royal family history, her relationship with other members has become extremely difficult.
In 1992, five months after the announcement of the break-up with Prince Andrew, the pictures of her and her “financial adviser” at the resort house in Saint Tropice were made public.
In these photographs, images of John Bryan, a millionaire from Texas, kissing, sucking on the toes and foot bows of the Duchess were reported to have been the strongest reaction of Prince Philip to the scandalous behaviour of the Duchess' daughter-in-law.
However, it was reported that he was “shocking” at the behaviour of the Duchess of York, and Princess Beatrice had claimed that her mother was the victim of a “defeated act that made her feel unwelcome”.
Recent information: Close the door to Kate and William: the shock habits of the couple are exposed
It was reported that the Duchess' spokesperson was unable to comment on it, but a friend of Figi's said, "Sarah's daughters are very tired of the way members of the royal family treat their mothers, which is no secret anymore.
"She received some bills that were pretty mean.
"They have been blaming their father for allowing such things to happen, and in particular Beatrice has been begging Prince Andrew not to treat their mother like a deportee."
Last October, at the wedding of Princess Yugini and Jack Brooksbank, Philip and Sarah were filmed together for the first time in 26 years.
There's been a second wave of strikes in Oregon.
At the same time, the average annual salary of university principals is US$ 500,000 and the annual salary of four university sports coaches is slightly lower, amounting to US$ 1 million. While the salary of school managers is six digits, the overall administrative expenditure is still rising, and one sixth of the confidential staff is eligible for food vouchers.
As another IT worker at Portland State University said, "I'm willing to take part in the strike because I think it's unfair that the wages paid to people cannot guarantee their lives in the cities they serve." Teresa Stackerberg, Portland State Library staff, said more directly, "I want to strike because I've worked here for 24 years, I need a raise, I need to feed my family."
As inflation increased, the cost of living in Oregon skyrocketed, and these staff members were in trouble, with little sympathy from management. The contract negotiations that started in mid-August were interrupted. At that time, the bosses made a number of particularly excessive proposals — a slight increase in the cost of living, a rejection of the seniority requirements of long-term university staff, an increase in the cost of meals for employees — staff members thought it was disrespectful or even cruel treatment. Fulmer said, “There is an unwritten class system in college. We are at the bottom.”
He went on to say, "For decades, educators have been under attack. We have finally stood up to fight back. When corporate executives see their relative cynic pay rising at a rate higher than inflation, discrimination against the class and a squeeze on the middle class will level up and face it. But when the same thing happens in education, the staff won't continue to tolerate it."
The staff of Oregon State University are not the only people to take action. Oregon is now a hot and hot powder keg, and the fuses are burning. Fred Meyer's grocery store workers in the supermarket chain are engaged in intense campaigns against employers, and although there is no official strike plan, tensions are escalating; their union, the local 555-member Federation of Food and Commercial Workers, has called for a joint boycott and produced an unfair labour practice report on the chain.
In the health care industry, if the local 49-member of the International Federation of Service Employees of Kessa Medical Institutions did not reach an agreement before the expiration of the existing contract in October (only temporarily avoided through a new interim agreement), the strike (a 98% approval rate) would be approved. In other areas of the industry, the Oregon Nurses Association, representing more than 120 nurses from Astoria Hospital, was deadlocked in contract negotiations with the hospital administration, and the last contract of these nurses expired in May, and the time was very tight.
Burly explained: "The labor movement in Oregon is very strong and indeed very thorough. This is part of a wave of labor growth across the country. People see economic instability, real wages are falling, and the solution is collective action in the workplace."
The extent to which such collective action will take place this fall is not yet clear, but it is certainly appropriate if the strike returns to the northwest in 2019. We can only hope that the spirit of action will spread further to the midwest agriculture, southern manufacturing, Texas oil fields, the Appalachian coal mine, Northeast construction, Silicon Valley technology giants, and any middle sector or industry. God knows that everything will pay.
Political civilization: The new prize program was set up to overcome Westminster differences and honour polite and decent politicians.
The new award program was set up to honor the polite and decent politicians.
When Parliament resumed, Westminster ushered in a contentious week.
During this controversial week, threats faced by parliamentarians and statements such as Prime Minister Boris Johnson provoked outrage.
In response to differences, the "political civilization" award was announced last Friday, and politicians were awarded £3000 a year for charity.
Boris Johnson was criticized for the tone he used in the House of Commons.
Lord Stewart announced the award, saying, "We all agree that British politics is facing a crisis of trust and civilization.
“The British dispute between Europe and Europe is growing and differences and suffering are increasing, and we firmly believe that politics must respond, not to these trends, but to resist them.
These awards are a small attempt made by a group of publics to draw public attention - to different or no political affiliations - to politicians who defend their reasons in a proper and polite manner, and to those who are able to reach out to people and cooperate across differences that affect us all."
The nomination will be announced in cycle six, and the award ceremony will take place next March.
In an exclusive interview with the British Standard Evening newspaper today, former Cabinet Minister Amber Raad accused Johnson of using provocative words such as “de facto incitement to violence”.
Johnson, for his part, said that he was "sorry" about the threats directed at parliamentarians.
Jesse Phillips was "scared" after receiving death threats for fear.
On Thursday, Labour Congressman Jesse Phillips - another guy who criticized Johnson - said that a man was arrested after trying to “kick off” the door of her constituency office and that the man was said to be a fascist.
Meanwhile, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Joe Svenson, spoke to the police after a young child had been threatened.
Elie Cooper, the daughter of Labour Senior Congressman Ivette Cooper, posted a fast-circulation post on Twitter about her fear for her mother after Cox was murdered. Ellie Cooper accused Johnson of “incitement to violence against parliamentarians” with words.
Lead by example? America's income gap is the highest in history.
Last year, the income gap between the rich and the poor in the United States was the highest since the US Census Bureau began to count income in 1967. Washington and New York were among the regions with the largest income disparities.
The United States may be the richest country in the world, but the same is true of its current situation: the super-rich can continue to grow and grow, however, while poor families often rely on "financing me" (a popular website) to pay for medical care. Economic imbalances affect both wealth and income, and the latter is at the highest level in history.
One way to measure the income gap is the Gini coefficient. The Gini coefficient is the smallest 0, representing the absolute average, and the largest 1, representing a scenario in which a family has all the income in the country. For over 50 years, the Census Bureau has been tracking this indicator. The Gini coefficient in the United States was 0.397 in 1967, but it rose to the highest 0.485 in 2018.
There are other countries in the world where the income gap is more severe, including some quite powerful economies. For example, the World Bank estimated the Gini coefficient for South Africa in 2014 at 0.63, while the Gini coefficient for Brazil in 2017 was 0.53. By comparison, the Gini coefficient for all EU countries is below 0.4.
New data show that the areas with the highest income differentials are often the areas where wealth is concentrated, including Washington, D.C., New York, Connecticut, and, of course, some poor areas, like Puerto Rico and the United States of America, Louisiana. The five states have the highest levels of economic equality in Utah, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota.
Census Bureau data also show that the growth of the median household income has stagnated, rising to over $62,000. This is the highest level measured by the American community survey, but the increase from 2017 to 2018 was only 0.8, a significant decrease from the increase of the previous three years, and if inflation levels are taken into account, the number has barely increased.
The new statistics are likely to bring the direction of the campaign for the Democratic candidate nominated within the presidential election party next year, which usually supports the collection of additional taxes on super-rich and large companies.
The aim was to convince multinational corporations to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US, while allowing incomes to flow to middle-class and poorer classes. In fact, these policies seem to have generated additional income for the executives, while most other Americans have missed the benefits of economic growth and record low unemployment.
A man from North Carolina was drawn five times in the same lottery.
A North Carolina man was drawn five times in the same lottery, including the first prize of $163634.
Garan Lancaster of Picver told the North Carolina Education Lottery officer that, when he was staying at the Wiesam Brothers Company in Pycville, he bought five cash lottery tickets with his five sets of numbers, which could be taken five times on Monday night.
"When the prize was drawn, my wife wrote down my number," Lancaster said, "When my wife handed me the paper, I checked the lottery, I couldn't believe it. One line matches 5 numbers, the rest matches 4 numbers. I screamed, "I won! I won!" I won the lottery!"
Lancaster has a five-digit line that matches the winning number, winning $163634 for him, while the four remaining lines match their respective winning numbers winning $250 for him.
The winner said that he intended to use the money to pay his bills and carry out some house repairs.
Tristan Thompson, Cole Kardashian's cheating ex-boyfriend, left another very provocative comment on her photo wall, after rumours that he wanted to get back together with Kardashian.
Tristan Thompson, Cole Kardashian's cheating ex-boyfriend, left another very provocative comment on her photo wall, after rumours that he wanted to get back together with Kardashian.
Earlier this year, the 35-year-old star completely abandoned the American National Basketball Association player because Thompson was accused of cheating with his family friend Jordan Woods -- before that, when Koler had his daughter, Tru, who was nine months pregnant, Tristan had cheated.
Someone found Tristan leaving another passionate compliment on Koller's photo wall home page.
However, 28-year-old Tristan refused to give up easily - leaving an embarrassing euphemism on his ex-girlfriend's latest selfie.
In this vague picture, Koehler stood in front of the rising sun and wrote in her mother's image, "May you have the courage to explore every dream you dream of."
In a public comment, Reitristan wrote, "The sun shines brightly on your beautiful [diamond expression]."
The fans were irritated by this comment, and some answered, "Yes, the diamond you dropped."
Tristan betrayed her when Kohl was nine months pregnant.
Another fan warned, "Get out of the photo wall."
The third person wrote, "Kolle, don't fall for it."
Just a few days ago, Tristan wrote, "Perfect," accompanied by a heart-shaped eye expression, underneath one of Koller's other reality show photos, a picture of her modeling Gaius jeans.
The Sun News revealed that earlier this month Tristan, at Drake's suggestion, spent Pound400,000 on buying a Porsche for Kohler and trying to get back together with Kohler.
Earlier this year, he was accused of cheating with a friend of the Kardashian family, Jodin Woods.
After his rap partners urged a "big move", Tristan decided to choose this benevolent gift, said to be the Porsche 911.
In the end, his friends said that Tristan had won an invitation from Kohler and had been able to attend a "Taco" dinner at her house on Tuesday -- which brought him closer to being reunited with Kardashian and their 17-month-old daughter, Tru.
One source said, "Tristan and Drake are good friends, and while he was planning to recover Kardashian, he kept asking Drake for advice.
Tristan's infidelity broke Kohler's heart.
Drake told him that if he wanted to recover Kohler, he would have to do everything he could.
"Although it may sound unreasonable to trade a fancy superrunner for a random dinner.
"But after Tristan did this, Kohler didn't immediately open the red carpet for him."
The couple is the parents of the 17-month-old Tru.
In a new season reality show series, Walking with the Kardashian Family 16, Köller Kardashian cried out of tears because of his boyfriend Tristan Thompson's affair.
The Sun last month revealed that Tristan had vowed to invite Kohler to a romantic Greek trip: "I'll get my family back."
Although Kohler was heartbroken about Tristan's constant derailment in their relationship, earlier this year he invited Tristan to their daughter Tru's first birthday party.
However, the star ' s family reality show " Walking with the Kardashians " later showed that the incident ended with Kölle ' s pain in accepting Tristan ' s infidelity.
Children's hospital freezer malfunctioned and 56 children with cancer suffered stem cell damage.
The L.A. Children's Hospital freezer malfunctioned, causing 56 children to lose their blood stem cells, which were collected at the beginning of tumor treatment for each patient and stored for future use.
The hospital wrote in a statement: "We apologize for causing pain or confusion among patients and their families. If you do not receive a letter or phone call from our team, your child will not be affected."
All patients have received basic treatment, with the exception of one patient. Chief Medical Officer James Stan says that the patient does need to reabsorb stem cells.
The letter sent in early September to the patient’s family informing them of the loss of stem cells was sent unexpectedly to the children, not to the parents. The hospital also apologized to the parents, saying that they would monitor the transmission of the messages.
The hospital said that the long storage of stem cell damage did not endanger the health of any child. The hospital has also provided assistance to families who wish to collect it again. But the collection process may be difficult.
One of the patients called it "suffering." Sean Anderson Corona, 13 years old, was diagnosed with a 4-stage neurological mother-cell tumor (a cancer often found in the adrenal gland), and he was treated with stem cells. The boy stayed alive all day and the machine collected stem cells from his blood. The machine then re-injected the blood into the body.
"I'll try to sleep, but my body will start shaking, and then I'll start to freak out and start crying," Corona told ABC-7.
Corona won't have cancer again for three years this November. But his mother, Elizabeth Anderson, said that she feared that if he had cancer again, she might not be able to collect more stem cells from his blood.
Stan said that patients would only be recommended to reacquire stem cells if the patient needed stem cells to repeat his or her condition.
He said, "We think it's almost impossible, so we don't ask anyone to do it in advance."
The courtyard has replaced the freezer and the sensor monitoring and alarm system has been upgraded.
"This is obviously a huge expense for us." Stan said, "We will personally contact every family to ensure that all their questions are answered."
Prince Harry has been passing through Angola's minefield on foot after Duffy's mother.
This is the sixth day the Duke of Sussex came to Africa with his wife and son Megan and Archie. But on Friday morning, Prince Harry returned to Angola alone with the intention of inheriting the legacy of his mother, Princess Diana.
The bright blue protective vest provided by the HALO Trust successfully inherited the mother's legacy. Twenty-two years ago, Princess Diana left a trail on a similar path through an area of deadly mines in Angola that were left behind during the civil war. This was one of the most iconic images of her brief life.
On January 15, 1997, Princess Diana of Wales, wearing protective vests and masks, visited a minefield cleared by Halo Trust charity in Huambo Province, Angola.
Diana has been trying to eliminate this weapon of war, but she has not been able to do so throughout her life, and she died just a few months before the promulgation of the International Convention on the Prohibition of Landmines in December 1997.
Twenty years later, the world is still not free of the threat of landmines. Prince Harry detonated a newly detected mine and responded loudly and clearly to her mother ' s legacy.
Prince Harry said, "Mines are the wounds of war that have no healing. By clearing mines, we can help local communities achieve peace, which offers opportunities."
Prince Harry detonated the latest mine in Angola.
Thomas Cook's pension trustee planned the spending rescue agreement.
The pension fund under Thomas Cook has begun negotiations with professional insurance companies on an agreement to save the retirement benefits of this bankrupt tourist group.
Sky News has learned that the President of the Trusteeship Agency, Steve Steeter, is negotiating a buyout agreement with several companies that will exempt the 14,000 majority members of Thomas Cook's pension scheme from a significant reduction in pension payments.
Any transaction with an insurance company may involve a cut in expenditure, which is much smaller than the 10 per cent that was triggered by the transfer of the pension scheme to the pension protection fund's lifeboat.
The discussion is still at a very preliminary stage -- even if successful -- and the agreement will not be reached until the pension protection fund evaluates Thomas Cook's program.
Thomas Cook's bosses are facing investigation into the reasons for the collapse of the group.
The survey may last for two years, and if Thomas Cook does introduce pension protection funds, the future spending on about 10,000 pensioners will be reduced by 10 per cent.
According to relevant sources, several pension risk transfer experts, as well as at least one new superfund integration company, are negotiating an agreement with Thomas Cook's trustee.
Four days after the closure of Britain's oldest travel company, news of the trustee's efforts to ensure the welfare of its members triggered an international repatriation plan and caused thousands of people to lose their jobs.
Thomas Cook's deep-seated bankruptcy triggered a fierce recrimination game, and Board members, government ministers and auditors need to explain their actions in the months preceding the group's bankruptcy.
According to the latest data, Thomas Cook's four pension schemes are well funded, with a £100 million surplus based on pension protection funds.
In total, they hold assets worth about £1.5 billion.
However, as the sky news revealed last month, the trustee asked Thomas Cook to propose more favourable terms for the rescue agreement, which complicated the conclusion of the transaction.
Thomas Cook's bankruptcy ended his 178-year-old solvency deal, prompting government bankruptcy service agencies, accounting regulators and an influential Parliamentary Committee to initiate investigations into Thomas Cook.
Ministers had set up a task force to deal with the crisis, which had left creditors with meagre gains after group bankruptcy.
To date, less than half of Thomas Cook's overseas British clients have returned home.
Just hours before his bankruptcy, Thomas Cook sent a final plea to his lending institution to reduce the financing needs of Pound200 million.
What's wrong with Thomas Cook?
Negotiations ended on Sunday night, but no agreement was reached, and Thomas Cook was forced to seek over Pound10 billion in new financing, which was the last of its frenzy. Previously, the company had lost Pound1.5 billion for six months, and the deal was deteriorating.
Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 by a 32-year-old furniture carpenter, a former Baptist missionary, to launch a one-day train trip from Lester to Ravburg, with only one shilling each.
Thomas Cook has been one of the largest resort companies in the world ever since, three years ago, on its 175th anniversary.
A spokesperson for the Pension Protection Fund said, "Some bankruptcy events, such as Thomas Cook's bankruptcy, are exactly why the Pension Protection Fund was established.
"We provide financial security for the future of the members of the fixed-benefit pension scheme, and the members of the scheme should be assured that we will protect them."
Thomas Cook's pension trustee spokesman refused to comment on Friday.
The picture is that the newly-born rhinoceros is rubbing their noses and exploring their new home.
The baby named Stella was born early this month at the Kotswald Wildlife Park in Oxford County, the first female baby of Monty and Ruby.
The cub is healthy and well cared for, as can be seen from the photo, it is curious about its surroundings and sleeps on a straw bed with its mother.
In 2009, mother Ruby and another female named Nancy joined the wildlife park, hoping to have the first small rhinoceros in the park with Monty.
In 2013, Nancy produced the next female cub named Astrid, and Stella was the third female cub born in 49 years after the park was built.
Jamie Craig, head of Kotswald Wildlife Parks, said, "We have achieved great success in the development of the existing rhinoceros.
"Stra is the sixth child of Nancy and Ruby's family, and our bull Monty has proved to be an excellent father.
"He is the perfect combination of a bull with power and a caring parent.
"It is particularly gratifying that Ruby has given birth to a cow calf, which is vital to the development of breeding plans, and Stella will eventually be transferred to another group, hoping that she will become a successful mother herself."
Ruby had two male cubs before, Ian in 2015 and Allen in 2017. Alan stayed at the park, and Ian was at the Turin Zoo in Italy.
When Alan was only a week old, he weighed about 11 stones.
Surrounding births is considered extremely rare. Females only reproduce every two and a half to five years, so the window of opportunity for successful reproduction is limited.
According to the park, female rhinoceros usually have to pass 16 to 18 months of pregnancy before giving birth to a small rhinoceros.
It is considered to be one of the longest-pregnancy animals in terrestrial mammals, after only 22 months of elephants.
The little rhinoceros just born can stand up within an hour of birth. After birth, the little rhinoceros will immediately try to suck, although in the first few days its feet might be a little shaky.
It will suck milk for about a year under the eyes of the mother.
They're very close, and little rhinoceros will stay with their mothers for at least two years under their mother's protection. Females will be very active in protecting their offspring, and if they are challenged, they will intimidate their opponents.
Alex Minasian, who was involuntarily alone, told the Toronto police that he was a member of the 4chan website.
The man in the picture allegedly killed 10 passers-by in Toronto and told the police that he was a member of an online sex-deficit men's organization.
Twenty-six-year-old Alex Minasian said he was a member of the Forum of Involuntarily Singles on the 4chan website.
After the attacks of April 23, 2018, he now faces 10 murder charges and 16 attempted murder charges in Canada.
When asked about the deceased, he told the police: "I feel like I have accomplished my mission."
After the incident, attention was drawn to the world of online isolation, anger and irritation.
Minasian said that he had contacted a killer in California who was angry at the woman who rejected him.
He was accused of driving a rented van into a crowd in a busy community north of Toronto. Eight women and two men were killed in a crash, and the dead ranged from 22 to 94.
Minasian has yet to raise a plea. His trial started in February, but the publication ban on him being questioned by the police was lifted today. The police interviewed him hours after the attack.
Minasian stated that he had never had a girlfriend and that he was a virgin, admitted to using the van as a weapon and said he wanted to launch more attacks.
He said, "A few other people I met online felt the same way," but added, "They're too timid to act to vent their anger."
Minasian called himself "incel," which is the acronym for "involuntarily single person." The involuntary solitarian movement is a web-based subculture associated with the deadly attacks in Toronto and the attacks in California and Florida.
Sociologists and other scholars who study this group believe that the “involuntarily single person” has gradually become popular language that provokes certain men who are angry because they have been rejected by women and tend to generate violent revenge ideas.
At online forums, interested people sometimes use "Chad" and "Stacey" as sarcastic words to refer to men and women who are more active in sexual life, respectively.
Minasian said that he had discussed his sexual misconduct on the 4chan website, which is notoriously the site where extremists express their views.
U.S. Houseline is worried about shooting again, and the clown audience is forbidden to dress up and watch.
The biggest independent court line in America forbids viewers dressed up to watch the widely praised Joker -- telling stories about the super-negative world in Batman movies. Although the cinema has banned viewers from wearing masks or painting faces, security concerns remain.
Most American courtlines have banned viewers from wearing masks, painting faces, or carrying toy weapons, because in 2012, when another Batman film, The Rise of Dark Knights, was shown, there was a major shooting in Colorado. The gunman was wearing a clown costume, shooting and throwing tear gas at the audience, resulting in 12 deaths and 70 injuries.
However, this time, the Mob announced that viewers dressed up were not allowed to watch the restricted movie " Clown " .
"I want the audience to be more relaxed when watching the movie," Ted Mondov, director and chief executive officer of the local cinema, told Hollywood reporters.
The company, with its headquarters in Los Angeles, has 52 cinemas in 27 regions of the country and is the largest professional cinema line in the United States.
At the same time, the biggest series of cinemas in the United States, the American multi-challenged cinemas with headquarters in Kansas, reiterated that the cinemas prohibited "masks, paint faces or any object that shielded the face", but welcomed viewers in costumes.
Most of the masks and fake guns are banned for practical security reasons, but as the Joker's appearance approaches, people fear that it will trigger an imitation shooting. The LAPD says that on the day of the premiere, the police will be “advanced” around the cinema, while the King's Theatre, the second largest chain in the United States, says that security measures developed “in cooperation with NATO” are being implemented.
The U.S. Army even warned military personnel to be aware of “involuntarily single people”, usually men who are disaffected because they are denied dating opportunities and worship clowns who may imitate his cruelty.
The Clown, led by Todd Phillips and led by Jackon Phoenix, was set to land on the entire American courtyard line on October 4, and it is predicted that the film will recreate a ticket house record. The film owner is the offspring of an isolated, mentally disturbed man who became a killer, green-haired, pale-faced enemy of Batman.
The Clown was well received after the premiere of the Venice Film Festival and won the highest prize, the Golden Lion Award. It was a psychological horror film adapted from comics of the same name. Some film critics were concerned that the film could have negative effects, because the film sympathized with the opposition, and the violent images were too written. However, the film's creative team said that the audience of the film was adults who could identify the wrong or wrong.
Midway Broadcasting announced today that the director of the company, Ms. Melody Spaniard Cooper, will publish a much-awaited new book to help women entrepreneurs and executives develop their careers. The Guide to Successful Transactions for Women's Friends shares many of her ideas and ideas, including how women can speak at the negotiating table in order to gain equal status, and how to use the female version of the Alumni Network for career development.
In his book, Spaniard Cooper constantly quotes anecdotes to explain controversial topics, including the #I too” campaign and the failure of President Hillary Clinton's campaign and its impact on the rise of women's empowerment in the United States.
In 2017, Spaniard Cooper gave a breakthrough speech at the Chicago National Association of Businesswomen to promote a sense of self-favourability, and the author's self-published book was the culmination of this speech. The language style of the Guide to Successful Transactions by Women Friends is very strong, and every female friend can find contact with herself in the book.
Christy Hefner, a businessman and founder of Playboy, was the daughter of Hugh Hefner, who said, "The Guide to Successful Dealing with Women's Friends is very interesting and helpful. Melody combines personal anecdotes, success stories, frustration lessons with practical experience. From how to express her thoughts in a meeting to when to make friends, everyone can benefit greatly from the story of Melody."
As the director of Midway Broadcasting Corporation, she bought the company's holdings in 1999 and successfully joined the United States elite women's broadcasting company. Midway Broadcasting Corporation is a top female family-style media company with multiple broadcasting and interactive platforms under its banner.
T. Sean Taylor, co-author of the book, was a journalist, writer and founder of the full range of service media consulting companies, Tre Top Consulting.
Romania spends billions on the Black Sea military base.
The Focus News Agency quoted the Times report that Romania will spend 2.5 billion euros to modernize the Black Sea military base to counter the growing power of Russia in the region. Documentation published on local news sites attests that the Mikhail Koglighanu Air Force Base, located about 200 kilometres east of Bucharest, will be consistent with NATO standards. It can accommodate up to 10,000 NATO F-35 fighter fighters. It plans to build a military “mini-city” with kindergartens, sports clubs and hospitals.
The base has become the centre of NATO’s increased activity in the Black Sea, where the Black Sea has become a key area of tension between Russia and the West. Following Moscow’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin began to use its deep sea base in Sevastopol to carry out naval missions in Syria to increase its naval presence in the Black Sea. Russia has also obstructed the region’s transport, capturing three Ukrainian ships in the Quechu Strait last year.
Romania and Bulgaria were on the coast of the Black Sea, formerly allies of the Soviet Union, and joined NATO and the EU after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Times said that, in response to Russia's actions, they had asked NATO to strengthen its presence in the region. In February, 500 US troops arrived at Romania's airbase. The British Air Force's European Typhoon Fighter squadron was stationed and deployed. These planes have intercepted Russian fighter planes several times since last April. Georgia on the eastern coast of the Black Sea is also concerned about Russia's ambitions. It is not a NATO member
The "New Berlin Wall" is once again entangled in the Ukrainian scandal.
Boroshenko is eager to win the support of President Trump, who is increasingly worried that his political opponents will block his re-election, which clears the way for Juliani, who can press the Ukrainian Attorney General, Yuri Lutchenko, who was later dismissed, to investigate Joe Biden and his son and help Trump for a second term.
But it is unclear how Poroshenko expects the Trump government to help him turn the tide before the two rounds of Ukrainian presidential elections in March and April of this year. In any case, he has been hit hard and has been badly defeated by Zelenski, whose officials soon became the new target of the Trump team to start fighting Biden.
Although the Democrats wanted President Trump to be impeached for dealing with Ukraine, the president and his allies have responded with a home-made Ukrainian scandal. They reiterated a well-known claim that Ukraine had collaborated with Clinton's campaign team to reduce Trump's campaign opportunities in 2016 and claimed that, with little evidence, Biden had used his vice president position to prevent Ukraine from investigating his son.
For many years, the Ukrainian people have been tired of watching their leaders make constant use of power and privilege in exchange for personal economic or political interests; today, most Ukrainians do not care about the worst scandal against the White House Trump Government since it was possible that President Richard Nixon was overthrown by the Watergate incident in 1974.
Ukraine, which used to be the center stage of Washington with little American interest, has caused great confusion in Ukraine. This feeling is mixed with pride. After centuries in the shadow of Russia, a strong neighbour in the north, Ukraine is no longer regarded as dead, but is an incredible point of turn for the most powerful country in the world.
This week, Pavlo Kremkin, the Ukrainian Foreign Minister of Poroshenko, sent a mean message on Twitter saying that "the country that led to the impeachment of the President of the United States" was in the history book "The future is not wonderful." But he added, "Now, everyone knows what we can do."
Pakistan's Red Red Kandel Baloch's brother was sentenced to life imprisonment for honour killings.
Kándr Baloch, famous for his social media photos, was strangled in July 2016.
Pakistan's social media star Karndell Baloch's brother was found guilty of murder last Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment, the country's most visible case of “honour killings”.
Baloch became famous for her funny self-promotion, and according to Western standards, it was considered provocative in Pakistan, where she was strangled in July 2016, where she hated feminism.
Her brother Muhammad Wasim was arrested. A few days later, at a press conference, he said that he had no regrets for what he had done, and he admitted that "of course" he had murdered his sister, whose actions were "unforgivable".
His lawyer, Sadar Mehmud, told AFP that the court in the eastern city of Murtan had found his client guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment, a highly visible sentence.
He said, "If circumstances permit, he will be acquitted by the High Court."
Earlier, Baloch's mother Anwar May told AFP that she had hoped for her son's acquittal.
"He's innocent. My daughter was killed and my son was murdered," she said.
Baloch's murder became an international headline and called once again for action to combat the spread of so-called “honour killings”, in which a victim — usually a woman — was murdered for flouting patriarchal social norms.
Women have been burned, shot, stabbed and strangled for their free choice of their husbands or — in the case of Baloch — for crimes such as glorification of their sex as a “stigma” to their families.
This type of murder is usually committed by close relatives. Under Pakistan's blood debt and revenge laws, they can seek forgiveness from the relatives of the victims.
Three months after the murder of Baloch, Parliament passed new legislation providing for life imprisonment for honour killings.
However, whether or not murder is defined as a crime of honour is left to the discretion of the judge, which means that in theory a murderer can claim different motives, but can still obtain a pardon.
In the Baloch case, her parents initially insisted that they would not pardon their son.
But it was sad to think of losing his son, and they changed their mind and said they wanted him to be forgiven.
The reaction of the international community to the murder led the Pakistani Government to take unprecedented steps to declare the Government the heir of the victim along with his parents, but this forced the case to proceed.
Some well-known behaviour in Baloch included a strip dance for the Pakistani cricket team and a falling red dress on Valentine's Day.
Her actions have attracted some criticism and threats, but many people, including young people, believe that this Kim Kardashian figure can be seen as a bold political act that empowers women and creates a new situation for the country.
“honour” killings are rooted in tribal social norms, which are still prevalent throughout South Asia and specifically regulate female behaviour, although men may also be victims.
Three Scottish students were evaluated as the best students in Europe.
Three students from Dundee University in England were evaluated as the best graduates in the European region.
In 2019, three students from Dundee University were selected as the best graduates in Europe in their respective fields, while five other students from the University were also recognized by the judges.
Scott Sheldrick graduated from molecular genetics and won the best European graduate award in life sciences; Chester Conford studied a Master of Science in Mental Health Care and won an award for nursing, midwifery and specialized health care; and Lola Niebbs won an award for visual arts.
Despite the fact that all three students were in the final round of the global round, they were defeated in the final heated battle, with 3,500 students from all over the world in the final round.
Professor Blair Grabb, Vice-Rector of Education at Dundee University, said: "To reach this stage, our students and graduates face competition with the world ' s top university students.
“The thousands of students around the world are stimulating competition for undergraduate prizes, and the students of Dundee University are well represented among the winners, which also reflects the quality of our students and the level of education they receive here.
"Glory congratulations to Scott, Chester and Lola for their remarkable achievements, as well as to other Dundee student delegates who received high praises."
Five other Dundee University students were also recognized in the world ' s top undergraduate award, which recognized their top academic performance and shared the results with global audiences.
The five students who received recognition were Nicholas Gallagher and James Osborne (all students in the life sciences), Ferentz Kojishikawa (medical specialization), Caitlin Scott (anatomy science) and Wako Yokota (philosophy).
The selection further praised the academic performance of the best undergraduate students in school and helped students and their fellow graduates from around the world to build bridges of collaboration.
The oldest cluster of prototyping galaxies, "The Queen's Palace."
An international team of astronomers, using Sparu, Cake and Gemini Telescopes, discovered 12 galaxies that existed some 13 billion years ago. This is the oldest group of stars found so far. The largest of these systems is the humous call found 10 years ago through the Sbaru Telescope, which was named after the queen of ancient Japanese mythology. This discovery shows that large galaxies like the group of primary galaxies existed only 800 million years ago in the formation of the universe, representing only 6 per cent of the current age.
In the current universe, clusters of galaxies can contain hundreds of galaxies, but how these clusters are formed remains a major question in the astronomical field. To understand the formation of clusters of galaxies, astronomers look for possible origins in ancient universes. They are dense systems of dozens of galaxies in the early universe, and gradually form a cluster of galaxies.
The team of astronomers was led by Yuu of Japan's National Astronomy Observatory researcher at the Japan Academic Renewal Society, who explained that "The original clusters of galaxies are a rare and particularly dense galaxy system that is very difficult to detect. To solve this problem, we used the wide view field of the Sbaru Telescope to map large areas of the sky and search for original clusters of stars."
On the map of the universe drawn by the Sbalux telescope, the team found a suspected interstellar galaxy, z66OD, with 15 times the density of the normal galaxy of that age. The team then made follow-up spectral observations using the Ceck Observatory and the North Twin Telescope, confirming that these 12 galaxies were stored 13 billion years ago and were the oldest group of ancient galaxies known to date.
Interestingly, one of the 12 galaxies of z66OD found in 2009 through the Sbaru telescope contained a large number of gases. The team members of the Puke Discoverer Japan National Astronomical Observatory and Tokyo University said, "It is possible to discover the group near large mass objects like Pyomai. However, we are surprised that the puking is not at the heart of the original galaxy, but at the edge of 500 million light-years from the center." Ironically, the Queen Pukmai is also said to have lived in isolation from the rest of the world. The
Nancy Pelosi's daughter Christine Pelosi is the star of the new book.
A new book about Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, is about to be released and is written by Christine Pelosi, who knows her daughter well.
On Thursday, Tianma Books announced that Nancy Palosi Road will be released on November 26. Christine Palosi's work will tell how the mother of five children became the first female head of the House of Representatives and how she currently leads the Democrats in the House of Representatives under the Trump administration. According to Tianma, Christine Palosi's new book will interwoven her mother's "professional and personal experience".
Christine Palosi is currently a Democratic Strategic Analyst, and has the title "Election Training Camp" and "Preparatory Training Camp 2.0." Palosi’s sister, Alexandra Pelosi, is a film maker and journalist and has made numerous documentary films about contemporary politics.
Warren bought lemonade and donated it to an anti-abortion charity.
When Senator Elizabeth Warren bought drinks from two girls running the lemonade soda stand in August, she probably didn't realize that the $10 she bought would be donated to an anti-abortion charity.
"Our daughters thought it was friendly," a Trump supporter, Dan Michel, the father of one of the girls, said to the Washington Lighthouse, "She came to tell us that we should vote for her. Our daughter told us she was a good person, but we didn't agree with her politically because she claimed that a woman had the right to choose abortion, and we said we should donate her money to an anti-abortion program."
On August 8, Warren stopped in front of a lemonade stand on a campaign bus trip in Iowa with two 11-year-old children: Sienna Micheles and Audrey Billings.
"Come to Harlan, Iowa, and have a drink for a little while in front of a lemonade stand. When life gives you lemon, a major structural change is required!" Warren posted on Twitter.
The two children were pleased to see a presidential candidate. After the photos were released, the Michelles girl urged her parents to vote for the Massachusetts senator in 2020. However, the parents explained Warren's position on abortion. The girls and their parents decided to contribute to the Life Education and Defence Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports anti-abortion legislation.
Michelles said, "My daughter told us she wanted us to vote for her." "We talked about abortion and said maybe we should donate money to the anti-abortion business, and my daughter totally agrees with it."
Why should we recategorize herpes and card viruses: the impact of biotechnology?
Recent research suggests that the way people perceive the structure of the virus needs to be reoriented, because the structure of the virus is actually more diverse than what was previously known. These findings may have a significant impact on their classification, on our understanding of how they form, evolve and infect their host, and on how they design vaccines to respond to them.
In the 1950s and 1960s, scientists began to acquire high-resolution images of the virus, discovering the detailed structure of the virus's coat; the coat is an outer layer of protection made up of multiple copies of the same protein and used to protect the virus's genetic material. Most of the virus's coats are typical paraplegics, displaying a tian symmetrical structure, like a 20-face dice.
The shell is the protective layer of the virus, and when scientists discover the structure of the shell, they suggest that the shell has different sizes and carries different numbers of genomes, so the virus can infect the host in different ways.
Why is that important?
In designing virus-specific drugs, scientists can now consider their different structural shapes to improve their efficacy.
Two researchers at the Research Institute for Information on Viruses, Anthony Luke, the theoretical biophysicist at Santiago State University, and Reton Divaloc, the mathematical biologist at York University in England, concluded that many viruses had been largely misclassified over 60 years, including common viruses such as herpes virus alone and card viruses.
Although we have acquired the structure images of cryogenic electron microscopes, researchers have not mathematically described different viral structures.
Luke said, "We found six new forms of protein composition for the twenties. So many viruses don't just use two well-known structures for the twenties. There are now at least eight ways to design their twenties."
Researchers use the generalization of the quasi-equivalency principle to observe how protein wraps 20-faced body shells.
Their research results, which will be published in the Natural Newsletter magazine on Friday, September 27, also show that viruses belonging to the same structural spectrum systems will use a consistent 20-face crust layout based on their composition, which provides a new method for studying the evolution of the virus.
Biotechnology applications
Structural biologists can now use this information to recategorize the structure of the virus, which will help reveal the molecular and evolutionary relationships between the different viruses.
It will also guide the design of new molecular packagings for nanotechnologies and biotechnology applications, and will help scientists to identify specific strategies for protein assembly in garments. This can provide a more systematic approach to developing antiviral vaccines.
Luke said, "We can use this discovery to target the formation and stability of the shell so as to prevent the virus from being infected with the host cell from forming the virus or disassembly it after it is formed. This may help to identify and identify the antiviral target of the virus sharing the same XX layout."
This new framework accommodates previously isolated viruses, provides new predictions of the structure of the shell of the virus and determines common geometric patterns in the long evolution of the virus from human to bacterial infection of all organisms.
Devaloc mentioned that the new blueprint also provides "a new perspective on the evolution of the virus, showing new ways for larger and more complex viruses to evolve from simple viruses at the time scale of evolution".
Building applications
Geometric graphics can also be used for new architectural design and construction.
Inspired by the geodesic-line dome designed by famous architect Buckminster Fuller, structural biologists Donald Kaspar and Biophysicist Allon Krueger have introduced geometry frameworks, classifying viruses according to the geometry framework of the virus's garments since the 1960s. However, as molecular imaging technology progresses, a growing number of three-dimensional redevelopments of the virus's casings, including herpes and card viruses, have been removed from the geometry framework of the classics.
Luke explained that "This study will present a more general framework than the classic Caspar-Kruger structure. It is based on the persistence of local peaks formed by the interaction of proteins inside the shell. This method found six new t-shirt layouts, while restoring two classic layouts from Caspar-Kruger based on high hysteria and geometry."
The pastor for sexually assaulting a boy in Wisconsin was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
A former pastor accused of sexually assaulting a boy in Wisconsin decades ago was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
According to the Waso Daily Herald, 72-year-old Thomas Eriksson was sentenced to a maximum prison term on Thursday and faced two charges of sexual assault on boys, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when he was a pastor at St. Peter's Catholic Church. He had to be registered as a sex offender for life.
Four men testified on Thursday and complained about the impact of sexual abuse on their lives. One of the victims was publicly present for the first time.
Ericsson apologized to the victim in court, saying that he was beginning to realize the impact of his actions on the victim. At least 11 men claimed that they had been violated during Ericsson ' s role as pastor.
Ericsson was removed from his religious post in 1988.
That too much sauce could damage the liver.
Cinnamon is made from the inside of the cinnamon tree. It is a popular spice, a taste agent for all kinds of food, and it has even become a unique smell.
Such spices have some impressive health benefits, such as reducing the risk of life-threatening diseases (such as heart disease, cancer and even diabetes), and it is therefore inevitable that they will be welcomed.
But don't rush to the conclusion that too much is too much and too much is harmful to the body. In this case, if there is too much cinnamon in the body, there will be some side effects. We should make sure it's safe.
It may increase the risk of cancer -- although cinnamon can help to reduce the risk of cancer, unfortunately it can also cause cancer. According to animal research, the common cinnamon of cinnamon can increase the risk of cancer if it is consumed too much. Scientists say that cinnamon can destroy our DNA in the long run and cause cancer.
May harm the liver - according to the study, over-ingestion of academe is also likely to cause liver toxicity and damage. This is based on several studies on the effects on humans of over-ingestion of acupuncture.
There may be oral ulcers - over-ingestion of cinnamon not only causes fatal conditions, but also oral ulcers. It is assumed that this is because cinnamon contains cinnamon, which is a compound that causes allergies to the human body after extensive intake. But only those who are allergic to cinnamon ulcer may have oral ulcers.
It may cause breathing problems - more so as a general precaution, because cinnamon is delicate and easily inhaled, may cause coughs and vomiting, and cinnamon formaldehyde can stimulate the throat.
It could lead to low blood sugar -- for many people, cinnamon is good for the body because it reduces blood sugar significantly. That's very good, especially for those with high blood sugar. But over-ingestion can cause blood sugar to drop too low in the body, causing a new set of health risks.
Tennessee's abortion waiting trial is pending before the judge.
During the 48-hour waiting period for abortion in Tennessee, a federal judge had to decide which expert to follow.
During the four-day trial that ended on Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee tried to prove that the law requiring women to travel to clinics at least 48 hours apart would give them time to reflect on abortion decisions, which would be beneficial to them. The lawyers representing five abortion clinics (the state ' s seven abortion clinics in total) argued that the law did not bring any benefit and would impose a huge burden.
Both experts agree that some women seeking an abortion actually have no idea, and some women who have had an abortion later regret their decision. But the experts disagree that this part of the population is smaller than the number of women seeking an abortion, and that the 48-hour waiting period does not have any effect on these women.
On Thursday, the state attorney presented the Utah study on the role of the 72-hour waiting period. The study found that 8% of the women who went to the clinic for their first consultation said they no longer wanted to seek an abortion.
Antonia Biggs, a sociopsychologist at UCLA San Francisco, was asked about the research and agreed that some women would change their minds about abortion or that they might not have taken the idea in the first place. She pointed out, however, that the study did not prove that the mandatory waiting period in Utah changed a woman's mind or found it in other ways beneficial to women.
Biggs also confirmed that, to date, there is no evidence that abortion causes mental health problems in women. She said that a national study compares successful abortions before the deadline for abortion with those outside the clinic after the deadline, finding that there is no difference between the rates of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.
During the cross-examination, Biggs pointed out that the study did not track the mental health results of women who changed their minds after the waiting period, although only three of them were found in the study. She contradicted the testimony earlier this week of Priscila Coleman, a professor of psychology at Boling Green State University, Ohio, who said that abortion was related to mental health issues.
Coleman testified that she believed that most scientific literature related to abortion had a political propensity to support abortion.
On Thursday, another obstetrician from Memphis testified for the state, and he joined a highly controversial network organization that tried to block abortion. According to the British doctor, through this work he was "physically exposed to women who changed their abortion ideas".
Tennessee's waiting period law came into effect in mid-2015, and Pedrasar said that since then he had witnessed many women who had taken abortion pills and tried to block them. There were also women who had changed their minds again and eventually completed the abortion, and he testified that, even if there was waiting time, that change would occur.
The head of the clinic has previously confirmed that waiting periods cause women financial hardship and stress. The chief added that the requirement for two visits poses coordination challenges for both patients and clinics, resulting in abortion being postponed far beyond the 48 hours required by law, thus forcing some women to seek a surgical abortion, which poses a greater risk of complications. A few women were forced to wait longer than they could have had an abortion.
According to the Guttmacher Institute, research organization supporting the right to abortion, 14 states across the United States have enacted laws requiring women seeking abortion to travel to abortion clinics in two separate stages, of which Tennessee is one.
In deciding whether or not the waiting period in Tennessee violates the United States Constitution, District Judge Bernard Friedman has to determine whether it places an excessive burden on women seeking abortion. Some subjective criteria have led to the repeal of some waiting period laws, while others continue to retain them, depending on the reality in the states.
On Thursday, after the parties had submitted the evidence in their possession, Friedman said that he would rule as soon as possible.
There's a lot of problems. The fire at the French chemical plant was extinguished.
The stench continued to spread to large areas, and the French authorities and Normandy residents were cleaning up the remains of the chemical plant fire.
A lubricating oil factory in Rouen had a fire on Thursday and no one had been injured, but residents on both sides of the nearby Seine had expressed concern about the potential health risks and consequences.
The head of the local administration said on Friday that after nearly 24 hours of effort, the fire was extinguished on Thursday night. Firefighters were still on the scene.
The French authorities warned that when the fire was extinguished, a special smell would be released, which could spread to the surrounding areas.
The French Minister of the Interior, Christopher Castane, said that people with health problems should stay at home until Friday night.
The cause of the fire is being investigated. The plant is listed as one of the highest-risk industrial sites in Europe.
Liquefied natural gas investment record in 2019 and China's highest growth rate
Since the beginning of the year, liquid natural gas investments have reached $50 billion, the highest level ever, and Fatih Birrol, Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), said at a industry conference.
"This year, investment in 2019 broke its record for the first time (final investment decision-making) of $50 billion." Bill said at the Liquefied Natural Gas Producer - Consumer Conference in Tokyo, Reuters quoted Biroll's comments.
As expected, investment growth is driven by rising energy demand in Asia; China is expected to surpass Japan and become the world ' s largest importer of liquefied natural gas.
"The biggest increase comes from China. In the next five years, one third of the global demand for liquefied natural gas will come from China alone." Bill said. He added that in five years China will be the largest importer of the fuel.
And it's not surprising that the volume of investment has increased. Of that, the United States and Canada have completed most of their investments.
In a report released in December 2018, the United States Energy Information Agency stated that the ability of the United States to export liquefied natural gas is expected to double by the end of this year, reaching 8.9 billion cubic feet per day. This would also make the United States the third largest exporter of liquefied natural gas in the world after Qatar and Australia. The volume of United States liquefied natural gas exports is expected to increase from 3 billion cubic feet in early 2019 to 17 billion cubic feet per day by 2030.
Canada currently has only one liquefied natural gas project under construction - Canadian liquefied natural gas - but its final annual production capacity may reach 28 million tons. The project cost $31 billion, led by Shell, and a small number of equity participants include the Malaysian National Petroleum Company, China Oil, Mitsubishi and Korea Gas Corporation.
At the same time, Qatar is stepping up its efforts to maintain its first position in the global liquefied gas export competition. Now that Qatar and Iran share the largest marine gas field in the world - the northern gas field - Qatar has lifted its mining ban on new wells in the gas field, with the goal of increasing its annual export capacity by 43%, reaching 11 million tons annually.
The global demand for liquefied natural gas is expected to reach 550 million tons by 2030, according to well-known global commercial information service providers.
Viola Davis recorded "Jimmy Campor Live Show", which reveals the true course of thinking about playing Michelle Obama.
Viola Davis feels a little pressured to play Michelle Obama.
The actor said in "Jimmy Kammore Live" Thursday, "I'm scared."
Last month, it was announced that Davis would be playing the former First Lady in the selection series First Lady of the Entertainment Time television series. Davis said the script was great, but she was keenly aware that it would not be easy to perform well.
She said to the host, Cammore, "I don't care what I've accomplished in my life. I've had one Aimee, one Oscar, two Tonys, but if I screw up this time, it'll be a decisive moment in my life."
Davis said she was waiting for her PR to call and said, "Don't hang up, I'm Michelle Obama -- scolding you."
Davis also considered the audience in the sixth season of Impunity (final season).
She said, "Listen, I don't want those who look at me to go crazy."
The judge cares about the drinking options of juvenile violence night.
The judge sentenced a juvenile for violence against an enemy, while expressing concern that the juvenile had chosen to drink before the violence.
A 19-year-old man, Kieran Clifton, beat a 17-year-old teenager who he believed was responsible for causing him to break up with his ex-girlfriend.
The Oxford Royal Court was informed that Clifton had been drinking call wine at the fat fox bar in Waterlington, Oxford County, shortly before the violent events of March last year.
Judge Nigel Daley told Clifton, who confessed to the actual bodily harm caused by ABH, that alcohol played an important role in the violence that night.
But he talked about Clifton's choice of drinking: "Do you drink Coca-Cola and Italian almonds? I'm surprised you're not sick!"
Clifton from Chargrove was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, 12 months probation, 15 days of rehabilitation and 160 hours of "unpaid work" and £750 in compensation.

A pink blanket is full of spirits: Jane Austen's classic novel, a strange young man's love play, fantasy novel Six Crows. Jordan Hickey's version was made by her grandmother and appeared in most of her photos on the tourist page of her photo wall account, matching books and giving people an attractive sense of comfort. Now, do you want to get into her photo life, roll this blanket, have a cup of coffee, put everything down, read the new novel Keeping Frank in Love?
Shiki is a user of the Books, and the label on the wall of the photo has a variety of styles and attractions, records love for books, and makes many fans happy. The book tag has been forwarded by more than 35 million photo wall posts, while the popular book host has more than 100,000 followers (in contrast, the New York Times bookboard has about 6.9 million followers.) A large number of users have joined the message, and a large number of posts have emerged, suggesting that the book host adopt best practices to manage the photo wall's "disguised algorithms" and use the most
According to the President of Colombia, the head of the country's Los Perlosos criminal group was killed.
The Supreme Leader and Founder of the Los Pellosos criminal group was killed in an operation led by the Colombian National Police, announced by President Ivan Duke on Friday.
The gang was one of the most well-known criminal organizations in this Andean country, participating in a battle that had threatened the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in the eastern part of the country bordering Venezuela.
Luis Antonio Quintro, alias Parkra, was a left-wing opposition leader with more than 440 gang members who were introduced by the government.
Parkla, 49 years old, wanted by the police for terrorism and murder, was located in North Santander province on Thursday.
"Our goal is clear: to destroy this organization completely," Duke said in a statement in the United States that he went to the United States this week to participate in the United Nations General Assembly.
Quintro was responsible for organizing the killing of several human rights activists and community leaders, a statement added.
Duke has been criticized by some in the international community for not taking more action to stop killings throughout the country with impunity.
The leader of another Los Pelosos was also arrested during the operation, adding that the details of the death of Quintro were not mentioned.
"How dare you?" Toonberry's speech at the United Nations inspired Dutch climate change protesters.
On Friday, tens of thousands of young Dutch people took a strike to participate in the global climate change protest, blocked local traffic, and asked their leaders, "How dare you?" They quoted Greta Tomberi, a Swedish radical environmentalist girl, in her speech at the United Nations.
On September 27th, 2019, in The Hague, the Netherlands, a protester, carrying a picture of the Swedish radical environmentalist Greta Tomberi, called on the government to take action to address climate change.
The number of people who took part in the march in The Hague exceeded expectations, and organizers estimated the number of protesters to be around 35,000. The police were forced to change the course of the march and directed the protest team to a location where more people could be accommodated.
Tumbery, 16 years old, gave a passionate speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York this week. Millions of people from around the world went on a strike on Friday to join the climate change protest and contribute to the United Nations Climate Action Summit.
"When people continue to join the protests, the strike protests will have a great impact, not only on today, but also on the future, and we can see the participation of people from all walks of life," the protester Rendel Rustema said.
Protesters marched through the center of the city, waving flags, holding pictures of Ton Berry, with slogans saying, "For Greta-like beauty," "Don't look like stupid antiques," and "You die because you're old, we die because of climate change."
"I understand their concerns and believe that people have heard their calls," the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Lute told reporters at his weekly press conference that the protesters were marching not far away from him. "We have put forward a number of expensive plans to deal with these problems. But the method of implementation needs to be flexible so that it can create jobs."
At the beginning of the Climate Action Summit, Tungberi’s short message shocked the entire scene by mobilizing governments and businesses to break the paralysis in the international community’s actions on carbon emissions, which reached record highs last year despite scientists’ constant warnings of climate change impacts for decades.
"This is all wrong. I'm not supposed to sit here. I'm supposed to go to school across the ocean, and you're looking to our young people for hope. How dare you do that?" She said that with passion and a voice shaking.
The Netherlands has 17 million inhabitants, with less than 7 per cent of its total energy generation using renewable energy sources in 2017, while Germany has 15 per cent and Sweden more than 50 per cent.
The Dutch government committed to reducing CO2 emissions by half by 2030, but by 2017 it achieved only 13% reduction.
On Friday, Tomberi also participated in the climate protest in Grana, when the ICAO leadership was meeting in Montreal to discuss emission reduction targets in the air transport industry.
Suicide surges, and the situation facing the military is not promising.
The continuation of this situation this year, when the suicide rate among active military personnel jumped to an all-time high, was fatal, and the Pentagon officials said that the situation was frustrating and was being actively addressed.
The data released by the Pentagon on Thursday show that both the suicide rate and the total number of suicides in the Army, Navy and Marine Corps are on the rise, while only the suicide rate in the Air Force is on the decline. The number of suicides among members of the Reserve and the National Guard is also on the increase.
Earlier this month, the Navy reported that three crew members serving on the George H. W. Bush carrier had ended their lives in one week. This highlighted the difficulties in identifying potential problem service personnel and finding ways to prevent suicide.
When asked about the suicide of the crew of the aircraft carrier, Defence Minister Mark Espelle said, "I hope I can tell you that we have found the answer to prevent future suicides in the armed forces. But we haven't found the answer. We are caught up in what some call the national youth suicide wave."
The number of suicides committed by the entire United States army increased from 511 in 2017 to 541 in 2018. According to the Pentagon, the highest risk factor was among young recruits, who chose guns as a way of committing suicide in at least 60% of cases. The number of suicides committed by the Army increased from 114 to 139, the number of suicides committed by the Marines increased from 43 to 58, and the number of suicides committed by the Navy increased from 65 to 68. The Air Force dropped from 63 to 60.
"Our numbers are not moving in the right direction," said Elizabeth Van Vinck, Director of the Pentagon's Army Resilient Office. She said that most military personnel were treated in a way that was no different from the civilian population and added: "It's hard to be happy."
The military and defence leaders expressed their disappointment and resolved to take more measures to improve the resilience of the army, train military personnel to respond more effectively to pressures, and encourage troops to seek help when they need help. Van Venk said that the military was also considering enhancing training in the safe storage of guns and drugs in the army. She said that there were no uniform rules or regulations between departments requiring that guns be locked or other controls taken, but some states or bases had their own limitations.
She and Karen Oves, Chief of the Suicide Prevention Office, said that it was difficult to determine those serving in the service who might be in pain or have suicidal ideas, and sometimes suicide was a sudden and impulsive decision with little warning. They said it was difficult to find the reasons for suicide, because there were too many stress factors that caused suicide.
They also admitted that service personnel were reluctant to actively seek help because they feared that it would affect promotions or security checks. Military leaders said that they all had to work harder to solve problems that were seen as impeding development.
General David Berger, Commander of the Marine Corps, said, "In addition to physical health, gun training, training and education, the Marines must also be free to discuss life difficulties, mental health and suicide. We must build a community where we can make important decisions seeking help and help become marines and marines."
For the first time this year, statistics on the suicide of a general's spouse and family in the Pentagon were taken into account. Van Vink said that the latest figures were in 2017, but officials were trying to improve their ability to collect family-related data.
According to the data, 186 families were reported to have committed suicide, of which 123 were spouses and 63 were family members between 12 and 23 years of age.
The vast majority (approx. 70%) are female spouses under 40 years of age, while 70% of the families who died of suicide are male. About half of the families who committed suicide have reached the age of 18 years, and most of the younger people who committed suicide are young people between 15 and 17 years of age.
Seth Meyers lost a smile in Donald Trump's "Tango and Cash" impression.
On Thursday, Seth Meyers, the host of the "Deep Night Show" brought a moment of relief to the week that had been so depressed by the mass shooting, and he made up a little bit of Donald Trump, but he couldn't help laughing during the interpolation.
The comedian mentioned Trump's visit to a hospital in El Paso, Texas, where the victims of the large-scale shooting over the weekend were treated, while his campaign still owed the city more than $500,000 for a political rally in February.
The activity also resulted in a one-time late payment due to delays in payment.
Meyers said, "This is Mr. President's usual tone. I'm surprised that his office desk was not flooded by the unreturned 100-vision DVD."
Then he started mimicking Trump in the 1989 popular movie Tango and Cash, but he was quick to endure it.
When the bullet was found in the skull of a woman, the man went to jail.
A man in Georgia, United States, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for shooting his girlfriend because his girlfriend realized that she left a bullet in her head and survived when she went to the hospital to receive treatment for headaches.
According to press reports, the 39-year-old Jerantai Kane was sentenced on Thursday for the felony of possession of a gun while attacking 42-year-old Nicole Gordon in 2017.
Gordon, suffering from severe headaches and memory loss, was examined last year by a doctor who found a bullet in her skull.
Gordon told the police she didn't remember being shot, but she did remember the fight with Kane, when her window broke and she fainted. She thought she was hurt by broken glass, and she was wrapped up at Kane's mother's house.
The male model is playing a big show at T's in Paris Fashion Week.
As Miss Gargae sang in her 2008 popular song Roman Death: "Go, go, fashion baby."
An editor said that a male model had kept these words in mind, that his T-table walk shows had overshadowed other models, and that on Wednesday's Paris Fashion Week, he was the closing model for the John Galliano Margira Spring 2020 series.
The male model, Leon Dam, 20 years old this year, conquered the audience with a unique T-T-T-cat step. He stomped and stomped, with his feet in order to keep up with his sex, while maintaining a strong face in his eyes.
He wears a shirt with a belt, white shorts, and long knee boots, and wears a student hat, making a hot debate online. In a catwalking video, when he passes by the editor-in-chief of Fashion, Anna Wintour, the latter seems to smile on his face.
Many praised the young German model, who was famous for his unique fashion sense by participating in the screenings of Jill Sander, Fay and Korean hard-to-man brands.
Lisa Lina, an actor and star of Beverly Housewife, described Leon as her "sultful object", while Rehana, a fashion designer and singer, followed him on the photo wall application.
Following the release of the Men's León show, a fan wrote on Leon's page: "This video and the exit were really out of the blue." Another fan also said, "Big Aron," while a make-up artist and Big Humpty McGrall provided makeup for his performance, and was also a make-up artist for the performance, leaving him with a flash and flame sign.
Perhaps the highest praise comes from Tim Branks, the special editor of fashion business reviews on the Fashion website.
"When you left, you were an unknown young man, but came back as a hot star!" On Wednesday, Branks wrote in the title of the photo wall application, quoting the classic line in the film 42nd Street.
And he added, "@leondame let the cat walk out of color @maisonmargiela, I think, they're telling the truth. No one's "good like Dum!"
There will be a geomagnetic storm in the second half of the month.
According to the Space Weather Forecast Centre of the National Atmospheric and Marine Research Institute of the United States, geomagnetic disturbances are expected to occur between September 27 and September 29. High-speed solar wind could cause medium geomagnetic storms (G2)
The Russian Solar Activity Research Laboratory at the Lebedev Institute predicts that disturbance will start on the night of September 27, and reach its strongest level between the next morning and noon. The planetary index can jump to the level of 5 Kp.
Geomagnetic storms affect people with cardiovascular system problems. Doctors warn that some people may experience heart strangulation, dizziness, headaches, and lack of concentration. Magnetic disturbances usually also affect people with mental disorders.
If there is more disturbance, the grid will fluctuate. Satellite signals that provide navigational information will also be weak.
The most beautiful sight of this phenomenon is the spectacular aurora in the sky above the poles.
Sony and Disney are working together again to launch the third film Spider-Man.
Disney and Sony are now on their way, and Spider-Man is on his way back.
The two companies announced on Friday that they would cooperate in the production of the third film Spider-Man, starring Tom Holland.
According to press releases issued by both sides, the unnamed film will be released on July 16, 2021, by Kevin Figg, the Mandarin Film Industry under the Disney flag and its president.
According to the press release, Amy Pascal will also produce films through the Pascal film industry, just as she did in the first two films she directed in Holland.
Fig said in the press release, "I'm very pleased that Spider-Man's tour will continue in the Wandering Film universe, and I'm very excited that it will continue. Spider-Man is a powerful idol and hero whose story spreads all over the world and is very popular among viewers of all ages."
The agreement also allows Spider-Man to appear in a movie about the future of the Mandarin Film industry.
Fergull admits that this collaboration makes the ability to fly across walls unique among superheroes.
He said, "The Spider-Man happens to be the only hero with the power to cross the movie universe, so as Sony continues to develop his own Spider-Man universe, we never know what surprise the future will bring.
More than a month after the end of Spider-Man's impasse, it was reported that the two companies were unable to agree on the continuation of the previous film Heroes Return and Hero Expedition.
The problem, according to the report, is that Disney, who has this role, wants to co-finance shares with Sony in future films, and that agreement was reached before Disney, who started with Mickey Mouse in 2009, acquired Bangwei, who owns film copyright.
Hollywood reporters have pointed out that there is good reason for both sides to work together. The Heroic Expedition is the highest ever film in Sony's ticket house, while Mandarin can maximize commodities and maintain creative control.
Also happy with the end of the impasse was Holland himself, who expressed his joy on the photo wall application.
European Union and British negotiator working in Belgium to reach a de-European agreement
The EU Chief Negotiator for De-European Affairs began negotiations with British officials in Belgium on Friday, seeking to reach a de-European agreement; there is about a month before the deadline for reaching the agreement.
Michelle Barnier met with British Minister Stephen Barclay in Brussels, who insisted that any agreement would exclude Ireland's “border protection measures”. Such “border protection measures” actually ensured the soft border between post-United Kingdom Ireland and Northern Ireland, which has become a major obstacle to negotiations.
Buckley said that while Britain was committed to reaching an agreement, he said that there was not much time left.
"I think there is still a long way to go, and I think it's now at the critical juncture of the negotiations," said Buckley.
The deadline for Teo is October 31, but a new law in Britain prohibits British Prime Minister Boris Johnson from completing it without a trade agreement, and does not allow the British Parliament to approve it before October 19 without a trade agreement.
Last week, EU negotiators expressed their willingness to accept an alternative to border protection measures, but the representative of Ireland, Simon Corvini, said last Friday that London had yet to submit a “serious” proposal.
He said, "Unless there is a serious proposal as a basis for negotiations, the current great differences will continue to exist."
The negotiator also said that "the time is running out", and that "the British Prime Minister and his team have a responsibility" to come up with a serious proposal.
On Friday, Johnson's office said that reaching an agreement was still a challenge.
From the Irish point of view, we certainly think it's better to postpone DeOu than never agreed, and Corvini says, "But I think there's a good reason behind asking for the delay."
The EU presidency, Jean-Claude Junker, said that he and Baniye were making every effort to reach an agreement, and if that was not possible, it was in the United Kingdom.
Irish Prime Minister Valladka said he was pessimistic about whether or not the Trans-European agreement could be reached, but he would urge the British leadership to come up with a plan at the October 17 British de-Europe summit.
"The Deo-European agreement is actually an international treaty," Valladka said, "It's not a thing that can be secretly modified or massed late in the night."
Scientist's Confusion: Large planets orbit around tiny stars
Scientists were surprised to discover that in a type of solar system galaxy 30 light-years away from Earth, a giant woody planet orbits around a tiny red dwarf, which completely destabilizes the existing theory of planet formation.
A picture of the gas giant GJ 3512b orbiting the Red Dwarf Star, published on September 26, 2019.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planets orbiting around them. But the size of the star observed is not so different from the size of the planet, as researchers said on Thursday.
The mass of this star, GJ 3512, is about 12% of the Sun, and the mass of the planet around it is almost half that of Jupiter (the largest planet in the solar system).
"Yes, it's amazing." Juan Carlos Morales said he was an astrophysicist at the Institute of Space Sciences in Catalonia, Spain, and his team published the results of the study in Science magazine.
"This discovery is surprising because theoretical models suggest that low-quality stars usually have asteroids like Earth or small Neptune. But this time we found a gas giant planet like Jupiter orbiting around a very low-quality star," Morales adds.
With telescopes from the Cara Alto Observatory in Spain, researchers discovered this type of log planet, made up mainly of gases. It orbits the main star around an elliptical orbit with a cycle of 204 days.
The mass of red dwarfs is small and the surface temperature is low. GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the sun, it is so small that it can even be compared to larger planets, and GJ 3512 is only 35% bigger than Jupiter.
"Red dwarfs release less energy, so the light from radiation is very weak, and their surface temperature is very low, about 3,800 degrees below Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit 3,527 degrees Fahrenheit). This explains why red dwarfs are tiny red, as Morales says.
There is evidence that another planet also orbits around this red dwarf, and that there may be a planet that has been thrown out of this galaxy, which explains that the orbit of this log planet is elliptical, as Morales said.
Planets and their surrounding stars were born on the same planetary disk made up of interplanetary gases and dust. According to the most accepted model of planetary formation, the Core Absorption Model, the stars were originally formed in solid particles in the palaeuse, and the gravitational pull of planetary embryos can gather the gas around them and form the atmosphere.
Another relative model is called Gravity Instability Model, which may explain this unusual galaxy.
"In this case, the original planetary disks around young stars may be a little higher in quality and lower in temperature than expected," Morales pointed out. "This will make the astrolabe unstable, and there will be dense areas that form clusters. These clusters can grow until they collapse and form planets."
Schools around the world strike on the streets demanding climate action.
On Friday, children around the world launched another wave of school strikes calling for action on climate change, the first major action since the issue became the top of the United Nations world leadership agenda this week.
More than a year ago, the "Friday Campaign for the Future" launched by the Swedish teenager Greta Sandberg on his own came to light, and millions of students took to the streets of cities like New York and attracted the attention of developing countries in Africa.
Some of the initial protests started in New Zealand, and according to Sandberg, organizers estimated that there were 170,000 marches across New Zealand. Cities in Italy, Finland, Nigeria, Austria and India also held marches.
Friday's protest followed a week of climate negotiations at the United Nations in New York, including a speech by Sandberg, in which world leaders were severely reprimanded for their inaction.
"You stole my dreams and my childhood with your empty words," she said on Tuesday. "The eyes of future generations stare at you, and if your choice disappoints us, I can say that we will never forgive you."
The demonstrators, citing a report endorsed by the United Nations last year, called on governments to take measures to prevent global temperatures from rising by more than 2.7 degrees, and scientists warned that this would have terrible consequences for human life and the planet.
Sandberg and her inspired young people said that they would not stop the weekly class strike until they saw a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that caused climate change.
In Nigeria's capital, Abuja, Oladosu Adinek went on a Friday strike 46 consecutive times. The activist posted some pictures on Twitter in which students wore blue school uniforms with banners with slogans "Climate change is happening" and "We don't have much time."
According to local reports, in August in Lausanne, Switzerland, hundreds of climate strike organizers gathered to prepare for events this week, and thousands marched in the city.
Thousands more are expected to go to the streets of Helsinki, Finland, where the local media reported that Helsinki schools would allow students to participate.
Samberg stayed in North America after his visit to the United Nations and plans to participate in the climate strike in Montreal, Canada.
Selena Williams was fined $10,000 for sabotage of Wimbledon tennis court.
Tennis legend, the seven Winbledon tennis championship champion, Serena Williams, was fined $10,000 for allegedly damaging the London practice with a bat.
According to Associated Press and CNN, the All-English Club of Wennet hosts issued a ticket to Williams for damage allegedly caused by Williams during an outdoor exercise competition on June 30.
The 37-year-old tennis star gave an interview to a journalist after winning a quarter final on Tuesday's match with Alison Reese, who seemed to laugh at the fine.
When asked about the fine, she said, "To be honest, I didn't really want to ruin the field. I just threw the bat. Then I got fined."
Williams says she doesn't know how this could damage the field.
She said to the reporter, "I mean, I'd appreciate it if you could tell me how I caused the damage. I've always been a man of revenge. Maybe I'm strong. I don't know."
Williams is on the run for the eighth Hotnet title, and she's going to be the twenty-fourth-largest. In the one-and-a-half finals on Thursday, she will confront Czech contestant Barbara Strikova.
Last year, a judge at the U.S. Tennis Open Competition accused Williams of illegally communicating with the coach during the game, and Williams defended it and was fined US$ 17,000 as a result.
In that incident, the judge issued three violations to Williams: the first was that she received unlawful instructions, the second was that she interrupted the bat because of emotional frustration, and the third was that she called the other a "thief" in her confrontation with the judge.
Many Williams fans claimed that the referee's reaction was too harsh for her, especially given the circumstances in which male players were excited throughout the history of sport.
"Do you know how many men do much worse than that?" Williams told the American Open Competition officials who entered the game after she confronted the referee.
Williams wasn't the only one who was fined this year at the Wennet Open Competition, but her fine was the highest.
The Italian player Fánini, after losing Saturday to the American player Tannis Sandgren in the third round, said, "The bomb should be detonated on the tennis court," and was fined $3000.
The Australian contestant Nick Kirgisos was fined two times for violating sports ethics, one of which was fined US$ 3,000 and the other US$ 5,000.
Ho Man's band suspended last night's concert: the Friday and Sunday shows were canceled.
The rock legend's "Hoh Man" is on tour in the United States. Roger Daltray, Texas, was forced to cancel the concert halfway through it. The 75-year-old singer said to the disappointed audience, "I think it's best to do it." The band had already played eight songs, but promised to come back one day. By watching the video, the audience looked back at how the band was developing on the stage.
Dartley announced his exit after playing the 1982 classic song, "Front of Excellence." He's always had voice problems, apparently following the advice of his surgeons.
The British star told the audience that he couldn't finish the show: "If I continue to perform with you, I'll get hurt. I think it's best to take it." Last time I stayed at the hospital for a month, I didn't want to go any more. I'm sorry."
Peter Townson explained the situation to the audience: "It looks like he can't continue, I'm afraid..."
The band left the stage and was going to try to finish the rest without Roger.
And when he came back, Townson said, "I'm really, really sorry. Roger has lost his voice now.
"It's obvious that before the show, he saw a doctor, you know, he sang well in the tour. I don't know what's going on. He's been doing everything he can.
"I'm really sorry you couldn't watch the show tonight... but we need one, and it's Roger's performance and he's in bad shape."
The audience fully supported him, cheering for his 74-year-old, explaining what happened and how the band wanted to return in order to fulfil their commitment to the show.
Townson said, "We'll announce the date of our return as soon as possible. Let me explain... we rehearsed the day and took a day off. That's because Roger's surgeon insisted that he take a day off.
"I swear to you, we'll come back, and we won't let your buys fail. I love you and I'm sorry to disappoint you."
The Friday and Sunday evening concerts to be held in Dallas and Denver were cancelled at the end of the show.
Their next performance will take place in San Francisco on October 9. The band will start their British tour in Manchester on March 16, 2020.
Michael Schumacher's agent issued a statement about his condition.
The official statement on Michael Schumacher ' s health has been published. According to Gong.bg website, the legend has been recovering for almost six years since he was injured in the 2013 Alps skiing accident.
A few weeks ago, the global media reported that the former pilot had been admitted to a hospital in Paris for treatment. Sabin Kom, a permanent broker of Shumah and an old friend of the Shumah family, made a statement.
Com said, "Michael's health is not a public issue, so we're not going to comment on it, just because we need to protect Michael's privacy as much as possible. We know it's hard for some people to understand, but we're doing it in accordance with Michael's wishes and thank you very much for understanding."
She also revealed that Schumacher was a very sensitive person. He didn't want his name to appear in the headlines, even before the incident.
The broker called on everyone not to believe any of the "spills" on social networks and yellow magazines around the world.
Authorities investigated a fatal accident in the Los Angeles National Forest and found the body.
On Thursday afternoon, the police were investigating a fatal accident in the Los Angeles National Forest.
According to the police, a car with a body was found below the Los Angeles Forest Road and Grand Tuhunga Gorge Road.
Preliminary reports from the scene suggest that the car may have been there for some time.
It is not clear how vehicles were found.
Is the nuclear-free world beyond reach?
Seventy-four years ago, two nuclear bombs exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing hundreds of thousands of people.
Since then, the threat of nuclear war will follow as long as there is conflict among the major Powers.
Although various treaties are trying to contain this threat, today there are about 14,000 nuclear weapons in the world.
Thursday is the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, but the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons seems increasingly difficult to achieve.
So, is there political will on the part of all States to abolish nuclear weapons?
Megan "goes with his heart" and insists on not giving up his own pursuit while performing royal duties.
Megan Marker decided to “go with her heart” and insisted on not “leave” her own pursuit while performing royal duties. As a member of the royal family, she wanted to be a model for young girls and boys.
It was reported that 38-year-old Duchess Sussex made the same statement earlier this week during her visit to South Africa with his husband Prince Harry, during a campaign to motivate women entrepreneurs at the Woodstock Exchange in Cape Town.
The Woodstock Exchange, a British-South African technology centre, promotes skills development and market access by helping entrepreneurs, especially women, to acquire skills, resources and support.
At the meeting of the Association of Women Entrepreneurs, the 38-year-old former actress met with a number of women entrepreneurs in the fields of technology, environmental protection and fashion and praised them for their creative thinking "to inspire the next generation".
In a dialogue with women technology creators, Megan strongly advocated the empowerment of young women and girls and expressed the hope that young men would also be empowered.
Nadia Musaji, South African engineer, social entrepreneur, co-founder of engineering women and mother of two children, said: "We recognize the importance of not only educating girls, but also being role models for boys, we are influential women, we should be role models for boys," according to People.
"We both have sons, and we must remember that we are not only role models for girls, but also for boys, not only for our sons, but also for the general public."
She added that we did not feel any hierarchy for Megan's presence because it was "a gathering of women to talk about the difficulties we face and the mission we need to accomplish in order to move forward, grow and change our society".
Mordisa Mordisai, founder of the skills training company Simordisa, said that even though Megan was a member of the royal family, she was determined not to abandon her deep-seated pursuit.
"She spoke of her responsibilities as a mother and Duchess and the fulfilment of her inner desire, not because she was a duchess, but to give up her pursuit," Mordiser recalled.
"You must be faithful to yourself."
She said that the Duchess urged them to continue ploughing their new ideas and to say how they would move forward and make it clear that they did so in order to set an example for others.
Mordis added that she did not mean being a royal member, but when faced with challenges in everyday life, she admitted that she felt a little "feary" about Megan.
"She spreads grace, and she accepts this task in such an elegant gesture," said Mordis.
"As a founder, many of us have made impressive achievements, but meeting with a royal member is a little scary. She's easy. She's a enthusiast."
Megan also revealed that she enjoyed the pressure of being a working mother and admitted that she felt that being a royal member and caring for a child, Archie, was a "heavy" but "very exciting".
Megan said to Laura Rosemarin, CEO of Cape Innovation Technology and the mother of two children, "Now I'm a mother for only five months. As a working mother traveling with a child, my God, how much trouble it has to be, but it's all so exciting.
"Sometimes you're dealing with hard work, but when you meet some people and you can positively influence them, you say, "Aha," it's all worth it."
Megan then went to the city's Mother Heaven Agency, which trains and hires women living with HIV.
She brought some of Archie's baby clothes, including a dress with the "future" on it and a baby with the "invincible" on it that he no longer fits, as well as objects donated by her mother's friends.
A couple of parents were sentenced to six years in prison for loading five-month-old babies in suitcases and throwing them in garbage cans.
The body of a five-and-a-half-month-old baby was thrown into a trash can. On Thursday, his parents did not contest the charge of infant death and were sentenced to six years in prison.
The L.A. County District Attorney announced that 34-year-old Adam Manson and 32-year-old Kanena Williams had not contested a felony charge of child abuse to death and confessed to a special charge claiming that they had caused the death of their son, Jackson Manson.
Both Manson and Williams initially pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The prosecutor said they found their son dead on New Year's Eve while they were using drugs in a motel in southern Los Angeles. The prosecutor added that they put the child's body in a suitcase and then threw it in a garbage can near Boldwin Shan Kronshaw Square.
In late April, after several weeks of searching at the Corona El Sobrant landfill, the authorities cancelled the search. The body of the child was never found.
In a statement at the time, the police said that they decided, with a "heavy heart", to close the search on Jackson, but pointed out that because they were unable to locate exactly at the dump site, "there is no longer any reasonable reason to continue the search."
The supply of unagreementd drugs in England is still unclear.
The British government regulator said that if there is no agreement, the government still needs to complete a "big amount" of work to ensure that there is an adequate supply of medicine in the country.
According to a report released on Friday by the UK National Audit Office, the government's extra leased trans-English Channel cargo capacity may not be in place until the end of November (one month after the October 31 deadline). The UK has authorized the registration of about 12,300 drugs, 7,000 of which are from or transported through the EU, most of which are transported across the Straits.
According to the "reasonable worst" scenario predicted by the British government, the volume of medicines may be cut by half on the first day of the unarranged transition and may take another year to recover. Time is said to be “extremely urgent” if the transportation problem is to be resolved by the end of October.
The report also states that the drug stock is "incomprehensive" but reserves are growing every day. As of September 20, suppliers reported that 72% of medicines had six weeks in stock.
"In the absence of an agreement, the British (health) sector would work under highly uncertain conditions, and it would be very difficult to fully implement the planned programs," government regulators wrote.
Meg Cyril, Chairman of the Oversight and Audit Office's committee, expressed her “deep concern” about the content of the report, saying that she had seen the British government “many times” miss the deadline, but the situation was particularly worrying this time.
"If the government screws up this time, it could have serious consequences," she said.
Dr. Richard Tobette of the British Pharmaceutical Industry Association said that while businesses were preparing for Europe, "some things were not controlled by businesses".
He said that if Britain really wanted to have no deal, businesses needed to know more about it and how to use the additional shipping capacity prepared by the Government.
In his view, “the best way to protect patients remains to ensure that an agreement is reached”.
Cleveland police are labeled "failure" in every aspect.
The Cleveland police, entangled in scandals, has become the first police force to be labelled "failure" by the inspectors in every aspect.
Her Majesty's Police, Fire and Rescue Services Inspectorate conducted an assessment of its overall and three key areas of work and reviewed its ability to reduce crime, ensure the safety and efficient functioning of the people and treat the public and employees.
The results of the survey showed that special measures should actually be applied to the force and that the Chief of Police, the Police and the Crime Commissioner were interviewed by the National Committee and asked them to ensure that the “significant improvements” plan was implemented.
If there is no improvement, the Home Secretary can intervene to solve the problem.
The team has been plagued by a series of scandals, including Harterpur, Redkar and Cleveland, Stockton and Middlesburg in the northeast of the United Kingdom.
Over the years, six police chiefs have been replaced.
In 2012, a former sheriff, Sean Price, was dismissed for serious misconduct; 7 police officers were under investigation and there were persistent complaints of racial discrimination in the team after the journalists ' phone had been illegally tapped.
Recently, the Inspector General of Police said that police work in an “imaginable inefficiency” and that police must share laptop computers and cameras with them.
British police inspector Phil Gomley said it was a “failure army”, and the situation had become increasingly “serious” over the past two years.
The Mayor of Tis Valley, Ben Huchen, said that the report “is the worst police force in the history of the country”, and that the police force was “finally officially confirmed as having a serious problem” and said that the Ministry of the Interior now needed to intervene.
He added: "There is no dispute. This is the fact described in black and white in this report.
"These results are the most painful and shocking part of what I've read."
Cleveland is one of the 15 units recently inspected by HMCFRS inspectors and the only one that is not qualified in all fields.
Gomlet added: "The force did not give due priority to crime prevention. The lack of strategic direction and the lack of resources allocated by the force to defence work ... failed to provide adequate protection to vulnerable groups such as children. The opportunity to protect them was lost and put them at risk."
He said that senior leaders had not consistently demonstrated “ethical behaviour” and that “the misconduct of high-level Cleveland leaders was very serious and was affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the force”.
He added: “This force has not always been fair and respectful of employees, nor has it been effective in communicating with or understanding employees; the process has been perceived to be unfair and the understanding of employees is inadequate to support them.”
Although the findings of the investigation are problematic, the force has indeed received some praise in dealing with serious and organized crime, but the way in which crimes are investigated must be improved.
Police and Crime Commissioner Barry Copinger said, "I am very concerned about the worrying part of this report.
"This unit has recently performed badly."
He said that he had been promised by the current sheriff, Richard Lewis, that once he realized those mistakes, he would take “quick action”.
The British Home Office has ordered Cobingue to respond to the report within 56 days.
Lewis said the report was like setting a line for the force and added, "I've made improvements, and I'm fully responsible for driving these obvious changes. During the five months of my tenure, I met with outstanding police and staff at all levels, and saw the efforts and determination of the frontline police, working to protect lives and the vulnerable."
If there is no substantial improvement fast enough, the government may step in, like to reshuffle collapsed prisons.
So far, however, politicians have never asked the police force to enforce this measure, the inspector said.
The Minister of Crime, Security and Fire Safety, Kit Martehous, said that he encouraged the sheriff “to act quickly to address these failures and will closely monitor the position”, adding: “Transparency and accountability are key to building public trust in the police.
Manelli Christian School: Many sixth-grade boys in Virginia are accused of being trapped in black girls and cutting their hair off by force.
A black high school student in Virginia accused three white boys of trapping her and cutting off her braids. The incident took place at the East Manelli Christian School, where Karen Pens, the wife of Vice President Mike Burns, taught.
Amar Allen, a 12-year-old student at the 12-year-old private Christian school, said that the boys caught her on the playground during the break, said her braids were ugly and curled, and then cut off her braids.
Amari told WUSA-TV under the Columbia Broadcasting Corporation flag with tears, "They laughed at me and insulted me. They said I was ugly, "I shouldn't be born." They said I was "wanting other people's attention."
According to WUSA, one of the boys allegedly held Amari's mouth over her, another grabbed her hands behind her, and another cut her braids with scissors.
Amari didn't tell her family about it until her grandmother found out her hair was shorter.
"They laughed and ran away, and I was just sitting there," Amari said.
The incident took place on Monday, but the kid said she didn't tell her family until Wednesday because her grandmother noticed that her hair was different. She said she feared reprisals after she told the truth.
Amari's grandmother, Cynthia Allen, said, "It's heartbreaking. I want the school to fire these students. I want the school to act."
Amari's family spends nearly $12,000 a year on Amari's school, and Karen Pens became famous at this famous anti-gay school at the beginning of this year after serving as an art teacher.
In a statement, Manelli Christian School said, "We attach great importance to the mental and physical health of our students and have a zero tolerance policy on any form of bullying or violence. We are deeply disturbed by these allegations, and we are currently communicating with the families of the victims, collecting information and doing everything we can to support them. We have also contacted law enforcement and asked them to investigate thoroughly and consult the Fairfax County Police Department for more information."
Although the school had adopted a zero tolerance policy for bullying, Amari said that the boys had tortured her before. She said that the boys had taken her lunch before, and they yelled at her.
Amari's family met with school officials on Thursday, and the investigation continues.
Iran released the British tanker Stana Anplio.
Iran released a British-flagged tanker last Friday, two months after Iran seized it on suspicion of entering Iranian waters in violation of international law.
According to the Iranian National News Agency, the Iranian Ports and Maritime Administration confirmed that the tanker, Stana Anplio, had left Abbas port at 9 a.m.
Eric Hannell, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Swedish Oil Transport Company (the operator of the ship), also confirmed that the ship had been released.
Eric Hannell wrote on Twitter: "Swedish Oil Transport Company and British Northern Oceanic Authority confirm that Stanna Anplio and his crew have been released".
On 19 July, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard detained the vessel for entering Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz on suspicion of violating international maritime law.
However, the arrest of the ship was widely regarded as Iranian retaliation against the British army, which captured an oil tanker in the waters of Gibraltar suspected of transporting Persian oil to Syria in violation of the international sanctions law. The ship was released in mid-August, despite the Trump government’s best efforts to extend the detention period.
According to The New York Times, Steiner Anplio was officially authorized to leave on Monday, but remained at the port until the investigation into the vessel ' s behaviour was completed.
“The tanker has left Abbas Harbour and is on its way to Dubai to get its crew off the ship for medical check-ups and debriefing”, said Hanaire, “The crew members have been informed and the company is currently arranging for the early repatriation of its important crew”.
The oil tanker had been the victim of an escalation of tension near the Persian Gulf, and the United States and Iran had shot down each other's drones near the Persian Gulf and at least two tankers had been blown up. The Trump government had accused Iran of being responsible.
The Trump government recently accused the Iranian drones of attacking Saudi Arabian oil installations, and Tehran denied any involvement.
Prime Minister Modi on Twitter saluted Jacques Chirac as a true global politician, friend of India.
Indian Prime Minister Modi expressed condolences on the death of former French President Jacques Chirac, saying that India mourned the death of a truly global politician and friend.
Jacques Chirac, who expressed support for India after its nuclear tests in 1998, died on Thursday and was 86 years old. From 1995 to 2007, he was President of France.
"I deeply mourn the death of Jacques Chirac. India mourns the death of a truly global politician. Indian Prime Minister Modi on Twitter said that, as a friend of India, he played a decisive role in building and building a strategic Indian-French partnership.
India and France established a strategic partnership during the first visit of Jacques Chirac to India in January 1998. In 2006, he visited the country again as President.
Jacques Chirac is said to have been in poor health for a long time.
Uganda: Government launched the HIV oral self-test reagent box
Uganda ' s Ministry of Health has introduced an HIV oral self-testing reagent box designed to ensure that citizens, especially male citizens, can be tested for HIV.
The objective of the plan is to reduce the number of new HIV infections in 2020.
Orasure Technology produces OraQuick HIV self-testing reagent boxes designed specifically for vulnerable populations such as young people between 18 and 24 years of age, adult males and sex workers.
"18 to 24-year-olds are our current target group. Young people in this age group are our target. Of course, any person over 18 years of age should be taken into account. We have no evidence of the illness of minors under the Constitution, but as more and more evidence emerges, we will move towards this goal. For men, we will give the reagent box to their mother, and they will hand it over to their partner, primarily to the sensitive population such as sex workers." Mr. Jeffrey Tasy, technical director of HIV testing services, said yesterday.
Easy to use
The previously provided self-test kits need to be tested for HIV through blood, but the HIV self-test kits can be tested through oral fluids.
The reagent box is made by detecting antibodies (natural guards of the human body who resist infection). If the human body is infected with HIV, the antibodies of the virus are found in blood and saliva. The reagent box is for antibodies in the mouth.
Data from the Uganda AIDS Commission show that Uganda adds 1,000 new HIV and 500 new AIDS deaths per week, which means 53,000 new infections and 23,000 new deaths per year.
Dr. Diana Atwan, Permanent Secretary-General of the Ministry of Health of Uganda, said that such a product would be very timely and would help humanity better fight AIDS.
However, she called on men to take HIV testing seriously.
She added that there were still 14% of infected people who didn't know they were infected with HIV, and more work was needed to take care of that segment of the population.
"For the time being, 86% of people living with HIV know their own condition, which means that 14% of the remaining people living with HIV do not know their own condition. So the question is how we use this innovative technology. For me, it's true how we're creating demand while providing reagent boxes, especially for those 14% of the patients, who are not well cared for." Dr. Atwan said.
However, health officials warned that diets were strictly forbidden for 15 minutes before testing.
Mr. Tasi said that the research showed that no suicides had occurred and that the Ministry of Health was confident to avoid such a possible tragedy, as testing was voluntary.
Dr Atwan said that, in addition to educating users through images and videos, government and private institutions (including all pharmacies) should provide 24-hour free telephone counselling services.
Study. Research shows that HIV-infected and non-infected people tested through OraQuick HIV self-test box have an accuracy rate of more than 99%.
Qatar World Cup athletes feel the heat.
At the Athletics World Cup, which opened on Friday, many of the contestants have already met their most challenging opponent: Qatar's hot and suffocating weather.
The humidity in Doha is suffocating, the day temperature hovers around 38 degrees Celsius, and athletes and track officials are discussing the weather in Doha, which is why they worry about some of the events.
Both marathons and races will be held at midnight, thereby minimizing the adverse effects of high temperatures.
Although the heat will have less effect on the players playing in the caliphate, because the air conditioner is in place and the temperature is around 21 degrees, because the training sites are all outdoors, the players still have to adjust their training arrangements.
"We're also from tropical climate countries, but it's nothing compared to here." The Bahamas coach Ronald Cartwright told Reuters.
"Here, you walk outside like someone turned on your heat. I guess that's why the race starts in the middle of the night."
Athletic officials promised to equip marathons and contestants with additional medical care and security measures.
The international track and track movement management organization, the International Federation of Fields, said that the female marathon, originally scheduled for Friday at midnight, would take place as planned, as temperatures are expected to be below 30 degrees or around 30 degrees.
The agency stated that its medical representatives had assured athletes that they would monitor weather conditions throughout the day and report to the teams, “so that the event would run at an acceptable level of health risk”.
The track and track players who participated in the indoor competition said that the heat should not have much impact on their performance, but they also acknowledged that training was particularly exhausting.
"I shined on my body during training, because it was too wet, and I was sweaty," said the 400-metre column player Rai Benjamin.
"Just like I just took a shower. But I don't think it's too bad because there's air conditioning inside."
Ryan Klaus, the 2016 Olympic champion and lead player, said he had to heat the ball to about 38 degrees Celsius every time in order to prevent it from becoming damp when trained in high-temperature and wet conditions.
"The normal temperature of the lead ball is far below the point of disclosure, and as soon as you take it out, it's wet, and it's dripping," said the American athlete. "This is worse than the rain pouring down and we've been overcoming it."
The European pole jump champion, Armand Duplantis, who has been training in hot weather in Louisiana in the south of the United States for years, said that the damp weather has proved to be useful for training, because the smoother powder on his hands has found water to make the grip stronger.
But for the other poles of sticky spray that are often used to enhance the grip, it's harder for them to hold on to the pole under this damp condition, he said.
"I understand that people who often use sticky sprays encounter problems because their hands feel slippery and sticky," Duprentis adds.
The locksmith was arrested, and the main prison security breach was worrying.
In recent days, a British prison locksmith was arrested and paid £500,000 to replace all the locks in the cell for fear that the key to the prison cell would be copied.
Fearing that copies of the key would be sold to some of the 1400 prisoners in prison, Her Majesty's prison Wanceworth called the police.
This suspicious security breach will result in the replacement of 3000 locks, possibly cells, internal and external locks.
The police arrested a 40-year-old man in the prison on September 13. The man came from the southwest of London and worked at the Government Facilities Services Ltd., which provided maintenance services to 52 prisons in the south of the United Kingdom.
The police investigation raised concerns that some key marks might remain in clay until a true copy of the key was produced.
However, the prison officials stressed that they had found no evidence that any prisoners had access to the keys.
Wanceworth Prison is a class B prison located in southwest London, with a capacity of up to 1628 inmates, and is one of the largest prisons in Western Europe. ... This prison, built in 1851, is used to house convicted male offenders and remand male offenders.
The Prison Administration spokesman said, "Her Majesty's Prison Wanceworth has raised the security level of the gate and is currently undergoing special identification checks due to a security accident.
The Speaker of the House warned Trump to stop attacking informants.
They said, "The President's speech today constitutes a threat to witnesses and should be strongly condemned, and such behaviour hinders impeachment by Congress. We condemn the President's attack and call on our Republican colleagues to condemn it, because Congress must do everything possible to protect this whistleblower and all whistleblowers." "The threat of violence by our country's leaders has had a terrible impact on the entire reporting process and has had serious consequences for our democracy and national security."
According to the statement, Trump “is now fully aware that our committee is seeking the testimony of the whistleblower and others mentioned in the `whistleblower complaint' published today in the House impeachment investigation, and that our country's laws prohibit any action that discourages, intimidates or otherwise puts pressure on witnesses to prevent them from giving testimony to Congress”.
They added: “Any official who has knowledge of the Commission's investigation — including the subject matter of the whistleblower's complaint — will not be subjected to any intimidation, reprisals or threats of retaliation, and all witnesses will have to be able to testify in Congress.”
The statement was issued on Thursday, a week when the "whistle-blower complaint" triggered a hysteria in Washington, saying that Trump had abused official power in the upcoming 2020 elections "to seek the intervention of Ukrainian President Volodme Zelenski" and that the White House had taken steps to cover up the matter. The White House's transcript of the July telephone conversation on Wednesday showed that Trump had repeatedly urged Zelenski to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunt.
There is no evidence that Joe or Hunter Biden was wrong.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced on Tuesday that Trump had betrayed his oath and announced the official launch of an impeachment investigation against the President, just before the whistleblower submitted the "whistleblower complaint" to the Congressman.
Michelle Obama complimented Megan Markle on his photo wall application.
Michel Obama has kindly written on the photo wall application on Thursday, paying high praise to Megan Marker, saying that the Duchess of Sussex is "a thought leader who is breaking stereotypes and making the world a better place".
The Duchess and Prince Harry are currently on a 10-day trip to South Africa with their beloved son, Archy Harrison Mombathon-Wincesa. Earlier this week, they attended a youth reception and met with the leader of the Obama Foundation.
The former First Lady of America enthusiastically wrote in the post: "Thank my friend, Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussex @sussexroyal, you are a thought leader who is breaking stereotypes and making the world a better place."
Michelle Obama added: "More than meeting with our Obama Foundation @ObamaFoundation leaders, or helping girls around the world to seek education, she inspired a lot of people."
Megan, who was a special editor of the British Fashion magazine, interviewed Michelle Obama for the magazine's 9th month magazine. The two ladies had a great talk, and the former First Lady reviewed her mother's experience and the changes she brought.
In an interview, Michelle Obama said, "Motherhood has always been a master's lesson to learn to let go."
As a mother, I understand that most of the time, my duty is to provide children with space to explore and develop, so that they become the person they want to be. It is not what I want them to be or what I want them to be when I am the age, but what they really are.
Michelle Obama, aware of the pressure under the global spotlight, gave some advice to the Duchess in an interview with Good Housekeeper.
She said, "The pressure felt by herself and others may sometimes be great. So my biggest advice is to be patient and not to rush into anything."
She goes on saying:
"I was worried about my daughters in the first months of the White House, making sure that they had a good start in school, and meeting new friends, and then I put my whole heart into a more visionary job. I think it's okay, even good."
Hero moment: Officer rushing up the busy high speed to save the hit dog.
It was a time of heroism, when a policeman rushed to a busy highway to save the next injured puppy.
Videos taken by Joseph Pugriya's CarLog show that Joseph Pugriya saw the puppy jump off the police car within seconds of being hit by another car.
The police officer who worked in Pinelas Park, Florida, wrapped up the injured puppy with a first aid blanket, put it in his own SUV and quickly took it to the nearest animal hospital.
Puglia said to the American Broadcasting Corporation, "I'm not really feeling better until the puppies start breathing."
Thank God, this little dog survived and suffered only minor scratches.
The officer said, "We gave him the nickname "Lucky," and I think it's more appropriate than ever. "It is indeed a lucky dog."
The puppy was sent to the local animal shelter and its rescuer was recognized as a hero.
But Puglia insisted that he was just doing his job.
The officer added that if the Animal Services Centre failed to find the owner of the puppy, his family would be happy to give a "lucky" family.
After WeWork went bankrupt, for the first time, the open equity market braked unprofitable companies.
Boston (Reuters) — Companies in the first show in the United States stock market resounded flat, especially when they were losing, which cast a shadow over the first publicly released calendar for the rest of the year.
Surprisingly, the sudden delay in WeWork's first open collection highlights how market confidence in companies and investors seeking financing is being eroded.
Peloton Interactive Inc. (PTON.O) continues to be punished on Friday for being more critical of the first open collection, the day after it started trading, the stock price of this gym company fell to $24.74, or 4%. The company's share price is now 15% lower than the price of the first open collection on Wednesday.
In the past, open market investors usually expected companies to make profits about 18 months after first publicly raising their shares. This timeline has been relaxed because capital operators are eager to add fast-growing businesses to their investment portfolios.
Recent transactions, however, seem to indicate that uncertainty about economic prospects is prompting investors to be more selective about the losses they are willing to support.
Peloton's report states that in the fiscal year up to June 30, corporate income grew rapidly and grew at 110%. But the company's operating leverage also showed negative values, with operating expenditure soaring by 147% over the previous year.
SmileDirectClub (SDC.O) in loss is the first listed dental correction company in the United States earlier this month. Research company recovery capital data show that the distribution price of the first publicly raised shares in three years will exceed the target area and will be closed on the first day of the transaction.
The average return on the first public collection in 2019 is currently about 9 per cent, down from 30 per cent at the end of June and 18 per cent about two weeks ago.
In the United States, most of the attention in the third quarter focused on an unrealized transaction - the first public collection of shares planned by WeWork's parent company, We Company.
The company originally planned to conduct its first public collection earlier in September, but postponed the listing plan until late 2019, after which the CEO was replaced and indicated that the listing schedule was under review.
The entertainment and talent agency Endeavoor Group Holdings (EDR.N), supported by Hollywood's heavyweight broker Ali Emanuel, has not yet had a clear profit schedule and has learned the lessons of these two companies. “This will be a dialogue between bankers, boards and senior management teams that decided to abandon their first open collection because of the market situation, and the company has had a loss record in the past.” Earlier in 2019, "These are isolated, incomparient" or "Our emotions have changed, we need to be more conservative and use different strategies", David Es
Jonathan Van Ness just pushed a plan with Nancy Pelosi.
Mr. Jonathan Van Ness, the star of "Pancho Savior" showed up in the United States Congress on Thursday to discuss the Affirmative Bill with the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.
The Affirmative Bill will provide non-discriminatory protection to persons belonging to sexual minorities in areas such as credit, education, employment, housing, federal financial assistance, jury services and public facilities.
The bill will amend the Civil Rights Act 1964 to include sexual orientation and gender identity in the list of protected categories.
Van Ness recently publicly admitted that he was infected with HIV and first shared a video of himself walking in the congressional building and explained in the text that he had met with the Speaker of the House of Representatives to discuss the Affirmative Bill, living with people living with HIV and access to PEP (an HIV-prevention drug):
Then he shared a longer post depicting the two men holding hands, urging his followers to stand up to the Senate majority leader, Mickey McConnell (Kentaki Republican), and pressuring Republican Senators to submit the Affirmative Bill to the Senate for a vote:
Pelosi introduced the Equal Rights Bill on March 13. The House of Representatives passed legislation in May. The bill has not yet been submitted to the Senate.
In August, the Trump Government asked the Supreme Court to fundamentally legalize anti-homosexual discrimination in the workplace and argued at the amicus curiae that the federal law on employer discrimination in the Civil Rights Act 1964 was not intended to protect individuals from dismissal on grounds of sexual orientation.
At the beginning of this year, Palosi and Van Ness, together with three other Pink Saviors, and Congressman Alexander Okacio Cortez (New York Democrats), met to discuss policies and promote the bill.
On Thursday, Pelosi shared a picture of her and Van Nes on the balcony shaking hands, thanking him for his voice in this struggle:
David Edenburgh is producing a new documentary on animals and colors.
David Aydinburgh is 93 years old, but this iconic master of nature is still alive.
He launched the seminal Naifeh documentary, Our Planet, and, after great success, this popular star will return with another series: The Color of Life.
This time, the father of the two children will study how animals use colours in their lives through high-tech cameras specially designed for the program.
The BBC has revealed that the purpose of this star is to present "the invisible colored world", which does sound very attractive.
Although fans look forward to the release of this series in the near future, it seems that we all need patience, because it won't be on our screen until 2021.
But we're sure it's worth waiting for.
At the famous ceremony in London earlier this month, David won the Lifetime Achievement Award for TV Select.
So far, 60 years have passed since the career of this country's treasure-class figure, bringing joyous laughs to millions of people.
In collecting his medals, the reporter enthusiastically said, "Yes, indeed. What I do is not always so funny, and people sometimes hear things they don't like."
But it's an honor and a great pleasure."
"Sir David Edenburgh is still working, studying and doing programmes, and he is not only a British hero, but also a global idol."
David was once again praised this week by a polar cruiser named after him.
The star figure attended the naming ceremony with Prince William and Princess Kate at the Birkenhead Kammelled Shipyard in Mercesardshire.
He said, "The world is facing all kinds of difficult problems, which are not news to any one of you, and it is the young people of today who will inherit the world most.
The difficult issues require a great deal of research and fact in order to resolve them.
That is what this amazing cruise ship will do to find the facts and find the law of science in order to deal with the problems facing the world today, and more and more people will do so in the future.”
The Color of Life is expected to be broadcast on BBC 2 in 2021, while Naife will retain global copyrights.
The husband of the murdered congressman Joe Cox said, "Don't use my wife's name to get political scores."
Jeremy Corbin criticized Boris Johnson by publishing a video of the murdered congressman last night, after which Joe Cox's husband said that his wife's name could not be used to gain political scores.
The Labour leader clipped a clip of Mrs. Cox's vigil after her death, with subtitles: "Boris Johnson doesn't care about our street violence."
Critics say that Colbin is using Joe Cox's murder to get a "cheap political score", while Joe Cox's husband, Brendan Cox, says that the Labour Party leader's attribution of hate speech to "simple political party issues" is "wrong."
Mr. Cox said, "Jeremy is right, and the best way to respect Joe is to defeat hatred and division. He believes that parliamentarians have special responsibilities and are right.
"But it would be wrong for Jeremy to attribute hate speech to simple party politics. Although Joe is a passionate Labourist, there are things that have to go beyond party politics."
Cox also shared a post saying that Joe Cox's name was "not just a political score point," and that it was subtitled "Thank you for this." Colbin's video started by talking about Mrs. Cox being murdered three years ago by an extreme right radical in the West Yorkshire district.
Speaking of clips about Mrs. Cox, Johnson and the congresswoman, Corbin said, "The prime minister knows that these words fuel violence and have serious consequences. The prime minister wants to split up. Obviously, he doesn't care about our street violence."
He continues to criticize Johnson and calls for a Labour Party government.
Colbin added: "Many people are deeply worried about Boris Johnson's words, which are being relayed by far right-wing elements. When women parliamentarians facing death threats asked him this question, Johnson looked down on them. It's shameful." Former Labour Congressman John Woodcock shared this video and said, "You can really shut up. It's disgusting."
At the same time, Nadine Zahawi, a member of the Conservative Party and Minister of Commerce, said, "It's a big mistake to use Joe Cox this way, because her family has made a clear request not to do so. Please stay away from politics.
"If you had a little dignity, Jeremy Corbin, you would have dropped the video." Prior to that, the British Parliament had a debate this week about some statements, in which Johnson said that the "best way to pay tribute to Mrs. Cox was to "finish England" and Joe's sister, Kim Lidbitt, called for a reduction in extreme speech, calling it "no good for Joe's children".
Joe's sister said to British Independent TV: "I'm talking openly about some crazy things about Boris Johnson -- I just think it's bad for the state of affairs. I can say what I think is right and what is wrong, but I'll try to do it in a cautious way."
The daughter of Labour Congressman Yvette Cooper publicly stated yesterday that she was worried about the safety of her mother, given the way people talk about politicians.
The House blames Trump on the border wall, but he plans to use a veto.
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives tried once again to overthrow President Donald Trump by using emergency powers to attack military base projects (e.g. schools and shooting ranges) in order to pay for his long-term commitment to build the border wall.
The bill was submitted to Trump with 236 votes in favour and 174 against, but he will certainly veto it, just as he rejected a similar measure in March.
The Senate passed the bill last week, but more than a dozen senior Republican parliamentarians condemned Trump.
The vote was different on Friday, as the Government recently published a list of 127 military construction projects totalling $3.6 billion, which will be cancelled to cover the cost of building the border wall, including many projects in Republican constituencies and states.
Brazil claimed that the oil spill on its northeast beach was not its own.
On Thursday, the Brazilian Environmental Protection Agency, the Brazilian Environment and Renewable Natural Resources Agency, indicated that analysis of the massive oil spill on the northeast beaches of the country showed that leaked crude oil was not produced locally.
In a statement, the agency said that they had conducted oil spill investigations on several beaches in the northeast states since September 2. The local media published several pictures of sea turtles covered with black tar from the oil slick.
Oil pollution spread along the north-eastern coast of Brazil over a total length of more than 1,500 kilometres (932 miles), affecting local wildlife and contaminating the painted beaches of many popular tourist attractions in the country, including the Fortno Beach in Ceará and the Maragos Beach Beach in the State of Alagoas.
In a statement, the Brazilian State-owned holding oil company, the Brazilian National Oil Company, stated that, after a molecular analysis of the crude oil, it was proved that the leaked crude oil was not produced or sold by the company.
Usually crude oil is tested prior to export to ensure that it meets the standards of the refinery that receives the crude oil. Crude oil from different oil fields can be identified on the basis of a range of chemical ingredients, including sulphur content, nitrogen content, acidity and viscosity.
The Brazilian Oil Regulator - Décio Odone, Director-General of the Brazilian National Petroleum Authority, stated that the agency believed that oil could have been leaked by a tanker far from the Brazilian coast, but added that this possibility had not been confirmed. A statement by the authority stated that no leaks had been reported from any oil drilling platforms in the country.
Some turtles were contaminated by oil, and they were rescued in North Rio Grande County and sent to rehabilitation centres. The bodies of some other animals were also found, and the Brazilian Environment and Renewable Natural Resources Agency added, but did not disclose the number of specific animals or deaths.
In a statement, the Brazilian National Oil Company stated that although it had nothing to do with the oil spill, it was also involved in the clean-up, and about 100 employees were helping clean the beaches.
Scorda offered voice digital assistant to the driver.
Scorda will present a digital assistant that can be activated by voice command. In a Wednesday's announcement, the Czech car manufacturer said that the driver could start the digital assistant using the phrase "Okay, Laura".
The system supports six languages and is capable of carrying out a range of tasks, including navigation to destinations and searching for music. The system will initially be configured in Kamiq city, SUV, and compact sedan Scala. According to Scota's annual report, Scota brand delivered 1.25 million cars worldwide in 2018 after it was acquired by popular groups in 1991.
For example, some BMW cars are now equipped with "intelligent personal assistants" and can start with buttons, call words, or the phrase "Hello, BMW." Drivers can use voice commands to heat their seats, access tire pressure information, and regulate internal temperature.
On Thursday, Jack Palmer, a senior network car expert at SBD Automotive, emailed a statement to the CNBC channel, in which he said, "Voice is the ideal interactive tool for cars."
"If most of the driver's orders can be received through virtual assistants without touching screens and buttons, the prevailing driver distraction problem will be greatly alleviated." Palmer adds. "Car manufacturers have realized this, and to that end, they are competing to integrate their solutions with, or cooperate with, consumer electronics companies like Google, Amazon, etc. "
The actions of companies like Scorda and BMW suggest that the way people interact with cars may change. The market intelligence company Inmint's car analyst, Hannah Kessian, told CNBC Channel via email that the company's latest report focused on why nearly 40% of the American consumers who own cars "want to use personal digital assistants in cars." She added, "This creates more opportunities for the future development of car digital assistants."
Ghana: Focus on World rabies Day
On Wednesday, Accra held an event to mark the thirteenth World rabies Day, which actively called on pet owners to vaccinate their pets in order to protect the lives of citizens.
The theme of the event was “Inoculation: elimination of rabies”, organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in cooperation with the Agricultural Veterinary Bureau.
The aim of the campaign was to highlight the important role of mass vaccination of canine vaccines in the eradication of rabies in Ghana.
Mr. Abebe Haile Gabriel, Assistant Director-General and representative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Ghana, addressed the meeting, noting that the problem of rabies could be minimized if vaccination was significantly stepped up to keep vagrant animals away from humans (especially children).
He said that according to the Global Strategic Plan for Zero rabies to 2030, "500,000 people die of rabies every year, 40% of whom are children living in Asia and Africa", he called for comprehensive measures to address the situation and protect children from rabies.
Mr. Haile Gabriel said that most rabid animals were infected with rabies, which again reflected Ghana's need to further expand the strategy of “United against rabies” (i.e., by 2030, when rabies died from zero deaths), which required pet owners to vaccinate animals suffering from common diseases of humans and animals.
He stressed the need for Ghana to initiate campaigns and vaccination programmes (for a period of five years) to raise the profile of the population and eliminate the risk of rabies among humans.
He noted that, through Ghana's rabies and prevention action plan (2018-2030), we had developed a comprehensive road map for the gradual elimination of rabies, with the hope that by 2030 this tropical epidemic, which has not received sufficient attention, would be eradicated.
Mr. Haile Gabriel promised that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations would be ready to work with other relevant units to prevent and control rabies in Ghana.
Dr. Owen Kalwa, representative of the World Health Organization in Ghana, noted that rabies are a pandemic disease that must be controlled in order to save lives.
He explained that through the strategy of “zero deaths of human rabies by 2030”, countries were supported in developing and implementing national plans to eliminate rabies, which included the concept of “health as one” and cross-sectoral cooperation.
Dr. Kalwa pointed out that 99 per cent of rabies and other animals suffer from diseases transmitted to humans through dogs, adding that it would be appropriate to control and eventually eliminate the “health as one” approach of human rabies.
Dr. Asiedou Baa, head of veterinary services, lamented that rabies had become a global burden.
He said, “Although rabies cannot be cured, infection can be prevented by vaccination, so the elimination of rabies is feasible and all animal owners must ensure that they are vaccinated against their animals.”
Dr. Ba'a said that while the use of appropriate sustainable control strategies can completely prevent rabies, the death rate of rabies will continue to rise and the epidemic will grow even further due to lack of funding and insufficient coordination.
He added: "It is imperative that the animal sector have sufficient resources to prevent the transmission of rabies on dogs as a means of preventing the disease."
The 12-year-old girl who kept the world silent.
At 16 years old, Greta Tomberg established herself as a global voice on climate change issues. But 27 years ago, another girl denounced United Nations leaders on the world stage long before social media was popular.
Since Greta Tomberg organized a student strike against climate change in her home country, Sweden, her environmental movement has been impeccable; on Monday, her angry and passionate speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit pushed her environmental movement to the top; she vehemently criticized politicians for using the word "talk" to steal her "dreams" and "babys", and humans are witnessing a "big extinction disaster".
The unconscionable criticism of Tomberi has been both fierce criticism and high praise. The New York Journal calls her "Sacro-Jongde, a protest against the climate change world", and the Guardian compares her speech to the meaning of President Lincoln Gettysburg.
By the way, in 1992, the media did the same thing with Suzuki Sutsu. Long before Tung Berry cold-facedly accused the officials of the various countries that "we may not have a future", the Internet people split into two completely opposing factions - Suzuki Suzuki's opposition and supporters; at the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, 12-year-old Suzuki Suzuki made a similar clamour, calling her "the girl who kept the world silent for five minutes."
The tone of Suzuki's rebuke is the same as that of Tomberi. "We came here only to tell you adults that you had to change your way of life," she started her own speech like Tomboli told the adults at the meeting, "We won't let you get away with these responsibilities."
As Tong Berry told the United Nations Climate Summit, "The great extinction disaster is coming, and you only know the fairy tale of money and economic growth all day long," Suzuki Suzuki told the leaders that "the future of losing me is much less simple than election failure or stock market swings."
And the focus of both girls' messages is nihilistic fatalism. "I'm afraid to stand in the sun now because the ozone layer is empty. I'm afraid to breathe air because I don't know what chemical substances are in it." Suzuki Sugi said in her speech in 1992. And look again at 2019, students strike and raise the slogan, "You die because you're old and I die because of climate change."
The environmental problems of Suzuki's clamour reflect the world in the early 1990s, when ecological problems focused on deforestation, ozone depletion, and species extinction. But after several years of intervention, humans have been quite successful in solving these problems. Thanks to a landmark ban on chemicals, ozone depletion has slowed significantly, and global forest cover has significantly increased, increasing the size of Texas and Alaska.
Suzuki-san himself later created an environmental think tank and worked with the special adviser group of United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan at the beginning of the 21st century.
So what's the future of Tungberry? It depends on how you look at the example of Suzuki. On the one hand, none of her most worried things happened. On the other hand, governments are still fighting environmental problems, and at the same time they have to be reprimanded by their children.
Assuming that 27 years from now our world still exists (and according to Tonberg, unless humans cut carbon emissions to zero in the next decade or so, the world will be extinct), this radical environmental girl is likely to recall her long career at the United Nations and non-governmental organizations, which she started with this famous speech.
By that time, another worried child might be sending a very angry warning about the acid rain in the Martian colony.
The Scottish National Party may support Jeremy Corbin as interim prime minister to stop the lack of agreement.
The Scottish National Party has indicated that it may support Jeremy Corbin as the interim prime minister of the British Prime Minister's Office in order to block the lack of agreement.
As the relationship between Congressman and the Prime Minister's Office became increasingly tense, Nicolas Sturgen suggested that the Labour Party leader could be supported as Acting Prime Minister before the general election.
Mr. Corbin appealed to Conservative traitors and opposition parliamentarians to support him in leading the interim government in August, but this was boycotted, particularly from FDP leader Joe Swanson.
On the basis of these proposals, the opposition sought to remove Boris Johnson through a "no confidence vote" and then form a coalition government to seek an extension to prevent Britain from leaving the EU on October 31.
The plan failed to gain cross-party support at the time, but the Scottish National Party high-level feared that if no agreement was reached before October 19, Mr. Johnson would ignore the law and force him to postpone the British retreat.
Nicolas Sturgem, leader of the Scottish National Party, suggested that the extension could be ensured by appointing Corbin, because it was a "black idea" that Johnson should be in charge of the operation.
In response to a tweet suggesting the appointment of a Labour Party leader or another interim prime minister, she said: “Agree to this approach.
No confidence vote, and the opposition unites around someone with the sole purpose of ensuring the postponement and the immediate conduct of the general elections.
Everything is at risk, but it seems to me that letting Johnson take office, forcing him to fail to reach any agreement, or even to reach a bad agreement, is the next step.”
Senior Congressmen Harriet Haman and Ken Clark have both been nominated as potential candidates to lead the coalition government, but senior SNP sources have insisted on the need to lead the Labour Party.
The source told Robert Peyston of British Independent Television that “we will have to elect a new Prime Minister through a `no confidence vote' so that we can ask for postponement of the decoure and the holding of general elections, a situation that has become increasingly clear.
It's too complicated to try to find a compromise, national unity candidate, especially now that we have a candidate. Whether people like it or not, Corbin must be the interim prime minister."
A spokesperson for the Scottish National Party said that the party was committed to stopping the lack of agreement and "remove the dangerous and undemocratic incumbent Prime Minister as soon as possible".
The spokesman said: “If there is political will, it is now possible for the political parties to unite in order to ensure that the letter promised the extension does not fall into the hands of Boris Johnson and his close friends, who are determined to find a solution to avoid the Banion Act, but sent by the acting Prime Minister, who will serve only for the necessary time to deliver the letter, and immediately thereafter hold general elections.
We remain open to all options in order to achieve the goal of stopping the lack of agreement and removing Boris Johnson.”
Even with the support of the Scottish National Party, this will be a decisive vote for Mr. Corbin. With 288 Conservative Members of Parliament and 10 Democratic Unity Party members, the opposition needs to bring some of the 34 independent Members of Parliament together.
The Labour Party considers the plan to be "the easiest and most democratic way to stop without agreement".
However, the Liberal Democratic Party believes that the interim government under Mr. Kolbin needs the support of former Conservative Congressmen and their own traitors, and therefore cannot obtain the necessary support in the House of Representatives.
Andres Conservative Congressman Kostney Haile said, "This report confirms the long-standing suspicion of many people that the Scottish Nationalists will be very happy to support Jeremy Corbin as British Prime Minister.
There is no doubt that the unswerving position of Corbin on the second referendum of independence (indyref2) is a determining factor for nationalists.
If he was Prime Minister, he had opened the door for a new referendum in 2014.
Only the Conservative government will come forward to support those who voted "no" in an event that should have been a 100-year-old.
Indicted for sexual harassment, more than 50 students at Surrey University were prohibited from joining the sports team.
"People just expect the boys to do what the holidays are supposed to do. You can accept it as an overdrinking, noisy trip.
However, according to students, some students behaved badly this year, especially during a game where members of the football club were provoked by their teammates to flirt with women, and their friends tried to “stop” them from doing so.
Alan Sutherland, Chairman of the Surrey Student Council, said: "We are aware of the impropriety of this behavior and, as the investigation proceeds, according to the student disciplinary regulations, any student accused of being “seriously” wrong will be referred to the school for investigation."
The school formally punished three students and personally investigated the conduct of the football team.
One student was removed from school for three sexual misconduct or harassment acts and one aggressive sexual act.
At the same time, two other students who were also accused of harassment were given a final warning and asked for an apology.
One student is prohibited from entering university campus at a given time, while another student is prohibited from participating in organized social activities. All three students are prohibited from attending graduation ceremonies.
The boys' football club at Surrey University said that they were “humbly sorry” for the behaviour of their members on their trip to Croatia.
Matt de Grodt should not be punished for schizophrenic stigma.
In 2016, Matthew de Grodd, who killed five people at a family gathering in Calgary, was convicted of not being criminally responsible for his actions.
Now, in 2019, a hearing will decide whether he should be allowed more freedom, such as to go outside without supervision. The decision will be made in the next few weeks, so in the meantime we will consider whether this is a good idea. There are different views on the matter: one side believes that, given his past violence, calls should be kept from happening again, while the other side believes in the power of change and healing.
First of all, let's look at the more pessimistic side. De Grodd did stab five people during a mental illness. This was an unpredictable violent attack. He suffers from schizophrenia, which is why he was found not to be criminally responsible, but has he been seeing psychiatrists and taking medication ever since. His psychiatrist, Santos Ray, once said before the Review Board, "If Matthew de Grod has committed another crime, the consequences will be serious." Despite his sense of progress, there is still a risk of attacking others again.
As long as De Grodt continues to take medication and the risk of reoffending is not so great, why are people so worried? I think that the stigma of people with mental illness, especially schizophrenia, has largely led to this fear. Some mental illnesses have become less terrible, such as emotional and anxiety disorders. But other diseases, including schizophrenia, are still highly stigmatized. This is largely because many people paint schizophrenia patients as dangerous people, and they have voices in their heads that tell them they want to kill.
It does happen, but it is rare, and that may be why we have such deep memories. In fact, most schizophrenia patients are non-violent, and they are more likely to be victims of crime or violence than perpetrators. With this in mind, it seems unreasonable to insist on depriving Degrod of certain freedoms if the fear of reoffending is more based on biased attitudes towards schizophrenic patients than on actual possibilities.
I don't think that DeGreud should never be unsupervised. Supervised through a parole-like system to ensure that he is still taking his medications and that they are effective. He argues that he or other mentally ill patients remain in solitary confinement unless absolutely necessary. This will cause mental illness, especially schizophrenia, to never integrate into society; so that they will continue to be stigmatized and the perception that they are dangerous criminals will become permanent. The court found that he was not criminally responsible and why treat him as a prisoner instead of treating him as a sick and now recovering
Prime Minister Olban of Hungary defended his country's candidate for the Council of Europe, “there's a solution at hand”
The Prime Minister of Hungary, Victor Orbán, said that after Hungary's nomination of a candidate for the Council of Europe Committee was rejected, he had several solutions “at hand”.
According to Reuters, Rowana Prembu, the Romanian Socialist politician designated by the EU Minister of Transport, and Laslo Trojani, the nominee commissioner of the EU Eastern Enlargement and former Hungarian Minister of Justice, were told that their nomination review hearings could not take place due to inconsistencies in the financial statements.
"I firmly believe that the best candidate for EU Commission member is Trojani," said Orbán. "If he is guilty, it is he who helps the government and I protect Hungary from immigration."
This was embarrassing for Orbán, who recommended Trojani, and he has been in constant conflict with Brussels on issues such as immigration policy.
A baby in flight: Japanese sails to launch the squeal baby selection service.
Japanese Airlines has introduced an online booking tool that shows the seats of children who go to school, and since then long-distance flights that are disturbed by crying babies may no longer exist.
When a passenger with an 8-day to 2-year-old child chooses a seat, a child sign appears automatically on the selection list, reminding other passengers who have not yet been selected.
Japanese Airlines quickly pointed out that the new functionality does not guarantee that passengers can completely avoid crying out loud babies.
The icon may not appear if the passengers book flights through a third party, take part in a tour or change the plane at the last minute, as indicated on the Japan Air website.
Japanese Airlines and other airlines have yet to come up with a way to predict the seat reservations of successive snorers and passengers who have completely tilted their seats when eating on the plane.
Nevertheless, this has won a number of user praises in social media.
"Thanks to @JAL_Officel_jp for reminding me of where the children planned to shout during the 13-hour journey," Lahart Ahmed, a businessman, wrote on Twitter. "This should indeed be enforced throughout the cabin."
However, there were also a number of people urging that travelling passengers remain tolerant.
"They're babies, we used to be babies. We have to learn tolerance. Otherwise, we'll soon need a map of the location of the situation that is common in life like snorting, drooling, farting, drunks, etc." One user wrote.
Pompeo accused Syria of using chemical weapons in the May attack.
United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeyo spoke during the United Nations Conference. The United Nations General Assembly said on Thursday that the United States had determined that the Syrian Government had used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year.
Pompeo said that United States officials had confirmed that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad's government had used chlorine gas in the May 19 attack on opposition forces in Idlib province.
Pompey said at the press conference: “The Assad regime is responsible for countless atrocities, some of which have risen to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity”.
United States officials said in May that the reports they had received were consistent with the chemical attacks in north-western Syria, but no firm conclusions were given at that time.
In April 2018, the United States, Britain and France launched air strikes on Syria in retaliation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month.
"It's different in a sense, because it's chlorine... but, you know, President Trump actively protects the world from chemical weapons," Pompeo said.
He added that the United States would provide the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons with an additional $4.5 million to finance investigations into other suspected use of chemical weapons in Syria.
Pompeo also called on the Assad administration to release thousands of prisoners who had been unjustly detained, including the missing American journalist Austin Tis, who was presumed to have been held for seven years.
"He's only one of the American citizens detained in Syria, and we call on the Syrian regime to release all of them."
Tesla released a report that Mask's goal is to deliver 100,000 cars this quarter.
Elon Mask, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors.
According to the electric car news network Electrek, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Ellen Musk said Tesla was expected to deliver 100,000 cars this quarter, which would be a new record, and Tesla's share price rose by more than 5 per cent after the news story.
The Electrek website indicates that this message was leaked from an e-mail sent by Mask to Tesla's employees. In this e-mail, Mask wrote, "We expect to deliver 100,000 cars for the first time this quarter. This is an exciting milestone for our company!"
In the report, the CEO added: "The challenge of this goal is to ensure that we have the right car type in the right place and to concentrate as much of the company's resources as possible to help meet delivery targets by the end of this quarter."
The vehicle manufacturer is expected to report its quarterly vehicle delivery in the coming days.
Tesla delivered about 95,000 electric cars last quarter.
Greece: 5 denials of illegal adoption of trafficking in newborns of poor women
Five Greek and Georgian citizens appeared in court on suspicion of involvement in a criminal organization that allegedly trafficked newborns in the form of adoption.
On Friday, all five denied the charges before the District Judge of Thessaloniki. Two Georgian nationals were accused of being the principal criminals.
The group allegedly recruited a number of extremely poor Bulgarian pregnant women who were willing to give up the newborn baby that was about to give birth. According to the authorities, the group sold babies to mostly Greek couples who had no children.
A total of 12 people were arrested this week for illegal adoption and trafficking in human eggs. 54 others were charged with conspiracy.
According to the police, this is one of the largest and most organized groups of similar organizations in Europe. Europol has assisted in the investigation of cases.
Mike Pompeio said the Syrian government used chlorine chemical weapons in the May attack.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeyo said on Thursday that the U.S. had concluded that the Syrian government had used chlorine chemical weapons in May this year while fighting insurgents in Idlib.
Pompey said at a press conference at the United Nations General Assembly in New York: “The Assad regime is responsible for countless atrocities, some of which have risen to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity”.
Pompey added: "Today I announce that the United States has come to the conclusion that the Assad regime used chemical weapons on May 19th."
According to the United States, in May this year, the United States received numerous reports that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad's army suspected the emergence of certain chemical substances in areas of armed combat with anti-government forces in the north-west; however, the United States did not draw clear conclusions as to whether the Syrian Assad administration used chemical weapons.
In April 2017 and April 2018, the Trump government bombed Syria twice on the grounds that Assad's Syrian government forces were suspected of using chemical weapons.
Father still has the hope that the suspect who shot his son a year ago will end up on the net.
The shooting of a 20-year-old in Long Beach was a year ago, but the family of the victim did not give up hope that the killer would get caught.
The victim's father, Guy Alford, said, "I wish I could do it with you, son. I wish I could do it with you."
Alford returned to the crime scene one year after his son Guy Alford III was shot dead -- the Jack fast food chain in a box near 52nd Street and Atlantic Street. He said he wanted to draw attention to the unresolved murder of his son.
He said, "Someone knows something, they need to say it."
The never-published security video shows that when Alford stopped at the car restaurant, the second car was parked behind him. Then three suspects came down from the car. One of them went to the driver's seat of Alford's car and opened fire on Alford. Four people in the Orford car jumped out of the car and ran away. The suspect then returned to his car and drove away.
Alford said, "No matter where this coward is, he'll be caught."
The sad father said that he did not know who would want to hurt his son, nor did he know who else was in the car when his son was shot dead.
Alford said, "They ran out of my son's car like they did on video, and where did they go? Did you go back and try to help him or do something? Nobody said a word."
Alford said that his son was a star football player at Alemany High School, and then an outstanding safety guard for the Long Beach City College football team. Alford said that his son was working hard to play, to get into level 1 school, and that his dream was to be a nurse.
A friend of his son's, Michael Harvey, said, "He worked three jobs. I'm 21, he's a year younger than me, and whoever keeps this busy state and the idea of work will be admired."
The police continued to investigate the fatal shooting, and Alford stated that he himself had not given up.
He said, "This problem will be solved, I can assure you."
Alford personally offered a $2,000 reward to find clues that might lead to the arrest and conviction of the suspect. We strongly recommend that anyone who can provide information about this crime call the Long Beach Police.
It's hard for England to get out of Europe.
If Johnson tries to avoid the promise of an extension, he will be humiliated in Brussels before the European Court of Justice. This will ease the mood of European officials, who will probably agree to do so. The main reason is to spend more time searching for solutions that reduce the threat of "no agreement" , which will harm both economies.
However, European diplomats have also seen that the British political impasse has delayed the British decision. Parliamentarians in Parliament can set aside their differences, restrict Johnson's movement and seek a postponement, but all the consensus they can reach is that. It was this same parliament that rejected the difficult British de-European agreement between former Prime Minister Teresa May and the EU on three occasions. Nothing will change until another congressman has the right to decide.
Even when elections are held, prospects remain worrying, because European countries want a friendly solution to the chaos brought about by Britain’s decoupling. The opposition Labour Party’s decoupling policy is painfully distorted and almost incomprehensible; and the centrist Liberal Democratic Party’s proposal to cancel the decouple is considered too extreme. The longer it takes, the less it works for the EU to function smoothly.
Brussels might be optimistic if there was a viable outline for an agreement at the headquarters of the European Commission Belemon Building. But the reality is that no such an outline exists.
Johnson often criticized the former Prime Minister's “back-up” proposal aimed at avoiding Ireland's return to hard borders and protecting the European Union's single market, but he did not bring any convincing alternatives. Officials said that many of the alternatives proposed by the United Kingdom were not specific enough to be operational and could not be implemented in time until 31 October, when the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union.
Moreover, Johnson's weakness will make the leaders of the 27 countries of the EU even less willing to eliminate the priority “red line”, despite the claim by British Minister Michael Goff, who is responsible for “no agreement” that they are “adapting” the backup.
Johnson was criticized for inappropriate rhetoric in the British Deloitte debate, the ideal outcome of which was that a series of strikes on him would bring the fight to an end. Europe had no choice but to negotiate with the current British administration while trying to preserve unity among the remaining 27 member states. Therefore, Europe should still try to get Britain to make maximum concessions, but the longer it takes, the harder it will be. If there is another chance to reach an agreement with the British Parliament, the EU should take advantage of such an opportunity.
But it's more like a football game, with 27 players on one side lined up, while the other guy tried to pick up the ball and go home.
The EU is good at setting rules, drawing the “red line” and insisting on enforcement, but unilaterally imposing its will is short-cut. At least until the UK elections or the second referendum break the deadlock, Britain has taken care of its own internal contradictions.
It's hard for Britain to get rid of Europe.
For the first time, the black hole devours and rips stars apart.
For the first time, a huge black hole was captured to swallow and tear apart a star.
Researchers published an article in Astrophysics magazine saying that this star is about as big as our sun, 375 million light-years away, and can see it twisted and spiraled up under the gravitational effect of a super-mass black hole.
Then the star was swallowed up, and astronomers called this rare cosmic event a tidal tearing incident.
NASA's Planetary Search Telescope, the Ling Japan Extraplanetary Explorer Satellite, captured the detailed time line from the beginning to the end of the event for the first time.
Astronomers used a global network telescope to detect this phenomenon before observing the Qing helium outer planetary exploration satellite, and the continuous observation area of the Qing helium outer planetary exploration satellite designed to search for distant planets captured the beginning of the violence.
Thomas Hollian, the astronomer who led the Carnegie Institute of Science, said, "This is actually a combination of rationality and good luck, sometimes what is needed to drive science forward."
When stars venture too close to a supermassive black hole, it is sucked into it, which lies at the heart of most galaxies, such as the Earth's Milky Way.
The powerful gravitational forces of the black hole tear the star apart, some matter of the star is thrown into space and the rest is inhaled into the black hole, forming a hot and bright gas during the swallowing process.
Mr. Holley added: "Specificly, we can measure the speed of the star's brightening, and we have observed rare planet temperatures decline and brightness darken."
The British Business Council will investigate Thomas Cook's bankruptcy.
The British Civil Aviation Authority said that after the collapse of the Thomas Cook Tourist Group, 72 flights were planned to take back another 16,000 passengers.
Aviation regulators said that more than 40% of passengers had already been picked up during the Maathorn Plan, the largest repatriation operation in the peace period launched on Monday.
At the same time, the British Parliamentary Business Committee has launched a bankruptcy investigation into Thomas Cook and has sought to question management issues regarding executive remuneration and accounting policies.
Thomas Cook, the oldest travel agency in the world, collapsed this Monday morning, affecting hotel owners, tourist attractions and resorts around the world.
"Unfortunately, the UK's old tourism company collapsed, and its principals should face public scrutiny and be held accountable for their actions prior to the collapse of the company," Rachel Reeves, Chairman of the British Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, said.
The hearing will begin in mid-October.
"The directors were pleased to accept this opportunity to clarify the facts and to prove that their actions were always in the best interests of Thomas Cook's clients, employees and stakeholders," an informed person from the company said to Reuters.
Why did the Times publish details of the identity of the whistleblower?
On Thursday, The Times published an exclusive detailed message from a whistleblower whose allegations led the Democratic Party to launch this week an impeachment investigation against President Trump. (This article states that the whistleblower was a CIA official who used to work in the White House and was very professional in Ukraine.)
Many readers, including national security and intelligence workers, have criticized the publication of detailed information in the Times, arguing that it may put the person who reported it at risk and could discourage those who wanted to report it.
We conveyed the concerns of these readers to Dean Barquett, the executive editor of The Times, who responded in discussions with the Reader Center:
As the information provided by the whistleblower triggered a landmark impeachment procedure, the President and some of his supporters criticized the credibility of the whistleblower. The president himself described the whistleblower's account as "political hacking".
We decided to publish limited information about the whistleblower, including that he worked in a non-political body, and that his complaint was based on an in-depth knowledge of the White House, because we wanted to provide readers with information that would enable them to make their own judgements about the credibility of the whistleblower.
China said it didn't start any war and didn't occupy another country's land.
On Friday, China stated that it had no intention of provoking "a war or conflict", and did not "approach another side of the land" and avoid mentioning the mid-1962 Indian war.
“China has always been committed to resolving territorial issues and maritime delimitation disputes through negotiation and consultation.” On October 1, four days before the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, China published an official white paper.
"China has maintained world peace with practical action. For 70 years, China has not initiated any war or conflict, has not appropriated an inch of another country's land." The White Paper "China and the World of the New Age" wrote.
While emphasizing the "peaceful rise" of the Chinese Communist Party, the White Paper makes no mention of the bloody war with India in 1962 and the vast areas of land occupied by China, particularly the Akselchin region.
The Chinese-Indian border dispute over the 3488 km de facto line of control remains unresolved. China also claims that Arunachal Pradesh is part of southern Tibet, and India rejects it.
To date, 21 rounds of Special Representative talks have been held between the two countries to resolve the border dispute.
In addition to the 1962 war, there was also a military confrontation between India and China in Dokram in 2017, when the Chinese People's Liberation Army tried to pave a road in an area close to the corridor known as the “Indian cock” and connected to the states of northeastern India, and Bhutan claimed to own the area.
The problem was finally resolved through diplomatic means, and both sides withdrew their armies.
In 1979, a major military conflict broke out between China and Viet Nam. China claimed sovereignty over the entire South China Sea. Viet Nam, Malaysia, Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan all objected.
"China and 12 of the 14 neighbouring countries have completely resolved the land boundary issue and demarcated the maritime boundaries of the Northern Gulf of China," said the White Paper and stated that since 1978, China has taken the initiative to reduce military posts by “more than 4 million”.
The Chinese army, with 2 million troops, remains the largest army in the world.
The prolonged monsoon has caused flooding and chaos in many parts of India.
The monsoon season in India has been raging for almost a month, with unprecedented rainfall causing buildings to collapse and many crops to begin to rot.
The monsoons in northern India usually dwindled in early September, but the average rainfall this month was 37% higher than normal. Indian meteorological experts say that if this continues for a few days, it will be the last monsoon season in decades.
Many parts of India are still suffering from unprecedented flooding, most recently in the town of Puna in western India, which killed several people on Wednesdays and Thursdays, and severely damaged by the collapse of buildings.
Houses are flooded and people travel on the streets in which they are flooded with flood on their knees, which is usually the only sight that can be seen at the peak of the monsoon.
Other cities, such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hyderabad, have also experienced heavy rains. North Akande in the north has suffered severe damage to houses as a result of persistent rainfall.
The monsoon is too late. Many areas lack water and farmers are prepared to cope with a possible drought disaster.
The prolonged monsoon season has caused the farmers a headache. "It's not normal at this time of year. My vegetables — cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes that I've harvested — have rotted." Prakash Mehra, a small farmer in North Akandbambimtal, said.
For consumers, this late-to-late monsoon has caused onion prices to rise. Onions are an important ingredient in Indian food. In cities like Delhi and Mumbai, onions are sold at 80 rupees per kilogram (approximately 1 pound sterling), whereas normally they are 20 rupees per kilogram (23 pence).
The holidays are also at risk. The next big festival is the 10th of October 8th, where Indians have a huge comic-style Robona portrait. Robo is a figure of the Hindu epic "Romocron" with a thick beard and a bad-mouthed smile.
The burning of Robona portraits symbolizes the impotence of evil. These are like paper, and if the monsoon continues, Robona may laugh until the end.
Julian Assange: Private security company "for the CIA to watch WikiLeaks at the Ecuadorian Embassy"
According to the source, Julian Assange was living in London when a Spanish private security company hired to protect the Ecuadorian Embassy in London watched the founder of WikiLeaks for the American intelligence agency.
According to a Spanish newspaper El País, Spanish private security companies are suspected of providing the CIA with audio and video from Assange's meeting with his lawyer.
It was reported that the company was under investigation by the Spanish High Court.
Assange himself initiated criminal proceedings, accusing the company of violating his privacy and the confidentiality of his client-lawyer privileges.
According to the newspaper El País, the Spanish private security company failed to respond to its request to comment on the matter.
Assange was expelled from the Embassy in April, immediately after being handed over to the British authorities by Ecuador.
In 2012, Assange entered the Ecuadorian Embassy in the United Kingdom during bail and was at risk of being extradited to Sweden on charges of sexual assault; Assange said he feared that he would be extradited to the United States if he gave up WikiLeaks activities.
In June of this year, the United States officially issued an extradition request to Assange, and Assange was charged with 18 counts of computer misuse, unauthorized disclosure of defence information, etc.
He was accused of collaborating with Chelsea Manning, a former American military intelligence analyst.
Assange, who had previously been imprisoned for breaching the bail conditions of Sweden's extradition request, was currently serving his sentence in Belmash prison in London and should have been released last week, but was remanded in custody pending the United States extradition hearing in London in February 2020.
In May of this year, the Swedish prosecution reopened the investigation into Assange's rape charge, which Assange has denied.
The flight landed in Baltimore after Almighty Air declared an emergency.
According to the United States Federal Aviation Office, an all-power international aircraft landed safely at Washington International Airport in Baltimore after an emergency was declared.
In an e-mail, the United States Federal Aviation Office indicated that the 328 flight landed at Washington International Airport in Baltimore at 6:19 p.m. on Thursday because of the hydration problem of Boeing B777.
According to the United States Federal Aviation Office, the flight has left Baltimore, but its destination is unknown. The number of passengers on the flight is unknown. The United States Federal Aviation Office is investigating the incident.
All-China International Airlines (based in Tarsa, Oklahoma State) received a telephone message and returned immediately on Thursday evening.
Why do we need Gandhi?
As we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the birth of an extraordinary human being, the leaders of the world's two largest democracies should listen to the principles that he practises.
Mohandas Karamchand's Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, and dedicated his life to the cause of morality, non-violence, tolerance and social justice, leaving a valuable legacy for the entire world. He has had a profound impact on the two most important national movements in the United States.
Howard Shurman and Benjamin Mays, American activists who traveled far across the ocean to India to meet Gandhi, have therefore begun to influence the civil rights movement long before Martin Luther King accepted his ideas.
And Caesar Chavez traced his political awakening to a news film that he watched when he was 11 or 2 years old and said, "This half-naked man without a gun conquered the power of the British Empire," and later, when he led the farm workers movement, he followed Gandhi in many strategies.
Gandhi has the same influence outside the United States. For example, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Marara Yusafzai and climate change activists view Gandhi as a beacon.
But President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi seem to be indifferent to Gandhi's ideas, apart from the words of complimentation they gave to Gandhi at a successful joint public gathering in Houston recently. Both are right-wing populists who lack compassion or tolerance in their countries and have successfully launched a voting group of whites and Hindus in their respective countries, while inciting division and social opposition.
Modi has been a member of the Indian nationalist organization, the National Volunteer Organization, since he was eight years old, whose former member, Naturam Goldson, stabbed Gandhi on January 30, 1948. Indeed, Modi’s ruling party, the National Councillor of the Indian People’s Party, has greatly appreciated the assassins of Gandhi in recent years.
The Modi government has demonstrated anti-Gandiism in many ways by abolishing the autonomy and state status of Muslim-majority provinces of Jammu and Kashmir and imposing a blockade on the area; and also by not welcoming refugees of mostly Rohingya Muslim origin who fled from extreme persecution in Myanmar.
Moreover, Modi's government has also caused social unrest by setting up detention camps in Assam State, located in border areas, ostensibly to capture non-national citizens from Bangladesh, a neighbouring Muslim-majority country, but this could result in nearly 2 million people being denied the right to vote and imprisoned.
The Trump policy is the same. The travel ban imposed by the Trump government on Muslim-majority countries is a response to Islamophobia, and this is what Modi's policy has always considered. Its indifference to refugees is also a reticence of the Indian government to the suffering of the Rohingyas, and American detention camps are very different from those established by the Modi regime.
At these two leaders' recent joint rally, there was a moment worth learning about. At the event, the majority leader of the House of Representatives, Stanley Hoye, quoted Gandhi's definition of democracy as "democracy can give the weak the same chance as the strong."
It's the 150th anniversary of Gandhi's birth, and if Trump and Modi could remember Gandhi's advice, their performance during their term of office would have been much better.
White House announcement: Trump nominated Peter Geiner as Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
On April 3, 2019, in Washington, D.C., the acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Peter Guena, smiled and testified at a hearing on the Bureau ' s budget request for the 2020 fiscal year, held by the Sub-Committee on Homeland Security of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, nominated Peter Geiner as Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the White House stated in a statement.
The current Deputy Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Guena, served as Acting Director General of the Agency, which is responsible for overseeing the Government's response to disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires.
Since the resignation of Broc Lang in March, there has been no head of the agency approved by the Senate. The Department of Homeland Security, the parent department of the Administration, determined that Lang had violated the law by using the bus to travel to Washington and his residence in North Carolina, and subsequently resigned as Director General.
Earlier this month, the nomination of another director candidate, Jeffrey Bayad, was withdrawn because background checks found him suspected of involvement in a bar fight.
Genna's nomination is unexpected. He also needs a majority in the Senate to approve the nomination before he can take up the post of Director.
According to the White House, before assuming the post of Deputy Administrator of the Administration in 2018, Qana worked in the emergency management department on Rhodes Island and served in the United States Navy.
Men were "hit" in front of their house.
A man was set on fire at his doorstep, which the police considered to be a targeted attack.
The 48-year-old man started a fire outside his home in Skelmersdale, Western Lancaster County, when he was wet and flammable liquids were said to be gasoline.
The man was badly burned and is currently in hospital in a critical but stable situation.
At around 1 a.m. on Thursday, the police received a police call to the man's house and opened an investigation into the attempted murder.
Inspector Pauline Stables, who was in charge of the investigation, said, "The nature of the incident is bad, the man is still in hospital, and the situation is very bad.
“We are conducting a series of investigations to try to identify those responsible.
“We are trying to verify the motives of the incident, and we are convinced that the event was targeted, and I would like to stress that I do not think that the current incident poses a threat to the wider community.
“I hope those who know the whereabouts of the killer will report to us.
"Does your relatives behave suspiciously when they come home, smelling smoke, gasoline, or have inexplicable scars?
"We need someone to take responsibility for this terrible incident."
Fragile Democrats have caused Perosi's fear of impeachment.
During the meeting, several members expressed their position that Democrats should continue to focus their investigations on Ukraine — accusing Trump of asking the Ukrainian president to investigate potential political opponents in 2020 — rather than other cases of possible violations detailed in the report of Special Adviser Robert Muller.
At a press conference on Thursday morning, Pelosi said that the vast majority of Democrats agreed with the strategy that the "whistle-blower complaint" was the "centre of the moment".
Leaders want to maintain intra-party unity by continuing to focus on impeachment investigations, while focusing on moderate members who have recently joined the proceedings. Members of Parliament said that Ukraine ' s problems are more clear and easily explained to the public. They also believe that the investigation led by the Intelligence Committee is small in scope and progress will be faster and could be implemented within the next month or two.
Shortly after Congressman Angie Craig from Minnesota joined the Democratic Party, she said earlier this week that she supported impeachment investigations, because in previous meetings Palosi and the Democratic Party leaders had mostly listened to parliamentarians.
Craig said, "In my position, I've always been reluctant to push the investigation from the point of view of what I wish to be bound by, and I want to see due process and to make sure that we have all the facts -- a process that will make it possible for us to do so," she added, and she supported a small-scale investigation led by the House Intelligence Committee.
Democratic Congressman Matt Cartwright from Pennsylvania told CNN that he would not vote in favour of impeachment clauses at the moment.
Cartwright said, "I'm not voting right now because we haven't seen the whole truth yet." "We have to assume that people are innocent, don't we? If all this is true, we have to see if the press is covering any news, and if there are any documents to disclose it."
Democrats will soon hear from voters about their push for impeachment, and members plan to return to their constituencies early in October for a two-week recess. This is the first time that a large number of members from conservative regions have heard feedback from their voters, sometimes negative news, since calling for impeachment proceedings following accusations in Ukraine earlier this week.
But Congressman Dan Kirdi of the Michigan Democratic Party said it would be good to choose to adjourn at this point.
He said to the press, "I can't imagine anything better than reporting to the boss before pushing the impeachment process." "It's actually a good time for us to go back and take a breath, understand the views of the local people, explain what we're doing to them, then go back and move on accordingly."
Although the parliamentarians have returned, the process may have been faster.
Jamie Raskin, a member of the Judicial Council, was a supporter of the impeachment investigation and said, "I think everyone wants to finish this job in 2019."
This Maryland Democrat said to the journalist on Thursday evening: "There is consistency within the party on the emerging irregularities and corruption in the White House, and our job is to reduce such acts and problems through a series of meaningful impeachment clauses for the country." "We need a series of provisions to ensure that legal cases are convincing and tell the public a coherent story. If we do our job correctly, then it will be a unified operation for the whole country."
Anthony Brindisi from New York, a new Democratic candidate who refused to call for impeachment investigations, told CNN that he was temporarily opposed to impeachment of Trump.
Brindisi said, "Although I find many of the statements in the whistleblower's report disturbing, there is more information." "We have to talk to some of these officials, who have already listed the report here and looked at its whereabouts."
According to CNN, more than half of the US House of Representatives support impeachment investigations. But this includes many Democrats who, while expressing support for impeachment investigations, are still waiting for results before deciding whether to vote in favour of impeachment of Trump. Even if the House of Representatives can vote for impeachment clauses, it will be confronted with a "stopper" in the Republican-controlled Senate, which is one of many reasons why the issue has caused political disagreement within the Democratic Party.
Trump discussed former Vice President Joe Biden in a telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodme Zelenski on July 25, after which the number of people supporting the launch of impeachment investigations increased significantly (more than 75 members of the House of Representatives). There is no evidence that Biden was wrong.
Trump staff said that lawyers had transferred Ukrainian phone records to the security system.
A senior official of the Trump administration admitted on Friday that White House lawyers had instructed that the telephone records of President Trump and President Zelensky of Ukraine in July be transferred to a highly secure system.
Apart from reporting the charges in the telephone, it is not clear what other actions have been taken to transfer the records.
The Trump government declassified the whistleblower's complaint, which was announced to the public on Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee, that White House officials said they had been “directed” by White House attorneys to remove phone records from the computer system where the phones were normally stored.
The whistleblower claimed that the transcripts were usually kept in different levels of the confidential system. The whistleblower added that, according to White House officials, "not the first time" the President's notes were placed in the system to protect politically sensitive information, rather than national security sensitive information. The complaint claimed that the White House tried to "restricte" access to calls.
"In the days following the call, I learned from a number of United States officials that senior White House officials had intervened to `lock ' all records of the call, especially the official verbatim records of calls produced by the White House Intelligence Unit in accordance with established practice," the whistleblower said.
The White House released a non-confidential version of this call record on Wednesday. The memo is not a verbatim record, but a "records and memories" of the call from the people concerned. It shows that Trump is seeking assistance in investigating the Biden family.
And he said, "The other thing is, Biden's son has a lot of rumors, Biden's got a case closed, and a lot of people want to find out, and it's best if you can do something with the Attorney General." "Baden brags that he stopped the prosecution, and it sounds awful to me if you can investigate it."
During his tenure as Vice-President, Joe Biden urged Ukraine to dismiss Victor Shawkin, its highest prosecutor, who was investigating corruption in the "Brisma Holdings" of the Ukrainian gas company, where Hunt, Biden's youngest son, was a director. Biden's allies insisted that he intervened because of corruption.
But the whistleblower complained that Trump was seeking foreign aid during the 2020 campaign. However, the whistleblower admitted in the complaint that the complaints were based on second-hand information.
The instructions of the White House lawyers to amend the record were characterized by the Democratic high-level as “covering the facts”.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, announced this week an official impeachment investigation against the President on developments in Ukraine, which she described as a "hidden" and said would be part of the impeachment investigation.
At the same time, Trump's attorney, Jay Sekulo, diluted the importance of record-keeping details.
"This is a cover-up? Think about it, Sekulo said on Friday in Fox and Friends. " Shouldn't the White House protect the conversation with the Ukrainian president? Is this a secret and not a cover-up? It's a document. It's bullshit."
Ukrainian scandal: Pelosi said Bar was a rogue; former U.S. officials supported the investigation.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, accused the US Attorney General, William Barth, of protecting the president on Friday by "the scoundrel" in a controversial telephone call between President Trump and Ukrainian leaders, which also triggered impeachment investigations.
This indictment was filed on Thursday by an intelligence officer who refused to reveal his name before the California Democrat made the above statement to Michael Atkinson, the US intelligence agency inspector. Atkinson handed it over to Joseph Maguire, the national intelligence supervisor.
In a call on July 25, Bar and Trump's lawyer Rudolph Juliani were mentioned many times. The indictment said that White House officials were very concerned about this and they tried to " lock up" the phone records.
Pelosi said to the Microsoft National Broadcasting Corporation on Friday, "Bal has become very rogue." "I think what they're doing is covering up the truth. I think it's sad that the Justice Department is so rogue. Well, it's been a while now. It's only making things worse."
After Trump admitted that military assistance to Ukraine had stopped, Pelosi announced a formal impeachment investigation this week. The aid was finally approved, but the Democrats of the House of Representatives wondered whether it had anything to do with Trump requesting Zelenski to investigate Hunter Biden, who had worked for the Ukrainian gas company for five years.
Also on Friday, nearly 300 former U.S. foreign policy and homeland security officials signed a letter in support of impeachment investigations. The coalition said that Trump's actions constituted "a serious concern for national security".
The letter said, "We applaud the congressmen, including the Speaker of the Pelasia, who led us on this necessary path." "President Trump seems to have used the power and resources of the country's highest office to invite more foreign powers to interfere in our democratic process. This would constitute an unreasonable abuse of power.
“It will also represent an effort to subordinate the national interests of the United States — as well as those of our closest allies and partners — to the personal political interests of the President.”
Trump denied that there was anything wrong with this call. On Friday, he denounced the complainant and said again that his call to Zelensky was "the perfect conversation."
On Twitter, he said, "It sounds more and more like a so-called whistleblower, but it's not a whistleblower at all." "In addition, all second-hand information has been shown to be inaccurate, and there may be no other person, leaker or spy giving it to him or her?" A party detective?
The whistleblower's complaints indicate that Vice President Pence also interacted with Ukrainian leaders and that he met Zelenski in Poland earlier this month. He said he had not discussed Joe Biden or Hunter Biden.
Chinese defenders have been buried in detention centres, and all sides have called for a thorough investigation of the torture.
One Chinese defender was arrested and killed after raising cards to demand that Chinese leader Xi Jinping be removed from power, and several defenders called for a thorough investigation into his true cause of death.
Wang Meiyo, age 38, raised a petition outside the Huanan Province Public Security Office in July this year to ask Xi Jinping and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang to step down and implement the general election system in China. The police then accused him of “suspecting for corruption”, a crime that is vaguely defined and for which many dissidents have been imprisoned.
Wang Meiyu's mother and lawyer revealed that he had died on Monday. Wang Miyu's wife, Cao Chongxia, received a phone call from the police saying that her husband died in a military hospital in Xiangyang City, and that Wang Miyu's detention centre was located in Xiangyang. The police officer did not explain his death on the phone.
According to the Chinese human rights organization People's Watch, Cao Chongxia later saw Wang Miyu's body, and found blood on his mouth, ears and nose, and bruises on his face.
The Chinese Network of Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) issued a statement stating: “The Chinese Government must thoroughly investigate the torture and death of human rights activist Wang Meiyu while in detention and hold perpetrators of torture and extrajudicial executions criminally accountable.”
According to Radio Free Asia, Cao Songxia said that the police had asked her to accept Wang Miyu's accidental death, but she rejected it. A police officer at the Changyang City Police Department said he could not comment on the case. Wang Miyu's mother told the Guardian journalist that the authorities had released more than RMB 2 million (approximately US$ 220,000) to her family.
"No investigation into the truth of the matter, no criminal liability of the person concerned, just compensation, so that the grievances of the snow victims cannot really be cleared, nor can the prevention of torture be effectively prevented", according to Francis Eve, head of the CHRD study.
“in particular, the victim's family has in fact been taken hostage and may be forced to stop asking for the truth of the incident by receiving compensation.”
Other Chinese defenders had similar events before Wang Meiyu, such as the death last July of Guagen lawyer Kischen, and the death last year of Uighur scholar Muhammad Saleh Agyi. In 2017, Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, who was still serving a prison sentence (11 years' imprisonment), suffered from cancer and died as a result of the authorities ' refusal to treat him; and in 2014, he successfully tried to attend a United Nations conference on the human rights situation in China, where he was detained while on his way and subsequently died.
According to CHRD, Wang Meiyu's family has been under house arrest since last week. Wang Mei has left two young children. Other people implicated in the case have also been pressured by the authorities. On Wednesday, human rights lawyers Xieyang and Chen Yan Hui, a rights activist, were under the control of six special police officers with live ammunition while discussing Wang Meiyu's case in the hotel guest room. The police released two men on Thursday.
Wang Meiyu began his advocacy activities in the early years of forced eviction; he was previously detained by the police and claimed to have been tortured.
In 2018, after raising cards to ask Xi Jinping to step down, he sent a message via the Internet, claiming that police officers had stormed his house and ordered him to write a letter of remorse and a promise to stop such activities.
"These morons, they don't want to think about how they tortured me all these years, even three days and three nights without water, and two hours with electric needles, causing me to spit blood in my mouth, and I won't give up."
A pet owner who doesn't walk a dog will face a $2,700 fine.
If the owner fails to provide basic goods such as shelter, food, water, etc., they will face a huge on-the-spot fine. If the owner locks up the dog for 24 hours, the pet must be allowed to move freely within the next two hours or face prosecution.
The region was the first jurisdiction in Australia to recognize animal perception capabilities.
"Modern animal welfare is concerned with how animals respond mentally and physically to their environment," Chris Steele, Minister of Urban Services of the Action Party, was also an advocate of the bill and stated at the press conference.
Hong Kong Police report that the number of students arrested during protests has increased.
Last Friday, the Hong Kong Police said that 1,600 people had been detained in anti-democratic protests since June, while 29% of students, and that on weekends the police urged young people to take the right approach when planning larger gatherings.
Chief Inspector Xie Zhen of the Police Public Relations Department said that 207 high school students and university students were detained this month alone, compared to 257 arrested between June and August, despite the fact that classes were resumed after summer holidays.
Xie Zhen said that there had been an increase in the number of juveniles involved in violent crimes and that some of them had been charged in court. These included a 16-year-old recently charged with arson, who, if convicted, could be sentenced to life imprisonment; a 13-year-old girl accused of desecrating the Chinese flag; and others who attacked the police and carried dangerous weapons.
It's worrying to see these young people breaking the law at this young age and possibly having a criminal record. We call on all young people to reflect on their behaviour and hope that the education sector and parents can help our young people regulate their behaviour.
Since June, young people have mainly protested the extradition bill, and the government has now agreed to withdraw it. But since then, the protest has attracted more participants, turned into a larger campaign against the Chinese government, and the protesters claim that the Beijing side is quietly interfering with Hong Kong’s right to self-government; Hong Kong was once a British colony and its sovereignty returned to China in 1997, when the Chinese government promised self-government for Hong Kong.
Protesters expanded their demands, including by directly electing Hong Kong leaders and independently investigating alleged police brutality against protesters.
On Friday night, thousands of people held peaceful protests in downtown square, alleging abuse of power by the police, waving anti-police slogans and chanting democratic slogans. The Hong Kong government said that complaints against the police would be investigated by a police oversight body which, according to critics, has no real powers and no real powers to investigate.
The police authorized the Citizen Human Rights Front to organize a major rally in Hong Kong city centre on Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of the umbrella movement, which ended without any concessions from the government during which the protesters occupied the main streets of Hong Kong for 79 days in 2014.
On Sunday, protesters will also organize "anti-polarism" rallies in Hong Kong and many cities around the world against the Chinese tyranny they condemn.
He called on protesters to stop manipulating peaceful protests, as they did earlier when they gathered, such as when some threw gasoline bombs, caused street fires and damaged public facilities. The police used tear gas, high-pressure water guns and other measures against those protesters, leading protesters to complain about the excessive use of force.
The Citizens' Human Rights Front also planned another large march on October 1, and there was concern that this bloody final battle might put the ruling Chinese Communist Party in an awkward position, as the Chinese Communist Party was hosting a major event in Beijing to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. The Hong Kong government reduced the size of the celebration of the National Day, cancelled the annual fireworks show, and changed the reception ceremony to the indoors.
Nestlé strengthened coffee bean control after herbicide panic.
The largest coffee company in the world stated in a statement on Friday that the company found that the residue of herb glyphosate was close to the maximum residue of herb glyphosone in some green coffee bean products.
In the United States, the jury has determined that those who claim that their cancer was caused by exposure to herbicides receive huge compensation. Bayer, the owner of Monsanto, said that the herbicide was safe as long as it was properly used, as did the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
Newman's Coffee Group, one of the world's largest traders, says that grass gluten is one of the substances monitored in the coffee it buys. Nestlé buys some coffee beans from Newman's Coffee Group. Now it is too early to predict the impact of Nestlé's tight policies on Newman's Coffee Group.
Nestlé's decision to increase the frequency of inspections has little impact on the global coffee supply chain, and the spokesperson said, "This is not a new process, we're just tightening controls," and the speaker told CNN commercial channels that coffee was tested before it arrived from the country of origin.
Nestlé will start with suppliers from the world ' s largest coffee producers, such as Indonesia and Brazil.
"Our agrologists will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve weed management practices, including the proper use of herbicides and other weeding methods," the Swiss company said.
In Nestlé's pink and liquid beverage business, the brands Nestlé coffee and Nespizo took a significant share, selling 216 billion Swiss francs (approximately $21.7 billion) in 2018. Nestlé agreed to sell Starbucks bags for coffee and tea last year on a global scale.
Does herb glyphosate cause cancer?
According to EPA, 100 different food crops use herb glyphosate. Scientists from environmental conservation organizations in the organic food industry say that some popular breakfast cereals contain chemical substances that exceed their child ' s safe dose.
Nevertheless, the EPA claims that glyphosate is not a carcinogen and does not pose a risk to public health. In a April statement, the EPA stated that ecological risks include hazards caused by pollinating insects and weed resistance problems.
But that did not prevent thousands of people from filing lawsuits against Monsanto, who claimed that they or their relatives had cancer as a result of their contact with Nonda.
Earlier this year, a jury ruled that Bayer paid 2 billion dollars in damages to a California couple because they claimed that they had spent more than 30 years in their property and that the couple had diagnosed non-Hoochkin lymphoma within four years. Bayer is appealing the ruling.
A 2015 study by the World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer found that, based on "limited" evidence of human carcinogenation and "adequate" experimental evidence of carcinogenation in animals, glyphosazine "may cause cancer in humans". However, a joint group of WHO and FAO subsequently concluded that glyphosazine was less likely to cause cancer through diet.
A man killed his ex-wife in Texas and six family members were sentenced.
A Utah man was convicted on Thursday of killing six members of his former wife ' s family in Texas and may face a death sentence.
The Harris County jury found Ronald Haskell, 39 years old, guilty of killing six members of the Star family in July 2014: parents Stephen Star and Katie Star, children 13 years old Brian, 9 years old Emily, 7 years old Rebecca and 4 years old Zach.
In a statement, the District Attorney of Harris County, Kim Augg, said, "We appreciate the jury's attention to every piece of evidence in the case over the past few weeks." "There is no doubt that Haskell has carefully planned and carried out the massacre of Star's entire family."
According to the police, Haskell travelled from California to Spring, a suburb of Houston, ambushed the former wife's sister, brother-in-law and five children at home.
Mr. and Mrs. Star and their four children were shot in the back of the head, while the fifth child was 15 years old and survived. Cassidy, a teenager, was grazed in the head by a bullet, pretending to have died and escaped.
The prosecutor demanded the death penalty for his murder, but the jury will decide whether Haskell should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.
According to the National Broadcasting Corporation in Houston, KPRC, during the trial, the defense argued that Haskell was mentally disturbed and heard voices that made him kill the six men. After reading the verdict on Thursday, he fell down.
According to TV, one of Haskell's defense lawyers, G. Dalham, said, "I think he might be severely punished as expected." "He realized that this was the most likely outcome."
The sentencing process starts on Monday. As Haskell's defense attorney Neil Davis III says, his team will try to "save him from dying." This is our job, according to KPRC.
According to television, the sentencing process is expected to last around two and a half weeks.
Cassidy testified in court, and all of them were family. According to KPRC, she seemed to be praying before the verdict was read on Thursday.
At the memorial service for the family in 2014, Cassidy thanked all sectors of society for their support and said that her parents, two brothers and two sisters were "in heaven, she was glad to see them again someday."
Haskell went to Star's house disguised as a FedEx express driver, apparently looking for his ex-wife, Katie Star's sister.
The police said he forced in and tied Cassidy. A few minutes later, when her family returned, Haskell tied them up and asked for information about the whereabouts of her ex-wife. They said they didn't know that they had all been shot in the back of the head.
Cassidy was injured and kept pretending to be dead until Haskell left and was able to identify him to the police. She told the police that he was planning to drive to her grandparents' house to kill them. But the police traced Haskell's whereabouts, and after 20 minutes of police pursuit and 3 hours of confrontation, he was arrested.
In view of the death rate in the United States, Scotland has banned fogging products and electronic tobacco advertising.
Ministers are considering banning advertising for electronic smoke and mist products.
The Chief Minister has confirmed that consultations on this initiative will take place “in the coming months”.
Nicolas Sturgen said that her Government would act “without hesitation” if there was evidence to support further action against the sale of such products.
At the same time, there were reports that two more deaths were caused by diseases associated with fogging products, with 11 deaths.
Fogification products (a mixture of nicotine, water, solvents and spices for consumption) are considered as substitutes for smoking and can help quit smoking, but their safety is not yet fully determined.
But in America, more than 500 people have developed a mysterious lung disease as a result of e-smoking. Officials say that hundreds of new cases have been reported in the past week alone.
On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, Florida and Georgia announced the first death cases. Currently, 38 states have recorded cases of this disease, 8 of which have deaths.
Although most patients reported the use of products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (a psychoactive compound in cannabis), patients who died in Georgia on Wednesday were reported to have only "absorbed a large amount of mist products".
More than 100 officials in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating the causes of this mysterious disease and warning citizens not to smoke electronic smoke products, especially those purchased on the streets or on the streets, until they have more information.
The Chief Minister confirmed that the Scottish Government was “closely” monitoring developments in the United States and elsewhere, following the death of fogized products.
She noted that, to date, they had not seen any deaths from fogging products reported in Europe.
She said, "We're cautious, so in Scotland we've adopted the strictest regulatory approach to fogized products in Europe."
"European Tobacco Products Directive limits the advertising of electronic cigarettes and ensures that electronic liquids do not contain known harmful ingredients.
"The directive also limits the concentration of nicotine in electronic smoke.
"In Scotland, we have also introduced retail registration and mandatory age certification schemes and have funded trade standards departments in all parliamentary areas to ensure that retailers comply.
“In the coming months, we will consult on a comprehensive ban on advertising and promotion of fogized products.”
She added, "It's important to stress that we all have to remember that these devices are relatively new products, so we're going to continue to study their impact. We don't fully understand what that effect is, so be very cautious.
"This may be one of the reasons why electronic smoke is not popular in Scotland.
“We continue to take all necessary steps, based on the best evidence, to ensure that potential harm to human beings is avoided.
"Although we have put in place the strictest regulatory regime for these products, if there is evidence that further action is needed we will not hesitate to do so."
Cambodian courts accused exiled politicians of rebellion.
A Cambodian court accused seven senior opposition party leaders of planning an armed rebellion, who planned to end their own exile and seek regime change through large-scale peaceful protests.
The Phnom Penh City Court also warned that anyone who supports the Cambodian opposition party ' s plan to overthrow the government would run the risk of long-term imprisonment.
If convicted, opposition leaders who ended their exile and returned home could be sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison, and their supporters could be sentenced to 5 to 10 years in prison. Citing Justice Ministry spokesman Qin Marin: Even attending a rally or expressing support online could be seen as conspiring to overthrow the government.
The political struggle has intensified since opposition leader Sanlancie announced plans to return to his country after more than three years of exile on November 9, in search of “restoration of democracy”, and Thursday's court accused him of launching the latest round of the political struggle.
November 9th marked Cambodia's Independence Day, when Cambodia was freed from French colonial rule in 1953.
Sanlancie said on Twitter earlier this week: “I will continue to call on the Cambodian people and armed forces to oppose the Hun Sen regime until the Hun Sen regime restores the opposition's right to participate in the political life of the country, including genuine elections”.
Last year, before the general election, the court dissolved Sananxi's opposition party in order to ensure that Hun Sen-sang continued to run a more authoritarian regime for 40 years.
The opposition party intended to launch a strong electoral challenge in July 2018, which was widely perceived as politically motivated, and the ruling Cambodian People ' s Party led by Hun Sen feared that it would lose power in the elections.
The Hun Sen government seems troubled by the planned return of the opposition leader, although the approach seems unrealistic, and Sanlancie calls for a large number of Cambodian workers in Thailand to return with him.
Officials vowed to arrest Sanlancie as soon as he arrived in Cambodia, but there were also speculations that Cambodia might simply prevent Sanlancie from entering, and that Sanlancie might be barred from boarding a plane to Cambodia if the airline was officially informed of the ban. The neighboring country is also unlikely to allow Sanlancie to enter Cambodia from their territory.
However, the Government has stepped up its arrest of supporters of Sanlancie, and there have been reports that opposition organizers have recently been physically assaulted.
At the end of 2015, Sanlancie was sentenced to two years in prison for criminal libel, and in order to avoid imprisonment, he went into exile. After that, the local government initiated other judicial proceedings against Sanlancie.
In late 2017, in a crackdown on all anti-Hunsen regimes, the co-founder of the opposition party, Gensoka, was arrested, and other high-ranking members of the party were exiled abroad. Genssoka was charged with treason for establishing ties with a pro-democracy organization in the United States and is currently under tight house arrest.
This year's Turner Prize placement will be displayed in Margate starting tomorrow, and the British deo will be on the agenda.
Oscar Murillo, a Colombian artist, paints a picture of people looking at the North Sea, but their vision of the North Sea and the continent across Europe is overshadowed by a black canvas that shows only a small fraction of the distance through a slant on the canvas.
This work is one of the four incarnations, an annual art award established in 1984 for artists who live in England or England but live elsewhere.
Féo Naperi, the discussant, explained that Murillo's work focused mainly on the current political and socio-economic situation in Britain. This group of paper-film people represents the globalized labour force, while black cloth represents "the dark moments of the British and even the global age".
She added, "I think it's a broader way of covering the horizon, but it's actually covering the view of any distant horizon. There's also the position of blocking the light. But I think there's still hope, there's a slash on the canvas, and you can see the sea on the horizon."
At the same time, Helen Kammock's video, A Long Note, explored the neglected role of women in the civil rights movement in Delhi/London, Northern Ireland, which started in 1968. It also covered the broader global class, race and gender struggle in the late 1960s.
All works will be displayed from September 28th to January 12th, 2020 at the Turner Contemporary Gallery in Magatet, and the 2019 Turner Laureate will be announced at the awards ceremony on December 3rd.
The award was named after the British 19th century viewer Joseph Mallard William Turner, who had reded Grayson Perry, Damien Hearst and Steve McQueen, director of the Twelve Years of Slavery.
Men confess to the details of kidnapping, torture and ill-treatment of plastic surgeons.
A man in Florida confessed to kidnapping a plastic surgeon and abused him with a blowtorch in extortion.
According to the Sun Sentry, 34-year-old Justin Bosio confessed to the abduction and conspiracy details of the January attack on a surgeon whose identity has not yet been made public.
Bosio's lawyer Kenneth Lange said that his client had been involved in the kidnapping at the instigation of his co-defendant, Serge Corrina, who was to be extradited from Tenerife Island, Spain.
According to the court documents, the surgeon was abducted and pushed into the van by a man armed when he left Wal-Mart's store. After several hours of torture, he returned to his car and became unconscious. The surveillance video filmed the incident. The investigator said that Corinner's wife was once a client of the surgeon.
The British Parliament refused to hold an early election for the second time.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has once again been frustrated in pushing for early elections in Britain.
The Speaker of the House of Commons said that according to the current regulations, it was not possible to vote before October 31 (the date of Britain's planned withdrawal from the EU).
This was the second parliamentary meeting since the Supreme Court ruled that the suspension of the general election was unlawful.
Meanwhile, the EU chief negotiator Michael Barnier said that the EU was still waiting for a new plan from the British side.
The United States sent troops to Saudi Arabia and deployed anti-aircraft systems to stop Iranian attacks
United States officials announced on Thursday that the United States was sending a patriot missile unit, four ground radar systems and 200 support units to Saudi Arabia to contain Iran ' s increasingly aggressive actions.
The Pentagon said that one Sad missile defence system and two other patriot missile units were ready if needed.
Jonathan Hoffmann, spokesperson for the Pentagon, said: “Other countries in the region have called attention to the situation in Iran, and we hope that they will contribute to international cooperation and strengthen Saudi Arabia's defence forces”.
Last week, US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said that more troops would be deployed to the Middle East as a “defensive” measure to help defend against attacks emanating from Iran.
Esper said that this deployment was the first step towards addressing Iran ' s growing violence in the region, including this month ' s drone strikes on Saudi Arabian oil installations, and he called on other countries to step up their actions and condemn those attacks.
The Iranian-backed Yemeni Al-Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for attacking the world's largest oil processing plant and an important oil field on September 14, but the United States and Saudi Arabia directly condemned Iran. Iran denied any involvement in the attack.
"It is clear that the weapon used was produced by Iran and not fired from Yemen", Esper said on Friday that he pointed out that all signs indicated that "Iran was responsible for this attack".
The purpose of deploying troops and resources is to send a clear message that the United States supports our partners and to provide "free flow of resources," Esper said.
The Secretary of State said that the United States called on other countries to also “stand up and condemn attacks” and contribute.
Megan Markle's "never invited" back to "Golden Bar."
Alan Korse, the founder of the Golden Bar, said that she had “never invited” the Duchess of Sussex of England, Megan Markle, to return to the play, and in the big ending, she was a part of Rachel Zann.
After the big ending of "Golden Lawyer" was aired in the United States, Korse was asked during an interview with the United States News Front in Hollywood whether it was "possibly possible" to invite this former resident actor to "accompaniment" in the big ending.
"Now that we've finished shooting the big ending, I can tell you," Korse replied.
"I thought about inviting her, and I thought about using audio material, which we have to think about, but in the end I didn't say anything because I thought, "I want to respect her new life, I can't put her in a position where she has to be invited."
"We decided not to put her in that position, so I never spoke."
The Duchess of Sussex appeared in Montage's image at the end of the Golden Bar.
From 2011, Megan played Rachel Zane in this New York-based political play until the last episode of her performance last year.
In her final season, Rachel's screen husband Mike Ross visited her from Seattle and was asked how she was.
"If I told you how well she was, you wouldn't believe me," he said.
Beetle bulldogs died of snake bites to protect Florida boys.
A man in Florida said that the eight-month-old Beet Bulldog Zeus had been bitten to death by snakes to protect several of his sons.
Gary Richardson told WOFL TV that his family lived in Samt County, Florida, and that several of his sons crawled with them on Monday as they washed Zeus' water plate outside the house. Richardson said the children didn't see snakes, but the dogs saw them and attacked them.
According to Richardson, the snake bit Zeus four times. Although Zeus was sent to the veterinarian's office at the speed of fire, he died the day after the attack.
Germany reported a marked case of West Nile virus.
Authorities have reported the first case of a West Nile virus transmitted through mosquitoes in Germany, and it is clear that climate change has accelerated the spread of the virus.
The German National Center for Disease Control and Tropical Medicine indicated on Friday that the patient had developed encephalitis, but had recovered after treatment at the hospital.
The West Nile virus originated in Africa, but was transmitted northward through migratory birds and mosquitoes. In recent years, southern and central Europe has erupted several times. Most parts of the United States have confirmed cases.
Jonas Schmitt Chanassit of the Bernhard Nokt Institute of Tropical Medicine, Germany, said: "According to climate change, summer fever has clearly accelerated the spread of the West Nile virus north of the Alps in the last two years."
Less than 1% of the patients infected with the virus are exposed to dangerous meningitis or encephalitis.
After prostate cancer surgery, she skips radiation therapy and works well.
A major study found that men undergoing prostate cancer surgery were in good condition without radiation treatment.
The examination of patients undergoing surgical treatment, the largest experiment to date, may have saved thousands of patients from suffering treatment, which may have painful side effects.
The Royal Masden Hospital conducted a study of 1,400 men who received prostate cancer treatment.
Half of the patients received immediate radiotherapy, which has been the standard treatment for preventing the recurrence of the disease so far. Monitoring the rest of the patients is done only when there are signs of a relapse.
Five years later, scientists found that there was little difference in the rate of relapse of the two groups of patients and that the situation of those who did not receive radiotherapy was slightly better.
The survival rate of the non-progressive group is 85%, and the standard care group is 88%.
Due to other factors, the data were adjusted and the difference between the two sets was about 1%.
This study, funded by the British Cancer Research Centre, found that urinary incontinence is twice as likely to deteriorate for patients receiving radiotherapy treatment as for patients without radiation treatment, and that urinary incontinence is one of the main side effects of prostate cancer treatment.
In the year following surgery, 5.3% of patients who received radiotherapy deteriorated, while only 2.7% of patients who received standard care deteriorated.
Radio claims that Seth Danlap, the WWL radio host in Louisiana, threatened to sue for anti-homosexual tweets, but the tweets were sent by him, just like in the case of Josie Smolit.
A radio host in New Orleans said he had received an anti-gay defamatory tweet from the station's Twitter account. The WWL host, Seth Danrap, was an open homosexual, who said on Wednesday that he intended to sue the radio parent company because he had been working in a gay and hostile environment for many years. On Thursday, there was a strange reversal of events, and the New Orleans police said that Danlap had received threatening tweets not from elsewhere, but from Dunlap's cell phone.
The controversial tweet was sent out at the beginning of this month, and on the day that it was sent, Danrap also conducted his own program as usual. According to the report of the WWL-TV under the banner of the Colombian Broadcasting Corporation, he announced his leave the day after the tweet was sent.
Danlap said in a statement that 14 people had access to the WWL Twitter account. He claimed that he was not the only one using the account.
And his lawyer Megan Keeford said that he decided to take part in the polygraph so as to dispel the speculation that he himself was the promoter. According to WWL-TV, Danlap has not filed a suit, but he said in his statement that he would start soon.
WWL Radio is part of the Colombian Broadcasting Corporation news station, but it spreads it all, and WWL Radio stated in a statement that it had opened an investigation into the tweet and decided to refer it to law enforcement officials. WWL Radio stated in a statement that “WWL has completed an investigation into this extremely offensive and unauthorized tweet sent by its Twitter account on September 10, which directly terrorized and defamed Seth Dunlap”.
"We believe that the most appropriate next step is to leave it to the law enforcement authorities. The current investigation is being conducted by the law enforcement authorities, and we cannot comment more on the specifics of the results of the investigation." WWL said so in the statement.
The New Orleans police department made public their investigation into the tweet, and in Thursday's police report, the story turned: the cynic and defamatory tweet was allegedly sent from Danlap's private mobile phone.
The radio host, Seth Danlap, once said that he had worked in a horrifying and hostile environment for many years. After claiming to have received anti-combined slander tweets from the radio Twitter account, he threatened to sue.
According to NOLA.com, WWL accused Danlap of threatening the radio for money only. WWL alleged that the 35-year-old radio host said he would follow up on the tweets and demanded compensation of over $1.8 million. According to the police report received by NOLA.com, WWL stated that Danlap was facing personal financial problems when he threatened to prosecute.
The charges were filed by Kevin Cassidy, the senior vice president of WWL, and his parent company, the lawyer who disseminated them. The police department is still trying to confirm the charges, but has classified the case as potentially extortion. Louisiana defines extortion as “a threatening message to others in order to get anything valuable”.
Viola Davis plays Michelle Obama in First Lady.
Viola Davis said that she was "strained" by the role of Michelle Obama in the latest television series.
The 54-year-old actress talked about Michelle Obama in the series of "First Lady" plays on Thursday at Jimmy's chicken hair show!
Davis said she had seen Michelle Obama, but wondered if the former First Lady knew about her role.
"I'm nervous. I'm very nervous." Davis says, "I don't care what else I've done in my life -- I've got the Aimee Award, the Oscar Award, twice the Tony Award -- but if I screw up this time, the impact on my life will be huge."
And she said, in the form of a joke, "like, "You raised a really great child, but you fucked Michelle Obama up."
Davis said, however, that she had confidence in the script of Aaron Couli. Davis and Couli will also be the executive producers of the show.
"I promise, this script is great," Davis says, "Listen, I don't want to drive my people crazy."
In First Ladies, we will discuss the political and personal life of the first husband in American history. The first quarter will focus on Eleanor Roosevelt, Betty Ford and Michelle Obama.
In addition to the First Lady, Davis will be reunited with Denzel Washington in the web-drawn "Rani's Mother's Black Ass Dance" and Danzer Wassing co-directed with him in "Spill Out of Adversity" and "Fence. "
"I had to wear a big suit," Davis said to the host, "I love the suit. I told them I wanted to be very, very big. I wanted to look mature."
Davis played Analis Keating in the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) series, Impunity, which started the sixth and last season on Thursday.
Death of Mike Miller: third man charged with drug trafficking
A third man has been arrested and charged with drug trafficking, linked to the death of a rapper, Mike Miller, who overdosed his medication.
Steven Walter is suspected of selling fake oxycodone pills with fentanyl. Miller died accidentally last year as a result of overdoses of cocaine, alcohol and powerful opioids. He held fentanyl before he died.
Walter was accused of being the drug source for another man, Cameron Petit, who sold the drug to Miller.
In the current year, 36-year-old Ryan Reavis was arrested this week in the city of Lake Havasu, Arizona, accused of being Walter's “legged man”, who handed over drugs to Petit.
Walter was released from custody for a drug case in 2005 and is currently in detention.
Miller was a Pittsburgh man, his real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick. Miller openly discussed his depression and drug addiction in his lyrics, which won him some big card fans at hip-hop.
His two-year relationship with Eleanor Grande also ended at the beginning of 2018. After Miller's death, Eleanor posted on her photo wall page a video that was full of love and launched a song, "Thank you, next," which was full of love to Miller.
In recent years, Miller was one of the musicians who died of opioid drug abuse and overdose throughout the country.
Prince died in 2016 when he took fake drugs containing fentanyl, which looked like a copy of the painkiller Vicodin.
In 2016, Matthew Roberts, the guitarist of the three fallback bands, also died from overdoses and contained Fentani and hydrogencodone in his body.
Women don't hang around Wal-Mart to prove their innocence.
In a Wal-Mart supermarket in Mexico City, a woman accused of shoplifting used extreme means to prove her innocence, and she stood in the supermarket naked and made supermarket security stunned.
Earlier this week, Mexico City's Tepeak Wal-Mart store filmed the scene when a supermarket security guard was heading towards the woman suspected of theft and she was approaching the supermarket exit. However, when she was stopped, her reaction left the security guard speechless.
The woman took off her dress first and then started going to the exit, but she might still feel sorry for herself and quickly turned around and took off her shirt. She took off without hanging and took her clothes in her hand and ran away from the supermarket.
The identity of this naked shopkeeper is still unknown, but it appears that after improvising this strip show, the shopkeeper allowed her to leave the shop.
Wal-Mart's weird story of this kind has come as a surprise. In July, in a Wal-Mart supermarket in Simephrin, a woman from Pennsylvania was caught by a surveillance camera firing a potato box. The woman in this video was clearly drunk and charged with public indecent assault, public drunkenness, vandalism and disturbing public order, and quickly reded out.
This week, another Englishman, Steve Whitehurst, was forced to appear naked at the supermarket because the supermarket found that he had an unknown "bulb" on his pants, so he had to expose himself to the security guard. It turns out he didn't steal anything.
"I was born this way, and I couldn't help it," Whitehurst told Sun.
The West Bengal government plans to set up a museum at the residence of Iswa Chandra Vidiasaga.
Calcutta:
The West Bengal government plans to set up a museum in North Kolkata, the 19th century social reformer Iswa Chandra Vidiasaga, where he spent the last few years of his life, as State Minister Pata Chatage said.
On Thursday, he said that the museum would be built inside the residence of Vidia Saga in Badur Bagan, and that photographs and models would be displayed documenting Vidia Saga's life, covering the period from his birth in the village of Bir Singhpur, Paschim Medipur district, to his relocation to his residence in northern Calcutta.
To celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of this educational and social reformer, Chatage, who is the Minister of Education, said this at an event following the inauguration of the Vidia Saga College in Badur Bargan residence.
The Minister also published two books at the event: Ahmad Vidiasaga and Chotod Vidiasaga.
Some of the items that Vidia Saga used will be removed from the dusty storage room and placed in the museum for public visit.
He said it would help the current generation to understand the celebrity, who had waged a war against the oppression of women and encouraged widows to remarry.
Mr. Chatage said that the Ministry of School Education and Higher Education would organize seminars during a year-long event focusing on the life and work of Vidiasaga in schools and colleges.
Citing other activities to be undertaken by the Academy, Mr. Chatage said that an unknown book book by Vidiasaga would be published to date.
Chief Minister Mamatta Bannaki recently announced that Vidia Sagar would be built into an educational tourism centre at his birthplace in Birsinghapur village.
On Thursday, Vidia Saga College set up the Vidia Saga bronze statue.
"Those who oppose the social reform of Vidia Saaga have destroyed their semi-mural, which stands in a college named after them," said the Minister.
In May, during a road show by Amit Shah, Chairman of the Indian People ' s Party, the image of the social reformer was destroyed.

The figure is for guests and winners.
The first-class winner of the primary and secondary school group, Guo Lina, said that as an overseas Chinese, he had the opportunity to express the feelings of "China in the Heart" and win the award through an ancestral text.
The host said that the competition not only created a positive atmosphere for China-China relations, but also attracted a growing number of Cambodian students to learn Chinese and study abroad in China.
The report published by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 26 September states that Iran has begun to use advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, further violating the nuclear agreement reached with the world ' s major powers in 2015.
The IAEA report states that the advanced centrifuges at Iran's Natanz Nuclear Facility are "accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium".
Since United States President Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement last May and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the 2015 nuclear agreement with the major Powers.
The agreement stipulated that Iran could only refine uranium with the first generation of IR-1 centrifuges.
The other signatories of the agreement, the United Kingdom, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to save the agreement, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
According to the Japan Common News Agency, in the afternoon of 25 local time, Japanese Foreign Minister Moo-mi-min held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York, where he visited, confirming that he would advance the conclusion of peace treaty negotiations covering the four northern islands (the disputed islands of Japan and Russia, known as the "4 northern islands", and Russia as the "South Korean islands") territorial issues, developing relations between the two countries in a wide range of political, economic and other areas, and agreeing to coordinate the early visit of the two sides to Russia.
This was the first consultation with Russia as head of the peace treaty conclusion negotiations since Shigeki took office as Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Maori said to the Russian side, "It includes the promotion of common economic activity (in the four northern islands) in the hope that consultations will actually take place".
According to the Japanese Government, the talks did not discuss the Territory in detail.
At the December 2018 summit meeting of the Russian Federation, it was confirmed that the foreign ministers of the two countries, as heads of department, should accelerate the negotiations.
During this meeting, the Foreign Ministers of the two countries welcomed the progress made in the consultations on joint economic activities in the areas of tourism and waste disposal.
Shigeki said he looked forward to the tourism pilot operation scheduled for October: "I hope it will be successfully implemented and will lead to the next step."
In addition, the meeting confirmed the November visit of Lavrov to coincide with the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Group of Twenty (G20) in Nagoya.
Tujonettoa was elected as the new Prime Minister of Tonga.
Nuku'alofa news: On 27th, the Tongan Parliament of the South Pacific Island State elected the current Minister of Finance and National Planning, Pochiwa Tuionetaa, as Tonga's new Prime Minister, replacing former Prime Minister Akilisi Bohiva, who died of illness earlier this month.

The next Tongan parliamentary elections will be held in 2021.
The women's platoon is expected to defend the World Cup early!
On 27th, in the competition against the Dutch women's platoon, the Chinese team was brought back to the city by the opponent after winning two games in a row, and eventually won nine in a row with 3:1 Lek Holland.
The game of the World Cup is nearing its end, but the Chinese women's platoon must remain unmindful in the face of the Serbian team, even though the crown is in sight.
In the first two rounds of the competition with the Netherlands, Chinese women's platoons performed as strong as ever. They went down two cities at 25:19, 25:16, until the third round, when the team suffered a setback.
The Dutch women's platoon has increased the aggressiveness of the serve while falling behind, and the Chinese team has been hit, and the girls' aggressive intentions and mistakes have begun to increase, leading to the return of the enemy to a city at 21:25.
In an interview with Xijiang Ping, he also said: "The third round, we sent about eight points because of the mistake."
Of course, the Dutch women's platoon could not have been less powerful, and the Chinese women's platoon had made difficult preparations before the race. Although they lost a game, everything was still under the control of Longping. "It's normal to win or lose a fight with a strong team, and it's normal to win, so we said to the players to focus," he said.
In the fourth round, the players actively adjusted their status, Zhang Changning opened fire at the attack, received eight points in the single round, and did a great job in winning the team.
To date, the 11 rounds of confrontation have left only two rounds, and while one hand has touched the championship, the Chinese women's platoon has indeed sounded a wake-up call in the competition against the Dutch team: the more critical it is, the harder it will be.
In another game on 27th, the Russian and American women's platoons were full of five games, and the United States team failed to score all three points from their rivals, so that Chinese women's platoons could win the coronation once and for all in the match with Serbia.
All things are moving towards a situation favourable to Chinese women ' s platoons.
However, while the Serbian team's six major powers are outnumbered, this does not mean that they will give three points to the Chinese team easily.
In the form of the current scoreboard, the Serbian team has basically lost its medal, which means that they can "lit up" in the competition against Chinese women's platoons, drop their loads and hit their opponents with full force, while the Chinese team is under pressure to win, and the state is likely to rise and fall.
Moreover, the substitute Serbian team was not the lamb of "no one to slaughter", as shown by the depth of its thickness when it was finally reversed by the Serbian 2nd team at 3:2 during the 5th round of the war with the Dutch team.
During the third phase of the game, Luang Ping also said that both Huo and Sai teams would be hard to deal with: "The match in Osaka will be very difficult, and we have to prepare carefully, as always."
Now that the horn of the coronation has been blown, the game has really entered the "white heat stage".
In terms of strength, Chinese women are above their rivals, but only at the last hour, and it is up to the girls to be able to play their normal level and release themselves in the race.
On this (27) day, the University of Macao organized the "Second Macao Green Cell Seminar", which attracted more than 100 experts from countries and regions such as the United States, Singapore, the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao in the field of research on "offer stem cells" to share and explore the latest technologies and developments in stem cell research with teachers and students at the University of Macao.
The Vice-Chancellor (Research) of Australasia said that stem cell research was of medical value and was one of the major research projects in Australasia. It was a seminar that helped to advance research and development in the field of stem cells in Macao.
Gwen said that Australasia, as a leading internationalized comprehensive university in the West Bank in Hong Kong, Australia and the Gulf, was working to build a training base and a science, technology and innovation centre for West Bank talent development in the Great Bay region and to contribute to innovation development in the Gulf region.
The seminar brought together experts in stem cell research, both within and outside the sea, to share the latest technology, which will help to promote stem cell research and development in Macao.
The Director of the Australian Institute of Health Sciences, Deng Xiaoxia, said that Australia had in recent years continued to strengthen scientific innovation and transformation and had significantly increased the number and quality of the papers, and that Australia had also achieved fruitful results in stem cell research.
At the conference, a group of eminent scholars shared cutting-edge knowledge and cutting-edge technology in stem cell research.
The Chinese Academy of Sciences and Dean of the Pulse Transformation Medical School at Yunnan Kunming University of Technology explained the process of studying the outside of monkeys and human embryos using the 3D culture system and its molecular mechanisms; the Shanghai Institute of Biochemical Cells Researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences described the temporal and spatial changes in the decisions and organization of the cell spectrometry department after the embryos in mice from single cells and molecular standards; and Professor Wang Yung of Pennsylvania State University showed how biomaterial hydrocelebrics can be used to simulate stem cell nests for survival
The Vice-Dean (Research) of the Australian College of Health Sciences, Seo-in and Assistant Dean Chen Kuo-kay and Associate Professor Wang Chun-ming of the Australasia Chinese Institute of Medicine also presented their most recent and important results, respectively.
The second Macao stem cell seminar was hosted by the Macao University School of Health Sciences and co-sponsored by the Macao University Chinese Institute of Medicine and the Macao University of Science and Technology National Priority Laboratory for Quality Studies, with the participation of Chen Zhouan, Acting Senior Manager of the Macao Science and Technology Development Fund.
The seminar consisted of 11 academic reports on embryo development and organization, conversion medicine, stem cell research and conversion applications, biological materials and applications.

Stoltenberg, speaking at the West Point military school in the United States, said: "For 70 years, NATO has adopted containment and defense measures based on preserving technical superiority."
He said, but the times are changing.
Stoltenberg said, "The competition we're encountering is getting stronger.
So now we should redouble our efforts in order to be sure that no one will outpace us."
He said, "Some new technologies have not been developed by NATO member states, but in authoritarian states.
Chinese companies are studying the 5G network.
Russia is developing an independent Internet and investing heavily in the development of the next generation of weapons, such as supersonic missiles."
Stoltenberg said that the future security of NATO "depends on the ability to understand, accept and apply state-of-the-art technology".
On September 24, "a boat ticket to show me "a charity aid event was held on the head of Changsha Orange. More than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to the Orange Star Cruise, to enjoy the great winds of Xiangjiang and to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China together.
Most of the more than 100 persons with disabilities who attended the event were boarded the cruise ship for the first time.
Zhao Zhengang, 56 years old, is a crippled person and usually rarely leaves because his feet are not easy to move.
He said, "For the first time today, travelling on a cruise ship to appreciate the magnificence of the Yangtze River at close range, feeling the development pulse of Changsha, feeling very excited and unforgettable."
Volunteers from the Fukukang Social Work Centre and the Blue Sky Rescue Team in Changsha City provided detailed and modest services to persons with disabilities.
Especially for clients with severe physical disabilities, volunteers will carry them up and down the liner.
According to the relevant head of the Fukuk Social Work Service Centre, the cause of persons with disabilities in Changsha City has continued to evolve over the past 70 years with the support of the Party and the Government, and an increasing number of persons with disabilities have become real participants, contributors and beneficiaries in socio-economic development. Care for persons with disabilities, care for persons with disabilities and support for the cause of persons with disabilities have also gradually become a social consensus.
The republic is about to celebrate its seventy-fifth anniversary, and the spotlights of the media on all roads are flashing, making many images that we don't remember at all, sparkling light -- they are the ones who bring heat and light to our bright days, silk glitters...
However, if a hero walks around, it looks like you're just like me.
Yuan Longping, a deep-seated rice research project, has produced good seeds to spread throughout the world, leaving one billion people at risk of starvation, and has done nothing wrong. It is also like an old farmer who likes to be in the fields. Nan In-dong, the chief scientist of China's sky-eyes, a man, a man, a man, a man, a man, a pot, who spends his whole life doing one thing, chewing cold brooms in the deep mountains of Guizhou, and an old man in the castle. Zhou Shachang, a
They, begging for Indrés, live in plain, simple and obstinate ways, so long as they immerse themselves in their own cause, it is easy for them to rejoice, not to care about their names, or to be rich and prosperous.
Like Kim Yuen's novel, Shaolin Temple's Shizuku monk has no joys and no sorrows, despite the horror of the world's martial arts.
Every "scavenging monk", every red son's heart, has a share behind his back of his own country.
Our country takes responsibility, not only on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the hearts and minds of hundreds of millions of people.
Once upon a time, a girl in high school was turned crazy by her Internet friend, "When a hero walks by, someone has to sit on the side of the road and applaud... and I don't want to be a hero, I want to be a guy sitting on the side of the road."
Actually, there's no contradiction between being a hero and being a hero.
The people who applaud on the side of the road are also passing heat and light, and they are also glowing bodies.
As you are me, there are opportunities in life, and there are moments, and there is a build-up of men and women, who are also shaping heroes.
Su Bae-hwa, a fine Shanghai judge, shouldered the burden of judicial reform, sent the messenger teacher to tell his story at the annual meeting, received and sent numerous newspaper letters a year, never wrong, "get the simple thing done, it's not easy," and Zau Bae-hwa led the judges to give a round of applause to this old "scrubbing monk" message.
It's between heroes, a hero applauding another hero.
Qing Yi has a stage and Zhou Chang has a platform to be a hero, not only on his own, but also on the basis of a better environment and positive incentives.
China SkyEye, for example, seems to be a myth now.
In the 1990s, China ' s scientific and technological community was still struggling to climb the slope, and the novelist Liu Xiahin has yet to write "The Three Bodies".
The greatest "eye" at that time was the single-gauge radio telescope in Puerto Rico's valley in the United States – Arecibo, 350 metres in diameter – considered to be the largest in a world that was “unbeyond”.
The Chinese radio telescope at that time was less than one tenth in diameter.
But Nan Indong, who enjoys world-class scientific research conditions and salaries in Japan, insists on returning home, bringing back an almost insane idea: building a new generation of radio "big telescopes" in China to receive more messages from outer space!
China wants to spend a lot of money to play with the stars?
The motherland trusted Nan In-dong, and the "Eye of Heaven" project began.
It took 12 years to select the site, and it was 9 years since the project was created.
The 500-metre SkyEye opened, and China became an unprecedented "unique scientific engineering in the world".
So, SkyEye is great, the Nan Indongs are great, and the Republic with tolerance is great, standing up high and far away.
With the trust of the nation and the goodwill of its citizens, the Nan Indongs have the opportunity to become the people of the country.
It's nice and harmonious for a country with young talent and white-haired hero to walk by, and for people to applaud lightly on the side of the road.
Garbage classification education first went to Jilin Kindergarten, and the idea of environmental protection began with the doll.
On 27th, a kindergarten in Gilling City, Jilin Province, conducted a garbage classification education class to teach young children how to identify recyclable waste and other types of waste.
It is known that this is the first time that garbage is classified into local early childhood education classes.
A programme of work to promote the classification and disposal of waste in urban life at the local level in Jilin province was launched jointly by the nine departments of Jilin province.
In 2019, on the basis of the pilot compulsory classification of household waste in Changchun City, the province decided to carry out the classification of household waste in local cities.
Gilling City is one of them.
Through this event, we hope to achieve the effects of a young child-led family, a kindergarten-led society, and the promotion of environmental values.
The executive director of the Fong Children ' s International Kindergarten said that the event had been organized.
On the same day, the head of the park read out an environmental initiative, hoping that garbage would start with the children.
After performing the low carbon bell dance, the children grouped up and made a little game of garbage sorting.
The tutor also issued the "Recoverable" "Other Garbage" label and advised the children to stick the label on the trash bin and make small videos when they returned home.
Liu Lilong reported that the kindergarten has been promoting low carbon, green and environmental concepts and regularly runs environmental syllabi.
Classifiable trash cans are also set up at the dump site in the park, where the type of drop is indicated.
Teacher taught the kids what recycling garbage is.
According to preliminary statistics, in 2018, Jilin Province generated approximately 54652 tons of municipal waste, all entering the waste disposal yard for disposal.
Of this total, 32.92 million tonnes were sanitaryly landfilled, 2,092 million tonnes were burned, and 80.1 million tonnes were treated using integrated processes.
After years of effort, all municipalities and counties of the province have the capacity to treat household waste without harm.
In the programme of work to promote the classification and disposal of waste in urban life at the local level in Jilin province, which has been published, it is explicitly requested that activities such as garbage sorting into schools, materials, classes, etc., enhance interaction between students and parents through the creation of garbage sorting songs, songs, cartoons, microvideos, etc., with the effect of “teaching a child, influencing a family, driving a community, nurturing a new generation”.
According to data released on September 27th by Maedeta, the global volume of sales in August was 117,015 vehicles.
The sales volume in China fell by 21% due to the impact of the underinvestment of new cars and the reduction in prices.
Japan's domestic sales fell by 6%, and the demand for the last bus before the consumption tax increase in October was limited.
Majuda sold 17729 in China in August.
August 2018 was also 13% lower than the previous year, and sales continued to decline.
China 's dedicated main SUV "CX-4" sales decreased by 14%.
“CX-4” has been on the market for a long time since 2016, and the effect of new cars has declined.
Reductions in prices as a result of strategies to raise brand values from a long-term perspective are also known to have a significant impact on sales.
Majeta's sales in the United States grew by 7% on a year-on-year basis, reaching 27482 and growing 14 months later.
In August, the seller's business days were one more day than in the previous year, coupled with “enhancement of promotional activities such as publicity” (Majeda), which led to an increase in sales such as SUV “CX-5”.
Japanese domestic sales fell by 6% to 14422.
According to the company, the emergency purchase before the tax increase "was not as high as in the last time (2014) " .
The sales of small cars like "Demio".
The death of Chirac and the perpetuation of the political legacy.
On 26 local time, former French President Chirac died and was 86 years old.
At a time when the world is in the midst of a century of great change, the many political legacies left by the French politician when he came to power in that year are still worthy of our praise.
Chirac was President of France for 12 years in a very personal way.
He has inherited the diplomatic spirit of de Gaulleism and independence and has firmly supported European integration, representing the pursuit of the European Dream.
At the same time, he strongly advocated the multipolarization and multilateralism of the world and was a strategic statesman.
That is why the French media assessed him as "France's outstanding representative on the world stage".
One of the promising political decisions of Chirac is to oppose the United States-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France, together with Germany, stood up to the pressure of the United States and was at the forefront of the fight against the war.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to increased terrorist activity and make the world even more dangerous.
Later on, it turns out that Chirac's warning was quite correct.
At a time when European integration is strangling and unilateralism in the United States is gaining prominence, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices about international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly highly instructive.
Chirac is also a French politician who is familiar and friendly to Chinese.
He was one of the protagonists and creators of the Golden Decade of Chinese-French relations, which, after being elected President of France for the first time in 1995, was rapidly developing with the strategic vision of politicians.
In 2004, China established a comprehensive strategic partnership and China entered into a completely new phase of bilateral contacts.
During Chirac ' s administration, China and France experienced rapid growth in their bilateral trade, and cooperation between the two countries in various fields, such as aviation, nuclear energy and rail transport, made breakthrough progress.
The Chinese culture year of the Chirac initiative created a completely new cultural exchange model in the history of Chinese law.
Sheilak was particularly impressed with Chinese culture throughout his life.
It is known to his Chinese diplomat that Chirac can carry on some of Li Bai and Dupu's poems and even accurately judge the history of China's bronze apparatus.
"Don't look at the pyramids as if they've actually been to Egypt, and don't look at Qin as if they've actually been to China" – this gold phrase comes from Chirac.
In an interview with a Xinhua news agency journalist, Chirac said: "The West is concerned about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth, and China's political status at the international level.
But I have confidence in China myself.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is enough to help it build ideas and values for harmonious development, and it has long shouldered its responsibilities on the world stage.”
I also believe that China ' s revival will bring new creative vitality to the world culture and enrich it.
The people have gone, but the political legacy and inspiration that Chirac left to the world will survive.
The "Seventh China Computer Society Large Data Academic Conference" was unveiled in Wuhan 27 on the theme "Tenth China's Computer Society Big Data Academic Conference", and nearly a thousand expert scholars and industry leaders in the field of big data research focused on big data hotspot research issues, interpreting the technological processes of big data in the age of artificial intelligence.
The Congress was hosted by the Chinese Computer Society (CCF) and co-hosted by the CCF Committee of Experts on Big Data and the Chinese University of Technology. It organized five invited and 188 forum reports. It established 33 thematic technical and industry sub-forums to exchange and discuss research findings in the basic theory of big data, big data education, big data visualization, big data finance and technology, respectively.
With the aim of strengthening contacts and exchanges between national and international scholars working in the big data field, promoting multidisciplinary cross-integration and the development of the big data industry, the CDF Major Data Academic Conference has evolved over seven sessions into one of the largest data academic conferences focusing on exchange of scientific research results and the most influential in the country, and its content has expanded to such areas as basic theory and technology applications.
Members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region co-sponsored the anti-American Hong Kong Bill.
A co-sponsorship statement issued on 27th by some formed members of the Legislative Council of the HKSAR expressed strong opposition to the adoption of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 by the Foreign Affairs Committees of both Houses of Congress of the United States Congress.
This statement, co-sponsored by 40 formed members of Parliament, states that Hong Kong's rights are currently conferred by the Basic Law of the HKSAR, including the maintenance of the status of free trade ports and separate customs areas, and the conclusion and implementation of bilateral and multilateral agreements in different areas of economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports in the name of “Hong Kong, China” with different countries and regions of the world.
These rights are not exercised by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always strictly adhered to international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, engaged in business with different countries and regions, and engaged in cooperation in a wide range of related fields.
The statement stated that the adoption of the relevant bill by the Foreign Affairs Committees of the United States Congress and the House of Representatives was not necessary, but merely to respond to the call of its agents in Hong Kong, as a means of grossly interfering in Hong Kong ' s internal affairs and securing political leverage for its agents in Hong Kong.
The formed council members deeply regret and strongly object to this move by the United States.
The statement states that Hong Kong is an important trading partner and the largest source of trade surplus for the United States.
Hong Kong ' s excellent rule of law, fair and free business environment, and a clean society make it a good place for American businessmen to run business.
If the United States were to pass this bill, it would make China-United States relations worse than Hong Kong and the United States itself, without any benefit or harm to others.
The statement states that Hong Kong will continue to enjoy the rights conferred by the Basic Law and effectively fulfil its obligations by implementing the “One Country, Two Systems” approach as always and unswervingly.
Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and to international trade and commerce, whether in the past, now or in the future.
According to the 26th of the European Times, the two chambers of the French Parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week.
French President Markron recently stated in this regard that France cannot “take everyone” but at the same time try to “take everyone properly”.
It was reported that Markron tried to find a compromise route in immigration matters and to mitigate the impact of the upcoming debate.
In a recent interview in New York, during the general debate of the General Assembly, Markron expressed the hope that there would be a real “two-pronged” approach to immigration policy, seeking a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Markron said, "If France wants to be well received (immigrants), it can't accept everyone."
Markron identified four priorities of immigration policy: granting asylum status to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; promoting the integration of immigrants more efficiently; receiving and protecting all migrants entering French territory; and more efficiently resettling those who illegally enter France and are not fit to stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the AME system is one of the most discussed topics in the past.
Markron said he wanted to be able to “assess” the system, but not to cancel it, but to limit it to certain limits.
After Markron made this statement, Le Pompand, the leader of the far right “National Union”, wrote that Markron's expression was “empty talk”.
The President of the Senate, Rasher, a member of the right Republican party, also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a “moderated” but “face to reality” manner, indirectly criticizing Markron.
The leftist Socialist Congressman Valau believes that France should “take more and better” on immigration and criticize Markron for “wiping up” the subject.
Reports indicate that the new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act, which has been promulgated for one year, has led to differences of opinion within the ruling party, without at the same time being able to appease the right-wing opposition party.
In the next general election in 2022, immigration policy issues will again be the focus of far right attacks, and Markron will need to make a difference on this issue, but will also run the risk of enraged leftists within the ruling party.
It was reported that immigration policy would be debated in the lower house of the French National Assembly on 30 September and in the Senate on 2 October.
There are indications that China's A shares are on a "backload" and that many listed companies have come up with "real gold and silver" to buy back company shares.
According to statistics on Eastern wealth of financial data service providers, the total amount of repurchase and implementation of A shares on the market in 2019 was more than 100 billion yuan (RMB, bottom of the list), well above the data for the same period in previous years, creating a record high in the volume of repurchase capital of A shares.
In response, Xuyang, Chairman of McCorin Information Consulting Limited, Shanghai, said that the overall value of the A share market this year was low, buying back shares at relatively low prices, and that it would help listed companies to improve the efficiency of the use of funds, as well as reflect the willingness of listed companies to manage market value markets voluntarily and their cash flow plentiful, and help boost investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the stock buyback system has also encouraged listed companies to actively engage in stock buyback.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued implementing regulations for repurchase of shares by listed companies, which provided detailed regulations and guidelines for repurchase of shares by listed companies.
Also according to media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented an increased buy-back programme have concentrated on the capital sector, the real estate sector, the information technology industry and the electronic equipment manufacturing industry.
In addition, according to the repurchase payments, six listed companies have repurchased more than 1 billion yuan this year.
Among them, the first is the Ily shares, which buy back more than 5 billion yuan.
What is the impact of stock buybacks by listed companies on the market?
In an interview with a Chinese News Agency journalist, Zhao Saijun, Vice-President of the Finance and Finance Academy of the Chinese People ' s University, said that repurchases showed, on the one hand, that listed companies had greater economic strength and better financial position, were able to maintain stable stock prices and give investors confidence, and, on the other hand, that listed companies and their controlling shareholders were responsible to companies, to markets and to investors.
The former is based on the good business performance of the company, while the latter requires a higher quality for listed companies and their controlling shareholders.
For capital markets, these are the most central building blocks.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies helps to boost investor confidence and has a supportive effect on the stock prices of listed companies.
Also according to the Eastern Securities Research report, based on the expected stock buybacks from A stock listing companies as a whole since the beginning of this year, and the average value of the stock that has been repurchased, it is expected that the incremental capital generated by A stock buying this year will reach 150 billion yuan.
During the last two months, the national focal point for human rights protection announced the closure of the 26th day of the restoration of the Queens after Heaven's Sacred Map of the Queen's Palace, which will be reopened during this year's National Day.
The Qur'an Map is a large traditional mural that comprehensively reflects Mother's life.
With the approval of the relevant State authorities, it was drawn by the Director of the former Tianjin Civic Museum (the Queen's Palace) from 1991 to 1994.
It is known that the mural was painted on the south and north walls of the Queen's Palace, 32 metres long and 2.6 metres tall, with two parts up and down, with more than 30 stories of the birth of the Queen, the sea by sea, the feathers and the sky, and 358 people rediscovering the life of their mother.
Chai Chang-kyu explained that in recent years, Tianjin's summer season was heavy and the winter was dry, and this "one wet and dry" led to a fragmentation of the mural, which accounted for 60% of the total mural area.
In order to protect and rescue the murals of the mother's ancestors, the ancient cultural street management committee and the Qianjin Palace in the South Kai District of Tianjin city started work to repair the murals at the Queen's Palace and inside the temple.
The restoration project was led by Chai Chang-kyu and involved four prominent national painters.
The restoration works were based on the principle of `renovation as old as old', while also adapting the local content of the original murals, supplementing the original murals where they were not perfect.
In the process of repair, we have also made innovations and attempts in colours, materials, pen ink, etc.
The original mural style, spirituality, spirituality and art style was preserved after restoration.
The Palace was built in 1326. It is known as the Queen's Palace. It has been repaired several times. It is one of the oldest buildings in the city of Tianjin and one of the oldest temples in China's current history.
On 25 September, the launch ceremony of the Beijing Daeheing International Airport was crowned.
Beijing Dae-hing International Airport Air Station's stylish pseudo "The Phoenix has shown wings", which is known as the first of the seven wonders of the new world.
Beijing Capital International Airport is currently overstretched, carrying 100 million passengers last year, becoming the second year of the world, after Atlanta Airport in the United States, where passengers have swallowed up hundreds of millions of times.
By 2022, Beijing Daesing International Airport is expected to have 45 million passengers and 20 per cent of international flights; by 2025, the number of passengers will have 72 million and the proportion of international flights is expected to be 30 per cent.
How cool is it when it's a "new country door"?
Beijing Dae-hing International Airport is located between Beijing City and Guangyang District of Hebei Province, and is 46 km from the Tiananmen Gate straight line. It is currently the largest new airport built globally.
The surface projection of the steel structure on the roof of its terminal amounted to 180,000 square metres, with the size of 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Daesing International Airport is the world’s first air terminal with two arrival and two departure levels – F1-F4 for international arrival, domestic arrival, domestic departure, and international departure.
The two-storey bridge that connects the high-speed with the airport outside the terminal, corresponds to the F3 and F4 air terminal, respectively – the international departure to the top level and the domestic departure to both levels.
The first voyage of the Beijing Daeheing International Airport opened the era of Beijing's "two airports".
The new airport has been designated as a large international air hub, a new power source for the development of the country, and an integrated regional traffic hub in Jinjinsha, which supports the construction of Yu An-Shun District. To date, a total of 66 airlines are interested in entering the Beijing Daesing International Airport, including 20 domestic airlines, 46 Hong Kong, Adota and foreign airlines, whose flights are approved at any given time.
During the winter and spring season of 2019, Beijing Daeheing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, of which 101 are domestic and 15 are international; it covers 112 shipping points worldwide, including 97 domestic and 15 international.
This has led to the formation of a coordinated development, moderate competition and a “two-hub” airport pattern with Beijing Capital International Airport, with international first-class competitiveness, both to ease the operational pressure of the capital airport's saturated capacity and to better meet the urgent need for rapid growth in air transport in Beijing and the surrounding areas and to effectively enhance the international competitiveness of our civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daesing International Airport takes due account of the geographical location, airport relations with the surrounding airspace and operating environment. For the first time in the country, the airport runway has adopted a "all-way" layout, adopted the world's largest automated air traffic management system, and established China's largest terminal control area, thereby maximizing the efficiency of aviation operations.
For the first time, airports of this size in the country use nationalized baggage automated handling and information management systems, using innovative baggage transfer models to improve the efficiency of luggage processing.
Beijing Dae-hing International Airport's first voyage heralded the phoenix's show of wings and cool flying.
This new airport, which has created more than 40 international, domestic and national first airports with a national production rate of more than 98 per cent, is bound to have a direct and indirect economic impact on industries in the surrounding areas and to inject an impending dynamism into Beijing ' s economic development.
Marv is scheduled to hold a congress in November to transfer to the Party until the age of 16.
Ma We are tentatively scheduled to convene a central congress in early November to amend the party's age of transfer under the party charter until the age of 16.
With Congress passing down the voting age for general elections, Ma Wah announced the 66th Central Congress this year and proposed changes to the party charter, which included a downward adjustment to the membership age of Mahua, from the current age of 18 to 16.
The General President of Ma Wah, Dato ' Seri Wei Jiaxiang, said that the Central Committee of Mahua was scheduled to hold a central congress on 2 and 3 November this year, but because of the by-election of the Danish-Ai seat, the date of the congress might change.
He said that, since the Election Commission would meet only on 1 October to finalize the nomination date for the by-election and the polling day for the Danfumi-Ai seat, they would meet the following day, 2 October, to discuss whether to change the date of this year ' s Central Congress.
He also explained that the purpose of the Chinese committee convened yesterday (26th) was to finalize the date of the congress and to amend the party's statutes, but only happened to coincide with the tragic death of Congressman Danfung Biai of the Indigenous Unity Party, Nadhu Mohamada, and therefore joined the agenda of the State's by-elections.
Xinhua Network
Wang Bo-xiang, Sandong's birthday man, born in February 1943, worked in 1967 and served successively as secretary of the Township Party Committee, county committee secretary, mayor, etc.
In 1986, Wang Bo Xiang was the secretary of the Cantonal Committee in Shandong Province, when his birthday was a poor county in Kanyuan.
During the five years of his tenure, Uncle Wang focused his efforts on three things: promoting the industrialization of vegetables; developing a salt beach in Yubei; and laying the foundation for an industrial turn-over, which led to the drumming of a pocket and a build-up of a waist board.
Lifelight farmers have a tradition of vegetables and have learned the lesson of growing vegetables.
At the beginning of the 1980s, life farmers could not sell their harvests and rot in the ground.
Wang Bo-xiang's research found that the key to catching vegetables is to get the circulation done.
Lifelight was the first to build a wholesale market for vegetables and set the stage for the development of a market economy.
Party cadres have to take the lead, screw up, and all lost county has to take care of.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Bo-xiang, 17 members of the party, including Wang Le Yi of Chu Yuen, built 17 winter warm vegetables sheds, and 17 “two million households” emerged from the village in that year.
Then a promotion group was set up in the county, and Wang Loi Yi, mobilized by Wang Bo-xiang, guided the tour in various towns and cities; over 5,000 vegetable sheds were promoted in the first year, and the vegetable sheds moved to the whole county and to the whole country.
For millennia, 1.6 million acres of land have been painted on shallow beaches in addition to saline beaches.
The local mass life is very difficult.
Su-nam has a vegetable shed. What about Su-bei?
Wang Bo-xiang organized a congress fight for 100,000 people and camped on wasteland beaches for 40 or 50 days.
Wang Bo-xiang and the county leaders ate and lived on the construction site, pushing cars and carrying loads like private workers, and sitting on the floor, and the people saw them stretching their thumbs and admiring their eyes......At that time, Subei developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and developed a "pogee pot" on salty beaches.
In July 1986, Wang Bo-xiang participated for the first time as District Committee Secretary in the industrial conference of Xianghuang City.
In the course of the meeting, a table comparing industrial economy figures in the 12th county of Xinhu City was released, and at first glance the gross industrial output is still good, and the fourth place is in the fourth place.
But if the original salt is removed, the value of the pure industrial product of life is only 119 million yuan, third in the penultimate.
Wang Xiang, with more than 70 men, went to the field to "change your mind".
After less than a year, the county invested $150 million in 77 projects.
Every year since then, a group has been organized to collect passages to Shenzhen, Dongjung and Shanghai, among others.
Life is short of businesses, and there is still a shortage of entrepreneurs.
Wang Bo-xiang hosted a panel on the theme of the conference: 40 "careful and talented people" out of public selection of the director of the factory throughout the county were pushed to the industry line.
In 1991, he joined the ranks of the country's 100 Qiang counties, and Wang Bo-xiang was transferred as Deputy Mayor of Xinhu City.
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, 4854 businesses, and more than 100,000 “millions of won households,” a cadre recognized by the people. The people still call him “Our uncle's secretary.”
On September 26 local time, the State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi chaired the meeting of foreign ministers of China and the African States members of the Security Council at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The Foreign Minister of Côte d ' Ivoire, who is currently a member of the African Security Council, Tano, the Foreign Minister of Equatorial Guinea, Oyono, the Foreign Minister of South Africa, Pandor, and the Foreign Minister of Niger, the Member-designate, Kara, and the Foreign Minister of Tunisia, Jehinawi, attended the meeting.
Wang Yi made four proposals to strengthen cooperation between the two sides in the Council.
First, the strength of solidarity.
The greatest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, the direct consequence of which is that the basic norms of international relations are being challenged and the role of the United Nations is being undermined to the detriment of the interests of the developing countries in general, and the small and medium-sized countries in particular, including African countries.
Meeting this challenge requires hands-on, shoulder-to- shoulder-to-hand, solidarity to be strong.
In the Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, and the focus is not just three votes, but the continent as a whole.
China and Africa stand together, not just four votes, but will lead others to follow up, influence and shape the agenda of the Council.
Since 2018, China has established a “3+1” coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council, which needs to be fully utilized.
Secondly, we rely on consultations to resolve disputes.
China has always advocated a political solution to hotspot issues. Africa has a good tradition of consultation and experience of successful mediation by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex and difficult issues on the Council's agenda, particularly hot spots in Africa, are mostly the root causes of colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.
Together, we will use Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations to play the role of the United Nations in good offices, mediation, etc.
Thirdly, self-sustainability.
African countries and peoples know best about Africa ' s problems, and Africa has the capacity and wisdom to solve its own problems.
In addressing Africa's hotspots, the Council should focus on listening to and respecting Africa's will, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is ready to strengthen coordination with the African side and firmly promote capacity-building for African autonomous peace operations.
Fourthly, development is fundamental.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries, and we will insist on putting economic and social development first and supporting each other in their chosen path of development.
China is ready to build a "one way" in tandem with the AU Agenda 2063, the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030, and the development strategies of African countries. China will help African countries to strengthen their capacity for development and eliminate the root causes of conflict.
Together, we will press the United Nations to increase its investment in Africa's development.
The outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has once again erupted, China has done and will continue to do its utmost to assist by providing human and material assistance, within its means, and is willing to coordinate its efforts with African countries to mobilize greater assistance from the United Nations, WHO and others to play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The relays of the Neonatal Unit and others save small lives.
It's dangerous!
The pregnant mother had an early seizure, and on her way to the hospital in a panic, a 32-week premature baby could not wait to be born on Dad's sidecar.
Fortunately, obstetric and neonatal doctors handled it in a timely manner, and the relay saved this little life.
By coincidence, on 19, 20 and 21 days, the maternity and neonatal departments of the maternal and child health centre in Hubei province received three premature births of children born on their way for three consecutive days, while the other two were born in 120 first aid trucks, all of them for 29 weeks.
Ms. Cheng was a second-born pregnant mother and at 7 a.m. on September 19, she felt a little pain in the stomach, thought that she had been 32 weeks pregnant and that the first birth was premature, and she packed up the waiting items and was ready to take a bath and go straight to the hospital.
After 9:30, Ms. Cheng packed up and let her husband drive from Xu Dong's home to the hospital.
I didn't realize that soon after the car left the house, the baby couldn't wait to be born on Dad's sidekick.
After 20 minutes, Ms. Cheng and the baby finally arrived at the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Building at the Mother and Child Health Home in Hubei Province.
Hospital security officers saw the upset couple and the baby and immediately informed the maternity ward that four doctors and midwife Liu Yanyan, who were waiting for the deputy doctor Zhang Qing, were carrying the delivery bag and the umbilical cord drive, and then went downstairs.
"At that time, the mother was half lying on the side of the car, under the water of sheep and blood, and a baby boy was next to her, with a umbilical cord attached to her."
Zhang Qing asked about the baby ' s 32-week premature birth, the parents on the way didn ' t have time to cover the children ' s parcels, the early autumn morning was cold, his skin was cold, he didn ' t cry, and his limbs were weak.
Liu Ying-hyang quickly went to the co-pilot to deal with the baby's umbilical cord, then Zhang Qing broke into the cab, quickly opened the delivery bag, wrapped several layers of warmth with the inside treatment towel and the package, and cleaned up the respiratory tract (e.g. map) for the newborn, and then carried the baby up to the 12th floor neonatal section.
Upon receiving the information, the Neonatal Medical Services immediately arrived at the nurse station to rescue the premature baby.
At that time, the baby had a purple face and was suffocating for lack of oxygen, and the doctor gave him a pipe intubation immediately. Less than a minute later, the baby regained heart beats, the skin color gradually recovered, and the recovery was successful.
After entering the hospital, this 32-week baby got on a trauma respirator, sustained rescue and smooth breathing, and was successfully evacuated the next day.
After a week of treatment, the baby's vital signs are stable and breathing is smooth and has begun to breastfeed in small quantities.
Coincidentally, on 19, 20 and 21 days, the maternity and neonatal departments of the hospital received three premature births of children born on their way for three days in a row, while the other two were born in 120 first aid vehicles, both of which were 29 weeks premature, and are currently actively treating them in the neonatal department.
Sun Guoqiang, obstetric director of the provincial maternal and child health centre, explained that in recent years, women and children in the province have attended to a large number of babies born on the subway in private cars, a situation which could threaten the life of their mothers and children if not dealt with properly.
Director Sun warned that pregnant mothers should visit the hospital as soon as they had a stomach ache, broken water, and seen red, among other things.
In case the mother is present at home or on the road, she should try to sit down flatly and put blankets on her buttocks and so on, so as to prevent the baby from falling back into the ground. The child should be warm as soon as she comes out, and she should be brought to the hospital as soon as possible.
The newer Aerial Technology Company is officially operational.
The establishment of VSTEA was one of the fine-tuning elements of the memorandum of cooperation signed in April 2018 between VAECO and ST Engineering Aerospace, marking the emergence of the first Vietnamese aircraft equipment maintenance and repair consortium.
Two leading aviation technology companies in Viet Nam and Singapore cooperate to provide aircraft equipment maintenance and repair services to domestic and foreign airlines.
Yang Zhisheng, General Manager of the company, said that the company’s associate – ST Engineering Aerospace – was the largest and highest-level aircraft maintenance group in the world.
The cruiser believes that this cooperation will bring benefits to both sides and is the beginning of a promising future cooperative relationship between the two sides.
Lim Serh Ghee, Managing Director of ST Engineering Aerospace, said that sharing vast experience with ST Engineering would help the consortium to provide international-level maintenance and repair services and contribute to the flight safety of the airlines.
The birth of VSTEA helped cross the sea to join the market for maintenance and repair of aircraft equipment with the potential to dig deep and wide.
At the same time, there is a great opportunity to access modern technology and train senior aviation technicians.
To better meet the sustainable development needs of Viet Nam ' s aviation industry.
Research shows that manufacturing has become the focus of attention in major countries around the world - Xinhuanet
On September 27th, Xinhua, the National Intellectual Property Operation Public Service Platform released the White Paper on the Global Manufacturing Innovation Index in Anhui.

Three points for a penalty?
On Beijing Time 27, the NBA Development Alliance announced a pilot new penalty code, with only one penalty at a time, and the score is determined by irregularities.
O'Neill has a very low penalty shot in the NBA ball star.
The new regulation provides for 2 points for 2 points for 2 points for 2 points for 2 points and 3 points for 3 points for 3 points for 3 points and 1 point for 1 point for 1 point for 3 points for 3 points for 10 points for 10 points for 10 points for 10 points for 10 points for 10 years.
The last two minutes of regular time and the extra time game follow the previous penalty rules.
Although this new season is only being tested by the NBA Development Alliance, fans are more concerned about the implications for the players of the present if it were to be introduced in the NBA.
At the moment, many people believe that the new rules may be beneficial to Hudden the Bigbeard, and that James, who is less good at penalty, is going to suffer.
Wuhan promotes the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises with a maximum subsidy of 20 million yuan.
On 27th, journalists learned from a series of city launches of the "Glorification of the New China Games" organized by the Vuhan City Press Office that since this year, the city has accelerated its industrial intellectual transformation and implemented a transformational subsidy measure of up to 20 million yuan.
To date, more than 800 industrial enterprises of more than size have collected information on the need for intelligent transformation.
Zhang Hong, Deputy Director of the Economics and Informatization Bureau of Wuhan City, introduced the plan of action for the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises starting this year, offering free advisory diagnostic services and solutions to industrial enterprises of greater size than demand, and comprehensively promoting a new round of high-level enterprise technology transformation.
In accordance with the plan, the city of Wuhan publicly selects a group of specialized diagnostic services each year to conduct an intelligent transformation needs survey for all industrial enterprises of the size of the city and above by opening columns, questionnaires, entry papers, etc.
To date, more than 800 regulated industrial enterprises have collected information on their intellectual transformation needs, accounting for nearly one third of industrial enterprises of more than the size of the city.
Five municipal diagnostic platforms have organized teams to be admitted into the enterprise in one-on-one field assessment and programme validation.
Zhang Hong explained that the city is currently organizing 373 smart transformation projects, with a total planned investment of 29,760 million yuan, and that the leading smart workshops and intelligent factories in industries such as the 5G Smart Production Line, the Motorola National Lead Smart Cell Phone Production Line, the Wuhan Siemens Sub transformer Digitally Unmanned Plant, the first batch of Quantification Satellite Production Lines in the National Space Science Industry, the New Veterinary Intelligent Production Line back home in the Bioworld, the European Intelligent Networked Smart Production Line, etc.,
In addition, Wuhan City has increased its financial support for smart transformation projects.
These include investment in industrial enterprises that are intelligently modified according to their actual completion; investment in equipment hardware, and soft investment in R & D, which is granted at 8%, up to 20 million yuan in conversion subsidies.
At the same time, financial institutions such as the Active Joint Exchange and the Wuhan Branch of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry provide personalized financial services specifically designed for the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises and significantly ease the pressure on corporate finance.
Trudeau "Putting Man down", can he succeed in his second term?
This time, Trudeau tripped out of the big pit, and it was Trudeau himself that dug up a little bit.
In recent days, Canadian media have exposed several old pictures of the current Prime Minister, Trudo, who dressed himself as black.
This is considered to be a clear act of racial discrimination, triggering a wave of violence in Canada.
After what happened, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, Canadians don't buy much.
Trudeau sort of moved a rock and smashed his feet.
As political critic Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the "anti-Black Face Movement" in the United States, Trudo and the Federal Liberal Party (FLP) have been high-profile in accusing opposition parties or dissidents within their party of "a great loss" in this regard, and have repeatedly threatened that "anyone who makes this mistake should be expelled immediately".
Simply put, this time, Trudeau tripped out of the big pit, and it was Trudeau himself that dug up a little bit.
Trudeau was the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, a young and handsome man who, when he was just out of business, had a “political idol” cyclone.
After taking over as head of the Federal Liberal Party, he fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in Canada’s federal legislative elections in 2015 – the Federal Liberal Party, half of its seats in the federal lower house, gained valuable separate governmental powers.
At that time, Trudeau put forward a number of political platforms, ideas, such as "ethnicity and gender equality", "eco-environmental environment", "economic revitalization", and emphasized the eradication of corruption and "unrighteous winds".
However, for the past five years in office, he has been “high and low” in almost all of the above-mentioned areas.
Taking the issue of "ethnicity and gender equality" aside from this "blackface" incident, he "blessed" on a series of Aboriginal issues, which led First Nations groups, leaders, to move protest tents to Congress Hill Gate on the 150th anniversary of Canada's founding.
With regard to the fight against corruption, at the end of last year, Trudeau was involved in the boiling "Ranving incident" at the beginning of this year.
It was exposed and pressured the department and officials in charge of the investigation to demand that its home construction and engineering company, Ran Wanling, "thank you" for major irregularities and fraud.
And Trudeau, after the big deal, was angry at the officials who revealed the malpractices – Wang Chaudi, mentioned earlier, was the Attorney General of Canada when he was the first person to disclose the malpractices and directly run the case.
Although the case itself remains suspicious, it is difficult to erase its suspicions.
Many observers have pointed out that the fall of the Trudeau regime for five years was largely the result of their own “powder pits”, and that none of the biggest “powder pits” is more than the three “dumps” of the Tiger Head Snake tail, “eat their own fruit” and “better than their own, harsher than their lawyers”.
The most authoritative Angus-Rayder poll data in Canada show that since 2015, supporters of Trudeau have slipped from more than 60 per cent to more than 30 per cent, while opponents have jumped from less than 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent.
Even though other opposition parties and their party leaders have performed similarly poorly, even a significant proportion of voters who still wish to vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now not convinced that the Federation Prime Minister, the head of the ruling party, is the same.
On October 21, the new Canadian federal legislative elections are about to begin. Will Trudeau be able to repeat what he won five years ago?
The answer might be one word: difficulty.
There are far-reaching implications and positive implications, whether in terms of corporate competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration, or Kyoto development integration.
On 25 September, Beijing Daesing International Airport officially sailed.
Newjing newspaper journalists have been informed by the Beijing City Development and Rehabilitation Committee that the capital airport is in a state of super-saturated operation and that the opening of Dahin International Airport will enhance the capacity of the capital's aviation services.
Following Shanghai, Beijing became the second city with two airports in our fellow city, similar to Shanghai Rainbow Bridge International Airport, which serves primarily domestic aviation affairs, and Pudong Airport, which is dominated by international shipping and aviation, and the future capital airport and Dahin Airport will also provide a more disaggregated service based on differences in service to different air operations at home and internationally.
Dahin Airport is more beneficial to the capital airport from the point of view of business development.
The capital airport reached 100 million passengers in 2018 and is the country's highest in terms of traffic, but there is still a significant shortfall in capacity compared to the rapidly growing demand for business, especially for international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passengers, travel, etc., and adapt to the trend towards increasingly open and internationally integrated cities in Beijing, Daejin International Airport has been positioned as a large international hub airport and plans to meet 100 million annual passenger throughputs and 4 million tons through mail and mail in the future.
As a result, there is no overlap in positioning the two airports, targeting different client groups and having sufficient market space.
At the economic and accounting level, it is clear that the navigation of Dahin International Airport will have a win-win effect by easing tensions in Beijing air traffic, accelerating the growth of passenger and cargo throughput, and building incremental cakes for the two-nuclear operation of Air Capital.
From the user's point of view, as Dahin international airport sails, it will not be necessary to concentrate all future trips on the capital airport, but will also reduce the number of problems associated with the excessive concentration of routes, such as longer stop security, slower passenger boarding, indirectly increasing aircraft and passengers' stay at the airport, increasing the burden of airport operations, reduced shipping through the capital airport, and improved passenger travel experience.
According to media estimates of the time and cost of a variety of transport routes to large international airports, such as travelling directly to Daeheng airport on the Jing Jing highway from the South 5th Ring and driving 50 minutes away, oil money comes back and goes back to around $40, and the high rate cost is $15; instead, the track traffic metro airport line is chosen, with a distance of 20 km and 30 km, with fares of $10, $25 and $35 in the third tranche; citizens can also travel from Beijing West Station to Daeheung airport station for more than 20 minutes.
In general, citizens have a wide range of transport options to go to Da Hing Airport, and the costs and timing are within a reasonable range.
From the point of view of trends: Daehing Airport is located as a traffic hub in Kyunjin, so it is a little further away from Beijing, but it has reinforced radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, facilitating more people to travel, and has significant implications for the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, Hebei and Tianjin passengers will be able to benefit from the additional international air route services offered by Da Xin International Airport, as can be seen from the traffic planning at Da Xin Airport.
In addition to the new airport line in the city of Beijing, which leads directly to Dashing Airport, there are several highways connecting the airport to the surrounding area.
Just as the city passengers of Guangdong Dongguan, Fushan and Chong Wan can travel to the White Cloud Airport in Guangzhou via the Guanghua Highway, the residents of such places as the Beijing Ribbon and the Yu Anjin District will also benefit from the Greater Hing Airport and receive easy and efficient air services.
As can be seen, the navigation of Dahin International Airport has not only added a few runways and planes, but has far-reaching and positive implications, from the level of corporate competition, from the level of consumer experience, from the level of regional aviation integration and from the dimension of the development of the integration of Kyoto, not only for the long-term layout and development of the shipping industry in Beijing, but also for the diversification of options for the movement of a large number of residents in Kyoto, and for the further improvement of the quality of services provided by the Beijing shipping industry, which is more conducive to the integrated development
As a result, we account not only for the small individual but also for the overall development of the airport.
On the 27th of mid-day, the small-board finger rose by 1.46% - Xinhua Net
Xinhua Society Shenzhen's electricity on September 27 (journalist Zhao Rish) went up high and high on September 27 and finally reported 6077.23 points, an increase of 87.55 points and 1.46 per cent over the previous trading day.
On that day, the sum of $108 billion was paid, which is $31.9 billion less than on the previous trading day.
Of the stocks traded on the same day, 668 stocks were closed and reported up, and Hwang and creatively raised and stopped in 15; 222 shares were closed and 4 shares, including the shares of Junwei, fell; and the shares of Weissung and others were flattened in 40 shares.
In 2019, Viet Nam ' s Forum on Economic and Social Issues was held in the province of Sun-Sooning.
Viet Nam ' s deputy director of the economic committee of the National Assembly, Nguyen Dejeng, revealed that early this year, Viet Nam ' s economic and social development showed many new signs and continued growth.
The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the Forum, participants exchanged views and views in depth on four themes, namely the economic development situation in 2019 and the impact of selected FTAs, some salient issues in the Vietnamese economy in 2019, outstanding issues in Vietnamese society culture in 2019, and projections and proposals for Viet Nam ' s economic and social development in 2020.
There was general agreement that global economic growth slowed and risks and challenges increased in the first months of 2019.
Trade frictions among major economies have further reduced global trade and investment.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), despite the uncertainty of the global economy, in which 70 per cent of the world ' s economies have stagnated in growth, Viet Nam ' s economic development has achieved many promising results, with a smooth macroeconomic performance and effective control of inflation, with an average consumer price index growth of 2.64 per cent in the first half of 2019, the lowest increase in nearly three years.
GDP grew by 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2019, down from 7.05 per cent in the same period last year, but the increase remained high compared to the same period in 2011-2017.
In forecasting Viet Nam ' s economic development trends from 2019 to 2020, the deputy director of Viet Nam ' s National Economic and Social Forecasting Centre, Dunde-Hing, said that the Vietnamese economy showed a high growth momentum in 2019 against the backdrop of the turmoil in the world economy.
Viet Nam ' s macroeconomic stability is expected to remain generally stable by 2020, the implementation of the various FTAs will contribute to trade development, the restructuring of the economy and the improvement of the business environment will be further strengthened, and Viet Nam ' s external export activity will decline as a result of trade friction.
It is therefore necessary to strengthen monitoring and forecasting early warning mechanisms, proactively seek trade relief measures for Vietnamese exports, seek opportunities to expand new export markets and facilitate the export of various commodities, including agricultural and water products.
At the same time, inflation rates are kept at reasonable levels, thereby contributing to the development of ancillary industries and supporting the development of high-tech, organic and eco-agriculture, among others.
Liu Jijie, Director of the Consul Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia in Siem Reap, hosted a reception in Siem Reap to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
Liu Jijie said that in the 70 years since the establishment of the new China, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributed more Chinese wisdom and China's programmes to improve global economic governance and promote common global development, made important contributions to world peace and development, and made tangible benefits for Cambodia's economic development and the well-being of its people.
Liu Jijie explained that, as the world's second largest economy, China contributed more than 30% to world economic growth, especially through China's "one way" initiative, and cooperation between China's local provinces and cities and the provinces of Siem Reap and the region continued to deepen.
He said that this year marked the beginning of 61 years of China-Cambodia's founding, that the two countries had fraternal friendship and friendship, and that China-Cambodia mutually beneficial cooperation would be the driving force behind local economic and social development.
The Governor of Siem Reap Province, Desaiha, highly praised the great achievements of the new China over the past 70 years and congratulated China and China on the results of their friendly cooperation.
Disahar expects both sides to continue to work together to promote Chinese-Chinese friendship and cooperation, enhance mutual trust and mutual benefit, and continuously improve the living standards of their people.
The Siem Reap Province and China's provinces and cities have had remarkable relations, so far concluding friendly relations with China's 28 provinces and cities. In China's large cultural performance projects, "U Go smile" and "U Go dynasty", the Siam Reap Model Agricultural Park, the Siam Reap New International Airport Project, the Siem Reap Government officials' special training course, the Siem Retro Study Scholarship for Siem Rey Koko, rural consultations, and the "Light Walking" project to revise urban roads and restore cataracts, among others,
The reception was attended by Ken Wensson, the Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, the Chairman of the Siem Reap Provincial Council, Onhing, the Governor of the 5 provinces in the region, the Siem Reap branch of the Cambodian Council, volunteer teachers, representatives of the Siem Reap branch of the Cambodian Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Chinese-owned enterprises and representatives of the foreign Siem Reap leadership.
To witness the 10 years of "Cown Up" - Xinhua Network - of Digital China in Cloudstown.
If the 2009 local website forum is used as a starting point, the 2019 Cloud Habitat Congress in Hangzhou has been going through a decade.
From the concept of "in the clouds" to the practice of "upset clouds", big data and cloud computing became one of the core technologies underpinning China's economic development, social management and public services in 10 years.
At the Jin-tae new energy light-voltage battery workshop in Heining, Zhejiang, there have recently been a number of new "coworkers" next to the Quality Inspector with Ali Cloud artificial intelligence.
It has no rest in 24 hours, has more than twice the speed of identification as manual, and the accuracy rate of the quality check has stabilized at more than 95 per cent.
According to the head of the company, the Quality Checker, with the camera, has focused on more than 40,000 defective samples, which, with the cloud computing power behind it, can quickly convert infrared images into binary languages, with defective battery fragments classified.
The firm is only a microcosm of today's cloud computing assistive manufacturing transformation.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Informationization published the " Guide to Promoting the Implementation of the Utility Clouds in Enterprises (2018-2020) " , proposing that by 2020, efforts should be made to achieve a significant increase in the awareness and motivation of the Utility of the Utility, with a significant increase in the proportion of Utility Clouds and the depth of application.
The founder of Ariyun, Wang Kin, said that today, data-centred cloud computing has opened the way for data to bridge the digital economy of key elements.
At the same time, our cloud computing industry has grown in size over the past 10 years.
The White Paper on cloud computing development (2019), published by the Chinese Institute of Information and Communications last July, showed that the overall market size of China ' s cloud computing in 2018 amounted to 96.28 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2 per cent over 2017.
In addition to being the key technology that underpins industrial transformation and digital economic development, invisible clouds change urban governance and social life unwittingly.
At this year's Cloud Habitat Congress, the "city brain" that has been shining for the third year in a row continues to be a matter of concern.
Aliyun explained that the urban brain has now become the hub of urban governance from a traffic governance tool and that the relevant cooperative application has been extended to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the urban brain, through its powerful computing power, makes it possible to perform new urban management service functions such as "stop and pay first", "real-time perception of the number of people in consultation", "Tourist route design".
In the area of government services, using "one cloud" to match "one thing", "take the job" "take the job" and "take the job," cloud computing facilitates the supply of government services on both sides.
Zhejiang has now built a unified public data platform across the province through the top of politics.
As of 11 September, the platform had covered more than 57 million resident residents and more than 15 million corporate entities in the province, bringing together 3066 categories of 1.08 billion data to govern.
The average monthly call and sharing of data between Zhejiang provincial government departments has reached 12 million times, and every time the data is called on a cloud, it may mean that the crowd is doing less.
Makoto makes tea with plastic tea packs!
According to the Central News Agency, a recent study in Canada in recent days found that a plastic tea bag could release billions or even billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than a single person's estimated entire intake of microplastics, but to date there is no evidence that the ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
Researchers at McGill University in Canada have reportedly found that dipping plastic tea bags into a glass of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius), will release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup.
This number is significantly higher than the total estimated number of microplastics taken by a person.
According to research published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year, while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.
According to the information received, the study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, where researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea packs at Montero Shop and Café, opened the tea bag, washed the tea bag and dipped it into almost boiling water for five minutes and analysed it using electronic microscopes and spectrometers.
According to this study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, "a number of grades higher than the plastic load of other previous foods".
It was reported that most tea bags were made of natural fibres, but many brands made of natural fibres still use plastic to seal them.
Some branded tea bags are no longer paper-based, but instead use plastic, which is the object of testing by researchers.
Plastic particles are microscopic fragments of plastic, and researchers define these microscopic plastics to be in the range of 100 nm to 5 m2 and to be produced mainly by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and deep-sea trenches around the world, and found them in running water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
For the first time in October 2018, researchers found plastic particles in human excreta samples from several countries in different regions of the world.
To test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from tea packs, the Canadian research team placed daphnia in contaminated water and found that microplastics affected the behaviour of these daphnia and caused them to develop abnormalities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that the ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
WHO notes, however, that more research is needed to understand fully how these plastics spread into the environment and how they affect humans.
Researchers speculate that the reason these tea bags release large amounts of plastic particles may be that these plastic tea bags come into contact with boiling water and may decompose or seepage toxic substances even when the "food level" plastics heat up to 40 degrees Celsius.
Guterres stated that climate emergencies were the greatest threat to the survival of small island States.
There, a natural disaster erodes a generation of human development gains.
This has been illustrated by the disasters in Babuda, Dominica and the Bahamas, which have been hit by hurricanes since this year.
About a quarter of the people in small island developing States live at an altitude of 5 metres or lower.
The relocation may seriously affect their society and way of life and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At this Monday's Climate Action Summit, small island developing States jointly committed themselves to achieving carbon neutrality and 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030, thus again leading the world in the right direction.
Gutierrez said, "The climate crisis is accumulating new injustices over old injustices.
Although small island developing States contribute little to global warming, they pay the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many countries are caught in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must act, and the time has come to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States.”
Today ' s high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for finding ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and transform renewable energy sources; and urging international institutions to help small island developing States, especially highly indebted middle-income countries, to access finance.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the lifeline of the planet — the ocean.
The latest special report issued this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have suffered the severe consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, many regions are likely to experience extreme sea level rises that would have occurred only once in a century each year.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable without significant investment in adaptation.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused huge losses.
Over the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic contamination has increased tenfold over the past 40 years.
The demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a decrease in resources, including the maintenance of fishing grounds in many island communities.
Small island States also face high transport, energy and infrastructure costs.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, subjecting them to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also making efforts to address the security implications of illegal trafficking in human beings, arms and drugs.
Gutierrez said, "The problem can be solved anywhere by resolving it in the most challenging environment.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples that the world can learn from.”
He stressed that small island developing States were a special case for sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
The Ministry of Finance of India indicated that the financial system was sufficiently mobile.
India ' s finance minister, Seetalaman 26, said that the current financial system was sufficiently liquid and that India ' s economic growth was expected to recover during the second half of the fiscal year, driven by the demand for the holiday consumption.
Seetalaman made this statement after a meeting with representatives of Indian private banks, non-banking financial institutions, housing banks, etc.
Seetalaman did not explain the relevance of these statements.
Some of the former Indian media and overseas media blamed India for the sustained slowdown in the current round of the economy on the tight liquidity of non-bank financial institutions.
Seeing the fall in car sales as an example, Seetalaman denied that liquidity constraints were the main cause of the decline in sales.
Seetalaman noted that the decline in automobile sales was mainly due to cyclical factors.
Seetalaman predicted that India's economy might recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday consumption.
India ' s annual shopping season began in September and will continue until the end of the year.
The market anticipates that shopping consumption will contribute significantly to economic growth in India.
In recent days, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education has issued an announcement that it is strictly forbidden for primary and secondary schools throughout the province to make up for the violations during the National Day Leave, and that personnel will be organized to conduct unannounced and unannounced visits at random.
In the circular issued by the Ministry of Education of Jiangxi Province on the prohibition of illegal remedial classes on leave for the Chief of the National Day, it was stressed that during the National Day, primary and secondary schools throughout the country must insist on the following: no student shall be allowed to organize group remedial classes or to attend new classes, no student may be allowed to organize training courses in disciplines, long classes, Osai classes, interest classes, higher classes, etc., and no school or school premises may be rented to other educational institutions to conduct training courses of all kinds.
At the same time, in-service primary and secondary school teachers are strictly forbidden to organize, recommend and induce students to attend in- and out-of-school infraction remedial classes, in-service primary and secondary school teachers to attend out-of-school training institutions or remedial classes organized by other teachers, parents, parents committees, etc., and in-service primary and secondary school teachers are strictly prohibited from presenting their sources and providing relevant information to out-of-school training institutions and others.
The circular makes it clear that, in case of proven violations of remedial education in primary and secondary schools, the local education administration will increase the deductions in the quality development education examination of the county level in the same year, and teachers involved in remedial education violations will be dealt with seriously in accordance with the relevant provisions of Shifu Shifu style.
To support the production of live pigs and secure the supply of markets.
Your loyalty requires that the measures be implemented in six ways.
A telephonic conference was held today to promote the production of live pig production and secure the supply of the market, and to mobilize for the redeployment of the policy measures adopted by the Central and Provincial Committees and provincial governments to support the production of live pig production and secure the supply of the market.
Be faithful and take care of all the measures taken to produce live pigs in six areas.
The mayor of the “basket of food” was responsible for the implementation of the plan, and this year ' s clear provincial mission of 45 million born pigs was broken down to the city states and incorporated into the accountability test.
Take the implementation of policy measures and effectively address the last kilometre of policy implementation.
The production of female pigs is being carried out in good condition, the policy of subsidization of female pigs is being carefully implemented, the growth of pig breeding is being encouraged in pig growing enterprises, and there is a systematic selection of good female pigs from the group of commodity pigs.
Seize the offer and implement it, making it a top priority to attract the investment that has not yet entered the country's well-known large-scale farming enterprises in our province.
Take care of the market circulation system, speed up the construction of cold-chain logistics facilities for raw pigs, and promote the overall shift from "supplies" to "meats".
Take care of the implementation of the modern system of vaccinations, equip the regions with grass-roots quarantine personnel commensurate with the size of the farm and the tasks of the work, and secure the first line of protection against disease and disease control.
The loyality demands that every effort be made to secure the supply of the meat market, to ensure that there is no large-scale shortage and wide-scale disconnection, and to ensure that the supply of the pork market for major holidays is stable.
The meeting also deployed efforts to maintain the control and control of the African swine plague, ban the capture and capture of key waters in my governor's river basin, and purchase of medium-to-late rice throughout the province.
An old Shanghai word for the love of the motherland, the spirit of the nation, the big white rabbit, etc., attends party classes for college students.
The "Me and My Fatherland" campus card points made college students "love to think about it."
On the occasion of the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, four famous Shanghai Old Words have gathered on the 27th day of Shanghai Technical University to "Art Party" in Shanghai, four Shanghai Old Letters representing an average history of more than 90 years, and Qiqi has told over 200 young students about the country's history and nation's spirits.
An exhibition of the old brand's products on the scene.
The narrations in the classroom made the students wonder that the display of the old branded product was carefully placed outside the classroom, and that the "Me and My Fatherland" campus had a punctuation point for college students.
Big rabbit lip cream, big white rabbit ice cream... as an old-word brand, big white rabbit milk sugar has been actively seeking change in recent years, taking the initiative, insisting on innovation and cross-bordering.
The big white rabbit, born in 1959, happens to be on its 60th birthday this year.
Xiao Wansheng also looks at youth consumption groups.
Wang Weiji, the secretary-general and deputy director of the party branch of Shanghai Pilgrim Food Co. Ltd., referred to the scene of "Spring is eating abalone, summer is hot and bad fish, autumn is cold, and winter clouds are drinking crabs", reflecting people's constant innovation in "eat".
Companies have also further developed brand culture in terms of taste innovation, cartoon packaging design, etc., to adapt to the heritage of younger consumer groups.
The old word represents the presentation of the path of innovation on the scene of the Art Party.
Yuji, the manager of Shanghai Feathers and Restaurants Ltd., agreed, "All innovations need solid foundations, and the old word word for each innovation is a thick and thin-haired process.
Everyone's heart hides the expectation of the old word.
The era of small and beautiful, centred on products, should begin."
As one of the first Chinese characters in the country, Shanghai Fish also quickly adapted to market currents, upgraded brands visually, introduced professional operating teams, and achieved a significant increase in turnover.
"The old word is not only visible in traditional channels such as supermarkets, but the old word is now actively involved in new retailing and activities.
All our changes will ultimately achieve the goal that consumers will be able to see, hear, and eventually buy."
Uyang Jilin, Deputy General Manager of Shanghai Soap (Group) Limited, said.
In the future, Shanghai soapmaking will also persist in high-end development, system development of energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products with broad prospects and user satisfaction, and adherence to high-tech and cost-effective paths.
Through this art party class, students have gained a lot.
I grew up with the old word, carrying the good memories and emotions of my childhood."
Song Yuen classmates are sighing.
The Shanghai Old Word represents more than 200 young students who tell about the motherland of the old word brand and the spirit of the nation.
Zhou Xing Ting said that how to tap into brand culture so that quality traditional culture can be inherited from generation to generation is a question that we, as design students, need to think about and explore.
Building on Ting Wei's "Shanghai Image" project of the Dean of the University of Technology and Arts School in Huadong, Professor Ning's "Old Words Incorporated Brand Innovation Studio", the Party's course aims to deepen the cultural potential and modern commercial value of the old word sign, enhance the concentration of cultural radioactivity of the old word Shanghai, achieve the industrial effect of the "1+1>2" in the form of "Design + Culture" and present Shanghai culture from a new perspective.
According to the information received, the Arts Party class will also continue to invite human history, painting masters, pottery masters, non-relict masters, architecture masters and landscape masters to serve as lecturers, through which they tell stories about innovation and adherence to the Chinese culture, highlight the characteristics of the times, further entrench the ideals of university students, foster their love for the country, use their works to speak, make their works sound, and innovate the Party's style to teach subjects that students love, enhance the Party's intellectual, theoretical and affinity skills and relevance
Abe made a video to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China and said in Chinese:
On the 26th of local time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe congratulated the People's Republic of China on its 70th anniversary via video.
Prime Minister Abe Shinzo of Japan: Good evening, I'm Abe Shinzo.
On the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China, I would like to extend warm congratulations to the Government and people of Japan.
At the G20 Osaka Summit in June, China and China declared to the world the firm will of the G20 through the G20 Leaders Osaka Summit Declaration to make the summit a success.
In addition, at the Japan-China summit meeting and dinner, prior to the summit, it was agreed that President Xi Jinping would make a state visit to Japan next spring, while unanimously determined to open a new era in Japan.
Japan and China share a great responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.
I firmly believe that the joint efforts of the two countries to address the problems facing the region and the world and to contribute to the international community will contribute to the construction of a new model of future relations between the two countries.
In conclusion, I wish Japan a vibrant relationship and friends a prosperous career.
"It is estimated that over-age farmers on some sites account for more than half of them.
Where do we find young workers now?
There is no way to use so many "old people" on the site."
Recently, Zou Kui, who worked as an engineering contractor in the construction industry for a long time, lamented the existence of a large number of over-age farmers on the site (over and above retirement age).
In recent times, the high school where I am based has been working on rain-distribution projects, and there are a lot of farmers on campus, and if you look closely, you will find a lot of over-age farmers in it.
Farmer workers who are too old to go out to work are not "silent", but rather because they are "unable to spend time" and have the help and hardship to "have to do so" – whether they save money to solve their old-age and medical problems or help their children, they drive these old people who were supposed to be "silent" to continue to work hard.
It's not as easy as we thought it would be for over-age farmers.
Growing up children, raising old people, helping children to read, helping them build buildings to buy cars, helping their children to start a family, raising grandchildren from generation to generation. When these farmers complete their "life mission", money bags have been emptied and even debted, and they mostly lack wealth accumulation.
In order not to drag the children, but also to save some wealth for themselves, a number of farmers insist that they “do it until it's done”.
Many “after 80”, “after 90”, or even “after 00”, new generations of farmers are reluctant to engage in secondary industries or low-end services that are under difficult conditions and labour-intensive, creating structural “work waste”, which are unattractive jobs and provide opportunities for over-age farmers.
Owing to the lack of a skill and the decline in physical and labour skills, many over-age farmers are engaged in high-intensity, low-income, high-risk and low-security jobs.
A day's work is a day's work, and a little more is a little bit, and the survival dilemma of the over-age farmers behind the "don't be idle" cannot be ignored and ignored.
Addressing the problem of wage arrears and bargaining, improving labour protection, reducing safety risks, increasing labour income and improving the survival of over-age farmers, is equally dependent on public sector institutional care and human care, in addition to their self-help.
It has been pointed out by scholars that over-age farmers are no longer likely to depend on their homes to grow land to solve their old-age and medical problems, and that they must support their families by other means.
Reading the incompetence and strength of over-age farmers helps us better understand the love and pain of over-age farmers.
Seeing the backslides of over-age farmers, hearing their sighs, trying to get them back to the village to really make their "good old living", need the public sector, markets and society to share their responsibilities in a virtuous interaction, and need to combine their efforts.
Chemetsov said that Russia would not export this system for the next five years because "first supply the country's army before export production takes place."
This practice is fully consistent with international practice.
The main producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure their defence needs first, before processing export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Glehoff, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Sky Force, said that the development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by the "Goldstone-Antai" Sky Defense Concén.
This is the new generation of anti-aircraft systems, using working principles used to destroy ballistics and aerodynamics objectives.
The main role of S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles and to intercept missiles with a range of less than 3,500 km.
In addition, according to certain information, S-500 can destroy high-sonic cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of drones, high-sonic missiles five times faster than sound, even near space targets.
Such weapons can also become a unified network with other air defence systems, especially S-400 systems, which is very important from a defence perspective.
Sergei Chemetsov expressed particular concern about S-400.
He said that the system was in great demand in the world today, but the Russian army needed it, including in the Arctic region.
S-400 air defence systems are in service in the Arctic air defence regiment.
According to the 15 September news, the conversion of S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems by the New Earth Islands Arctic Air Defence Corps has been completed.
This is not the militarization of Russia in the Arctic region.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, this is entirely a process within the transition plan to a more advanced defence tool in the strategic direction of the north.
News Service of the Russian Northern Fleet said: "According to the transition to the new S-400 air defence system, the controlled airspace of the Arctic region has grown significantly."
It is very important that, according to military assessments, the system has been successfully used in the far north and the Arctic.
Air Defence Corps officers trained on the new system and were ready to enter combat duty.
The S-300 long-range air defence system was previously equipped there and is still partially maintained.
When it comes to air defence systems, they must possess weapons capable of destroying a variety of air targets, be they high-speed targets at the outer altitude or "fish leaking" near protected facilities.
According to open sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by the Golden Diamond-Antai Sky Defense Concene, was designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high ultrasound targets and other air strike weapons.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 km and shoot down ballistic targets flying 4.8 km per second within a distance of 60 km.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defence forces in the far north to ensure the safety of air space on the northern seaways.
Not long ago, the first 12 "Tor" anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, sufficient to form an air defence battalion to strengthen the anti-aircraft systems in the Arctic.
The Russian Ministry of Defence said at that time that the Arctic “Tor” force would be extended to complete brigade formations in the future.
Together with the new S-400 remote system deployed on New Earth Island and the Kola Peninsula and the Pantsir-SA short-range system deployed in the far north, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons are powerful defenses of Russia's polar sky.
It will be difficult for enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles to break through this defence.
According to the Russian Government, the flagship shop will serve as a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods and avoid the complex and lengthy process of opening their own shops.
The Russian company, the Russian store operator, focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
The biggest trading platforms in China, such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, ShouQ, Wechat, etc., have online shops and have their own online platforms Epinduo.com and Russian retail outlets.
The Russian Export Centre will work with the Russian Federation to develop marketing strategies and standards of participation in shops and screen virtual shelf-loading companies.
The store plans to open and board products of at least 10 Russian manufacturers by the end of this year.
According to data from the Russian Export Centre, the total number of visits to China ' s power company platforms is as high as 1 billion per month.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, reaching over $1 billion in 2018.
Currently, the Alibaba Group will also open pilot shops for the sale of commodities from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of the Global Import Strategy.
According to Alexei Kozhevnikov, the new store will display the merchandise of enterprises selling at least 500 million roubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and 500 million rubles are not sold enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers are quite positive about Russian goods and view our commodities as high-quality and green green and green.”
Kozhevnikov said that competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power was intense and increasing.
He said, "Our goal is ambitious, and 500 businesses will be launched through this store in three years."
At the same time, the platform will also carry products from Russian Far East enterprises.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, Professor of the Basics of Trade Policy Studies at the Russian Plykhanov Economic University, said: "This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export centre is a State-owned rather than a private institution."
"I didn't see a large number of highly competitive Russian goods on the market."
He believed that the project would probably not really be implemented, but that it would help to strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to the Russian News Agency, Andrei Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Center, stated during the Eastern Economic Forum that more than 170 Russian enterprises ' product information had been published on the biggest international wholesaler platform, Alibaba.com, and could be purchased in China or elsewhere.
In addition, there is a model for cooperation with the Alibaba Group, namely, the training project for Russian enterprises by experts from the Bao University, whose first seminar was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Centre will also be the organizer of the participation of Russian enterprises in industry exhibitions and business projects at the Second China International Import Fair in Shanghai in November of this year.
A major exhibition will be held in the 1,000 square metres exhibition hall, where it will also be the centre for commercial project activities, protocol signing ceremonies, promotion sessions and meetings with Chinese business representatives.
About 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Information Service of the Russian Export Centre said, "We must also hold business meetings in addition to the agricultural stand, that is, arrange direct contacts between entrepreneurs."
"This is another direction of our efforts to support businesses and ensure that dozens of special meetings are arranged for them."
In addition, the fair will hold master courses, cooking competitions and Russian-renowned cook-cooking meetings for Russian-American foods on the project "Exploring Russia's Food Top Sea Station".

When's the next bus coming?
The Internet+Intelligent Station makes you count.
On 27th, Nanjing's Smart Transport Union Gode map announced that the first Internet+smart stations in the country will be officially located in Nanjing, when 54 public transport electronic screens will be lit, which will comprehensively upgrade Nanjing's information services, improve the efficiency of public transport services and the mobility and happiness of the people.
In the past, the anxiety scene of the waiting car was played almost every day at the bus stop.
It is difficult to predict the duration of bus operations, the condition of public transport routes and the location of the vehicles. The issue of the public handing over of the pain points needs to be resolved. In some major cities, in particular, long commuting distances and complicated traffic conditions at morning and evening commute peaks have made it difficult to guarantee the rate of public transport.
To this end, Nanjing Wisdom Transport, together with the Goth Map, explored the new direction of Internet+Travel and launched the country's first smart service project, the Internet+Intelligent Station.
According to the information received, the country's first Internet+intelligent stations landed in Nanjing, integrating Goethe Big Data and Goethe's vehicle expected time to travel the ETA algorithm, and relying on bus electronic station and mobile Internet, traffic big data upgrades to realize the ability of the bus smart station plus electronic map to publish bus routes at both ends, bus expected stop time, etc.
By means of the Internet+smart station, Nanking citizens not only have easy access to the expected arrival time of the bus, know the real-time location of the bus and the number of stops at the current site, but can also gain a visual view of the road along the three colours of the red orange green, making it possible to see the real-time status of all bus lines through the station.
Thanks to the “Internet + Smart Station” technology, which warms the heart, Nanking citizens have achieved easy and efficient means of public delivery, such as “advocating the bus position before leaving, knowing the stop time when waiting for the bus, knowing the time when the bus arrives at the destination”.
On the basis of real-time bus information from the Internet+smart station, the choice of the most appropriate route for your travel, while at the same time providing for psychological expectations and reducing the anxiety of waiting cars, makes travel easier.

Xinhua Times Review: Stand firm and follow our own path.
The White Paper " China and the World of the New Age " , published on 27th, answers: China ' s development has been successful for 70 years, and the fundamental reason is that, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have found the right path of development, the socialism of the Chinese identity, and have followed it with determination.
China follows its own path of development and is the choice of history and people.
In recent times, in an environment of poverty and internal and external distress, generations of rich people have been searching for solutions to save their country and to follow through.
However, "the constitutional monarchy, the reintroduction of the empire, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, the presidential system have all thought and tried, and nothing works."
It was only with the Chinese Communist Party and the new China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a socialist path of Chinese identity in practice.
China ' s path is one of happiness for the Chinese people and revival for the Chinese nation, and one of common development for China and the rest of the world.
It is on the right path that China will be able to do its job well, become the second largest economy in the world and contribute most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As pointed out in the White Paper, China ' s development path is consistent with China ' s national circumstances, adapting to the requirements of the times, and will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how hard it is to find the right path; look around the world, the Chinese people value the right path even more.
The Chinese understand the logic of South Orange and understand that what suits others is not necessarily good for themselves, but best good for themselves.
It is with such road self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created a world-renowned miracle.
In the course of the twists and turns of the human race, the "Episode of History" was famous for a while.
Today, the success of the socialist path of China’s special features has declared the end of the “final conclusion of history”, the collapse of the “China collapse theory” and the failure of the “socialist failure theory”.
China ' s success has boosted the confidence of developing countries to achieve prosperity and prosperity in their countries. It has expanded the path of developing countries towards modernization. It has provided experience and lessons for countries and peoples in the world that wish both to accelerate development and to maintain their independence, and to follow a path that is consistent with their national circumstances.
The world is rich and varied.
China has always respected the right of each country to choose the path of development appropriate to its own circumstances.
China will not "enter" the foreign model, nor "export" the Chinese model, but will firmly and steadfastly pursue its own path, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen exchanges with countries on governance and governance, and make its due contribution to the common realization of good governance and good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that a 66-year-old female worker was fired by the owner of the Foodworks supermarket via a text message because he preferred to hire employees from an Asian background, and his practices were strongly criticized as " shameful".
The Board said that Ms. Gail Ayton's boss, Jianbin Wang, who worked at Wagga's store for more than 20 years, treated employees in a way that was "unfair" and could violate anti-discrimination laws.
Ms. Ayton told the committee that Mr. Wang had taken over the shop in 2016 and that he had always "wanted to fire me", because she was not Chinese.
In this case, the Vice-Chairman of the Commission, Peter Sams, conducted a search on the Internet and found that "Mr. Wang has published a number of job advertisements in various Australian employment forums in the past".
Among the job requirements listed in these posts, one said "prefer to Asian women" and the other said "prefer to Asian employees".
The third post says he's "more inclined towards overseas people (sic)".
Mr. Wang dismissed Ms. Ayton by text message in April this year, later claiming that this was due to her absence from work and the alleged small cash deficit of $5.10 to $30 on the cash register.
Mr. Sams said, however, that Mr. Wang's reasons for dismissing Ms. Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
She's only been absent from one class for three years, and the missing amount totals several Australian dollars.
He said that Ms. Ayton's dismissal was “in fact irrelevant to her conduct or performance”.
He said, "It seems to me that, supported by the evidence of Mr. Wang's job announcement, the real motive for the argument to dismiss her is that he prefers to hire employees with Asian background.
According to section 772(f) of Fair Work Act (FairWork Act), Mr. Wang ' s conduct appears to constitute an unlawful violation of anti-discrimination law and/or dismissal of the applicant. "
Mr. Sams said that it would be inappropriate for Mr. Wang to consider reinstating Ms. Ayton's position, in view of his “horrifying” treatment.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, who was a temporary worker with an hourly salary of $26.
In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and industrial relations legislation, Sams indicated that he would submit his decisions and documents to the head of the committee to consider whether Mr. Wang should be transferred to other bodies to investigate possible violations of state or federal laws.
He said that Mr. Wang had not given Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
He said, "I think that the argument should have taken an irresistible and unfair and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant, and Mr. Wang "waiting" this opportunity, which he thought would `prove ' that the applicant's employment was justified."
"He was wrong... to argue that in dismissing the applicant she was completely ignored any natural justice, and it was shocking that he was impolite and grossly unjust in his perfunctory behaviour. "
Mr. Sams said that while Foodworks is a small business, "but frankly, no decent employer will fire an employee in the most unfair and perfunctory manner recognized in this case."
He said, "This is shameful and extremely unfair."

Six people denied the sale of fake Greater Marka paper, and the case went to the High Court.
Six men suspected of counterfeiting and selling our passports, papers and identity cards, including one assistant director of the National Register Office, and one businessman with the rank of governor, passed the case on Thursday, and the district court judge approved the charges against trafficking in human beings and anti-trafficking migrants and transferred them to the High Court for trial.
The lawyer who originally represented the Chinese-Chinese defendant Le Zhenhua, as well as Congressman Ryer of Sunset Hole District, applied to the judge to withdraw from representing the case and no longer became the defendant's representative lawyer, which was approved in court.
He said that he himself had drawn criticism from his political opponents by representing the defendant, and that his party of action had been implicated.
He stressed that he himself was not afraid of any threat, but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to discredit the Action Party and the Greek government or other Greek leadership, and that the decision was taken after careful consideration.
He also said that there was no conflict of interest between representing the defendant and being a congressman, that he was not legally prohibited from representing any of the defendants, and that until now the defendant, Le Zhenhua, had not been convicted.
The six defendants were charged in court on 12 September of this year and denied all guilt and were not granted bail pending trial by the court in the face of numerous charges against article 26E of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Trafficking in Migrants Act and article 466 of the Criminal Code (forgery of documents).
On Thursday, two district court judges, Noshahaha, and Mazlan, after the arguments of both parties, granted the prosecution ' s application to transfer the charges against the anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking immigration ordinances in respect of the six defendants to the High Court for trial; as for the charges of forgery of documents, they will appear in the district court on 3 October, pending the prosecution ' s transfer of the documents to the defence.
The earlier six defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Order 2012 (SOSMA), so the judge did not grant bail.
Walking with the motherland - written by a unit of the Armed Police Force
Kim Qiu, on the military parade field, a unit of an army of soldiers of an average height of 1.83 metres was busy training.
Shining spears, unique olive greens and bright red shoulders together form a bright landscape.
A day ago, journalists walked into this team and felt the determination of the Wu police officers to always be party and loyal defenders of the people, as well as their “honour above all” love and pursuit.
"Dreams shine bright lives, writing the immortal legends of the new era..." is a team song written by all the members of the Fang army - Walking with the Fatherland.
In the team, this song is the motto of every member of the team.
Qi Xiaogwang, 1.92 metres tall, was particularly visible on the side team.
He has a deeper understanding of honor as the flag guard of the former Armed Police Force.
The honor of the soldier comes from hard training.
As Qi Xiaogwang, a flagman, training has always been a high standard and demanding requirement.
He strapped to sandbags to shape, stuck to a second watch to practice speed, blindfolded to practice scale and steady with the wind.
There's always a picture of him in his "flag career".
At one flag-raising ceremony, rain poured down, while none of the tourists who came to watch the flag-raising ceremony left.
The moment the flag rises, Qi Xiaolight feels deeply the glory represented by the five-star red flag on his shoulder.
In 2019, Qi Xiaoqiang was selected as the base soldier.
The base soldier and the flagman have different standards of movement.
Qi Xiaoqiang explained that the march of the flagmen and the base soldiers, although less than 20 steps away, required more effort in training.
The base soldiers are the first in the first row and directly determine the alignment of the line.
After the parade focused on training, he repeatedly kicked his legs on a daily basis and practiced hard kicks.
In the demonstration, he won a round of applause for the soldiers at the exact pace and speed of the march.
Almost every member of the army has the same experience as Qi Xiaogwang.
The father of the soldier Chu Xu's east was present 20 years ago on the occasion of the 50th anniversary.
In order to follow his father's footsteps as a member of the team, he was frustrated on one occasion, but never discouraged.
He said, "I would like to walk through Tiananmen Square just like my father, and accept the party and people's scrutiny as an honor in my life.
"The Master of Security in the Capital" has eight large characters in the curtains.
Wang Xian of the Chinese political committee introduced the fact that all the members of the team came from the Beijing Brigade of the Carabineros – an army with a glorious tradition that took on important tasks such as the opening of the country, the national festivals, the security of the National Congresses of successive parties and the maintenance of stability in the capital. A large group of British models and individuals, such as the "flag guard" and the "guard hero squadron", were developed, and over 50 units and individuals were awarded honours by the State Department, the Central Military Commission and the Armed Police Force
A reception of foreign experts to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
A reception of foreign experts to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China was held on the evening of 27th in the People ' s Hall and was attended by and addressed by the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party and Deputy Prime Minister of the State Council.

The 70-year development achievements of the new China are the result of the tireless struggle of the Chinese people of all ethnicities and the hard work of foreign experts.
Over the past 70 years, a large number of foreign experts have come to China, joined the Chinese people in the modernization and construction project and made indelible contributions, which the Chinese people will never forget.
He noted that China's development has come to a new historical start, and that the Chinese people are working tirelessly to achieve China's dream of a final victory and the complete creation of Xiao Kang society, a great victory in the socialism of the Chinese character of the new era, and a great revival of the Chinese nation.
China will insist that "development is the first priority, talent is the first resource, and innovation is the first engine", and vigorously pursue innovation-driven development strategies and promote high-quality economic development.
People are the most innovative and dynamic factor, and China will accelerate the development of a large pool of strategic science and technology personnel with international standards, science and technology leaders, youth science and technology talent and high-level innovation teams.
Han Jing said that China ' s cause is one that enjoys the support of the world ' s people, one that is open to learning from the world and one that cooperates with the nations of the world.

Viet Nam needs to seize opportunities for artificial intelligence development.
The four criteria used to assess and rank cities in terms of level of preparedness to face the AI wave include prospects, ability to realize, asset base and development direction.
Singapore city ranked first, followed by cities in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an expert of his organization, responded to an interview with a journalist on behalf of Mohin Pevana, saying, "I find it very interesting to review and assess cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam.
Overall, I think Viet Nam's future is bright in a context of high growth rates, strong economic development paths and rapid growth of the human base.
I think Viet Nam is on the right track and doing well.
The important thing is that Viet Nam should know how to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the fourth industrial revolution to promote more economic development.”
Artificial intelligence is completely changing people's work, communication and way of life.
It brings greater efficiency, but it also poses a threat of increasing social, economic and technological inequality.
However, according to a global study organized by Oliver Wyman, there are only cities in the world today preparing for the breakthroughs of the age of artificial intelligence.
Gutierrez said it was a pleasure to celebrate China ' s 70th anniversary here together, and he congratulated the Chinese Government and people on their impressive achievements over the past 70 years.

China is ready, together with Malaysia, to continue to implement the important consensus of the two heads of State and the outcome of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, and to promote the further development of practical cooperation between the two countries.
China is willing to strengthen communication and collaboration with Malaysia in international affairs in order to safeguard the common interests of both sides and the larger picture of Central African relations.
Kasela said that China was a true friend of Malawi and African countries, and that its development had benefited the people of Malawi.
The Malaysian side insisted on a one-China policy and thanked China for its support and assistance to Malawi.
The Malaysian side looks forward to further development of relations between Malaysia and China, and welcomes more Chinese enterprises to invest in the future.
About 800 million people traveled to China on the Fourth of July to reflect Chinese tourism supply and demand.
About 800 million people will travel on the upcoming 11th Golden Week!
Large data from a number of tourist platforms show that the country ' s tourism consumer market is booming in both supply and demand.
In the context of previous national holiday tourism statistics, it is expected that the number of domestic tourists this year will be close to 800 million; there will be more than 7.5 million trips abroad.
Tourists from more than 500 cities currently book products such as tour tours, free travel, custom tourism, local play, etc. through the platform, covering 100 countries and regions.
China Tourism Institute estimates that last year's national holiday hosted 726 million domestic tourists, an increase of 9.43 per cent over the previous year.
Not only will the number of tourists be re-innovated this year's national holiday, but rising consumption will also become the main theme of the national holiday vacation.
The courier reported that the national holiday trip cost more than $3,000 per person across provinces, an increase over the same period last year, as tourists generally chose to experience better products, such as high-rated branding hotels, shopping-free tour tours, elite small groups, special coaches, etc.
The donkey mother's travel network booking data show a similar trend, and “privileged groups” of less than ten people are more popular than in previous years, using comfortable cars throughout the long line of the country.
Spring and fall tourism data show that consumers prefer a "slow-paced" approach that focuses on experience, service, and diversity.
The Flying Pig data show that the country's four-line and suburban tourist reservations grew fastest, reaching 30% at the same time, refracturing the rising consumption of more parts of the country.
Personalization is one of the main features of this year's Golden Week tour.
Portside data show that the annual holiday rental car self-drive order is expected to increase by nearly 60% over the same year, that the short-distance travel of small groups of people visiting the perimeter continues to be appreciated; and that the registration of private groups has increased by up to 155% over the same year.
The sharing of joy became the main purpose of people's tourism and leisure.
The data show that 28 per cent of the holiday visitors on the National Day were parents and children, 25 per cent were couples and 23 per cent were colleagues and friends.
Also, according to the age of tourists, "after 80" and "after 90" account for more than 50% of the total number of tourists.
It is a matter of concern that, unlike in the past, when gold travels across the border grew more rapidly, the performance of the domestic tourism market this year has been more “optimal”.
Flying pig data show that the number of people booking the country's cultural and travel routes this year's national holiday has increased by 42% over the same year, and the speed of travel exceeds the speed of travel abroad.
Industry analyses that while demand is strong, tourism supply side reforms are being promoted throughout the country to provide tourists with a richer “unsun feast”.
For example, the National Directorate of Sports and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism have recently jointly issued the "Fine Line for Sports and Tourism for the 11th Golden Week of 2019" ; the Shanghai Tourism Festival, which is being held in 2019, has launched 7 cultural and tourism spots to attract Chinese and foreign tourists; and several provinces, such as Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan and Shandong, have introduced price reduction or free measures for viewing areas near the Golden Week.
The data on booking shows that destinations with unique natural or cultural characteristics are the most "fire" in the country, and Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xian, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing and Tianjin will be the most popular tourist destinations in the country.

China is expected to become Australia's largest beef export market.
An animal protein analyst from the Dutch Cooperative Bank (Rabobank) said that China faced a severe shortage of pork following the outbreak of the African pigpest and was expected to become Australia ' s largest export market for beef.
After the outbreak, Chinese consumers are shifting from eating pork to other animal proteins. The epidemic has caused the authorities to destroy many herds. In the past year, the number of live pigs in China has been reduced by half, and the price of pork has almost doubled.
China produces and consumes two thirds of the world ' s pork.
According to Chenjun Pan, a senior animal protein analyst from the Dutch cooperative bank in China, demand for other meats, including beef, has increased. China, the world’s largest animal protein importer, currently imports 27% of the world’s pork, and beef imports 24% of the world’s meat.
Ms. Pan said that Chinese beef imports from Australia had increased by 65 per cent in the first half of the year, and China had surpassed the United States and Japan and became Australia's largest export market for beef.
Yesterday, the Chinese Government stated that it would release more pork from emergency reserves before celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party.

The world's highest-age barber died at the age of 108 and had his hair cut for 96 years.
In New York, America, there is Anthony Mancinelli, the world's highest-age barber certified in the world record of Kim, who never retired to his daily hairdresser, but in 19 days Mansinelli died as a result of cancer in his jaw, saying goodbye to his 96-year-old haircut.
According to CNN, Mancinelli emigrated to the United States when she was eight years old, helped clean the floor in a barber shop, and began to pick up scissors to serve guests when she was 12.
Mancinelli, although attending primary school at that time, did not graduate.
Mansinelli's son Robert revealed that Dad loved his job and people from all over the world liked him, but Dad was diagnosed with cancer in February this year, and was unable to work for physical reasons for six weeks before he died, but that was not retirement because he planned to come back to cut his hair when he was better.
Robert, 82 years old, said he had to find a new hairdresser now after his father died, because he had asked his father to help cut his hair for the rest of his life.
During the year, listed companies bought back more than $100 billion in historic heights - Xinhua Network
In order to stabilize the company ' s share price, preserve the company ' s image, the listed company began to buy back shares frequently in the last two years, hoping to transmit the information that the company ' s value is undervalued to the market through targeted buybacks and a pool of competitive transactions, thereby stabilizing the stock price and enhancing investor confidence.
Eastern wealth Choice data show that the amount of money that listed companies spent on repurchase shares in 2017 rose sharply to 51 billion yuan in 2018, and since 2019, the total amount of repurchase implementation by A-stock listed companies has exceeded 100 billion yuan, creating a new and higher level of the A-stock ' s historical repurchase capital, far higher than in previous years.
From the point of view of the purpose of the repurchase, the company's repurchase of shares appears to be on the same increase as the major shareholders, but there are significant differences in the subject of the implementation, the source of funds, the purpose of the repurchase, and the equity interest in the stock itself.
In an interview with the Daily Securities Journal journalist, Xu Yang, Chairman of McCorin Information Consulting Limited, Shanghai, said that the November 2018 " Opinion on Support for Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies " had improved on the problems of existing systems such as narrow repurchase of shares, complicated decision-making procedures, and inadequate inventory systems, which had previously encouraged repurchase of shares by listed companies from the point of view of policy, had significantly increased the buyback of shares during the year.
In January of this year, the " Rules for the Implementation of Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies " , officially published at the drop-off and deep-off offices, expanded the sources of funding for repurchase by listed companies, simplified implementation procedures, guided improved governance arrangements, and encouraged all types of listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee holding schemes.
After the comment was made, the listed company performed the share buyback operation with more applicability, the buyback process was easier and the share buyback was more motivated.
Repurchase of shares at relatively low positions would also help listed companies to increase the efficiency of the use of funds, thereby increasing the level of profitability per share, raising the rate of return on net assets and reducing pressure on corporate profitability indicators.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies is even more significant than the increase in large shareholders, and reflects the willingness of listed companies to manage their own market value and cash flows.
Xuyang argued that undervalued shares were the main factor behind repurchases by listed companies and that the stock prices of companies no longer reflected the future prospects of the company, so such companies deserved the attention of investors, but could not invest blindly, and that attention needed to be paid to the financial statements of such listed companies and the specific business situation.
Listed companies with large-scale buybacks at least show the company ' s development confidence and financial strength.
The repurchase enthusiasm of A-stock listed companies is gradually warming and normalizing repurchase behaviour. The data show that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented repurchases this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the main force in the repurchase market.
China recently disclosed the progress of repurchases, stating that the company has accumulated 57.559 million shares in A through a centralized bid transaction, accounting for 0.315% of the company ' s total stock stock, and that the total amount paid is 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction costs). Repurchase shares will be used entirely for employee holding schemes, including, but not limited to, long-term service plans that have been considered and adopted by the company ' s shareholders ' general meeting.
Eli shares have paid $5,792 million for stock buybacks and have recently adjusted the use of repurchase shares, changing from the original plan to "repurchase shares will be used entirely as a source of stocks for later implementation of equity incentives" to "cumulative buyback of 183 million shares, 152 million of which will be used to implement equity incentives, and the remaining 3,049 million shares will be used to write off and reduce registered capital".
The Ily shares indicated that the cancellation of some of the repurchased shares would further enhance the level of return per share and effectively improve the return on investment of the company ' s shareholders.
The TCL Group issued its Repurchase Progress announcement on 25 September, indicating that TCL Group accumulated 3.39 per cent of its shares, at a total cost of 1.65 billion yuan.
The TCL Group Board Office stated to the Daily Securities Reporter that repurchase shares would be used for employee holding schemes, equity incentives or to convert corporate bonds issued by listed companies into shares.
The TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy, constantly improving competitiveness and sustaining healthy development.
Based on confidence in the company ' s future development and the preservation of investors ' interests, the company plans to repurchase its shares using its own funds, self-financing and other forms of financing, taking into account the performance of the company ' s stock in the secondary market over the past year and taking into account the company ' s business performance and financial position.
Yang Delong, the chief economist at the former Kaitsu Foundation, said that the operation of stock buybacks by listed companies would, on the one hand, reduce the number of shares in the market and increase each share of the earnings of listed companies, which would be an important benefit for the stock price of the secondary market; and that the willingness of listed companies to offer real silver and silver and cancel stock buybacks from the stock market greatly boosted market confidence.
Repurchases by domestic listed companies have gradually increased in recent years, particularly for merit shares, and it is a very good way to boost investor confidence through stock buy-backs, as well as an approach worthy of recognition and encouragement.
Hunan Province Standing Committee and Changsha City Council Secretary Hu Shenghua, and the four leading leaders of the Xiang army in engineering and engineering – Jan Junxin, Liang Biangen, Ho Xinghua, Liu Feihua – set a “small goal” around “From engineering machinery to smart manufacturing” – three or five years later, building a world-lead cluster of engineering and machinery industries.
The construction of the world ' s leading engineering and mechanical industry cluster in Changsha is, in the current fashionable words, "the strongest on the surface".
Chang Sha, as the capital city of the interior province, shouts this rhetoric. What's the reason for this?
It's based on the power of hegemonism.
The four engineering and mechanical companies that took part in the dialogue, each of which was able to do so, covered the whole field of the sky, underground, sea and land: the light aircraft of the mountain river intelligence, the concrete transport pump of the Central United Heavy Section, the full ground crane of the trio, and the tunnel shield of the iron-builder, whose "hard power" could be considered unique and proud of the males.
Once upon a time, China had virtually no voice in the field of engineering and mechanical manufacturing.
China's enterprises "incorporated into the world" and "go out" were driven by two wheels, taking advantage of the eastward winds of the "one-way" initiative. The acquisition, merger, plant etc. made a leap into the global engineering and machinery industry.
Among them, the leading engineering and mechanical enterprises, such as the Triad Workers, the Central and Central Union Heavy Industries, the Iron Construction and Heavy Industries, and the Mountain River Smart, whose main economic indicators, such as the value of production, market occupancy and sales, are already well ahead of similar enterprises.
It's time to move with the camera.
The "Four Great Kong" of the Engineering Mechanics Army is the leader of the Changsha Engineering Mechanical Industries and the head business of the global engineering and mechanical industry.
Who survives and lives well in the world's industries is hard to speak.
In earlier years, the global engineering and machinery industry experienced a cold winter, and a number of internationally recognized engineering and mechanical manufacturing firms fell down, but Changsha's engineering and mechanical manufacturing firms used the term "cat winter" as "winter swim", self-pressure, self-break, through the transformation of industrial structures and transformation from manufacturing to intelligence, not only survived, but also strengthened the body and bone.
It's on the basis of the co-optation of the moon by the stars.
Developing industries of advantage requires both active enterprise and government action.
Changsha's reputation for “the capital of engineering machinery” is that it brings together a whole industry chain from upstream to downstream, creates a number of related clusters of industries, and significantly reduces the cost of R & D, manufacturing and marketing by optimizing the business environment, improving the accompanying services, simplifying the approval process, etc.
Good business ecology has brought engineering and machinery manufacturing enterprises to the fore.
History has pushed Changsha to the front desk of the world ' s leading engineering machine.
The government, the business, and even the producers and researchers associated with it, should seize the opportunity, step up, target, sustain their efforts, and contribute Hunan's power to the building of the powerful.
Wang Yi chaired the meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of China and the African States members of the Security Council.
Wang Yi said China is a good brother and partner with African countries.
China stands firmly with its African brothers, past, present and future.
We advocated the holding of such a meeting of foreign ministers as a concrete step to implement the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping with the leaders of African countries at the Beijing Summit of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum last September, in order to strengthen China's solidarity and collaboration with African countries in the Security Council, and in order to promote better support by the international community for peace and development in Africa.
Wang Yi said that Africa is China's most important and trusted partner.
As a permanent member, China's vote in the Security Council has always belonged to the vast majority of developing countries, including African countries.
In the face of the new situation, China is ready to work with African countries in the Council to strengthen solidarity and coordination and to safeguard common interests.
It is up to both sides to work together, to negotiate and resolve disputes, to be self-reliant and to be governed by development.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the participating African Member States thanked China for its initiative to convene this meeting and congratulated the New China on its 70th anniversary.
The Foreign Ministers said that the relationship between Africa and China was based on equality and mutual respect and that Africa and China had always been the most trusted and trusted partners.
The African side appreciates China ' s important and positive role in African affairs as a permanent member of the Security Council, its strong contribution to a just and reasonable solution to Africa ' s problems, and its great efforts and contributions to safeguarding Africa ' s interests and promoting peace and security in Africa.
Africa today faces the threat of terrorism and extremism, and only by addressing security issues can Africa truly achieve long-term peaceful development.
We look forward to further coordination of positions with China in the Council and enhanced solidarity and cooperation.
Wang Yi said that there was an important consensus at today's meeting.
We all support the preservation of multilateralism, the strengthening of the authority and role of the United Nations, the preservation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rejection of unilateralism and bullying; we all agree to strengthen mutual supportive cooperation between Central Africa in the affairs of the United Nations and the Security Council and to safeguard the common interests of Central Africa and the vast majority of developing countries; we all support African countries in solving Africa's problems in an African way and ask the United Nations to provide financial support for African-owned peace operations; we all support the concept of “cooperation for development and development for peace
Gansu Qingyang: The lake sheep came to "get out of poverty".
The autumn of September rewrite the Yellow-Team Plateau.
A 58-year-old villager, Xavilli, in a professional cooperative for the development of the people of the town, filled the sink with the last herbs in the sheep, held by the sink and watched the white lake sheep chewing.
"Eat well, when autumn and winter are full, you can get a good price out of the column."
Xavilli said that he fed the sheep a "special feeding" every day, regularly cleaned up and disinfected, and was careful to wait.
Xavier raised sheep for more than 20 years, until he came to work in the cooperative to know how rough sheep was in the past.
Xavili is from the village of Xiaquai, Qingyang County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His left neighbour's right quarters are sheep owners, but they adhere to the traditional distribution methods, the quality of sheep is poor and the numbers are small.
In June of this year, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative under the guidance of the Government and everything began to change.
Xavier Xavier spends all day working on farming because he's always holding on to it.
The stockholders are poor households, they trust the sheep to the cooperative, and they count on him if they can split the money and sell it at the end of the year.
Thanks to the technical guidance, he slowly learned to control the disease, mastered the scientific feeding, and became a "good game" for the few farmers in the village.
The professional cooperative for the development of the public is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1,400 lake goats.
Zhaotao, the cooperative leader, said that there were doors both inside and outside the standardized sheep shed.
"The wool is thick enough to breed bacteria, the lake sheep can't stay in a hot, wet place, the shed must be built on three sides of the ditch, and the wind changer has to be installed to vent and evaporate the heat."
Zhaotao said that, in order to prevent the disease, it was necessary to spray and disinfect the sheep shed regularly and give the sheep three to four times a quarter.
In addition to living well, the Little Fat sheep has to eat herbs mixed with green grains, wheat herbs, herbs, etc., and have a sufficiently wide playground to stretch its bones.
The cooperative uses a foster care system that directs local farmers to place the good-breeding, management, marketing, breeding, scientificization, standardization and intensive farming here.
Today, 140 poor households that share in sheep receive more than $6,000 per household per year, and four poverty-alleviation clients work in cooperatives.
From the word "filled mountain grazing" to the word "precision feeding", from the word "local mating" to the word " artificial insemination", from the words "see body size, touch belly" to the words "doing B super by one"... in Gansu Qingyang, the meat and goat farming was more than just a shift in feeding patterns, and the model of the "long head business plus cooperative plus farmer" changed the image of the former "sale sheep on the mountain slopes and marketed sheep", overcoming the weakness of traditional farming, the poor days of farmers
Zhaotao said that if market prices were weak, the local leader, Gansu Jin Sheeng Farm Development Co. Ltd., would buy up at 27 yuan per kilogram of market protection prices to help farmers spread market risk.
Xu Jianfeng, the General Advisor of Gansu Central Shing Agricultural and Livestock Development Co. Ltd., said that by providing poor households with loan guarantees, sheep-planting, order farming, bid acquisition, and unified processing and marketing services, enterprises have led to an increasing number of poor households to read "sheep experience".
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families achieved a steady increase in their harvests through the raising of grasses, the breeding of good seeds, the raising of large-scale plants, the partitioning of slaughters, and marketing.
Qingyang city is located in the northern agricultural-pastoral intersection and has abundant resources for herbing.
There are currently 913 meat and goat-scale farms, cooperatives and more than 5 million meat and goat-breeding, and 2 1.3 million meat and sheep slaughter-scale processing production lines have been built throughout the city. The flock is becoming a “lead sheep” for poverty alleviation in the industry.
The French Chancellor of Finance said he'd cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros next year and called on Germany to follow suit.
Reuters Paris, September 26 - The French Chancellor of Finance Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros (US$ 10.9 billion) next year, while Germany should keep pace with France’s fiscal stimulus in order to revive its depressed economy.
In introducing France ' s 2020 budget, Lemel said that the European Central Bank ' s latest monetary easing initiative had created an opportunity to increase investment for the Governments of those member States that were able to afford it.
The European Central Bank reduced interest rates to record a new low on September 12 and plans to restart purchase debt in order to lower borrowing costs, hoping to stimulate economic recovery and boost inflation.
“The low interest rate will not allow Europe to prosper again, monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough”, Lemel said to journalists.
"Germany needs to invest, and the sooner it needs to, the better. Don't wait until things get worse." He added.
He has made this appeal to Germany on many occasions.
France has implemented tax cuts of over €10 billion this year, which have greatly boosted its economic growth.
The global economy lost its power and the German economy, which depends on exports, bore the brunt.
Le Mel noted that next year the tax burden on French families will be reduced by €9.3 billion, including €5 billion in income tax relief.
In addition, as the corporate tax rate is gradually reduced from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent over a five-year period, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost Euro1 billion.

Research: US National Healthy Diet Index has increased slightly, but still has challenges - China New Network
In recent days, according to the U.S. newspaper, a recent U.S. study shows that the U.S. government ' s healthy diet index has grown modestly over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58.
But it's not worth celebrating when the full score is 100.
American nationals still face a "substantial challenge" in their diet.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Fangfan, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University, Massachusetts, said that Americans still consume too many foods that could cause diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, etc., which are the most common diseases among American nationals.
The study was published in the American Medical Association magazine in 24.
The study was based on the findings of a health survey of 44,000 adults conducted by the United States Government between 1999 and 2016.
The authors wrote, "In spite of significant improvements, significant dietary challenges still exist."
According to the information received, these challenges include reducing United States nationals ' intake of food containing saturated fat, such as snacks, hot dogs, fat cows, butter, etc.
Research has found that the intake of these unhealthy fats in people ' s daily diet has increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended 10% intake ceiling.
The biggest improvement in America’s national diet is the drop in sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but the intake is still too high.
Officially, sugar addition should be less than 10% in daily diets.
For the reason that the intake of sugar has decreased, researchers believe that it is related to the reduction in the use of sweet soda by people, but Zhang Fong stressed that sugar is often added to foods that are not even very sweet, such as yogurt and ketchup.
The intake of fruits, nuts, oatmeal and other whole grain categories has increased slightly among the adult population in the United States.
However, data for 2016 show that these foods still account for less than 5% of the daily diet.
Although the intake of salt has decreased slightly and the consumption of juice has led to the intake of low-quality carbohydrates, Zhang Fang indicated that they still account for up to 42% of daily heat, many of which come from processed white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on a biennial personal health survey that reminds adults of the food they have eaten in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have asked the question twice every few days since 2003.
The government has published a dietary guide for American residents suggesting that people use "healthy diet patterns" to reduce their vulnerability to chronic diseases.
The guide states that people should consume more nutrient-intensive foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, thin meat, poultry meat, eggs and seed food that can provide proteins.
During the research, the number of people suffering from diabetes in the United States almost doubled, to over 7%, and the obesity rate also increased over the years – today about 70% of adults in the United States are overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among United States nationals.
EU promotes strategic partnerships with Asia
The Forum was attended by members of the Vietcong Central Political Bureau, the Secretary of the Central Registry and the Minister of the Central Economy, Nguyen Wenping.
Based on the close cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia Pacific region, the theme of the Forum was “Combining the EU with Asia: Building Bridges for the Future of Sustainable Development”.
The forum took place one year after the implementation of the twinning strategy in the two continents of the European Union.
Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, said that the enhanced reception was part of the above-mentioned proposition, as it brought benefits to the peoples and economies of the countries concerned.
These relations help bring stability and prosperity to all concerned.
At the same time, he believed that the EU wanted to convey messages about increasing participation and consolidating the mutually beneficial interface between Europe and Asia.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan is the special guest of the Forum and will make an important presentation in the plenary.
The country's first shareholding management subsidiary was set up to run the business with technology empowerment.
In Qingdao, a fully-owned subsidiary of Qwang Da Bank was formally established in Qingdao as the first stock-based bank finance subsidiary.
The experts stated that asset management was an important area for the development of financial science and technology and that banks established financial subsidiaries to facilitate their use of science and technology to upgrade their financial operations.
In April of this year, the Guang Da Bank and the recruiting bank issued an announcement stating that they had been approved by the China Silver Insurance Supervisory Board to prepare for the construction of the finance subsidiary.
On 24 September, Gwang Da Bank announced that Kwang Dynasty had been officially authorized to open its business.
Just two days later, Kwang Da Bank led a number of stock-based banks and took the lead in establishing Kwang Dynasty in Qingdao.
Lee Xiaoping, Chairman of the Big Light Group, said that the Big Light Group would accelerate the pace of innovation, apply modern technological thinking and tools, rely on big data, object networking, cloud computing, improve the coverage, usage and penetration of financial capital, and improve client acquisition, happiness and security.
By 2021, the "Four-Eight Pillar" for the sound development of our financial science and technology will be established. It will further enhance the capacity of the financial industry to apply it, achieve deep integration and coordinated development of finance and technology. It will increase the public's satisfaction with digitalization, networking and intelligent financial products and services.
Mr. Zhang Xuyang, Chairman of Gwang Da Finance, introduced that Hwang Finance's capital management platform would use such technologies as smart investment, smart investment, big data, etc. to help Gwang Finance better manage macroeconomic judgment.
New technologies, such as block chains, will also be applied in the future to capture the direction and trends from traditional to alternative assets to digitally alternative assets.
Dong Xijin, a special researcher at the National Financial and Development Laboratory, said that, in the face of a completely new competitive situation in the financial management industry, the financial science and technology company and the financial management agency would explore new growth paths using capital and technology together.
The financial science and technology empowerment industry is both a need for financial science and technology to transform and develop itself, and it will inject new life and dynamism into the management of business development.
At the beginning of this year, Kyoto Digital Science and Technology launched a new technology management system to upgrade the production research and development and wind control capabilities of the capital through technology and digitalization.
The new system began with product design, sales transactions, asset management and risk assessment of four major capabilities, raising the overall intellectual performance of the industry.
Experts believe that while upgrading client service capabilities and innovative enrichment products, managing technology can also enhance risk preparedness and efficiency in managing management.
Zhang Xuyang indicated that the risk preferences used to locate clients through questionnaires were easily biased and that the current use of artificial intelligence for user drawings would help to better locate customers and to roll out the corresponding products according to their investment preferences and help mitigate risks.
"Alternative big data, such as power merchants, space and space data, can help us better carve a region, an industry's activity, and the atmosphere."
Zhang Xuyang said that while risk is being addressed, big data technology will also help improve wind control capabilities.
The deepest record of Chinese railway tunnels has been updated.
After more than 1,200 days of day and night construction on September 27, China's Sino-News Social Security Hill electricity (Jan Wei Minh Xiao Jingbo) completed the excavation work on 27th day of the construction of Jia (Li) Ri (Li) Road's first rig, which reached a depth of 762.59 metres below the ground, breaking the deepest record of Chinese railway tunnels and wells, which was created in the midst of a massive flood of water.
The 34.5-kilometre-long Grand-Swe Railway Golligan Hill Tunnel, located in Yunnan, is the longest double-line single-hole tunnel in Asia across the Golligan Mountains in the West Bank.
The tunnel crosses 19 fracture zones and is buried at a maximum depth of 1,155 metres, since it covers the undesirable geological and significant risks that may be encountered in almost all tunnel construction. The Golégon Hill Tunnel is known as the "Geological Museum" of tunnel construction.
The rig is the most important auxiliary tunnel in the Goligan Hill Tunnel, and has the important task of increasing the operational surface to achieve the "silent hit" and later ventilation of railway operations.
The successful excavation of the first rig to the bottom of the well marks the construction of the formal entry level tunnel of the Golégon Hill tunnel, which, after the opening of the bottom of the well and the replacement of equipment, can add four fields of operation to the well and speed up the opening of the tunnel.
"Pilot wells are all on the granite surface, and the size of the water pressure is basically as high as the depth of the wells due to the fragmentation of the granite layer, which can't stop the water. "
The Chief Engineer of the Dare Railway Project of the Central Iron Tunnel Bureau told reporters that during the construction of the well, there had been a number of dangers, such as mud and water surges and collapses, and that the builders had invited experts to take the pulse on site, and over 20 discussions had been held on the treatment programme.
"The maximum influx of water in the wells is more than 300 cubic metres per hour and more than 700 metres deep in the bottom of the well, with water pressure equal to 700 metres deep in the sea floor."
He said, "If we don't pump the drain in time, we'll flood the well 10 meters in an hour. We spend almost 85% of our time on water treatment, 15% of our time on digging."
In order to overcome the geological difficulties of vertically controlled development of the titanium fencer number 1, silt surge water, and rich water granite, tunnel construction uses a combination of systems for water treatment, “detection, notation, digging”, to reduce the risk of construction.
After a number of improvements, the construction of the first rig created a mechanized stream of water, such as an excavator system, a puncture system, a suspension system, and a gallows upgrade system. The complete process mechanized operation of eye beating, bursting, shattering, template installation, concrete construction, etc., accelerated the construction process.
Eventually, after more than 1,200 day and night works, the rig successfully completed the excavation of 762.59 metres.
The Grand Swe Railway, which is 330 km long, is an important component of the international corridor in Central Myanmar and is an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the "one way" construction.
With the construction of the car, the travel time between Dalian and Reilly will be reduced from 6 hours to 2 hours on the current road, which will greatly improve transport patterns in the Fifi region, and will facilitate China ' s economic and trade cooperation and friendly interaction with South-East Asian countries.
Lin Jung-seok: As a Chinese, he was proud of his country's achievements.
Hong Kong press celebrates the 70th anniversary of the National Day.
"The Hong Kong press celebrates the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China", held in Hong Kong.
The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Lin Jung Qu-tae, in his speech at the wine conference, stated that the achievements of the country over the past 70 years are well known to the world and that we are proud as Chinese.

According to the message of Lin Jung Qu-tae, China has moved forward over the past 70 years and, even though it has faced a number of difficult challenges, we are proud to be Chinese, even though we have overcome the odds and have achieved achievements that are well known to the world as a whole.
When Hong Kong returned to its homeland, it was bound up with the Mainland to move forward together and share fruitful results.
It is believed that under the premise of "one country, two systems", Hong Kong will continue to have the advantage of taking advantage of the opportunities of the "one way" and the "one way" of Hong Kong, Australia and the Gulf of Hong Kong, in order to find a better future for Hong Kong.
She also said that every Hong Kong citizen had been affected by the social controversy of the past few months and that journalists faced different challenges.
At this critical juncture, it is hoped that the press friends will continue to face difficulties, act with professionalism, make just and balanced news reports for the society and do their part for the future of Hong Kong, and for the society to return to rational communication dialogue.
In his message, Kang said that the glorious journey of the new China was also one of Hong Kong's development and common progress with the motherland, blood ties and honours.
In particular, since the return of Hong Kong to its homeland, the Central Government has steadfastly pursued the principles of "one country, two systems", "the Hong Kong people rule Hong Kong" and "the Hong Kong people govern Hong Kong" and a high degree of self-government. Hong Kong has helped the Mainland and China to keep watch and watch, and has jointly created a miracle of mutual benefit and mutual success and economic prosperity.
To that end, the Hong Kong press gathered to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
He said that over the past three months there had been a series of violent activities in Hong Kong that were blatantly illegal and wantonly destabilizing the society, with some media outlets publishing distorted and false reports that contributed to the violence.
He called on the media to stir up awareness and create a good atmosphere for the population to resist violence and uphold the rule of law.
Professional media professionals adhere to journalistic and professional norms, use real reporting and responsible speech to guide citizens to self-consciously and violently dissipate, and uphold the fairness and authority of the law.
Some 500 people from all walks of life, including the Hong Kong press, attended the wine fair and raised their cups with the guest of honour to give their blessing on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The journalist learned from the publicity department of the Sinning City Council that the City of Sinning will implement the Regulation on Promotion of Civility in Sinning City as of October 1, focusing on 15 uncivil behaviour types such as pedestrians who do not follow traffic lights and throw objects out of buildings, setting out a list of priority governance issues and setting appropriate penalties.
Wang Xingbin, Deputy Minister of Communication and Director of the City Civilization Bureau of the Sinning City Council, described the marked improvement in civic civilization literacy and ethics since the city won the title of the nation ' s civilized city in 2017.
But uncivil behaviour such as pedestrians crossing the streets, breaking through red lights, non-motorized cars not following traffic lights, high-altitude objects, car window objects, smoking in public places, walking dogs in public places and allowing local defecation is still prominent and easy to bounce back, and needs to be addressed as soon as possible.
In conjunction with Sinning ' s reality, the regulations set a more comprehensive and higher standard of civilized conduct for individuals and units from a variety of areas, such as public places, public order, public facilities, public sanitation, civilized travel, civilized tourism, civilized Internet access, building civilized campuses, promoting civilized family building, performing public duties, honouring hero martyrs, medical care, etc., so that society as a whole understands what can be done and what can be promoted and what is prohibited.
"Promote regulations to eliminate blind spots and misperceptions in the area of civilized behavior, and provide a strong legal guarantee for the normalization of the work of popular spiritual civilization in Sinning City by comprehensive regulation of citizen behavior, homekeeping, meals, travel, education, tourism, Internet access, green life, wedding funeral rituals, etc. "
The Secretary-General of the General Committee of the Sinning City People's Congress said that he hated Huai Jun.

The British tourist car keys fell into the lake, and the whole family was trapped in France for five days.
In recent days, a couple from Wales, England, took two children on vacation to France and accidentally threw car keys into the lake. The whole family was forced to wait five days to get the new keys from the car manufacturer.
The couple then left France with the children.
It was reported that on 16 September local time, when the British family was looking at a lake in France, the daughter accidentally knocked over a bag and the car keys inside fell into the lake.
But they took hours and couldn't find the key.
And all their possessions and cash are locked in the car.
Although British tourists bought insurance before leaving, the insurance company refused to help on the grounds that the vehicle was not in danger of being stolen.
They had to hire a trailer to pull the car to a garage and store it, and then reorder the keys from the car manufacturer.
A few days later, British tourists finally got the key to the formulation and the couple left France with the children.
Their scheduled journey was cancelled because of the loss of car keys.

Pilot notification of commitment systems in areas such as licensing of food production in low-risk varieties and devolution of foreign business representation to self-trade zones
On 27 September, the Shanghai Municipal Market Regulatory Authority signed a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Pudong-New District to launch 20 market regulatory reform measures, some of which were pilot projects throughout the country.
According to the presentation, notification of the promise means that the administrative authorities, when dealing with the registration of permits, inform the applicant in writing of the conditions and requirements laid down in the laws and regulations once and for all.
Once the applicant has signed a promise, the executive branch can deal with it directly.
According to the memorandum of understanding, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority will support the registration of business names in the Pudong New Zone and the Shanghai Free Trade Pilot Area, and conduct licensing of food production for simple and low-risk varieties of process, partially measuring device type approvals, to inform commitment systems in three areas to make business access easier.
Shanghai Xinjin Live Food Co. Ltd. 27 obtained the Food Production Licence on the spot by notifying the promise, becoming the first company to benefit from the pilot dividend.
The head of the business said that food permits could also be obtained on the spot, and that the "admissible case" approach allowed the company to submit part of the material in accordance with the deadline agreed in the letter of commitment, "it actually felt the ease of the reform."
Shanghai market regulators indicated that the implementation of a notification commitment system for food production licences was a national pilot.
As a result of the reform, the processing process was reduced from six previously "Registration, Reception, On-site Verification, Sample Examination, Examination of Materials, Approval of Documents" to three "Registration, Reception, Approval of Certificates", and the closing time was reduced from 20 working days prior to the reform to immediate closure.
Taking into account the high outward orientation of the Pudong economy, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority has delegated registration authority to the Shanghai Self-Trade Zone of Permanent Representatives of Foreign (Regional) Enterprises in order to facilitate the proximity of enterprises.
Statistics show that the decentralization involved a total of 1,592 permanent representative institutions in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, 99 of which have been processed in accordance with the new regulations.
"11" long fake consumer survey: choice of more diversified tourism takes first place.
The long holidays for the National Day are approaching, and people's vacation plans are gradually being finalized.
In recent days, security daily journalists have launched a small survey in the circle of friends on the “XI” holiday arrangement. Nearly 20 feedbacks indicate that while plans vary, “tourism + consumption” became the key word for the “XI” holiday.
Specifically, in the feedback received by the Daily Securities Journal journalists, more than half chose to travel.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said, "It is planned to take his family to Shanghai during the 'XI' period, and Disney is the first stop, and then goes to the surrounding cities." Ms. Li and her family in Beijing chose to travel to Taiwan, "a family left on September 28th to plan a 10-day tour of the island"; Ms. Ma in Chongqing planned an exit tour, with Singapore as his destination; Mr. Zhang and his family in Hebei chose to travel on their own, saying, "The daughter is under two years old, it is
The report on the Trends of Residents Traveling and Traveling on the Golden Week of the 2019th National Day, published jointly with the same travel, shows that there is a clear trend towards rising consumption in the three subsectors of travel, residence and travel on the occasion of the Golden Week of the National Day this year.
There has been a steady increase in the penetration rate of aircraft, high iron travels and an increase in the demand for star hotels, personalized unmarked accommodation.
On September 23, the United States Mission published a report on trends in tourism consumption at the 2019th Fourth World Day, which shows that tourism consumption continues to thrive and shows an upward trend in the diversification of “food, shelter and play”.
More young people travel in favor of high-quality and distinctive experiences, and cultural tourism, night tourism, etc., continue to increase in heat.
In addition to tourism, various types of consumption demand were released centrally during the Eleventh.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the Daily Securities Journal reporter, "The main plan of this year’s ‘XI’ is to buy a car."
The staff of a Beijing car brand 4S store said to the Daily Securities Reporter that, in general, September and October of each year were referred to as the golden period for automobile sales.
During the "XI" period, the shop will launch a number of activities, such as drawing prizes, taking off to the shop, etc.
In addition, a number of brands have recently introduced new models, and it is expected that the boost to sales of new products will be more visible.
In the context of rising consumption trends, there is greater emphasis on meeting the needs of the spiritual dimension, and the share of services such as culture, education, etc. is rising.
Ms. Dou, who lives in Beijing, said, "Cultural and educational consumption has become the head of household consumption expenditure since the birth of the child.
This year 'XI' is full, going to the 'Catch Card' Planetarium, the Children's Theatre, a few family weekends to camp in tents at the Elk Museum, and some experimental lessons. "
Some insiders say that, theoretically, the population ' s consumption escalation path is the evolution of subsistence consumption towards developmental consumption and enjoyment consumption, with a substantial share of the enjoyment consumption being the coverage of service consumption.
As our economy continues to grow and the income level of our population rises, people are increasingly focusing on consumption demand at the spiritual level, and tourism and travel is a good way.
In particular, catch-up with the long holiday of the Eleventh National Day, with ample time, people are more willing to travel and consume, both to meet the spiritual demand for consumption and to reflect the population's rising consumption.
The afternoon started being lonely and unwilling to go out, and the children's absence has yet to be adjusted.
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
She wrote a few details about what she was going to do, and the character features of type A blood are getting stronger, and she feels uncomfortable.
Take the suit, buy the nutrients, pay, buy raw fish chips, Nana's snacks.
That's the reason for going out.
On the phone, thanks to Nanna, you just finished loving your sister, or you won't even have an excuse to buy snacks.
They laughed a couple of times and said the kid was on the phone and hung up.
The Nana light car jumped on the sidewalk, fell down honestly, and she knew she was sick, scared, and he didn't want to stay with me.
It's hard for her husband, Boo, to come back early.
Even the salad of the salmon with butter and butter is delicious, and then goes to the bedroom to watch TV on the bed.
Look at the wall, it's just 7 o'clock, the sun sets early in the sunrise, and it's dark.
The month was invented in the circle of friends, and today is Mid-Autumn.
Washed a bunch of grapes sent by friends, left half to Boo, left the rest in the favorite little flower bowl and took out to see the moon.
And Nana sat on the floor, and I ate grapes and she ate skins, and I threw up grape seeds so hard far away.
The moon is hidden in the clouds, so that the clouds are walking, the moon will suddenly appear, and the bright and dark will be a little sharp.
The poems about the moon are rife in their minds, and they only like it clearly: every time they come back, they'll come back and they'll cover the jade fence/the last round of the sky.
Maybe we gave the moon too much emotion. For me now, in fact, the word of God belongs to God, and Caesar belongs to Caesar is the best.
The moon goes to the moon, your emotions go to your own.
After eating the grapes, it's cold and cold.
The Nana Regiment had a small snoring sound at her feet, stood up and laid Nana's little blanket on her little house, and Nana was happy to lie on it.
Open the door and shout: "Are the bath waters burned?
The windows in the bathroom can't look at the moon. They can only feel the moon, turn off the lights in the bathroom, and pull the glass out.
No mooncake, no drink.
The Dubai Expo in 2020 released a mascot.
The 2020 Dubai Expo mascot launch ceremony was held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
The mascot consists of six cartoon images, including two Emirates children, three flying robots and one UAE tree of beans.
The launch presented the audience with information on six mascots through video clips.
A 9-year-old boy, Rashid, and an 8-year-old girl, Latifa, are brothers and sisters, representing the people of the United Arab Emirates.
Three robots correspond to the three subthemes of the present Expo, blue robots for "mobility", green robots for "sustainability", yellow robots for "opportunity".
An ancient bean tree named "Salama" is the "grandmother" of five little boys, symbolizing the ancestors who defended the land.
Ahmad, Chairman of the High Committee of the Dubai World Expo, said that mascots could strengthen emotional ties between large events and participants. "Believing that the mascot of Dubai Expo will convey the traditional spirit of storytelling, demonstrate the creativity of indigenous talent and express our ambitions and expectations."
The launch was attended by the Vice-President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates, Chief Mohammed of Dubai, Crown Prince Hamdan of Dubai, the Minister of State for International Cooperation of the United Arab Emirates and the Director of the Dubai World Bureau, Lim Hashimi.
The Dubai World Expo will be held in Dubai from 20 October 2020 to 10 April 2021, with the theme “Communicating ideas to create a future”.
This will be the first time the World Expo will be held in the Middle East region.
Chinese students can apply for German undergraduate studies on the basis of their high school grades starting next year.
In recent days, the Anabin database, which is responsible for assessing and certifying foreign educational qualifications in Germany, announced on the official network that starting in 2020, Chinese high school graduates can apply directly to German universities for undergraduate studies on the basis of their high school results and need not first enrol at domestic universities.
Prior to that, Chinese high school graduates wanted to apply to German universities and needed to study a semester (211,985) or three semesters (general undergraduate) in their country, and passed the APS or Testas examination.
The release of the new regulations may save Chinese students who wish to study in Germany for at least six months.
It is known that the new regulations will enter into force in the second half of 2019.
Applicants are required to fulfil: complete 12 years of formal compulsory education, obtain a high school diploma; participate in a meeting examination, a high examination, with grades of 70% and above of the total score (with a total score of 750 points, a score of more than 525 points) and include requirements such as two language performances and one mathematics or natural science achievement.
In addition, the requirements for performance in higher examinations vary from one specific profession to another.
For example, applying for medicine, oral medicine, veterinary medicine, pharmacology, etc., requires a full score of 80% for higher examinations, and the subject of higher examinations must include mathematics, physics, chemistry, at least two in biology, or participation in more than 80% for higher examinations, and the subject of higher examinations must include foreign languages, history, at least two in geography, or participation in more advanced studies.
According to incomplete statistics, several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, have now endorsed China ' s performance in the high exam.
In the United Kingdom, for example, universities such as Cambridge University, Birmingham University and Leicester University accept Chinese students to apply for admission on the basis of their higher grades.
The military "Machine Dogs" first attend acting classes.
The U.S. Army has funded the development of a "machine dog" for the battlefield, and may be on the circus stage even more now!
The Sun Circus has recently indicated that it is in contact with Boston Dynamic Technology Corporation (Boston Dynamics), which develops robots, to discuss the feasibility of robot applications for circus performances.
In a comprehensive foreign media report, Boston Power Technology announced on 24th a promotional film entitled "Spot, a four-foot robot", which shows Spot to be an agile mobile robot with a 14-kilogram capacity with high mobility to cross-country terrain, 360 degrees of shelter function, navigation, remote control and autonomy.
In particular, Spot has exclusive software platforms specifically developed for Spot, and users can customize Spot robotic functions through various applications.
Boston Dynamics and Technology first published the idea of a machine dog in 1992, causing a sensation, but it has still not really been put into commercial applications.
Boston Dynamics and Technology, however, states that Spot is now in the mass production phase, with a majority of ordering people predominantly in the construction and energy industries.
In addition, the Sun Circus is currently in contact with Boston Dynamic Technology, and the Sun Circus said that the plan was still in the conceptual stage and was assessing Spot's potential for use at the performance site.
The State Council Press Office published the White Paper "China and the World in a New Age"
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China, the State Council ' s Press Office issued the White Paper " China and the World in the New Age " on 27th.
The Vice-Minister of China and Chief of the Press Office of the State Council said that the White Paper focused on “Where China comes from and where it goes” and “What kind of world China promotes to build” and “How China grows to live with the world”, and systematically described China's development achievements, development paths and trends, and elaborated on China's relations with the world in depth, in order to enhance the international community's understanding and understanding of China's development.
According to the White Paper, over the past 70 years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, China has undergone dramatic changes that have created a miracle of development unprecedented in human history, especially since the Party ' s eighteenth anniversary, and China ' s development has achieved historic achievements and made historic changes.
Through a wealth of data and facts, the White Paper describes the great achievements, significance and world contribution of China ' s development over the past 70 years.
According to the White Paper, China has spent decades through the hundreds of years of development that developed countries have gone through. The economy is the second largest in the world. Nearly 1.4 billion people have emerged from material shortages, have generally reached the level of well-being and enjoy unprecedented dignity and rights.
The White Paper stresses that for 70 years, the Chinese people have come home with nothing but self-reliance and struggled hard to bring about a new world; for 70 years, China has developed in interaction with the world, embraced the world, learned the world and contributed to it; and for 70 years, China has contributed to world peace while achieving self-development and has injected momentum into the common development of all nations.
The White Paper states that China ' s development has been successful over the past 70 years, the fundamental reason being that, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have found the correct path of development of the socialism of the Chinese identity and are steadfast in their pursuit of that path.
The White Paper stresses that China ' s unique socialist path is a path based on the country ' s national circumstances, a path that puts the interests of the people first, a path of reform and innovation, a path to common development in openness, and a path to a comprehensive State governed by the rule of law.
China ' s development path is consistent with China ' s national circumstances and will be adapted to the requirements of the times. It will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.
In response to the concerns of the international community regarding China ' s development, the White Paper stresses that achieving the country ' s wealth and strength, national revitalization and the well-being of its people is both a dream of the Chinese people and a common dream of all peoples.
The White Paper states that China is the main stabilizer and engine of economic growth in the world, that full-scale openness to the outside world creates more opportunities for development in all countries, that China provides the international community with more public goods, that China ' s development provides experience and lessons for other developing countries, and that China will never follow the path of "the powerful and the powerful."
Faced with the question of the "What is wrong with the world, what is wrong with humanity", the White Paper states that today's world is in the midst of a century of great change and that human society is both hopeful and challenging.
China ' s offer to build a community of human destinies and open up new development paths of cooperation and win-win and build-and-share development offers new options for human development.
The White Paper calls on all nations to unite, build new international relations, promote new economic globalization, preserve the international system with the United Nations at its core, promote exchanges of civilizations, and jointly contribute to building a community of human destinies and a better world.
With the growing development of China, the international community is generally concerned about how developing China can live with the world.
The White Paper states that China cannot develop without the world, and that the world cannot develop and prosper peacefully without China.
China has always placed its own development in the system of coordinates of human development. China insists on cooperation and win-win and co-development, insists on maintaining and promoting economic globalization, actively develops global partnership, firmly supports multilateralism, upholds international justice and equity, promotes the building of a "one-way" high-quality development, actively participates in leading the reform and construction of the global governance system, and always acts as a builder of world peace, contributor to global development and guardian of the international order.
At present, China's development has entered a new era.
The White Paper states that China in the new era will not change its determination to follow the socialist path of Chinese identity. The determination to learn from each other and to cooperate and win will not change, and the determination to work with the world will not change.
The White Paper concluded by stating that the future destinies of nations in today's world have never been as closely connected as they are now.

The White Paper was published in eight languages, Chinese, English, French, Russian, German, Western, A, Japanese, etc., and was published separately by the People ' s Press and the Foreign Press, and distributed in Xinhua Bookshops throughout the country.
Is Marv going to be a by-election at the Dumpy-Ai conference in Johor?
The Governor of Ma Wah, Nadok Slyswei, said, "Go to the Supreme Council of the National Front for discussion!"
In the immediate run-up to the Danish-Ai by-election, it was a matter of concern whether Ma Wah, a member of the National Front Party, would take up the traditional national seat.
However, after the meeting of the Mahua Central Committee, it was announced that the Supreme Council of the National Front would decide whether the Mahua traditional seat would continue to be taken up by Ma Wah or replaced by other members of the party.
After chairing the meeting of the Mahua Central Committee on Thursday afternoon, Wei Jiaxiang said to the media that any by-election would be conducted in accordance with the SOP, i.e. only after the meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front.
He said that the meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front was expected to take place in early October, as the Election Commission would meet only next Monday (1 day) to finalize the By-elections for the Danfung Bing.
"Tomorrow yesterday morning, I also met with the President of the National Front, Datos Ali Amalzahi, and we all agreed that it was necessary to regain this seat from the Alliance of Hope."
“We have decided to convene a meeting of the leaders of the Special National Front in early October, and the leaders of the three parties of the National Front will determine which of the member parties will take up the battle.”
Wei Jiaxiang reiterated that, as head of Ma Wah General, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures, and therefore any decision must have a national consensus.
"In any by-election, it is a common thing for people to be willing to march, for political parties and for parties to think that they should come out."
"What organization and political alliance do we come from?"
"This is a great test for us to form a political alliance over the years, and we believe that the National Front has come all the way with some valuable values."
"In this process, someone might say something, which is not surprising."
"But once the Supreme Council of the National Front has made a decision, everyone must be ready for war, which is the most valuable."
In any case, Wei Jiaxiang said that Ma Wah would make every effort at three levels, namely the regional council, the state board and the central council, to prepare for the coming Danish-Ai by-election.
"The district council is led by the chairman of the district council (Danflebai) with the head of the regional council with the head of the regional council with the head of the central council of the state with the head of the council with the head of the head of the council of Juju State with the head of the head of the board with the head of the council with the head of the central board with the head of the board with the head of the board with the head of the board with the head of the board with the head of the board with the head of the board with the head of the
Last Saturday, Congressman Nadhu Mohamal Fari, an indigenous unity party, died in a stupid Jin government hospital, 42 years old.
A villager in Bachong County, Hubei, was ordered to hunt wildlife "compulsory patrol of mountains".
A villager in Paikang County, Hubei, was sentenced for hunting wildlife and ordered to compensate him for the cost of repairing environmental damage to ecological resources in the amount of 15420 yuan (RMB, lower).
Due to the indigence of the defendant ' s family, the prosecutor ' s office introduced alternative labour compensation for ecological restoration costs, bringing about an organic harmonization of legal and social effects.
On 27th, Wang Chung Liang, Deputy Attorney General of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Pao Kang County, explained that, through alternative labour, such as three months of "compulsory tour of mountains", the accused has established deep feelings with wild monkeys and is deeply responsible for the previous hunting of animals.
On 21 June of this year, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of Pavang County filed a civil public interest suit in the area of ecological resources, which was heard in the county court and handed down in court.
The defendant was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment, four years ' probation and a fine of $3,000, and was ordered to compensate him for the cost of repairing environmental damage to ecological resources in the amount of $15420.
According to the survey, starting in late January 2014, Cho started setting up electrical grids on the cliffs and hunting for more than 20 wildlife species, including falcons, pelicans, fur crown deer, etc.
The falcons belong to the second-tier endangered wildlife conservation animal, and the twigs and mary coronding deer are listed in the National Land Wildlife Conservation List.
During the trial, Chow confessed to his wrong facts and conduct and was willing to assume incidental civil liability.
However, taking into account the poor economic situation of one of the families in Zhou's district, the local village council, forest station, and one of Zhou's three parties, coordinated by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Paikang county, entered into an agreement on the cost of alternative labour compensation for ecological restoration, i.e. the cost of providing public goods to cover the cost of ecological restoration for one year, i.e., the cost of training and caring for monkeys in the village monkey reserve, the obligation to patrol mountains and forest protection.
In response to the prosecutor's recommendation, the court accepted and agreed to actively fulfil the obligation of “alternative labour compensation for ecological restoration costs” while executing a suspended sentence at a certain time of week.
At present, Zhou Xiao has been working on a mandatory basis for three months in the Monkey Reserve, visiting the mountains positively and performing well.
In recent years, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the Prefectural District of Bainkang has integrated the prosecution function and the conduct of social governance in practice. Science uses methods of supervision such as prosecutorial advice, investigation supervision, litigation supervision, etc. to minimize damage to the ecological environment caused by criminal acts through judicial means.
The United Nations awards the Earth's Guardian Award for the Ant Forest.
In a warm round of applause and resounding music, the ants Forest project leader, Xu Di, and the user representative Shen Xiao Liang went to the podium to receive the 2019 United Nations Earthguard award from the moderator.
In 2019, the Earthguard award ceremony was held in New York, USA, on the 26th of which the "Incentive and Action Award" was awarded to the "Ant Forest" project, which uses cellular small program to engage hundreds of millions of people in environmental action.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced its winning list at its headquarters in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, but the people who participated in the award ceremony on that day were still very excited.
Inner Andersen, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, in an interview with Xinhua News Agency journalist, said that the Ant Forest is an exciting innovation that brings hundreds of millions of people to action to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans can do about the environment.
It connects people and the environment with technology and allows each individual to participate in actions to protect the Earth, which will have a huge impact.
"Ant Forest" was launched in August 2016 by the Chinese Ant Financial Services Group (known as the ants' Golden Clothes) on the payment platform. Users accumulated "green energy" through low carbon actions such as recording their daily green travels in the Ant Forest and online payments for electricity and water, and "plant trees" on their mobile phones.
Each time the user grows a virtual tree, the ant forest and the public good partner plant a real tree in the area of desertification.
As of August of this year, 500 million ants forest users had accumulated 7.92 million tonnes of carbon emissions, and 122 million trees had been planted in areas of desertification.
Costa Rica won the Earthguard Prize for national environmental efforts, and Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado praised the contribution of the Ant Forest on the spot. "It was impressive to inspire so many people to participate in green action."
The President and Chief Executive Officer of the ants' Golden Clothes said that the "Earthguard Award" was an affirmation of the Ant Forest project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for people to participate in low-carbon life, an honour that belongs to all participants.
Ii Hyunjing said that the ant forest has affected 500 million people over the past three years and that the objective of the ant forest over the next three years is to engage 1 billion people globally in low carbon actions.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to increase farmers ' income from green water in the mountains.
In addition to providing employment through tree planting, it is hoped that farmers will be helped to achieve increased harvests through agricultural development projects, electrical platforms, etc.
The pro bono environmental model created by the Ant Forest, based on digital technology, has also been successful in the sea and has been emulated by other countries.
Last June, the largest electronic wallet in the Philippines, GCash, launched the Philippine version of the Ant Forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low carbon living.
It was stated that GCash would work with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines, the Environmental Public Interest Organization and others to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the start of the project.
The Earthguard Award is the highest United Nations award in the field of environmental protection and is awarded once a year.
"Ant Forest" was awarded the "Incentive and Action Award" award from China for the third consecutive year of the Green Innovation Project from China, following the construction of the Xaihan Dam Forest Field in China and the `Kijiang Village Model, Manjiang Village Fixing' project in Zhejiang Province, China.
Trade friction affects the U.S. economy's Report Card.
The United States Economic Report Card for the second quarter of this year showed that, as a result of the sharp decline in private sector investment and exports, the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate in the United States was significantly slower than in the previous quarter.
Analysts pointed out that the economic and trade friction and the uncertainty it created were the main causes of the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data released by the US Department of Commerce on 26th show that US GDP grew by 2% at annual rates in the second quarter, which is the same as the previously published revised data, but is significantly lower than 3.1% in the first quarter.
Data show that consumer growth is the main factor underpinning the growth of the United States economy in the second quarter.
Individual consumption spending, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the total United States economy, increased by 4.6 per cent in the current season, driving economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government spending on consumption and investment boosted economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment fell 6.3 per cent in the second quarter over the previous quarter, dragging 1.16 percentage points of economic growth in the same season; exports fell 5.7 per cent over the previous quarter, and net exports dragged 0.68 percentage points of economic growth in the same season.
Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ensaid's macroeconomic consulting firm in the United States, said that private sector investment had not only failed to maintain the momentum of last year's growth, but had declined significantly because of the impact of economic and trade friction and rising uncertainty on business confidence.
Knap believes that, under the influence of policy uncertainty, US corporate capital spending is expected to continue to decline next year.
According to analysts, while consumption growth has strongly supported the US economy in the second quarter, there are growing signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty they bring have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected US consumption prospects.
Richard Courting, the head of the survey and professor of economics at the University of Michigan, has recently stated that in the most recent survey, 38 per cent of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the United States economy, a proportion that has been at a new high in a year and a half.
For future economic trends in the United States, analysts generally agree that the United States economy will continue to slow down.
However, it was also suggested that the performance of the United States industrial sector and financial markets would improve if economic and trade friction were eased.
Karin Burch, a global economist from the British think tank of economics, predicts that the United States economy will continue its downward trend since this year and will increase at a much lower rate than in the second quarter.
The chief economist of Moody's analysis company, Mark Zandy, predicts that the US economy will grow 2.3% this year, assuming that the economic and trade friction will not continue to escalate, and will further slow down to 1.6% next year.
Ellen Hazen, the investment manager of Patnan Investment Corporation, noted that the biggest concern of the current firm was the economic and trade dispute and the uncertainty it created, which would be significantly reduced if economic and trade disputes were resolved, and the industrial sector would perform much better than it is today.
Matt Melley, the stock strategist of Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said that the economic and trade friction remained the "first issue" and was the main cause of the significant volatility in US capital markets this year, and that the proper resolution of the economic and trade friction would be key to influencing the direction of US capital markets for the rest of the year.
Ningxia's first husband and wife shared parental leave, and parents of children aged 0 to 3 could take 10 days a year.
Protecting the legitimate rights and interests of women is an expression of respect for and protection of human rights and an important sign of the progress of social civilization.
On 27 September, the Regulations on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women in the Ningxia Autonomous Region were adopted by a high vote at the fifteenth session of the Standing Committee of the Twelfth Session of the Ningxia Autonomous Region.
This is the local regulation issued by Ningxia's first provincial department on the comprehensive and systematic defence of women's legitimate rights and interests, which will be formally implemented as of 1 November 2019.
It is understood that the Regulations adopted on this occasion were amended on the basis of the 2007 Ningxia Measures for Implementing the Law of the People ' s Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women, divided into nine chapters and 65 articles, including general principles, political rights, cultural and educational rights and interests, labour and social security rights and interests, property rights and interests, personal rights, marital and family rights, legal responsibilities and by-laws.
In the Regulations, Ningxia encouraged the exploration of joint parental leave for couples, which was the first in the country.
In April of this year, the Guidance for Promoting the Development of Child Care Services for Children under 3 years of age, issued by the Office of the State Council, was described as relevant for the joint raising of children by couples.
During the revision of the Regulations, Ningxia introduced an innovative proposal to "encourage employers to grant ten days of joint parental leave each year between the ages of 0 and 3 for couples with children who comply with the law and regulations".
At the same time, the Ordinance highlights anti-sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative results in China ' s current Civil Code Book of Personal Rights, and details the constituent elements of sexual harassment, subjects and mechanisms against sexual harassment, etc.
Section 44 of the Ordinance explicitly prohibits the frequent incidence of sexual assault on girls and requires educational institutions to undertake relevant educational, protective and preventive work as a new standard for the protection of girls in local legislation.
With regard to women ' s right to know and dispose of the common property of the marital family, article 35 of the Ordinance clearly states that women ' s right to know about the common property and the obligations of the property register and related subjects provide solid institutional support for women ' s rights.
In addition, in response to the social issue of gender discrimination in employment, article 26 of the Ordinance prohibits not only direct discrimination, but also indirect discrimination, and draws on the latest experience of joint interview practice, enhances penalties for gender discrimination offences and more vigorously defends the legitimate rights and interests of women.
In recent years, the work of the Ningxia Women's Union's Joint Public Prosecution and Law Division, Civil Administration etc. in promoting and introducing social and professional forces to participate in marital and family dispute mediation and anti-domestic violence has been very effective.
The Regulations summarize and promote this, and various articles encourage the mobilization of social forces, the accumulation of social resources and the defence of women ' s rights and interests, and require the people ' s governments at and above the county level to provide stable and institutional guarantees and support through, inter alia, the purchase of services.
Inner Mongolia, the workstation of the UNITA Yuanlong Pilgrim is resistant to salty rice acre production of rice.
The journalist learned from the UNITA Administration Administration Agency of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on 27th that the "Saline-resistant rice field survey and evaluation council at the UNITA Yuan Long Pilgrim Workstation" recently held in the Allies had uploaded good news that the average acre production of saline rice had broken down by 1,000 kilograms.
A team of six experts from the Heilongjiang Province Agricultural Academy of Sciences, Yangzhou University and Hunan Province Agricultural Rural Office conducted a sampling of the “Saline Series” rice harvest on site.
According to expert evaluation, the average acre production of saline rice amounted to 508.8 kg on a pH value of 8.8 to 9.6, with salt content of 5 to 6 per thousand.
Wang Shigang, the executive director of the UNITA Yuanlong Pilgrim station, said, "We intend to build on this year’s experiment and to innovate, and reform, so that salt-resistant rice varieties can again be cultivated and optimized, making them better and more productive."
The Vice-President and Researcher of the Heilongjiang Agricultural Academy of Sciences, head of the Group of Experts on Production Measurements, came here to say: "In the absence of any change in the factors of production, I believe that the continued intensification of the technology offensive will continue to bring miracles to salt-resistant rice."
UNITA is part of the group of special hardship areas of the Great Hing and Ring and Ring and Nam.
In October 2018, Yuan Long Pilgrim worked at UNITA to show up.
Yuan Long Pilgrim led the expert team to accelerate the introduction and promotion of the newly developed "salin-resistant hybrid rice" varieties and advanced technologies, build 960 acres of salin-resistant rice bases on the right-wing central flag of Koljong, use side tests to demonstrate side-by-side, and promote technology routes to boost the productivity of the local poor and lift them out of poverty and wealth.
This field-testing of salt-resistant rice not only injected hope into the upgrading of UNITA salt-based low- and medium-yielding fields into middle-high-yielding fields, but also provided a scientific basis for saline rice cultivation under the same conditions in our country.
The new Australian state passed the legalisation of abortion bill on September 26, local time, after marathon debates and weeks of protests, as reported by the Australian Net.
According to the information received, the bill has generated political debate in the past eight weeks, and there have been serious differences within the AFP since the independent Member of Parliament Greenwich announced its introduction.
It was reported that, after nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Australasia Senate passed the legalisation of abortion bill by 26 votes to 14, making it the third-long bill to be considered by the new state Senate.
In the morning, after a final vote in the House of Representatives of the new state, abortion was legalized in the new state.
The Act allows a woman to terminate her pregnancy on the 22nd week of pregnancy and, if two doctors agree, also allows a woman to have an abortion later in pregnancy.
On the evening of 25th of the Senate, an amendment was adopted whereby doctors can seek advice from the multidisciplinary team of the hospital advisory committee before performing an abortion for a woman after the 22nd week of pregnancy.
In addition, the amendments adopted by the Senate included the need for doctors to provide proper care for babies who survived the termination of pregnancy.
Previously, the Governor of the new state, Berrijiklin, had faced public criticism from conservatives on the bill, and Berjiklin had intervened many times to secure more debate time for the bill, but she was not present at the final vote.
Berrijiklin defended his absentee vote by saying, "I need time to run the whole new state."
It was reported that AFP Congressman Davis was the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, threatened to withdraw from the new state government because of the bill, and claimed that the bill triggered a “government crisis”.
But then Davis gave in.
Davis said, "The content of the amendment to the abortion legalisation bill submitted to the House of Representatives on the morning of 26 actually provides more guarantees for women, doctors. "
Meanwhile, Bari Laro, leader of the New Australian National Party, said he was proud to be a member of the government that legalized abortion.
"What we achieved last night is historic for the new state, which legalizes abortion, which is no longer a criminal offence, and does not treat abortion women as criminals."
Three groups of major projects are located in Chihuahua.
A total investment of 15 billion yuan focused on the development of oil intelligence equipment and the intelligent steel industry.
Today, the People's Government of the city of Changzhou has held a project signing ceremony with the Trinity Group.
The Trinity Group has invested $15 billion in industrial projects such as the intelligent steel industry, oil intelligence equipment and regional research and development centres (headquarters bases) and the second-hand car market for engineering machinery in Changzhou, which are expected to exceed $200 billion annually.
The Trinity Iron and Steel Industry Project, with a total investment of $10 billion, is located in the Hodang district and will focus on creating the largest iron and steel and product trading centre throughout the province and even in the centre. It will also be an intelligent manufacturing and processing centre for triad metal structures.

Minister of Finance Liu Quin: 67 Yan enterprises and financial institutions have transferred $8.601 billion from the State to strengthen the Social Security Fund.
The Minister of Finance, Liu Quan, stated on 27th day that 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions had completed the transfer of part of the State capital enhancement social security fund, totalling approximately 8601 billion yuan.
Liu Qun made the above statement at the deployment of the task of the National Transfer of Part of the State Capital for the Work of the Social Security Fund, which was co-organized by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the National Finance Committee on that day.
"The transfer of a part of the State-owned capital enhancement social security fund is an important initiative to reform and improve the basic pension insurance system. It is an adequate reflection of the universal sharing of the results of State-owned enterprise development and the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system. It is a policy measure that is based on the present and takes into account the long term."
In 2017, the State Council issued the Program for the Implementation of the Transfer of Part of the State Capital Supplement of the Social Security Fund, which calls for the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces for piloting.
According to Liu Qun, the transfer of pre-work has had positive results.
At the central level, three batches of conversions of 67 central enterprises and financial institutions were completed, with a total of about 8601 billion yuan in State-owned capital transferred.
Of these, the transfer of central financial institutions in which the Ministry of Finance carries out the responsibilities of funders has been largely completed.
Central business transfer has reached a certain size.
At the local level, the pre-transfer of enterprises has been carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, pilot work had been largely completed in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces, transferring State-owned capital of 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces undertook successive pre-transfer preparations, which laid the foundation for the next transition.
According to a joint circular issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the National Finance Committee, the General Tax Administration and the CVM, the central and local transfer of part of the State capital to the SWF was fully opened in 2019 and substantially completed by 2020.
The meeting that took place on that day made concrete deployments for the full roll-out of the transfer.
It was stressed that the transfer process should be completed pragmatically and efficiently.
"According to the schedule, the transfer process is to be substantially completed by 2020.
The shift time is tight and the task is heavy."
Liu Quan said that the regions and departments need to be well organized and well organized to ensure that the transfer is completed as required; work is firmly advanced to accurately grasp the content of the transfer policy; communication coordination is strengthened and difficult issues are resolved in a timely manner.
The transfer of state funds to the Social Security Fund (SWF) – from the point of departure of the SWF money bag, the destination is to provide strong support for old-age security.
However, in the view of the author, this is not a simple "physical shift" of equity, but it opens the "mathematical addition".
On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human and Social Welfare, the State Finance Committee, the General Tax Administration and the CSRC jointly issued the Circular on the Full Promotion of the Transfer of Part of the State Capital for the Work of the Social Security Fund, which specifies the timetable for the conversion of the State capital to the Social Security Fund, i.e. the central and local transfer of part of the State Capital for the Work of the Social Security Fund was fully opened in 2019.
Once the documents were published, departments such as the Ministry of Finance were implemented very quickly.
On 25 September, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10 per cent of the holdings of business and industry banks and agricultural banks to the Social Security Fund, and the total value of the transfers exceeded 115 billion yuan.
According to the regulations, subjects such as the Social Security Foundation, as financial investors, enjoy the right to gain, dispose of and know the shares allocated to the State.
In the announcement, the WB, the WB stated that this change of interest would not result in a change in the shareholders and actual owners of the WB.
In response, I believe that similar state entrepreneurship transfer is not a simple change in equity attribution, but a "additional algorithm" that stimulates a range of effects.
The "plus results" of the first step in the conversion of part of the state capital to social security naturally reflect the universal ownership of state-owned enterprises and the shared development outcomes of all.
After many years of reform and development, State enterprises, especially China, are mostly in important sectors and areas of our economy, with greater and more stable overall profitability.
Among them, the leading business is more successful in achieving meritorious performance on a continuous basis.
On 10 July, the Standing Meeting of the State Council decided that this year the transfer of part of the State capital to strengthen the work of the Social Security Fund would be fully rolled out.
The Ministry of Finance then indicated that it would work with the relevant departments to fully promote the transfer of part of the State capital to the Social Security Fund, in accordance with the deployment of the State Council ' s Standing Meeting, fully reflecting the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system and the universal sharing of the results of State enterprise development.
The second step of the transfer, "plus results", is to enhance the sustainability of our social security fund and further consolidate the foundations of the social security system for old age.
With the ageing of the population, our social security funds are under pressure, and most of the national funds that have been transferred this time have the ability to sustain profits and dividends, not only to effectively replenish the social security fund, but also to provide the source of the living water for the social security fund.
The calculation shows that for every 3.8 percentage points of State capital transferred, the contribution rate of basic pension insurance for enterprises is reduced by 1 percentage point.
The third step of the transfer, "plus results", is to add stabilizers to capital markets.
The transfer recipient receives the proceeds in a way that is "primarily rededicated and operated as an aid".
The Social Security Fund, as a financial investor of state-owned capital, does focus on receiving dividends from equity.
However, the Social Security Fund, as a value investor in capital markets, has a relatively strong capital working capacity.
For listed assets of state-owned capital, the participation of SWF in holding shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, contribute to upgrading the level of business operations and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the Social Security Fund, as the investment wind signpost, has increased its shareholding weight, which has helped to further enhance its influence in the market and act as a “stabilizer” in the market.
It is also conducive to the full realization of the “value discovery” function of institutional investors, leading investors to invest rationally and in value.
Karl Hartmann was admitted to Leipzig School of Music at the age of 18, after which he was trained from Webburn.
After the Nazis came to power, Hartmann first resisted in the form of works not published in Germany, and even stopped writing.
In 1933, he created a symphony suffering (Miserae) and dedicated it to "My long-sleeping friends".
In 1935, this symphony was inaugurated in Prague, but was harassed by Nazi bureaucrats.
After that, Hartmann resolved not to play any of his works under Nazi rule.
Hartmann's funeral concert was a violin and string concerto, when the manuscript of the song was stolen from Germany and its premiere was held in Switzerland.
Please listen to the funeral concert of the Berne indoor orchestra at Beethoven Music Festival in 2018.
The United States Senate approved Scalia as Minister of Labor - Xinhuanet.
Xinhua Society, Washington, D.C., on September 26th, the Senate of the United States Congress voted on President Trump's nomination of Eugene Scalia as Minister of Labour.
The result was 53 votes in favour, 44 against, and none of the Democrats voted in favour of Scalia.
Republicans believe that Scalia's curriculum vitae makes him very suitable for the position of Minister of Labour.
But it seems to the Democrats that Scalia has long stood against workers and trade unions in the course of her legal career.
Scalia will replace Alexander Acosta.
Acosta, then Minister of Labour, announced his resignation in July this year, under great pressure from public opinion, because he was accused of “broadening treatment” of Jeffrey Eppstein, the billionaire of the United States on suspicion of sexual assault and trafficking of young girls.
Scalia is 56 years old and is a partner in a well-known law firm in the United States. His father is Antonin Scalia, the late Chief Justice of the United States Federal Supreme Court.
The Department of Labor is a cabinet-level department of the United States federal government responsible for labour-related matters, etc.
The White House also issued a statement on the same day that Trump had nominated Peter Guena, Acting Director of the Federal Emergency Measures Agency, to head the agency.
In accordance with the procedure, the nomination of Guena must also be approved by the Senate of the National Assembly.
The Federal Emergency Measures Agency is part of the United States Department of Homeland Security and coordinates federal government resources to deal with emergencies such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks and follow-up in the United States.
Since the first military parade on the thirty-fifth anniversary of the National Day, each major military parade has seen the emergence of a "big no-man" front line for strategic missile forces.
"This national day is the first time that the rocket army has come to light after the `military' changed to `military'."
Wang Bo, Chief of Command of the Rocket Army Equipment Team, said.
The missile-visited forces fully promote a spirit that is particularly painful, particularly capable of fighting, especially capable of contributing. They conduct detailed training, scientific group training, and the whole course of military training reflects three main features. It displays a good strategic military image, with a greater focus on hard practice.
During this military parade, both generals and soldiers were strictly required by standards to create a culture of aggressiveness and banishment.
They also focus on promoting the spirit of the craftsmen, grasping each detail, practicing technology, perseverance and practice, forming features such as "arm positions, speed, words, etc.", constantly crafting a powerful missile dynasty, with a greater focus on technological innovation and innovation.
The rocket army as a high-tech strategic army, science, technology and innovation are good traditions and advantages.
On the basis of past experience, they broke the mindset and broke the traditional approach, using advanced means such as satellite positioning, laser range measurement, high-resolution imaging, real-time speed measurement, to upgrade the training level and quality efficiency and to ensure that human vehicles are integrated in milligrams, and that the action of the teams is done in equal seconds, and that they are more responsive to the actual standards of engagement.
The rocket army was asked to adhere to the same standards and higher requirements as the military parade and launch site, to hold every gate, to keep a close eye on every detail, to make the troops subject to the hammer of fire, and to make the national parade field truly a training ground and a test ground to enhance the force's ability to fight.
Iran has been confirmed to develop advanced centrifuges and further suspend the implementation of Iran's nuclear agreement.
According to the Central Agency, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on 26 September that Iran has once again violated the Iran nuclear agreement by using advanced centrifugal mechanisms to enrich uranium.
It was reported that Iran was gradually violating the restrictions of the Iran nuclear agreement in response to President Trump ' s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement in May 2018 and the resumption and strengthening of sanctions against Iran.
Iran suspended two other commitments in July to keep its enriched uranium stock below 300 kg, and the purity of enriched uranium does not exceed 3.67%, and there is now a further move.
According to the nuclear agreement, Iran can only accumulate enriched uranium by installing about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz, and only allow Iran to use a small number of more advanced types of machines for research, but not produce enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for the production of nuclear bombs.
The report states that the International Atomic Energy Agency report states: "On September 25, the Agency confirmed that Iran's advanced centrifuges of Type 2 or 3 R & D machines are accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium."
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency submitted this report to Member States on 26th, and a diplomatic official responded: "They are busy at the Natanz enrichment facility."

The Italian Minister of Education proposed a sugar tax to protect the health of the population.
The new Italian government, Cabinet Minister of Education and member of the Five Star movement Lorenzo Fiolamonti, submitted a motion to Parliament to propose to the Italian Government a new tax policy on sugar-rich drinks, snacks and airline tickets.
According to reports, pursuant to the bill motion of the Minister of Education, Fiolamonti, the Italian Government will impose a zero-food tax on dietary products that are harmful to health, such as sugary beverages, snacks, etc., while imposing environmental taxes on airline tickets, charging 1 euro for domestic flights and 1.5 euros for international classes.
Fiolamonti said that the government expected 3 billion euros in tax revenues through a seemingly small set of tax measures.
Funds derived from this tax will be used in the fields of education, health and environmental protection.
In response, Italian Prime Minister Conte said he saw it as a viable option; Italian Congressman, European MP, and Alliance Party leader Salvini sarcasticly said, "Please hide dessert, cookies, bread and candy, because the new government is about to start collecting a snack tax."
According to the report, the zero-food tax refers generally to a special tax on sugary beverages and high-heat foods.
The tax will help bring benefits to public health.

China ' s development offers new opportunities for the development of countries around the world, including Canada, and benefits all peoples.
As Tsang Peng-wo stressed, the development history of China-China relations over the past 50 years has shown that it is only by adhering to the principles of equality and mutual respect that relations between the two countries can move forward on the right track.
On the other hand, relations between the two countries will be frustrated, and the interests of the two countries will be undermined.
China is not responsible for the serious difficulties encountered in relations between China and China.
"Ringer also has to be the bell man."
It is hoped that the two sides will soon come up with an appropriate solution to the problems highlighted in their bilateral relations in order to create the conditions for their relations to get back on track.

The first 100 degrees of autopilot taxis started a pilot operation.
Yesterday, 100 degrees announced in Changsha that the pilot operation of Robotaxi of the autopilot taxi team was officially opened.
The first 45 Apollo, developed jointly with a red flag, started piloting the Red Flag EV Robotaxi convoy at the open test section of the Changsha section.
From this day onward, ordinary Changsha citizens can access the Apollo official network and apply to become seed users and have an opportunity to try and access the experience.
An experienced passenger said he sat in the back row of the vehicle and clicked on the passenger seat front screen, and one key opened the autopilot of the vehicle.
In the vehicle, in order to ensure the safety of passengers and the requirements of current policy and regulations, the pilot vehicle is equipped with a safety officer in the driver ' s seat to maximize the safety of passengers.
During the course of the journey, vehicles can make intelligent diversions depending on the condition of the road, and they can also determine the condition of the surrounding vehicle and make automatic concessions in cases of near-distance overcarrying, etc.
Throughout the experience, the passenger area screen shows in real time the road conditions of pedestrians, cars and even some traditional blind areas on the side of the road.
Even in case of vehicle blockage, information such as changes in front red and green lights and waiting times can be seen in advance, and all traffic conditions are clear.
Unmanned people have heard of it on television before, thinking it's far away from us, but it feels amazing to find it in our lives today.
We expect it to truly enter civilian life in the future.
In June 2019, Apollo obtained 45 human test plates issued by the Changsha municipality.
At present, Changsha's autopilot tests open roads, passing through Changsha City's artificial intelligence technology city, May Creek Lake, Ocean Lake, Great Wangshan, High New Zone, etc., reaching 135 km, the demonstration area covers 70 km2 of the longest and largest Chinese road, covering the most complex scenes, and the most advanced intelligent driving demonstration area in the coordinated infrastructure.
It is expected that by the end of 2019, the Apollo Robotaxi convoy will cover about 50 km of the pilot operating road in Changsha, with plans to cover 135 km of the road currently open in Changsha in the first half of 2020.
The women's platoon still has a grudge against Ping: it's hard to beat strong teams so many times.
In Beijing time 27 p.m., the Chinese women's platoon met in the ninth competition of the 2019 women's world cup. The rivals were strong Dutch women's rows. China's women's rows 3:1 won the Dutch women's row, and the women's World Cup nine won.
But after the game, the female platoon leader, Mr. Ping, expressed his dissatisfaction with the performance of the third round of the team.
"The third round has increased the aggressiveness of the hairball, and some of us can't hit the ball without it, and we've made a lot of mistakes."
"It's hard to fight with a strong team and make so many mistakes."
He said after an interview he said:
"We said to the team to focus on the attack, we're going to strike the readjustment, and we're going to defend ourselves against each other."
Luang Ping also commented on Zhang Changning's performance, saying that she had some difficulties in attacking, was anxious, too eager to kill the ball, and that the movement would change.
Let's hope she's patient, "Let's protect her."
China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
White Paper: China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
The White Paper states that China ' s development is an opportunity, not a threat and challenge, for the world.
According to the White Paper, with China ' s combined national power and international influence rapidly rising, some people at the international level fear that China will follow the path of "the powerful" and some raise the so-called "China threat theory".
This is a combination of cognitive misreading, deep-rooted prejudices, psychological imbalance brought about by growing power, and deliberate distortion in defence of their vested interests.
It is the dream of both the Chinese people and the peoples of China to achieve national prosperity, national revitalization and the well-being of their people.
"China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge."
The White Paper states that China is the main stabilizer and engine of economic growth in the world, that China is the largest contributor to economic growth in the world, that technological innovation in China injects new energy into economic growth in the world, and that the role of stabilizers and power sources in China ' s future economy is even more prominent.
The current world economy is not sufficiently motivated to grow, and a robust Chinese economy is becoming increasingly important to the world.
China ' s economy is moving from high-speed growth to high-quality development. New types of industrialization, informationization, urbanization and modernization of agriculture are accelerating, the economy ' s structural depths are being adjusted, the industry ' s optimization continues to escalate, and new economic growth points are emerging.
“The McKinsey Global Institute studies suggest that by 2040, China’s integration with the rest of the world’s economies is expected to generate between $22 trillion and $37 trillion in economic value, equivalent to 15% - 26% of the global economy, and that closer cooperation between the rest of the world’s economies and China will create huge economic value.”
The White Paper stressed that China ' s economy and the world economy had undergone structural changes and were deeply integrated.
China, with a more stable economy, a higher quality of growth and promising growth prospects, is a long-term benefit to the world economy.
Considering China ' s economic development as a "threat" and "challenging", trying to squeeze China out of global industrial chains, supply chains, and value chains, and "decoupling" China from the world economy is unfeasible and harmful.
The White Paper states that full-scale openness to the outside world creates more opportunities for countries to share the “China dividend”.
China is steadfast in pursuing a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy and achieving greater and higher levels of external openness. China has the world's most potential consumer market. China is the most attractive destination for investment.
“Openness should be two-way, mutually beneficial, not one-way, one-sided.
A mutually beneficial two-way approach can last for the long term."
The White Paper states that China is committed to continuously expanding imports, easing market access, improving the business environment and strengthening intellectual property protection. Other countries should also expand their openness and take corresponding initiatives and work to improve their business environment.
It is only by working together that an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment can be created. Together, the “cake” of development will grow larger and will form a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests.
According to the White Paper, China provides the international community with more public goods.
This includes promoting high-quality co-construction of the "one way" , setting up multilateral platforms for dialogue and cooperation, active participation in international and regional affairs, and active foreign assistance.
“China has benefited from the international community's development, and has never forgotten to give back to the family of nations, providing the international community with more and better public goods.”
The General Manager of the Russian Export Centre, Andrei Slepniov, during a recent written interview with Xinhua News Agency journalists, stated that Russia was willing to strengthen cooperation with China in the economic and trade fields, further optimize its export structure and promote the diversification of Russian exports to China.
Slepniov noted that forestry, mechanical manufacturing and chemical industries account for a significant proportion of Russian exports to China, while agricultural exports are also important, including oil and fat products, meat products and dairy products, as well as cereals, fish and seafood products.
Russian exports of non-material and non-energy products to China have also shown good and steady development in recent years.
Speaking of optimizing Russia ' s export structure to China, Slepniov said that the Russian side had set a mandate to expand exports of high-tech products to meet the import demand for high-tech products from countries and regions around the world, including China.
The Russian side will then improve financial and non-financial support measures and promote further growth in the number of high-tech enterprises.
Slepniov stated that Russia is willing to export construction technology and high-tech building materials to China and to develop cooperation with China in areas such as medicine and aviation manufacturing.
There is also great potential for cooperation between the Russian and Chinese sides in the area of urban environmental development.
He stressed that Russian products in many areas were "quality superior and price competitive" compared to Western-like products.
Referring to the two countries ' goal of achieving $200 billion in bilateral trade by 2024, Slepniov said that areas such as agriculture, machinery manufacturing, the chemical industry and forestry would play an important role in achieving that goal.
The Russian side intends to contribute to the diversification of supply in these areas and to the export of highly processed products.
He stressed that the Russian side intended to push its exporters into the global value-added chain, in which China was one of the directions of development.
Russian manufacturers in the fields of agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas and chemicals are fully capable of participating in this process.
At present, the two countries need to continue to deepen cooperation between enterprises, “to create more joint Russian-Chinese ventures and to jointly develop exports to third countries”.
Slepniov indicated that the Russian Export Centre, through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Export-Import Bank, was taking a variety of measures and services to support exports of Russian products to China.
At the same time, the Russian Export Centre will continue to deepen its cooperation with relevant Chinese departments, promote easier entry of Russian goods into Chinese markets and develop new export products to China.
There has been a marked increase in the number of financial institutions using the renminbi to pay globally.
SWIFT's latest special journal on People's Currency Tracking, published in London on 26 July 2017, showed a clear trend towards an increase in the number of financial institutions worldwide paying in the renminbi between July 2017 and July 2019.
At the Global Banking Financial Telecommunication Association (SWIFT) 2019 London Annual Conference, the agency published a special journal called The People's Dollar Tracking from the London Perspective, which showed that the number of financial institutions worldwide paying in the renminbi had increased by 11.31 per cent from July 2017 to 2214 from 1989.
Of these, Africa and the Middle East experienced the largest increase in the number of financial institutions paying in renminbi, from 143 in July 2017 to 173 in July 2019, an increase of 20.98 per cent.
According to the report, as of August 2019, the renminbi ' s share of the global payment currency was 2.22 per cent.
At the same time, London plays the leading sheep role in foreign exchange transactions off the coast of the renminbi.
The report shows that in July 2019 London ' s share of foreign exchange transactions off the coast of the renminbi was 33.79%, and it was the world ' s leading chair.
According to the report, London is firmly in the lead in global foreign exchange transactions.
In July 2019, London ' s share in global foreign exchange transactions was 40.14 per cent, the United States 12.93 per cent and France 7.67 per cent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to Taiwan's so-called "diplomatic breakthrough" by sneaking up on self-defeating.
In response to Taiwan's recent entry into the United Nations Headquarters for meetings on religious issues, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Gum Keun responded at the regular press conference, saying that this small move was a disgraceful one and that it was laughterful.
A journalist asked, according to the Taiwan media report, that Taipei-based office personnel had recently entered United Nations Headquarters to attend a meeting on religious issues in the United States and called it a "diplomatic breakthrough".
The meeting you mentioned was a side event held by the United States on the premises of the United Nations, not a United Nations meeting at all.
Geng said that Taiwan's people blended in with the United Nations in a sneaky way, self-defeating, and made it sound like a so-called "diplomatic breakthrough", and that the little move was a disgraceful one.
He noted that the United Nations side had repeatedly reiterated its insistence on dealing with the Taiwan issue in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2758, and that the general membership of the United Nations also adhered to the one-China principle.

The authorities have shown a strong crackdown on the fall of the president from Mount Egypt.
Twitter theme tags and social media are strongly advocating that Egyptians take to the streets today to peacefully demand the resignation of President Sessi.
But the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress it.
Ever since Ceci, then head of the military, staged a military coup in 2013 to seize power, the expression of dissent has virtually disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest has become extremely dangerous.
The British newspaper Guardian reported that the Cairo NGO, Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, stated that more than 1900 people had been arrested since the rare outbreak of protests last weekend calling for Seth to step down.
The corruption allegations surrounding Ceci and his family's wasteful pursuit of vanity led thousands of people to take up street demonstrations in 20 days.
The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior firmly stated yesterday that any attempt to destabilize the country will be met with determination and will not be soft.
The city centre of Cairo is already heavily guarded, and riot police, security agency vehicles and plainclothes policemen were seen everywhere in the streets around Tahrir Square, where the Egyptian revolution detonated in 2011.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of leading scholars and social sages on 25th, including Nafa, a professor of political science at Cairo University and a well-known columnist.
He sent a tweet on 24th saying, "I have no doubt that continued absolute rule over Ceci will cause disaster."
"It is in Egypt's interest that he immediately step down."
Before Nafa was arrested, Hosni, who was the former Chief of Staff of the Egyptian military, spokeswoman Annan, was detained.
Anna was arrested last year after attempting to win the presidency with Ceci.
The President of the Constitutional Party, Davud, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that, at a time when the economic plight of the poor and the middle class is worsening, the scavenging of dissidents reflects the instability and fragility of government.
The leader of the opposition, Ayman Nour, who fought for the presidency, said: "The arrest underscores the regime’s disregard for the Egyptian people and its own fear."
"Cessi tried to send a clear message to key generals and politicians who might replace them, because the economy had been ruined by him, coupled with widespread political oppression."
Noel noted that the Government ' s high-handed approach would only increase people ' s anger in the context of the continuing deterioration of the socio-economic situation.
Now that the barrier of fear has been broken, he expects more people to go to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor currently in exile in Spain and formerly a contractor for construction in the Egyptian military, began to upload a series of films early in the month, claiming that he had benefited from the corruption of the government and detonated a small wave of demonstrations in different cities last weekend.
Ali said that his company, Amlake, could obtain lucrative contracts without having to go through a statutory bidding process, emphasizing the corruption of the military and the relatives of Cessi, including the First Lady, Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply sorry that he had been involved in it.
Ali claimed that his own help with the Fry House Palace and the luxury hotel in Sessigue contrasted sharply with the abject poverty of the Egyptians today and that the other side had not paid.
On Twitter, thematic labels such as " Stand Up and Out You Are Not Alone", "Sessi You Are Dead", "Sessy Rolling" and "Next Friday" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and pushbacks calling for people to go to the streets peacefully to demand Seth to step down.
Amarwick, a Hollywood Egyptian male star, has almost 7 million followers on Twitter.
He sent a tweet yesterday in Arabic saying, "Sessi is doomed...he is finished, and those who support him are now going to make a big mistake."
Hong Kong has put in place a special free training program to help recently economically affected employees get through.

The Director-General of the Labour and Welfare Department of the HKSAR Government, Mr. Lu Xi Xiang and Director of the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, Qiu Tenghua, commissioned the Employees Retraining Bureau to carry out a special training programme and to meet with the media on measures to support the tourism industry.
Lo Chi Guang described the challenges facing Hong Kong's economy as urgent and should not wait until the situation calmed down.
Therefore, the HKSAR Government has launched this free training program called "Special? Love Added."
It was stated that persons who had been unemployed or who had been asked by their employers to take unpaid leave since 1 June had the opportunity to participate in the plan, provided that the relevant requirements had been met.
Lo Chi Quang introduced the wide range of courses, the most important of which was the training of "vocational skills", covering 19 industries, including tourism, retail and catering, there would also be some brand new "innovation technology" courses, as well as cross-industry "general skills" courses.
The Chairman of the Employees Retraining Bureau Yu Peng Chun said that all courses were free of charge and that the plan was expected to support some 10,000 people in need.
A special allowance of HK$4,000 per participant per month is paid to participants who complete each full-time or part-time course and attend 80%.
It was stated that the training course lasted from 2 to 3 months and was offered by some 50 training institutions, that citizens could report from 3 October to 31 March next year, and that each could report up to 4 courses.
In addition, the HKSAR Government has announced a series of measures to support the tourism industry and assist the industry to overcome its difficulties.
These measures include easing allocations to the Tourism Council, funding 6,000 guided tours to continue their courses, exemption of travel agents from annual fees, etc.
I'm tired of sports, too?
According to the Russian satellite network, a study of athletes shows that the brain also shows signs of fatigue after high-intensity motion.
This study, led by Marcelus Pesigrion, expert at the Pitier-Salpetril Hospital in France, shows that there is no obvious connection between brain and manual labour: both require cognitive control of activities.
Pesigreon explained: "You need to control the autonomous process of forcing yourself to stop during muscle and joint pains."
The study was initiated by the French National Institute of Sport and Physical Education (INSEP).
The school specialist is responsible for guiding athletes in preparing for the Olympic Games.
Some athletes have begun to experience excessive training syndrome, i.e. an insufferable sense of fatigue following high-load sports, inability to recover and a decline in performance.
INSEP asked the question: Is this disease partly due to nervous fatigue, the kind of nervous fatigue caused by over-intelligent labor?
The study was published in Contemporary Biology magazine.

"Go Out" for Chinese citizens - visit Choi Aimin, Head of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Wherever you go, the country is behind you.
On 25th, the first Ministry of Foreign Affairs consul protection short film was on the line, and this phrase at the end of the short film was resonanced by a wide range of online friends.
In an interview with the Xinhua News Agency journalist, Choi Aimin, Director of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that the short film was intended to further make people feel the love and temperature of “diplomatics for the people” and to make Chinese citizens feel that no matter where they are in any corner of the world, Chinese diplomats will reach out to them and give them help, strength and hope.
There's nothing wrong with being out there, and there's nothing wrong with it.
CHOI Aymin said that over the past 70 years, the number of Chinese citizens “going out” has increased dramatically, from “less than a million a year” before reform and opening up to more than a billion times a year today; at the same time, Chinese citizens travel abroad with greater security, and consular protection and assistance work has also expanded from overseas Chinese citizens to various groups such as Chinese diasporas, tourists, students and workers.
According to statistics, since the Party ' s eighteenth anniversary, we have organized more than 10 major evacuations or relocations of Chinese citizens abroad. More than 40,000 Chinese citizens have been safely evacuated from dangerous and volatile areas.
About 500,000 requests for help were received and coordinated, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.
In times of danger, the country can take you home; it's no longer a dream if it wants to "go and go."
According to Choi Aimin, by the end of August, China had concluded visa-free mutual agreements with 14 countries covering persons with ordinary passports.
In addition, an increasing number of countries unilaterally grant Chinese citizens entry facilities such as visa exemptions or landing visas.
Forty-two countries and territories, including Thailand, Egypt and others, have unilaterally granted Chinese citizens with ordinary passports land visas, while another 15 countries and regions, such as Indonesia, have unilaterally allowed Chinese citizens with ordinary passports to be exempted from signing.
In addition to arrangements such as waivers, landings, etc., Chinese citizens are becoming easier to apply for visas, and procedures are becoming easier and easier.
By the end of August, China had concluded visa facilitation agreements or arrangements with 41 countries.
These included agreements with the United States, Canada, Israel and Argentina to grant multiple visas to tourrs, business people for 10 years, and with the United Kingdom to arrange multiple visas for travel, commerce and family visitors for two years.
The United Kingdom and Belgium jointly launched a "visa one stop" service, while France, Italy and Singapore reduced visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
For business people who often travel abroad, the APEC business travel card for multiple entry and easy clearance is a good option.
According to Choi Aimin, holding the travel card would amount to obtaining visas for more than five years in 16 economies around Asia and the Pacific, and would be significant for business people, especially private business people, to “go out”.
At present, China ' s effective holding of cards is among the top of the APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, promote visa facilitation measures by more countries for Chinese citizens, make the results of diplomatic efforts more widely translated into welfare initiatives for all citizens, and continuously raise the `gold content ' of Chinese passports.

(hereinafter referred to as “Tianjin Swemmy”), held 82,135 thousand shares of the company, accounting for 40.06 per cent of the company's total stock, and Wen Wei directly held 66.06 per cent of the company's share.
It is a matter of concern that this is not the first time that Cyrus has made a good offer.
Since last September, in a short period of one year, Cyrus has successively introduced measures such as top executive growth, head of board-led growth initiatives, repurchase of shares, equity incentives, etc.
On September 18th last year, Cyrus announced that the seven planned top executives of the company, Liu Wenhouse and others, had accumulated 394,300 shares (0.1922% of the company ' s total share capital) in the company ' s stock, bringing the total increase to 7.0229 million yuan, and the implementation of this plan has been completed.
Shortly thereafter, the Chairman and the realist, Wen Wei, initiated an initiative to increase the stock of the company by employees and promised that Wen Wei would compensate for the loss.
The period of increase was from 19 October to 31 October 2018, and the total ceiling for the addition of company shares did not exceed 150 million yuan, the addition of which required continuous holding of company shares for more than 12 months without loss, and the employee was on board at the time of compensation.
The journalist comb found that the share price for the above-mentioned initiative staff was a minimum of $14.02 and a maximum of $16.44 during the increase in the time period, and that the maximum floating surplus of the staff was 42.80 per cent and a minimum of 21.78 per cent at the price of $20.02 on September 25.
On 21 January this year, Cyrus again adopted the Repurchase Company Equity Program, which announced that the total amount of funds to be spent on repurchase of shares was not less than 160 million yuan yuan and not more than 280 million yuan yuan yuan.
On August 8, this year, the company issued a public announcement on the Restricted Stock Incentive Plan 2019 (draft) and set high performance conditions to unlock it.
The announcement showed that equity incentives were based on operating income in 2018, with growth rates of not less than 30%, 70%, 120% and 185% for the four fiscal years 2019-2022.
From the performance of Cyrus in the first half of the year, the company maintained high growth and exceeded the 30% performance growth conditions of this year.
In the first half of the year, operating income was 842 million yuan, an increase of 46.50 per cent in the same year; the net profit attributable to shareholders in listed companies was 56,23.24 million yuan, an increase of 16.46 per cent in the same year.
And since mid-2018, Cyrus has grown by more than 38% in each of the five consecutive reporting periods, reaching a maximum of 59%.
In 2018, the company established a two-nuclear-driven and coordinated development strategy based on medical testing and intensive operating services (IVD operations), which was broken down by the Medical Waste Consolidated Operational Services (SPD operations) and the regional testing centres, to upgrade and advance SPD operations, building on the consolidation of the advantages of the former IVD operations.
Céles-related sources told journalists that the three main operations of Célis were steadily advancing in order to respond to the general trend of medical reform and achieve rapid expansion.
In the SPD business area, in January this year, Cyrus announced the signing of a cooperation agreement on the construction and day-to-day operation management services for three years with the People ' s Hospital of the City of Lingwu and the Central Hospital of the City of Lingwu.
"In fact, Cyrus is making a major effort to expand SPD operations to provide health-care institutions with sophisticated operating services such as centralized procurement, warehousing management, distribution and settlement in medical consumption yards to generate long-term income. "
The above-mentioned people say.
On September 17, the Zhejiang Government Procurement Network Government Procurement Services Information Platform announcement indicated that Cyrus was awarded a "Provision of Logistics Extension Services in the College of Medicine with Reagents", a subsidiary of Zhejiang University Medical School.
According to the medical industry analysts, the winning bid is very goldy, and the Xinjiang Hospital is the first public hospital in mainland China to pass the International Hospital Review (JCI). The successful implementation of this project in the future will also be an important development opportunity for the hospital.
According to its analysis, the operational map largely completed the operational area coverage of the national province through regional outreach, national strategic cooperation and channel mergers and acquisitions.
Today, after Zhejiang, the winning bid hospital should continue to replicate the model in different hospitals and enhance the company's competitiveness in the Chinese market.
In addition, this year Celese has also made a presentation in new and emerging areas such as industrial marijuana, block chain technology, etc.

After being held by Iran for two months, the British tanker Stanna Empire was finally released and departed from the Iranian port of Abbas in the morning for international waters.
In the middle of last month, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory released an Iranian tanker that had been detained for more than a month.
According to the news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran, at 9 a.m. local time 27 a.m., the British tanker Stanna Empire departed from the port of Abbas for the international waters of the Persian Gulf.
The Iranian port and shipping organization of Hormuzgan Province confirmed that the commander and crew of the vessel had made a formal and written commitment and that, although the vessel had been seized, they had no claim.
Stena Bulk, the Swedish ship owner of the Stanna Empire, also said that the ship was sailing from the port of Abbas.
In addition, Refinitiv ' s vessel tracking data also found that the tanker had started moving in 27 and had left Abbas port.
The British-flagged tanker, Stena Impero, was seized by Iran last July.
The company spokesman said that the tanker was preparing to leave Abbas Harbour.
Two weeks after the British seized an Iranian tanker in the waters of Gibraltar, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards detained the tanker, the name of Stena Impero, on the Hormuz Channel channel.
The ship was released in August.
Earlier this week, the spokesman for the Iranian Government said that all the legal procedures required for the release of the Stanna Empire had been completed.
However, according to the Iranian side, the investigation is still ongoing.
Iranian media outlets have also released videos of the tanker's departure.
On 19 July, the IRGC Navy detained a British oil tanker, the Stanna Empire, inside Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz, and took it to Abbas port.
The Iranian oil tanker Grace One left the waters of Gibraltar.
In addition, on 4 July, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory seized the “Grace I” tanker carrying Iranian crude oil in the Strait of Gibraltar on suspicion of transporting oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions.
More than a month later, on August 15, the Gibraltar authorities announced the release of Grace One.
This afternoon, a conference was held in Changsha on the theme of educational review and rehabilitation at undergraduate colleges throughout the province.
The Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Council, Ulan, stressed the need to raise political posts, strengthen political commitment, review and reform issues from a rigorous perspective, and promote high-quality development in the construction, political thinking and reform development of institutions of higher learning with the effectiveness of thematic education.
Ulan fully acknowledges the initial results of the second series of thematic education by undergraduate colleges.
She pointed out that education on the theme “Don't forget your mind, remember your mission” was a major deployment of the Party's centrality, and that undergraduate high schools needed to study deeply the spirit of Xi Jinping's secretary-general's important speech on the theme “Don't forget your mind, remember your mission”.
From the promotion of the "four consciousnesss" to the "two preservations", to the political heights of the original mission, to the careful completion of the actions of the various provisions of the thematic education, and in particular to a solid overhaul and review of the series of problems, to the integration of all aspects of the reform and development of schools, to the "two promotions and two promotions" are achieved.
Uran stressed the need to insist on the inside of the blade, hold on to the problem, find the right questions to the watch in accordance with the requirements of the "Four cross-checks" and "Four search-and-see", ask for advice from teachers and students, parents and all sectors of society, examine the root causes in a serious and serious way, and then identify the direction of the effort and improve the initiative, and come up with the hard moves to solve the problem.
The word “change” should be effectively applied throughout the process by insisting on precision and strength, strengthening real change.
It is important to combine thematic education with the work of the Leeds and others, to pressurize and change responsibility, to ensure that the problem remains intact and the problem is clear and clear, and to ensure that the changes are effective.
It is important to maintain both the symptoms and the rules, improve the long-term mechanisms, weave the cages of the system, strengthen the rigidity of the system, ensure that the work is regulated and regulated, and genuinely use the system to manage the management of affairs.
In keeping with the above, the leading cadres will take the lead in strengthening the theoretical arm, taking a serious look at the reformation, taking the lead when it comes to discipline, playing an exemplary role as a "key minority" and trying to accomplish the tasks of the thematic education review and restructuring.
Five high school party committees, including Hunan University, spoke on behalf of the comrades and the relevant provincial unit on behalf of the comrades.
Two major high-pressure projects are going to be delivered once and for all.
On 26th day, the direct transmission of electricity project to  1100 kV in the east to nan, and the GIL Integrated Colony Project in Sutun 1,000 kV in communication.
Both projects occupy the current highs of the world ' s electricity transmission technologies in their respective fields, and their delivery will lead to a significant increase in the country ' s energy-extensive and optimal configuration.
Guo Ji, General Economist of the National Energy Agency, said that the protégé to Xiangnan project was the transmission project with the largest power delivery capacity in the world and the most distant transmission.
Their delivery is important for promoting the development of the Xinjiang energy base and safeguarding the electricity supply in the East China region.
GIL, i.e. gas insulation metal seals the transmission line.
The Sutong Pipeline Project created a record of GIL's highest global voltage level and highest transmission capacity, and achieved the combined operation of the `interchange double ring' at the highest voltage level of the Chinese backbone grid.
According to the National Electricity Network Corporation, 3324 km of electricity transmission distance is from the Pre-East to Sannan Project.
If conventional technologies are adopted, more than 15 per cent of electricity will be lost in transit, and the project will be developed and developed through a closure that will significantly increase the distance of the economy to more than 3,000 km.
100 million degrees of electricity can be delivered every 8 hours and 20 minutes after the drop of the Northeast-South project, which can help solve the problem of dissipation of the new energy sources available in Xinjiang.
According to full load estimates, the annual electricity delivery of this line alone will reach between 60 billion and 85 billion kilowatt-hours, which will satisfy more than half of Shanghai ' s electricity use throughout the year.
The Sutong GIL Integrated Colony Project is a control project of the ultra-high pressure communication ring network across the Yangtze River.
If a conventional line is used to cross the river, two giant iron towers of more than 450 metres need to be set up on the surface of the Yangtze River, and an artificial island of more than four football fields size is built for each tower.
In response, the national electricity grid was boldly innovative and developed a compact-type supervoltage exchange of GIL transmission technology to cross the river through tunnels, avoiding the impact on the gold channel.
Two projects contributed to a new leap in our electrician equipment manufacturing capability.
At present, the national grid has cumulatively built a "10 to 11 straight" super-high-pressure project, and a "4 to 3 straight" is under construction.
Foreign Exchange Bureau: our external debt structure continues to be optimized and external debt stability enhanced
“In general, the external debt structure of our country continues to be optimized, and external debt stability has increased.”
The press spokesman for the National Foreign Exchange Administration, Wang Chun Ying, the chief economist, stated on 27th that the main indicators of our external debt are within the internationally recognized security line and that external debt risk is generally manageable.
Wang Chun-Ying made this statement in response to a question from a journalist when the Foreign Exchange Bureau published external debt data for the end of June 2019 on the same day.
The data show that, as of the end of June 2019, our external debt balance at full calibre (including this foreign currency) stood at US$ 1998 billion, an increase of US$ 26.3 billion, or 1.3 per cent, over the end of March 2019, mainly as a result of the growth in the debt portfolio balance.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70 per cent of our full-calibre external debt growth was driven by non-residents purchasing local renminbi bonds, and the non-resident population was dominated by medium- and long-term investors such as central banks.
At the end of June 2019, the share of medium- and long-term external debt rose by 3 percentage points in comparison with the end of March 2019 and the share of foreign debt in this currency rose by 1 percentage point in comparison with the end of March 2019.
Wang Chun Ying stated that, with the inclusion of the renminbi bonds in our country in April 2019 in the Bloombergaclé global composite index, international investors' recognition of the Chinese bond market has further increased and the internal renminbi bonds have been continuously increased.
"Our balance of payments is generally balanced and external debt risks are manageable."
The journalist learned from the Yunnan Agricultural Academy of Sciences on 27th that the Yunnan meadow has now been effectively controlled, that it has not caused large outbreaks of disaster, and that the prevention has produced phased results.
In January of this year, Yunnan Pumang Town County discovered, for the first time, the migration of grassy night moths from abroad, which was confirmed to have occurred in 129 counties in Yunnan, and the gradual spread of grass land night moths from Yunnan to mainland China poses a direct threat to Chinese food production.
Grassland night moths are important agricultural pests of multi-food long-range migration originating in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are major migration pests of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Global Warning, characterized by "internationality, migration, flashy, destructive".
The pest endangers more than 80 crops, such as maize, sugar cane and sorghum, and takes large quantities of food, causing up to 70 per cent loss of production.
Control is difficult and China has no registered pesticides to control the bug.
Ever since the meadows and night moths invaded Yunnan, the Yunnan Province Agricultural Academy of Sciences has selected Yidong Fellows to lead Yunnan Province Agricultural Transfrontier Hazardous Organisms in coordination with the Green Prevention and Control Province Innovation Team, and has gone to the first line, field research, sample collection and technical guidance and pilot demonstration.
The Xiao Yidong team has gained initial knowledge of the stock characteristics of the Yunnan meadows, the resources of the natural trichlorfon, the characteristics of the source of the off-shore bugs, the migration trajectory of the stock, the toxic effects of the drug and the effects of the field control.
They actively engage in research and application of green control technologies. Through the implementation of new green control technologies such as stock monitoring, insecticide trapping, scientific medicine and agronomy measures, the prevention and control effects have reached more than 90 per cent in the demonstration areas, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting natural enemy resources and the ecological environment, and providing technical security for Yunnan to effectively control the outbreak and sustainable governance of night moths in grass.
At present, the Yunnan meadows have been effectively protected against large-scale outbreaks of disasters, and the prevention and control efforts have produced phased results.
In the next step, the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on ecological mechanisms for moving stocks and invading invasions, breaking through the biocontrol and green control technology architecture.
At the same time, cross-border international cooperation has been actively promoted with a view to establishing joint priority laboratories and joint monitoring nodes and demonstration areas outside the country in order to enhance the full range of monitoring and early warning capabilities of the Yunnan meadows.

White Paper: China ' s way out of a country-friendly development path
On September 27, China News Agency Beijing launched the White Paper "China and the World in the New Age" on September 27, from the Press Office of the State Council of China.
The White Paper states that over the past 70 years, the Chinese people have struggled to explore and move forward, successfully opening up the path of socialism of the Chinese identity and achieving the world ' s remarkable development achievements.
According to the White Paper, China's development depends on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development is based on the solid spirit of “800 million shirts for a Boeing”, in which generations won't stop fighting and struggle, giving hard work and sweat that others can't imagine; on the spirit of “one's own responsibilities”, in which no problems are exported, no problems are exported, no contradictions are passed, no development is taken through the forced purchase of another country, and no development is taken through the forced sale and plundering of another country; and on the spirit of “touching over the river with stones”, not following the old path of imperialism, colonialism
The White Paper states that China has developed in its interaction with the world, that China ' s development has injected positive energy into world peace and development, and that China ' s roads are consistent with China ' s national circumstances and the requirements of the adaptation era.
China maintains world peace with practical action.
For 70 years, China has not initiated any war or conflict and has not appropriated an inch of the land of another country.
The White Paper states that China's development has been a great success in 70 years, and that the fundamental reason is to find the right path of development of China's special socialism and to follow it with determination.
It is a path that is based on national circumstances, that puts the interests of the people first, reform innovation, pursue common development in openness, and fully adhere to the rule of law.
China is huge and complex in size, and governance difficulties are rare in the world. Without a united and strong leadership, China will move towards division and disintegration, bringing disaster to the world.
According to the White Paper, over 70 years China has overcome risks and challenges and created another world-renowned Chinese miracle.
In particular, since the 18th year of the Chinese Communist Party, China has achieved historic achievements and made historic changes in its development, and the Chinese nation has taken a great leap from standing up to being rich to being strong, closer to the great goal of national renaissance than ever before in history.
This development path in China will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.

Taiwan scholars have argued that the "indeterminate times" traders need to keep up with the mainstream industries on the continent.
The "2019 Business Innovative Business Model Forum" was held in Taipei on 26, 27 days a day or two.
The event invited representatives of various Taiwan-based businesses and scholars to share their experiences on business transformation, innovation, succession and market openings.
The forum was hosted by the Taipei Institute of Business Management and co-sponsored by organizations such as Kim Ding Securities, the Outstanding Continental Trade Association and others.
The two-day meeting was divided into workshops on transformation and upgrading models, business strategies, etc., and was attended by more than 100 participants.
Chen Ming-hyeong, director of the Taipei Business Management Institute, said that Chinese-American trade frictions continued, and Taiwan traders faced an "unsure age".
In his view, it was necessary to keep pace with the times and keep abreast of the mainstream industries developing on the continent, with particular attention paid to innovative products related to science and technology, culture, tourism and health.
"Once upon a time, clients valued quality, effectiveness and delivery."
Chen Mingxing believes that the above-mentioned conditions are no longer sufficient at the moment.
He pointed out that capital enterprises need to combine speed and service, speed up supply chains, and focus on extension and product services.
In addition, "service value added" is also a new area where clients can significantly develop.
The representative of the Taiwan trader spoke on the link, and the Chairman of the Taiwan merchant Ame Electronics Ltd., from Guangdong, Xu Wenchen, introduced that Ame Electronics had experienced operational difficulties as a result of the sharp downswing of orders, and that the group had begun to improve business from a variety of orientations, including structural adjustments, living assets, etc.
The removal of traditional electrical services, the use of electronic equipment for the transformation of cars, and the advance of the intelligent household electricity industry took three years for businesses to collect.
Shih Hong-hwan, General Manager of Solar God Electronics Ltd., suggested that if it was difficult to develop new customers, instead of focusing on the original customers, it would be better to provide a “one-stop shop” service.
The replacement of a customer by a supplier is not unique to the factors of poor service delivery, high price, low quality, slow delivery, low variety and integrity. If these six points are addressed, together with the timely adaptation of production lines and the expansion of product lines, the enterprise will itself become an irreplaceable supplier to the customer.
On 27th, the award ceremony for the "2019 Outstanding Continental Dealers Award", also hosted by the Taipei Business Management Institute, was held in Taipei.
According to the Taiwan Daily Economic Report, the General Manager of the Golden Land Corporation, which operates from Shanghai, was awarded the "Excellent Dealer and Cross-Strait Contribution Award".
New regulations for consultation: the acquisition of rural land rights by social capital requires qualification
Qualified access to rural land by social capital
Public consultation on the rural land tenure transfer management scheme to regulate the transfer of social capital to land rights, such as business enterprises
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs published an open notice for comments on the " Management of Rural Land Administration Transfers (Advancement Draft of Revised Draft) " (hereinafter referred to as " The Draft Opinion " ), which increased the regulation and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital to land management rights, such as business enterprises.
The Draft Opinion is now open to comment from society.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, in order to implement the newly amended Rural Land Contracting Law, further consolidate and improve the basic rural business system, deepen the reform of the rural land system and implement the "triple power-sharing" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the Rural Land Contracting Transfer Management Scheme to form a Draft Opinion.
The Beijing Young News reporter learned that the first published Draft of Opinion was subject to several important changes.
The newly amended Law on Rural Land Contracting defines the scope of land transfer, implements the concept of “triple-power division”, establishes “the right to land contracting” and “the right to land management”, respectively, and makes a clear distinction between the transfer of land contracting rights, swaps and the transfer of land management rights (rents, turnkeys, shares or other means).
In this Draft Opinion, in order to implement the concept of “triple division of powers”, respond effectively to the main thrust of the amendments to the Law on Rural Land Contracting, and take into account the significant differences between the transfer of land administration and the exchange of land contracting rights, transfer of rights, etc., in terms of parties, procedures, regulation, etc., this revision defines the scope of the transfer, focuses on the transfer of land administration rights, the transfer of the transfer means including rents, shares, etc., and changes the name of the regulation from the Rural Land Contracting Transfer Transfer Management Scheme to the
The transfer and exchange of land contract rights will be regulated separately.
According to the Draft Opinion, in the context of the “three-power division”, farmers are only investing in land management rights for a limited period of time.
Theoretically, even in the event of liquidation, farmers only run the risk of losing business rights for a certain period of time, so it is no longer legally necessary to provide for the return of the contracting land to the original contractor, and there is a conflict with the Bankruptcy Law.
In response to the problem of protecting farmers against the risk of land loss, priority shares, first rent and then share shares, buy back, etc. have been developed in practice.
Considering that priority shares already have matured theoretical exploration of company law, it is suggested that they be used as advocacy provisions to protect against the risk of market loss.

The survivor, Franzichek Kowal, said, "There's finally a piece of glass broken, and they're starting to escape through the window."
Stars emit light and heat because hydrogen atoms combine (or fusion) to create heavier elements that generate energy.
Scientists are currently working to build a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
However, this is a difficult issue to solve. It will take years for us to see a functional fusion reactor built.
As a result of surface tension, steel needles can float on the surface.
Surface tension occurs because water molecules on the surface are strongly attracted to each other, and the gravity between them is more attractive than between water molecules and air molecules above them.
The water molecules form an invisible skin on the surface of the water, which allows things like needles to float on the surface.
The edges of modern skates are double-edged, with a hole between the blades and the blades. They have a better grip on ice (even when tilted).
The edge of the knife, which was in contact with the ice, was bent when it leaned towards one of the sides because the base of the blade was slightly bent.
So the skater can turn around. The skater leans to the right, the skater turns to the right. The skater leans to the left, and the skater turns to the left.
They have to eliminate excess energy from light before they can return to the previous level of energy.
They do so by launching a tiny light particle known as "the photon".
Scientists refer to this process as “intense radiation”, because atoms are stimulated by powerful light, which causes the launch of photons, which is also a radiation type.
The next picture shows the atomic launch of the photon. Of course, the photon is actually much smaller than it looks on the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the substances that make up the atom!
After hundreds of hours of use, the lights were eventually burned and the bulbs were not on.
Then you need to change the light bulbs. You have to be careful when changing the light bulbs.
First of all, it is important to close the switch on the lights or break the cable connection.
This is because when there is still a part of the light bulb connected to the plug, and when you touch the inside of the plug or the metal base of the light bulb, the current flows into the plug (the link of the light bulb metal base) and makes you severely electrocuted.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which transports blood.
Blood flows out of the heart through the pipe known as the arteries, and then through the pipe known as the veins, it returns to the heart. The smallest pipe is called the hair vessels.
Triangular dragons have teeth that bite not only leaves, but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that the triangulation dragon feeds on iron, which is a common plant during the white age.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown made of nailed sharp leaves.
Before eating the trunk, the Triceratops will strip the leaves with its powerful mouth.
Other scientists consider these plants toxic, so dinosaurs are unlikely to eat them, even now that lazy and other animals, such as parrots (the offspring of dinosaurs), can eat toxic leaves or fruits.
What will Io's gravity do to me? If you stand on the surface of Io, your weight will be lighter than on Earth.
A man who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth, weighs about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. Gravity naturally creates a smaller pull.
The sun doesn't have the Earth's crust on top. The whole sun is made of gas, fire and plasma.
The further you get to the center of the sun, the thinner the gas.
The outside of the sun that we see is called the light sphere, meaning "the light ball."
About 3,000 years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used telescopes to observe celestial bodies and found that Venus had a position consistent with the Moon.
Discrepancies occur because Venus (or the moon) is only seen on one side of the sun. Venus variations support Copernicus's theory that planets rotate around the sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, a British astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a Venus Day.
After reconquering Danelaw, England went through a long period of peace.

There is much to say about the origin of Sanskrit. One of them is that Aryans emigrated from the West to India to bring their own language here.
Sanskrit is an ancient language comparable to the Latin language in Europe.
The first book known in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the completion of the book, Sanskrit disappeared for reasons of hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a big, sophisticated language and the origin of many modern Hindu languages, just as Latin is the origin of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the battle against the law was over, Germany began preparing for the invasion of Britain.
The German code name this attack was Operation Sea Lion. British troops lost most of their heavy weapons and supplies when they withdrew from Dunkirk.
But the Royal Navy is still much stronger than the German Navy (“Kriegsmarine”) and can destroy any invading fleet across the English Channel.
However, few Royal Navy ships are stationed near potential intrusion routes, as the Navy generals fear that the ships will be sunk by German air.
Let's explain Italy's plan first. Italy is basically a little brother of Germany and Japan.
Both the army and the navy are weak, although they built four new ships shortly before the war began.
Italy's main objective is African countries. In order to capture these countries, they need an army base so that they can travel across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
To that end, they had to withdraw British bases and ships in Egypt. Apart from these actions, Italian warships should not have acted.
Now come to Japan. Like the United Kingdom, Japan is an island nation.
The submarines were designed to operate under water, and the submarines stayed under water for a long period of time.
Submarines were used during the First World War and the Second World War, when they were slow and very limited in range.
At the beginning of the war, most of them sailed on the sea surface, but as radar development and accuracy increased, submarines were forced to dive underwater to avoid detection.
German submarines are called U-boats. Germans are very good at navigation and handling submarines.
Because the Germans were successful with submarines, they were not hosting large numbers of submarines after the war.
Yes, King Tutankhamun, sometimes also known as the "Tut King" or the "Junior King", is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings of modern times.
Interestingly, he was not considered an important figure in ancient times and was not recorded on the list of most ancient kings.
However, his grave was discovered in 1922, making him famous. Although many past graves were stolen, it was almost undamaged.
Most of Tutankhamun ' s accompaniment remains intact, including thousands of cultural objects made of precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of the radiator made the Assyrian chariot lighter and faster and could travel easier than the soldiers and other chariots.
The arrows they shoot out of the deadly crossbow can penetrate the armor of the enemy. Around 1000 B.C., Assyrians used the first cavalry.
Cavalry is the army that fights on the back of a horse. The saddle was not invented at the time, so Assyrian cavalry can only fight on the back of a bare horse.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists, and artists. The most famous person in Greek culture is probably Homer, a blind poet with legendary colors. He created two masterpieces of Greek literature: Iliat and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights whose drama is considered one of the greatest works in world literature.
The other famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, whose most famous achievement has been the presentation of famous theories about the cross-sectional relationship of the rectangular triangle.
The number of people speaking Hindi is different. It is estimated that Hindi is the second to fourth most commonly spoken language in the world.
The number of native languages depends on whether closely related dialects are counted.
It is estimated that the number of people who speak this language ranges from 340 million to 500 million, while the number of people who understand it amounts to 800 million.
Hindu and Urdu have similar vocabulary, but the scripts are written differently; they usually communicate with each other during daily conversations.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was heavily influenced by German culture.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to their natives, so they invented the Estonian script language.
It added the letter "" to the alphabet in German.
Over time, many German foreign words have been merged with the original vocabulary. This is the beginning of the Enlightenment movement.
Traditionally, heirs to the throne would join the army directly after completing their studies.
Charles, however, entered the Trinity College of Cambridge University, where he studied anthropology and archaeology and later studied history and obtained a degree of 2:2 (second degree).
Charles was the first British Crown member to obtain a degree.
The part of Turkey located in Europe (eastern Thrace or Lumilia in the Balkans) accounts for 3 per cent of its territory.
Turkish territory is more than 1,600 km (1,000 miles) and 800 km wide (500 miles) and roughly rectangular.
Turkey has an area (including lakes) of 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 square miles) are located in South-West Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 square miles) are located in Europe.

Turkey surrounds the sea on three sides: the Aegean Sea on the west side, the Black Sea on the north side and the Mediterranean Sea on the south side.
Luxembourg has a long history, but only became independent in 1839.
Some parts of Belgium today used to belong to Luxembourg, but were classified after the Belgian revolution of the 19th and 30th centuries.
Luxembourg had always tried to become a neutral country, but it had been occupied by Germany during the First World War and the Second World War.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of an organization now known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a destroyed fortress and Buddhist temple located in the upper part of the Paro district (in Fonde village).
Zabdrung nawang Namgyel was said to have built this fortress in 1649 in memory of his victory over the Tibetan army.

Learning to produce interactive media requires conventional traditional skills, as well as tools acquired in interactive courses ( storyboard production, audio and video editing, story plot design, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to re-evaluate assumptions about media production and learn non-linear thinking.
Interactive design requires that the various components of the project are interlinked, but can also exist as an independent entity.
The disadvantage of the focal lens is that, in order to achieve a certain focus range, the number of focus complexes and lens components required is much greater than the number of focal lenses.
This is no longer a problem as camera manufacturers reach higher standards in camera production.
This makes it possible to take pictures comparable to the quality of the fixed focus lens.
Another drawback of the focal lens is that the largest halo (speed) of the lens is usually smaller.
This makes it difficult to use cheap focal lenses in weak light conditions without flashlights.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert films into DVD formats is overscanning.
Most television programmes are produced for the entertainment of the general public.
For that reason, the frame of the image you saw on television, including the top, bottom and side, was cut.
This is to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It's called "overscan."
Unfortunately, when you produce DVDs, its borders are likely to be cut off, and if the subtitles in the video are too close to the bottom, the subtitles will also show incompleteness.
This traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination of people, drawing images of horseback spears, feasts and the spirit of King Arthur's knights.
Even standing in the ruins of the millennium, people can easily recall the sound and smell of war that has long passed away, and they can almost hear the crashes of horseshoes on pebblestones, and they can smell the fear that comes out of the dungeon pits.
But does our imagination have a realistic basis? Why build castles in the first place? How are they designed and built?
As the typical building of that period, the Castle of Muxloe was more a reinforced house than a real castle.
Its big glass windows and thin walls cannot withstand a determined attack for a long time.
In the 1980s, when Lord Hastings began building this castle, the country was relatively peaceful and only needed to defend itself against a small group of wandering looters.
The balance of power is the system in which European countries seek to preserve the national sovereignty of all European countries.
The idea is that all European countries must try to prevent a country/region from becoming strong on its own, so governments often change allies in order to maintain balance.
Spain's war on inheritance marked the first war with the balance of power at its core.
This marks an important change, because European powers will no longer be able to use religious warfare as an excuse. So, 30 years of war will be the last war to be labelled religious war.
On July 21, 356 B.C., the arson of Herostatus caused the destruction of the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus.
According to the story story story, this man is willing to show his face at any cost. The angry Ephesus declared the name of Herostratus to be inexhaustible.
Greek historian Strabo later mentioned the name, which we know today. The temple was destroyed on the night Alexander was born.
Alexander the Great proposed to rebuild the temple, but his proposal was rejected. Then, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible, and still you can hit all notes correctly - and try not to do too much extraneous action with your fingers.
So you can save your strength as much as you can. Remember, you don't have to hit the keys like you did on the piano to raise the volume.
In order to increase the volume of accordion, the windbox can be pulled harder or faster.
Mysticism seeks to communicate with the ultimate reality, God, spiritual truth or God, to identify with or to reach a sense of consciousness.
The believers seek a direct experience, intuition or epiphany of sacred reality/godishness or gods.
Followers pursue a way of life or practice aimed at nurturing these experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship because it emphasizes a direct experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially a peaceful, perceptive, happy and even eccentric state of consciousness.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region in the 15th century and came from the divisions within Hindu traditions.
Sikhs believe that they believe in a religion different from Hinduism, although they recognize that Sikhism originates from Hinduism and contains Hindu traditions.
The Sikhs refer to their religion as Gurmat, which in Punjabi means "the road of Gulu." Gulu is an essential part of all Indian religions, but is particularly high in Sikhism and is at the heart of Sikhism.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Gulu Nanak (1469-1539), followed by nine Gulus.
However, in June 1956, Khrushchev ' s commitment was put to the test when Polish workers protested the food shortage and the wage loss riots that turned into protests against the communist system itself.
Although in the end, Khrushchev sent tanks to restore order, he made concessions on a number of economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wadislaw Gomulka as the new Prime Minister.
The Indus river basin civilization is a Bronze-era civilization, located on the northwest subcontinent of India, covering most of modern Pakistan, as well as parts of northwest India and northeast Afghanistan.
The civilization of the Indus basin has developed and flourished, and that civilization is therefore famous.
Although some scholars assume that, given that this civilization also exists in today's drying up Salaswati river basin, it is only right to call it "Industy-Salaswati civilization", although some call it "Harapa civilization" — the first site to be discovered in the region in the 20th century.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire has contributed to the advancement and development of medicine.
Emperor Augustus began recruiting doctors and even formed the first Roman medical team for post-war medical treatment.
Surgeons have knowledge of a variety of sedatives, including morphine extracted from poppy seeds and east platinum extracted from thorium seeds.
In addition to using tourniquets and arteries to stop blood flow, they have been able to use amputations to save gangrene patients.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has achieved great results in the field of medicine, making up most of the knowledge we know today.
The limit rule of the paper is that it can only fold once, that it is not allowed to fold more complex actions in reverse, and that all folding positions must be simple and clear.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced origami or less capable people.
When a child is young, he becomes aware of racial and ethnic stereotypes, which affect his behaviour.
If, for example, there is a pattern that children of a minority perform poorly in school, these children tend to behave badly in school once they learn about their own ethnicity.
MySpace is the third most popular site in the United States and currently has 54 million registered accounts.
These websites received much attention, especially in the field of education.
These sites also have benefits, such as the ease with which to create a class page containing blogs, videos, photos, etc.
You can easily access the page by simply providing a web site. This is easier to remember and easier to enter for students who do not have keyboards or spelling difficulties.
It can be personalized to read, or use more or less colours according to demand.
Attention deficit disorder is a nervous system syndrome, and three typical defined symptoms include impulses, distractions, multiactivity or excess energy.
It's not a loss of learning ability, it's a learning disability; it's "influencing 3% to 5% of American children, and the number may be as high as 2 million".
It is difficult for children with ADs to focus their efforts, such as doing homework, but they can concentrate on what they like, like playing games, watching favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without signs.
These kids often get into a lot of trouble. Because normal methods don't stimulate their brains, they "do dangerous behaviors, fight, challenge authority."
The attention deficit barrier (ADD) affects the relationship of a sick child with his or her peers, because other children cannot understand why patients behave and spell and why they are different in maturity.
When the ability to acquire knowledge and learn changes as described above, the basic rate of acquisition of knowledge changes accordingly.
Access to information varies. Pressure no longer exists in personal memories, but the ability to remember texts becomes more important.
The Renaissance has fundamentally changed the way learning and knowledge are disseminated.
The difference between primitive humans and other primates is that they no longer move their bodies with their hands, lift their weights and wander in the woods.
The size and length of chimpanzee hands and feet are similar, reflecting the fact that hands are used to bear the weight in their fingers and back walks.
Man's hands are shorter than his feet, and his fingers are sharper.
From 2 million to 3 million years ago, the fossils of the handbone showed no loss of hand, and changed from the way they moved to the way they operated.
Some people believe that often artificially induced and clear dreams are exhausted.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that a clear dream lengthens the time lag between rapid eye movement.
The shorter the rapid eye movement period (REM) every night, the less frequent it is to get a good sleep in this state and recover its energy, and the physical problems may arise.
It's like waking up on TV every 20 or 30 minutes is exhausting.
The effect depends on the frequency of your brain's sober dreams every night.
The situation of Italians in North Africa was less than ideal from the very beginning. Less than a week after Italy declared war on June 10, 1940, the 11th light cavalry of the United Kingdom occupied Capuzburg in Libya.
In an ambush in eastern Batia, the British captured General Latussi, commander of the engineering unit of the Tenth Army of Italy.
On June 28, the Governor of Libya, Marshal Ital Italo Balbo, the successor of Mussolini, was shot dead by friendly forces while landing in Tobruk.
The modern sword-fighting movement is divided into levels of initial study for university students and professional and Olympic competition levels.
The campaign was conducted mainly in the form of a standoff, in which one swordfighter fought another.
Golf is a game of players hitting the ball into a hole with a club.
The regular round has 18 holes, and the players usually start with the first hole on the field until the end of the eighteenth hole.
Winners who finish the game with a minimum number of hits or swings.
The game was on the grass, and the grass around the hole was cut shorter and called the fruit ridge.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is also what most people think when they think of tourism: leisure tourism.
This means that people go to a place that is very different from their daily lives for relaxation and recreation.
Beaches, theme parks and camping are often the most frequent destinations for leisure tourists.
If the purpose of a person visiting a particular place is to understand its history and culture, this type of tourism activity is called cultural tourism.
Tourists may visit different landmarks in a given country, or they may concentrate only on one area.
In view of this activity, the colonizers also asked for reinforcements.
The forces supporting the forward positions included the 200-man New Hampshire 1st and 3rd Regiment, under the command of Colonel John Stark and Colonel James Reid (who later became generals).
Stark's soldiers followed the defensive fence north of the colonial position.
As the tide retreated, the mysterious river running along the northeast of the peninsula opened a gap and quickly built a short stone wall that extended to the small beach on the north shore.
Gridley or Stark placed a stake 100 feet (30 metres) in front of the fence and ordered that no fire be fired until the regular army passed.
The United States plans to launch a coordinated attack in three different directions.
General John Kadwad will launch an attack on the British garrison in the town of Borden, diverting enemy attention in order to block any reinforcements.
General James Ewing, with 700 militiamen crossing the river at the Trenton ferry crossing, seized the bridge on Assent Pike Bay and blocked the way for the enemy to escape.
The 2400 main forces will cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under Greene, and one under Sullivan, in order to launch the attack before dawn.
From a quarter mile to a half mile race, the speed becomes less important, and patience becomes an absolutely important factor.
Of course, to be a first-class half-mile runner (finished in two minutes), you have to be fast enough and develop patience at all costs.
The practice of running across the country during winter, coupled with the exercise of the upper half of the body, is well prepared for the running season.
Proper nutrition practices alone are not enough to produce excellence, but this can significantly affect the overall health status of young athletes.
Keeping a healthy energy balance, adhering to the practice of effectively replenishing moisture and understanding the various aspects of rational use of nutritional supplements can help athletes improve performance and increase sports pleasure.
Medium- and long-runs are a relatively inexpensive sport; however, participants have many misunderstandings about the few pieces of equipment they need.
Products can be purchased according to need, but most products have little real impact on achievement.
The athletes may think that they prefer a product, even though it is useless.
Atoms can be considered as one of the basic building blocks of all matter.
According to the simplified Boll model, this is a very complex entity, containing a central atomic core surrounded by electrons that are sort of like planets orbiting the sun. See figure 1.1 for details.
The atomic core consists of two particles, neutron and proton.
The proton has positive electricity, the neutron has no electricity. The electrons have negative electricity.
To examine the victim, you must first survey the site to ensure your own safety.
When approaching the victim, attention needs to be paid to his posture and any unconscious dangerous signals.
If you want to help someone else, you'll only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear and distressing feelings played a role as intermediaries in pain and disability of patients suffering pain in the waist.
Structural physical exercise can only be conditionally carried out on a regular weekly basis if the impact of the fearful thinking, rather than the effects of frustration and fear, is felt.
Those involved in regular training need more support in the passive perception of pain to help them distinguish between chronic pain and discomfort and normal physical activity.
The ability to see or see depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, i.e. the eyes.
There are many kinds of eye formations, the complexity of which depends on the needs of organisms.
Different configurations have different functions, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different sensitivity. They also need different treatments to understand input, and different numbers of inputs are needed to achieve optimal effect.
A stock refers to a concentration of specific species of organisms within a given geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are identical on a particular tabular form, they are called monolithic.
When individuals show a few variants of a certain type, they are multi-morphological.
The marching and nesting of ants are also at different stages.
During the migration phase, ants travel at night and stop and camp during the day.
When the available food is reduced, the colony will move. At this stage, the colony will build temporary nests that will be replaced every day.
It's a nomadic rush that lasts for about 17 days every time.
What are cells? The word "cells" is derived from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small rooms", originally created by microscopic scientists who observe softwood structures.
Cells are the basic constituent units of all organisms, all of which are made up of one or more cells.
In fact, cells have such a foundation and a vital place in biological research that they are often called the “fundamental unit of life”.
The nervous system maintains the internal balance by sending a nerve pulse to the body to keep the blood flow smooth.
These nerve pulses can be transmitted very quickly throughout the body to protect the body from any potential threat.
Compared to other violent storms, the tornado struck a smaller area, but could destroy everything along the way.
The tornado pulls trees up, rips wood from the building, throws cars into the sky. Two percent of the tornado is the most violent and continues to rage for more than three hours.
These monster storms have wind speeds of up to 480 km per hour (133 m/s; 300 mph).
Humans have been producing and using magnifying glasses for thousands of years.
However, the first real telescope was made in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes use a combination of two lenses, making distant objects look close and large.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us. The essence of cooperation is that short-term selfishness always brings more benefits when most people benefit.
It is hoped that most people will realize that working with others is the best option in the long run.
Many dream that humankind can migrate to other planets one day to explore other worlds. Some want to know what the universe has; some believe that there may be aliens or other life on other planets.
But if this really happens, then it probably won't happen again for a long time. These stars are very dispersed, and the "neighbour" stars are hundreds of billions of miles apart.
Perhaps one day, your children will live in the outer world and guess what kind of life their ancient ancestors had at that time.
Animals are made up of many cells. Animals eat food and digest it in their bodies. Most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (but not all animals, e.g. jellyfish have no brains).
There are animals in every corner of the planet. Some dig underground, some swim in the ocean, some fly in the sky.
Cells are the smallest structural and functional units of all types of organisms.
The word Cell (cells) is derived from Latin clalla (meaning small rooms).
Watching organisms under microscopes, you find them made up of little squares or balls.
The British biologist Robert Hooke saw a few small squares hidden in the cork with a microscope.
They look like rooms. He was the first to observe death cells.
Elements and compounds can change the physical state in the event of chemical change.
The gas nitrogen still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The density of liquid nitrogen is greater, but the molecules are the same.
Another example is water. The compound water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Whether it's gas, liquid or solid, its molecular structure is the same.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains unchanged.
Time is around us, affecting everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
Time has been the subject of research by religious, philosophical and scientific scholars for thousands of years.
The time we went through was a series of events that never came to the present or to the past.
Time is also the way we compare the duration (long duration) of events.
You can record the passage of time by observing repeated cyclical events. cyclical events are events that happen again and again on a regular basis.
Today, we use computers to process pictures and videos.
Complex animations can be built on computers, and this type of animation is increasingly being applied to television and movies.
Recording music is often handled by sophisticated computers and combines sound.
For a long time in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, New Zealand's first inhabitants were thought to be Māori, who hunted a large bird known as a birdy bird.
The theory then established the view that Maori had moved from Polynesia on a "big boat" and had taken New Zealand from the Moriori, creating an agricultural society.
There is new evidence, however, that the Moriori belong to the Maori ethnic group on the mainland and that they moved from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands to develop their own unique culture of peace.
There is another tribe in the Chatham Islands, who are Māori immigrants from New Zealand.
They call themselves the Moriori. There were some small clashes, and the Moriori were wiped out.
Those who participated in the decades helped us to recognize our strengths and passions, while at the same time honestly assessing difficulties and even failures.
In listening to other people share their personal, family and organizational stories, we have a valuable understanding of the past and of some people who have had a good or bad influence on the organizational culture.
While understanding history does not mean understanding culture, at least it helps people understand their place in organizational history.
In summing up successes and failures, individuals and all participants will have a deeper understanding of the values, mission and driving forces of the organization.
In this context, a review of previous entrepreneurial behaviour and success could help to keep people open about new changes and directions in local churches.
Such success stories reduce people's fear of change and create positive tendencies for future change.
The mode of condensing thinking is the solution technique of finding solutions by combining different ideas or fields.
This mindset places great emphasis on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as on screening facts, re-applying existing technologies and gathering information.
The most important element of this mindset is that there is only one answer. You just have to think about two answers, right or wrong.
This pattern of thinking is not irrelevant to certain scientific or standard procedures.
This type of thinking has logic, remembers patterns, solves problems, and conducts scientific tests.
So far, humans have been the best species to read and understand his mind.
That means that we can successfully predict other people's perceptions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge or desires.
In these abilities, understanding the intentions of others is essential. We can use this ability to understand the ambiguity that physical behaviour may express.
For example, if you see someone breaking a window, you probably think this guy's stealing a stranger's car.
If he lost the keys to his car and tried to open the door to his car, that might be something else.
Magnetic resonance imaging is based on a physical phenomenon called NMR, which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Broch and Edward Purcell.
In this resonance, magnetic fields and radio waves cause atoms to send weak radio signals.
In 1970, the doctor of medicine and research scientist Raymond Damadian discovered the rationale for using magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was approved, the world's first patent in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the manufacture of the first "whole body" MRI scanner, which he called the "intransigent sign".
It gives people time to think about and react to the reactions of others.
This enables students to learn at their own pace and controls the rhythm of teaching messages.
In addition, there are fewer time limits due to flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
Learners can use the Internet and the World Wide Web to access information at any time.
Students can also submit questions to teachers at any time of the day and can expect a quick response within a reasonable time, without waiting until the next interview.
Post-modernist learning gives people absolute freedom. There is no good learning method.
In fact, nothing requires special learning. When the learner experiences knowledge, the learner behaves.
So far, we have shown this through all the DEYs, the display of information, and all the television programmes that focus on learning.
Many of us find that television shows we watch are telling us some sort of process or experience, but we will never participate in or apply that knowledge.
We will never make major repairs to cars, we will not build fountains in backyards, we won't go to Peru to visit ancient monuments and we won't reform the neighbor's house.
Thanks to submarine fibre cables and broadband satellites connected to Europe, the Greenland network is well connected and 93% of the population has access to the Internet.
All settlements have a cybercafe or a public wifi.
As mentioned above, while the term "Eskimo" is still acceptable in the United States, many non-Americans in the Arctic region, especially Canadians, agree that it has a derogatory meaning.
Although you may hear native Greenlanders use the word, foreigners should avoid using it.
In Canada, native Greenlanders call themselves Inuit and in Greenland they call themselves Kalaalleq (complex number Kalaallit), meaning “Greenlanders”.
In Greenland, crimes and malicious acts against foreigners are generally almost unknown. Even in towns, there is no high crime zone.
The cold may be the only real danger that unprepared people will face.
If you come to Greenland during the cold season (remember the way north goes colder), you must bring enough warm clothes.
The long summer days can lead to a lack of sleep and related health problems.
In summer, attention is also paid to Nordic mosquitoes. Although these mosquitoes don't spread any disease, they may cause discomfort.
The economy of San Francisco is related to the fact that it is a world-class tourist destination, but the economy of San Francisco is diversified.
The sectors with the highest employment include professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
It often appears in music, film, literature and popular culture, making the city and its landmark famous.
San Francisco has developed a large tourism infrastructure with hotels, restaurants and first-class meeting venues.
San Francisco is also a good destination for other Asian foods such as Korean food, Thai food, Indian food and Japanese food in the United States.
For many American families, going to Disneyland is a big event.
This "typical" exercise involves flying to Orlando International Airport, travelling by car to the Disney Park Hotel, traveling around in Disneyland for about a week, and then going home.
Disney plays in countless ways, but for most people, "Go to Disneyland" means that.
Many of the tickets sold on auction sites like eBay or Craigslist are partially used for multiple days.
Although this is a very common act, Disney forbids it: tickets are not transferable.
Camping permits are needed to camp below the edge of the Grand Canyon.
In order to protect the Grand Canyon, permits are issued in limited quantities.
Therefore, if the departure date is May, the field camping permit will be issued on January 1.
The most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel camp near Phantom Ranch, usually receive full booking applications on the first day of opening the reservation.
For unannounced visits, the number of permits reserved is limited and permits are granted on a first-come, first-served basis.
Southern Africa is well suited for driving, and tourists can both appreciate all the beauty of the region and reach places outside the regular tourism route.
With careful planning, ordinary cars can do it, but it is strongly recommended to use four-drive cars, and in many places only large axle four-drive cars can pass.
During the planning period, remember that while Southern Africa is in a stable state, not all neighbouring countries are in the same position.
Visa requirements and fees vary according to country/area and will be affected by your nationality.
Every country/region has a specific law that regulates emergency items that must be placed in cars.
Victoria Falls is a small town in western Zimbabwe, bordering Livings, Zambia, near Botswana.
The town is close to the Falls, the main destination, but this hot tourist destination offers many opportunities for explorers and tourists to stay long.
During the rainy season (November-March), the volume of water will be higher and the waterfalls will become more acute.
If you cross the bridge or follow the trail near the falls, you'll surely get wet.
On the other hand, precisely because the amount of water is too large, the sight will be blocked by the water, and the whole waterfall will not be seen!
The Tutankhamun Tomb (KV62). KV62 is probably the most famous burial in the valley. Howard Carter discovered the young king's near-complete royal burial in 1922.
But compared to most other royal mausoleums, the Tutankhamun mausoleum is hardly worth visiting, as it is much smaller in size and less decorative.
If anyone wants to see the mummy get damaged when it's removed from the coffin, they're going to lose sight of it, because everyone can see only the head and shoulders of the mummy.
The vast wealth of the ancient tombs was no longer in the tombs, but was transferred to the Egyptian museum in Cairo.
Tourists with limited time are better advised to choose another destination.
The Gorom Temple is located 12 km southwest of Siem Reap City. This mountain top temple was built at the end of the 9th century under the King of Losing Zones.
The dark atmosphere of the temple and the view of Tonle Sap make it feel worthwhile to climb to the top of the mountain.
You can also swim by boat when you visit the attractions.
Angkor's ticket is needed to enter the temple, so don't forget your passport when you go to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and the largest city, although most other countries/regions and the United Nations do not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
The ancient city, which sits on Judean Hills, has been a success for thousands of years.
The city is the holy place of the three main monotheistic religions — Judaism, Christianity and Islam — and is a true spiritual, religious and cultural centre.
The religious significance of Jerusalem, especially many sites in the old city, makes the city one of Israel ' s main tourist destinations.
Jerusalem has not only many historical, archaeological and cultural sites, but also vibrant shopping centres, cafés and restaurants.
Ecuador stipulates that Cuban citizens must receive invitations before entering Ecuador through international airports or border crossings.
The letter must be approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador and meet certain requirements.
These requirements were designed to achieve orderly migration between the two countries.
Cuban citizens holding green cards in the United States should visit Ecuador ' s consulate to obtain the exemption requested.
Your passport should be at least six months away from the departure date and require a return/joint ticket to prove your stay.
Travel is cheaper for a larger group of travelers. If you travel alone or with only one friend, try to meet someone else and form a group of 4 to 6 people, so you can get a more favourable per capita price.
There is, however, a little bit to worry about, as tourists are often transported in order to fill their cars.
It's actually more like a trickery way to make people think they have to pay more.
This steep mountain peak, high above the north end of Machu Picchu, often serves as a background for photographs of many sites.
It's a little scary down there, and it's a steep and tough uphill, but most people in good health should be able to do it in 45 minutes.
Most sections of the path are paved with stone steps; in the steeper part, there are steel cables that support them.
It was said that it would be too breathing, and that care should be taken in steep places, especially when the weather was damp, and that the situation could quickly become dangerous.
It has to go through a very small, very narrow hole close to the top.
To visit the Galapagos Archipelago attractions and wildlife, the best way to travel is by boat. Charles Darwin travelled by boat in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships travel regularly in Galapagos waters - the size of these cruise ships varies from 8 to 100 people.
Most people have pre-positioned early (because ships are usually full during the season).
Make sure that the agent for your scheduled trip is an expert in Galapagos, who knows a lot about ships.
This ensures that some of your interests and/or constraints match the ships best suited to them.
Before the arrival of Spain in the sixteenth century, northern Chile was ruled by Inca, while the indigenous Araucanians (the Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche people were also one of the last independent Native American tribes. It was not until Chile became independent that they were fully under Spanish ruler.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (Spain did not have a functioning central government for several years during the Napoleon war), it did not win a decisive victory over Spain until 1818.
Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country located in the eastern half of Ispaniola, which is divided into Dominica and Haiti.
In addition to having white sand beaches and mountain landscapes, the country is home to one of the oldest European-style cities in the American region and is now part of Santo Domingo.
Taínos and Caribes are the first people to settle on this island. Caribbeaners are the Arawak-speaking people who came here about 10000 B.C.
In just a few years after the arrival of European explorers, the Spanish conquerors cut down the population of Tenos.
According to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), Spanish aggressors killed about 100,000 Tinos between 1492 and 1498.
The Union Garden (Jardín de la Unión). This used to be the middle court of a 17th century monastery, where the Santiago shrine was the only existing building.
Now it's a central square, full of day and night.
There are many restaurants around the garden, and free concerts are often held at the central cooling booths in the afternoons and evenings.
Callejon del Beso (kissing alleys). The two balconys are only 69 centimetres apart.
Just give a little money and you can get some kids to tell the story.
Pao Yung Island is a suitable human destination for one day or weekend trips, where tourism projects and services such as kayaking, hiking, shops, restaurants, etc. are provided.
This truly community is located in Ho Bay, near Vancouver, and can easily arrive in regular water taxis from Granville Island, downtown Vancouver.
For those who like outdoor activity, it's bound to be on foot on Sea to Sky.
As a result of the 2010 Winter Olympics, the price of Whistler (1.5 hours away from Vancouver) was high, but he was well known.
In winter, enjoy some of the best skiing grounds in North America; in summer, try some real mountain bikes.
The permit must be made in advance. You must have a permit to spend the night in Selina.
Sirena is the only ranger to provide dorm accommodation and hot meals in addition to camping. La Leona, San Pedro and Los Patos only provide camping and do not provide catering services.
You can get permission to enter the park directly from Puerto Jiménez, but you can't use a credit card.
Parks Authority only issues park permits within one month of the expected visit date.
CafeNet El Sol offers appointment service at a fee of $30, compared to $10 a day; please see its Corcovado page for details.
The Cook Islands is an island country, a free association area of New Zealand and situated in Polynesia in the central South Pacific.
It is an archipelago of 15 islands spread over 2.2 million square kilometres of the sea.
Because they are in the same time zone as Hawaii, these islands are sometimes considered to be "Waya in the South".
Although small in size, it reminded some of the older tourists of Hawaii before the founding of the state, when there were not so many large tourist hotels and other development projects.
Cook Islands has no cities, but is made up of 15 different islands. The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In today's developed countries, the provision of luxury accommodation has risen to an art form.
In high-end markets, it is clear that a B&B company competes mainly in two areas: bedmaking and breakfast.
So in such an excellent place, people often find the most luxurious bedding, perhaps a handmade blanket, or an age-old bed.
Breakfast may include local time foods or special foods offered by the owner.
The scene could be an ancient building of historical significance, with an old-coloured furniture, a punctuated ground and a swimming pool.
To get into your car and start a long road trip has a simple, pure appeal in itself.
Unlike large cars, you may already be familiar with driving your own car and know its limitations.
Tentage on private property or small towns of any size can easily attract unnecessary attention.
In short, driving is a great way to drive, but it is not in itself a good fit for camping.
If you have a bigger minivan, a sports van, a sedan or a travel car, and the seat is flat, then you can make a car camp.
Some hotels date back to the golden age of steam trains and ocean ships: before the Second World War, in the 19th or the early 20th century.
These hotels were the home of rich and famous people at the time, and usually had high quality restaurants and night places.
Traditional equipment, lack of state-of-the-art facilities and age-sensitive glorification are also features.
Although they are usually privately owned, they sometimes also provide accommodation for visiting Heads of State and other dignitaries.
A long-sleeping passenger may consider travelling around the world by air and continue to live in many such hotels during the journey.
The food and accommodation exchange network is an organization that connects travellers to local residents in the cities of their destination.
Joining such an organization usually requires only one online form; although some organizations provide or request additional validation.
A paper version and/or an online version of the list will then be made available, listing the landlords with available accommodations and sometimes indicating the recommendation and evaluation information of other passengers.
Sofa surfing was set up in January 2004. Until then, computer programmer Casey Fenton had found cheap flights to Iceland but had no residence.
After sending mail to local university students, he arrived with an invitation to provide free accommodation.
Residentials provide services mainly to young people, who are typically their clients at age 20, but you can often meet relatively older people there.
Although there are few families with children, some hostels allow them to live in single rooms.
Beijing, China, will be the host city of the Winter Olympics in 2022, and this city will thus be the first city to hold both summer and winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the opening ceremony, the closing ceremony and the indoor skate race.
Other skiing events will take place at the Prince's Ski Field in Zhang Jiaguchi, some 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most temples have annual festivals, which vary from the end of November to the end of May.
Most temple festivals are held to celebrate temple anniversary and host temple events such as God's birthday.
The temple festivals in Kerala are extremely interesting, and there are usually iconic elephant parades, temple orchestra performances and other celebrations.
The World Expo (commonly known as the Universal Expo, World Expo) is an international event to showcase art and science.
The participating countries hold exhibitions of art and education in national galleries to showcase world problems or the culture and history of the country.
The World Horticulture Fair is a display of flowers, botanical gardens and everything related to plants.
Although the theory is that the World Expo can be held once a year (as long as it takes place in different countries), in practice this is not the case.
The duration of these projects usually ranges from three to six months and takes place in sites of no less than 50 hectares.
Over the years, people have used a lot of different film formats. Standard 35mm film (36x24mm negative) is the most common.
If the film is used, it can usually be easily refilled with a resolution that is roughly the same as the current digital single anti-camera.
Some medium-painted film cameras use 6x6cm and, more accurately, 56x56mm negatives.
As a result, the resolution reached almost four times the 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 versus 864).
For photographers, wildlife is one of the hardest people to shoot. Good luck, patience, experience, fine equipment is indispensable.
Many people are accustomed to wildlife photography, but like ordinary photography, one photo is more than a thousand words.
Wild animals are usually shot with long lenses, but other shots are needed for objects such as birds or microorganisms.
Many rare animals are hard to find, and parks sometimes have regulations for commercial photography.
Wild animals are either afraid of people or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or bad.
There are more than 5,000 different languages in the world, 20 of which have more than 50 million users.
Also, the written text is often easier to understand than the oral text. This is particularly true when describing an address, because it is often difficult to pronounce a pronunciation.
In many countries/regions, people across the country can speak fluent English, while in more countries/regions there is a slight knowledge of English, especially among young people.
Imagine a Manchester man, a Boston man, a Jamaican man and a Sydney man sitting around a restaurant in Toronto, if you like.
They tell the story of their homeland in their own unique accents and local native languages and make each other happy.
Buying food at supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to fill a stomach. If cooking conditions are not available, you can only choose what is available.
There is a growing variety of finished foods in supermarkets. Some even provide microwaves or other methods for heating foods.
In some countries or in some types of shops, at least one restaurant (usually informal) has a fairly favourable price.
Copy details of your insurance policy and insurance company contact details and carry them with you.
In order to consult, authorize and claim, they need to show the insurance company ' s mailbox address and the international telephone number.
A copy is ready for storage in the luggage and a copy is stored online (by e-mail to send an attachment to yourself or to store it in the "cloud end”).
If you travel with a laptop or a tablet, you store a copy in the memory or disk (and you can access it without the need for a network).
At the same time, copies of insurance contracts/contacts are given to travelers and relatives and friends who are willing to help back home.
Moose (also known as moose) are not born aggressive, but they will defend themselves if they feel threatened.
Some people do not view moose as a potential danger and may be too close to put themselves at risk.
Drink alcohol properly. Alcohol affects everyone differently. It's important to know the limits of your drinking.
Overdoses can cause long-term health problems, such as liver damage, and even blindness and death.
Illegal alcohol may contain dangerous impurities, including methanol, and even small doses can lead to blindness or death.
Glasses may be cheaper abroad, especially in low-income countries, where labour costs are lower.
An eye check in the home country could be considered (especially in cases where health insurance can be reimbursed), and the prescription could then be taken to another place to go to the mirror.
There may be two problems with the high-end brand frames purchased in these areas: some may be fake goods, and the real import frames may be more expensive than domestic purchases.
Coffee is one of the most traded commodities in the world, and it is likely that you will be able to buy a wide variety of coffees at home.
Nevertheless, there are many unique ways of drinking coffee in the world, all of which deserve to be experienced.
When the stream falls, it goes to the bottom of the canyon, which can be dry or have very deep water.
The streamfall combines elements of swimming, climbing and jumping - but it takes a relatively small amount of training and physical infrastructure to enter (as compared to rock climbing, water lung diving, mountain skiing, etc.).
A hike is an outdoor activity that walks in the natural environment (usually on a hikewalk).
One-day hiking is a journey that is completed within a day and can be at least a mile lower.
There is hardly any need to be prepared to travel a day along a smooth trail, and anyone who is not physically bad can enjoy the fun of hiking.
Families with children may need to be more prepared, but even with babies and pre-school children, it is not difficult to stay outside for a day.
There are nearly 200 running tourism organizations around the world, most of which operate independently.
Go Running Tours, the successor to Global Running Tours, connects dozens of tour operators from four continents.
The organization originated in the Running Tours Barcelona and the Running Copenhagen in Copenhagen, and soon the Running Tours Prague in Prague and other regional organizations joined.
You have to take into account many aspects before departure and during the journey.
When you travel, don't expect everything to be like "in the house." The manners, laws, diets, transportation, accommodation, standards, language, etc. will be different from where you live.
This is something you need to always remember so as to avoid disappointment or even disgust at local practices.
Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century. Travel agencies are generally a good choice if, during a journey, the traveller is not familiar with the nature, culture and language of the destination, or plans to travel to low-income countries.
While most travel agencies are willing to accept most of the regular appointments, there are many travel agencies that specialize in travel operations of a particular type, budget scope or destination.
Better find an agent who's always booked similar to your journey.
See what tourism products travel agencies promote and can be viewed on websites or shop windows.
If you want to spend the least money to see the world, there are ways to help you do it, whether it's necessary to change lifestyles or to challenge yourself.
Basically, they can be divided into two categories: working while travelling or minimizing expenses. The article focuses on the latter.
For tourists who want to sacrifice comfort and time, prefer a trip full of surprises, and lower their expenses to close to zero, see Minimum Budget Travel Strategy.
The assumption assumes that travellers will not steal, trespass, participate in the illegal market, beg or exploit others for their own benefit.
The entry checkpoint is usually the first stop by which an aircraft, ship or other means of transport are taken off the plane.
The inspection of some cross-border trains is carried out on board; when boarding a cross-border train, valid identification documents should be carried.
In the night sleeper train, in order not to affect the sleep of passengers, the captain of the train may collect the passport in advance.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you must register your presence and address with the local government.
This may require filling out forms at local police stations or visiting immigration offices.
In many countries with such laws, local hotels can register (must be asked clearly).
In other cases, only people living outside tourist accommodation need to be registered. However, the law is so vague that it needs to be known in advance.
Architecture is a discipline in architectural design and construction. A local building is often a tourist destination itself.
Many buildings have a beautiful look, whether from a high-rise or from a delicate window, and they see a beautiful view.
There is considerable overlap in the areas of architecture and urban planning, civil engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.
Given that many Pwebros live in very remote areas, you have to travel to Albuquerque or Santa Fe to enjoy a rich night's life.
However, almost all of the casinos listed above supply beverages, and some of them also offer well-known recreational activities (mainly large casinos in the immediate vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Note: For tourists from other states, the town bar here is not always a good place to hang around.
First, there are serious drinking and driving problems in northern New Mexico and a high proportion of drivers drive around small town bars.
Unlicensed mural drawings or sketches are called graffiti.
Although this is by no means a modern phenomenon, most people are likely to link it to the use of paint spray by young people to destroy public and private property.
Today, however, there are mature graffiti artists, graffiti activities and "legal" graffiti walls. Paintings of graffiti in this context are often similar to art rather than hard-to-identify labels.
The throwback dart is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn to throw an echo dart so that it can fly back into your hands when it flies out, make sure to use the right dart that can fly back.
In fact, most of the swing darts on the Australian market don't fly back. It's better not for the beginners to try to throw the darts in the wind.
Hangi refers to the cooking of the kiln.
The pits heat up by burning stones and, in some places, by using geothermal heat to heat the earth.
Stone and fire pots are often used to cook traditional barbecues.
Rotorwa has several places where geothermal kilns (hangi) are provided, while other practices of Maori kilns can be tasted in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail carriages in and around Cape Town and MetroRail train have two levels: MetroPlus (also called first class) and Metro (also known as third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded, but it's a little more expensive, even if it's cheaper than normal subway tickets in Europe.
Every train has MetroPlus and Metro cars; the former are always at the end of the train near Cape Town.
Carrying things for others - don't let the luggage out of your sight, especially when entering or leaving the country.
You might find yourself being exploited and becoming an unwitting drug dealer, which would put you in a lot of trouble.
This includes waiting in queues, as drug dogs may be used at any time without prior notice.
Some countries/regions even impose extremely severe penalties on first-time offenders; penalties may include imprisonment for more than 10 years or death penalty.
Unattended bags are not only targeted by thieves, but are also used as bomb threats that draw the attention and attention of the authorities.
When you're at home, because you're exposed to local germs, you can easily immunize them.
But in other parts of the world that have never experienced bacteria, you are much more likely to experience problems.
Moreover, in a warm climate, bacteria can both reproduce quickly and survive for longer in vitro.
So something like "Delhi Diarrhoea", "Pharaoh's Curse" and "Montezumar's Revenge" appeared.
Just as cold climates are prone to respiratory problems, hot climates are also extremely prone to intestinal problems. In most cases, intestinal problems can cause significant discomfort, but they are not very dangerous.
If you travel for the first time to a developing country or to a strange place, don't underestimate the potential cultural impact.
Many stable and capable travellers have been deterred by new problems of travel in developing countries, where there is a need to quickly adapt to the many subtle cultural differences that follow.
Especially in the early days, you can consider spending more money on Western-style and high-quality hotels, food and services to help you adapt to the environment.
Do not sleep on mattresses or mats on the ground in areas where the local fauna is unknown.
If you are going camping, please bring camping beds or hammocks to avoid harm like snakes and scorpions.
At home in the morning, they enjoy strong coffee, and at night they make relaxing chamomile tea.
The house is on vacation at home, it has more time on hand, it can spend a little bit more time on a special drink and work hard on itself.
If you want to update something strange, you can use this opportunity to squeeze some juice or make a mix of milk shakes:
Maybe you'll find a simple drink that you can make at breakfast when you return to normal daily life.
If you live in cities with a variety of drinking culture, go to bars or taverns in neighbourhoods you don't usually go to.
For those who are not familiar with medical terminology, the terms "infective" and "tactile" have very different meanings.
Infectious diseases are diseases caused by pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and other parasitic organisms.
Infectious diseases refer to a category of diseases that are very easily transmitted near the infected person.
Many Governments require inbound tourists or departing residents to be vaccinated against a range of diseases.
These requirements usually depend on the country the traveller has visited or intends to visit.
One of the advantages of Charlotte, North Carolina, is that it offers families many high-quality choices.
Households from other regions often praise family friendship as the main reason for their migration, and tourists find it very pleasant to visit the city with their children.
Over the past 20 years, Charlotte has achieved exponential growth in child-friendly facilities in upper urban areas.
Families living in Charlotte do not usually use taxis except in exceptional circumstances.
More than two passengers will have to pay extra, so this option may be expensive and unnecessary.
Antarctica surrounds Antarctica and is the coldest place on Earth.
Travel costs and physical requirements are high, and travel can only take place in the summer between November and February of the following year. Tour sites are mainly confined to the Peninsula, the Islands and the Rose Sea.
During the summer, more than 40 bases here will host thousands of staff, most of whom are stationed in the area; a small number of people stay through the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a desolate highland covered by 2-3 kilometer thick ice.
Occasionally, dedicated air travel groups travel inland, participate in mountain climbing or travel to large bases in the South Arctic.
The South Pole Trade (or highway) of Antarctica began at the McMurdo Station in the Rose Sea, straight to the Antarctic Point, which is 1600 km long.
Snow is compacted and the cracks are filled and marked with flags. Only special tractors and sleighs with fuel and supplies can pass.
The car was not very flexible, so it had to go around the Trans-Antarctic Mountains to take a long big turn to reach the plateau.
The most common cause of accidents in winter is the wetness of roads and surfaces (walks), especially steps.
At least you need the right shoes on the soles of your shoes. It's usually smooth to walk on ice in summer shoes, and even some winter boots aren't enough.
Shoe tattoos should be deep enough to be 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more; materials should be soft enough at low temperatures.
Some boots have shoe nails; there are also extended equipment designed for wet slide surfaces, with shoe nails, that applies to most shoes and boots, that can be kept up in shoes or on heels and soles at the same time.
The heels should be low and wide. The roads often throw sand, sand or salt particles (calcium chloride) to increase friction.
Avalanche is not an anomaly; the amount of snow that can be held on steep slopes is limited and the excess snow falls in the form of an avalanche.
The problem is that snow is very sticky. Some triggers are needed to bring snow down, and a little snow falls may trigger other snowfalls.
Sometimes the initial trigger is because the sun warms the snow, sometimes because there is more snowfall and sometimes because of other natural events, but more often the cause is often man-made.
The tornado is an extremely low-pressure rotor that inhales the surrounding air inwardly and upwards.
The tornado produces strong winds (often 100 to 200 miles per hour), throws heavy things into the air and holds them up and moves forward.
At first, the funnel-like cloud stretches down from the thunderstorm cloud and becomes a tornado when they touch the ground.
The personal VPN (virtual private network) program is an excellent tool to circumvent political censorship and commercial IP geographic filtering.
They are superior to web agents for the following reasons: they reroute all Internet traffic, not just the text transfer protocol (http) content.
They usually provide higher bandwidth and higher quality services. They are encrypted and harder to monitor.
Media companies routinely lied to cover up their purpose, claiming it was to “prevent piracy”.
In fact, the area code has nothing to do with illegal reproduction; a copy of a desk-by-desk copy can be played smoothly on any device that can play the original disk.
The real purpose is to allow these companies to better control their markets; everything is for money.
You don't have to use a call company located in your place of residence or travel because the call is made via the Internet.
Whether to get a local number in the resident community is not required; you can get satellite Internet connection in the field of Alaska King and then choose a number that shows you are located in sunny Arizona.
In many cases, you have to buy a single number that you can use globally in order to listen to calls from the public exchange phone network (PSTN). The source of the number has a great influence on the main caller.
Real-time text translation application: an application that automatically converts the entire text from one language to another.
Some of these applications even allow users to direct smartphones to signs or other objects in the real world and translate foreign language words above them.
Translation engines have improved significantly and now often provide more or less correct translations (and much less nonsense), but it is important to note that they may still be completely wrong.
One of the most outstanding applications of this kind is Google Translation. After downloading the required language data, it can be translated offline.
Use of smartphone GPS navigation applications may be the easiest and convenient navigation mode when travelling abroad.
It would be cheaper to buy enough maps or stand-alone GPS equipment to carry GPS, or to rent one from a car rental company.
If your cell phone has no data connection or is out of service, the performance of the cell phone may be limited or the cell phone cannot be used.
Each street shop has a row of fancy prepaid telephone cards, which can be used either for public payphones or for ordinary telephones.
Although most of the cards are suitable for calling anywhere, some have special advantages when dialing some country-specific calls.
These services are usually available by calling a telephone number, and most telephone calls are free of charge.
The rules governing conventional photography also apply to video, and may even be more relevant.
If you can't even take a picture, you don't have to make a video.
If drones are used, please carefully confirm in advance what can be filmed and what permits or additional license plates are required.
It's a bad idea to operate drones in the vicinity of the airport or in crowded places, even if this is not illegal in your area.
Few people now book tickets directly through airlines without first searching and comparing prices.
Sometimes the prices of the same flight may vary considerably from one information-gathering site to another, and it would be beneficial to compare search results before booking and to look at the airline's own website.
Although visas are not required for travel or business travel during short-term visits to certain countries, students who stay there usually spend longer periods than leisure tourists.
Normally, a longer stay in a foreign country requires an advance visa.
Student visas usually have different requirements and application procedures compared to ordinary tourist visas or business visas.
In most countries, you need a letter of admission to the school you wish to attend, as well as a document proving that you have the funds needed for at least the first year of the course.
The consultation school and the immigration authorities of the country where you wish to study are informed of the detailed requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, work abroad generally entails paying income tax to the country/area in which it is located.
The structure of income tax varies from country to country, and there are significant differences in tax rates and tariff scales.
Some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, collect federal and local income taxes, so tax rates and grades may vary from region to region.
When returning to the country, there is usually no need to carry out immigration checks or just walk around, but passing through customs can be cumbersome.
Ensure that you know what you can carry, what you can't carry, and declare anything that goes beyond what is permitted by law.
The simplest way to start travel writing is to sharpen your skills on a senior travel blog website.
You can create your own website once you're familiar with the online layout and editing.
Volunteering in travel is a different way, but it is not just about paying.
Living abroad and being a volunteer are good ways to understand different cultures, to meet new friends, to learn about themselves, to exercise the ability to properly judge, and even to acquire new skills.
This is also a good way to save the budget and to stay somewhere longer, as many volunteers work to provide food and accommodation and some work has a small salary.
Vikings use Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Some of these routes are still accessible today. It may be difficult to apply for special permits if you want them.
The Bering Strait connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, most of which are rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to Volga, so it may be possible to reach here via Russia from the Caspian Sea.
Don't worry, when you get to the dock, everything will be fine. You'll meet someone else who wants to take a ride, and they'll share information with you.
Basically, you can post a sign that you can help, walk back and forth at the docks, contact people who are cleaning yachts or sailors in bars, etc.
Try talking to as many people as possible. In a while, everyone will know you, and they'll tell you which boat you're looking for.
You must be careful in choosing the "Flying frequent" airline in the Alliance.
While it may be natural for you to think that it would be natural for you to be a member of any airline with the highest number of flights, you should know that airlines often offer different interests and that other airlines under the same alliance may give back more regular passenger credits.
Air divisions such as Emirates Airlines, Attihad Airlines, Qatar Airlines and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their services to Africa, providing routes to many major cities in Africa at prices that are more competitive than those of other European airlines.
Since 2014, Turkish Airlines has been able to reach 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have more than enough travel time, check out the total fare to Africa compared to the worldwide fare.
For all regions outside Africa, don't forget to add additional visa fees, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc.
If you just want to fly around the world in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flight and destination is very limited, because there are few trans-ocean routes.
There is no single air union route in the southern hemisphere that can cross all three oceans (the TAC does not even have a trans-ocean route).
However, the Star and Space Alliance covers all routes around the globe, with the exception of the south-east Pacific route from Santiago, Chile, to Tahiti, which is the route of a South American Airlines (LATAM) airline.
If you don't want to go through the South Pacific and the West Coast of South America, there is another option than this flight. (See below.)
In 1994, the Armenian-Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan launched a war against Azerbaijanis.
A new republic was born with the support of Armenia. However, it was not officially recognized by any country, including Armenia.
Diplomatic disputes in the region continue to lead to the deterioration of relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The canal area (Dutch: Grachtengerel) is the famous old town of the 17th century surrounding Binnstad, Amsterdam.
Due to its unique cultural and historical values, the entire region is classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and the property value of the region is among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, originally designated as five plots of land, consists of five small coastal villages, Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso, located in the Liguria region of Italy.
They are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
For centuries, ladder fields have been carefully constructed on the rugged terrain, and these slopes have been extended to cliff cliffs overlooking the sea.
It's attractive in part because there's no obvious business development. Villages are connected by roads, trains and boats, and they can't drive from the outside to these villages.
The French languages used in Belgium and Switzerland are slightly different from French in France, although they are very similar and mutually accessible.
In particular, the French language spoken by Belgium and Switzerland has some minor peculiarities on the digital system, unlike French, and some words are pronounced slightly differently.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss will learn standard French at school, so even if you use the standard French measurement system, they can understand it.
In many parts of the world, waving is a friendly expression, meaning "Hello."
In Malaysia, however, at least among the Malays in rural areas, this gesture is similar to the "come here" that some Western countries use to swing towards their bodies with their feeding fingers, and this gesture is used only to indicate that.
By the same token, when waving goodbye, British tourists in Spain might think it was a gesture to invite someone back if their hands wave to themselves (rather than to someone who wants to make a difference).
Auxiliary languages are artificial languages or constructed languages created to facilitate communication among groups of people whose languages are not connected to each other.
They differ from the general language. The general language is a natural or evolving language, which, for various reasons, is the main means of communication among users of other languages.
At the hottest day of the day, travellers can experience the illusion created by water (or other things) - the mirage of the sea and city.
It would be dangerous for travellers to chase the mirage because it would waste valuable energy and remaining water.
Even in the hottest desert, the night becomes extremely cold. Without warm clothes, hypothermia is a real risk.
Especially in summer, if you decide to walk through the rainforest, you need to be careful with mosquitoes.
If you're driving through the subtropical rainforest, for a few seconds when you enter the car, the door will be open enough for mosquitoes to enter the car with you.
Avian flu, or more formally known as "poultry flu," can infect both birds and mammals.
Humans reportedly have fewer than 1,000 cases of avian flu, but some of them are fatal.
Most cases come from people who deal with poultry, but bird-watchers also have certain risks.
The typical landscape of Norway is that the steepy fjords and valleys suddenly turn into tall, more or less steep highlands.
These plateaus are commonly referred to as "vidde", meaning a vast, open and treeless space, a vast area.
In Rogaran and Agde, they are commonly referred to as "hei", meaning that there are no trees in the wilderness, usually full of stone south.
The glaciers are not stable, but flow from the mountains. This leads to cracks and ice cracks that may be hidden by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of the ice hole may collapse and the cracks may close.
On the edge of glaciers, huge ice blocks will loose and fall and may jump or roll further away from the edge.
The summer season in the mountains is usually summer in India.
In winter, however, there is a different beauty and charm, and the amount of snow in many mountain havens is just right. These places offer activities such as skiing and skiboarding.
Only a few airlines threw up to pay for the funeral ticket, which was slightly cheaper than a temporary trip to the funeral.
The airlines that provide such fares include Canadian Airlines, Darmeh Airlines, German Hansa Airlines (a flight from the United States or Canada) and Air Wester.
Whatever the situation, you have to make a direct call to book the airline.
He added, "We've got rats four months old without diabetes, but they've had the disease."
Dr. Ehud Ur (Professor of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax City, Nova Scotia, and Professor, Clinical and Science Department, Diabetes Canada) cautioned that the study was still in its early stages.
Like some other experts, he doubted whether diabetes could be cured. He noted that the findings had nothing to do with people already suffering from type 1 diabetes.
On Monday, Sarah Daniels, Permanent Secretary of the Nobel Committee of Literature of the Swedish Academy, announced to the public in a program on Swedish radio that the committee had abandoned its attempt to contact Bob Dylan because it could not contact him directly, informing him that he had won the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature.
Danius said, "We're still standing still. I called and e-mailed the best partner of his relationship, and I received a very friendly response from each other. For now, that's enough."
Earlier, CEO Jamie Siminov of Ring stated that he could not hear the doorbell in his studio in the garage when the company was founded.
He said he made a WiFi doorbell.
Siminov said that after he showed up on "Smart Winner" in 2013, there was a huge increase in sales by the company, when the group refused to invest in the startup company.
In late 2017, Siminov appeared on the QVC TV sales channel.
Ring also reached an out-of-court settlement with its competitor, ADT Security.
Although an experimental vaccine appears to reduce mortality from the Ebola virus, to date, no medication has been clearly demonstrated to be suitable for treating existing infections.
An antibody cocktail, known as ZMapp, was initially expected to play a role in this area, but the official study showed that it was somewhat less effective in preventing death.
ZMapp is used as a reference in the PALM experiment. That is, scientists use it as a baseline and compare the other three treatment methods.
The United States Gymnastics Association supported the letter of the American Olympic Committee and accepted the strict requirement of the Olympic family to create a safe training environment for all athletes.
We agree with the statement of the American Olympic Committee that instead of withdrawing our licences, it would be better to continue to promote meaningful change within our organization, which might be more conducive to safeguarding the interests of athletes and clubs and their movements.
According to an independent investigation supported by the American Gymnastics Association, we may be able to learn why the massive sexual assault of Larry Nassar, which the survivors bravely exposed, was not detected for so long. Moreover, the Association has indicated that it will make the necessary and appropriate corrections.
The United States Gymnastics Association and the American Olympic Committee share the objective of ensuring, as far as possible, the safety of gymnastics and other sports so that athletes pursue their dreams in a safe, active and supportive environment.
In the 1960s, Bulzezinsky first served for John Ford Kennedy, served as his adviser, and then worked for Linden Baines Johnson's administration.
During the 1976 presidential election, he provided Carter with advice on foreign policy and subsequently replaced Henry Kissinger as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981.
As a national security adviser, he assisted Carter in a number of international matters, such as the signing of the Camp David Agreement in 1978; the normalization of relations between the United States and China in the late 1970s; the Iranian revolution that led to the crisis of Iranian hostages in 1979; and the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union in 1979.
The film, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, was nominated for the prizes.
Gosling and Stone received nominations for the best male and the best female lead, respectively.
Other nominations include best film, best director, best photography, best costume design, best film clips, best original music, best artistic guidance, best audio clips, best mix and best original scripts.
The two songs of the film, "The Heart of Dream" and "The City of Starlight" were nominated for the best original songs. The Liongate Film industry received 26 nominations, more than any other studio.
Later on Sunday, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, issued a statement through the press secretary, announcing that the United States army would withdraw from Syria.
Trump made a statement after calling Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The statement stated that Turkey would also take over custodial tasks for arrested ISIS militants; European countries refused to repatriate them.
This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs have feathers — a theory that has been widely circulated — but also provides details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as colours and 3Ds.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal top is chestnut brown and the bottom is light or carrot color.
The discovery also contributed to an in-depth understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
The feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed backbone -- this is called the "feat axes", but there are other features of the feathers, such as the plums and the feathers and the researchers assume that the feathers may evolve later than these other features.
The feather structure shows that they are not used to fly, but to regulate temperature or display. Researchers think that while this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature feathers, not the feathers of a cub.
According to researchers, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers rather than the velvet hair of a young dragon.

Then two photographers replaced an old woman who needed to go to the washroom. Mendoza was killed.
Liggins followed his father's footsteps and started a doctor's career.
He has been trained as an obstetrician and has worked at the Auckland National Women's Hospital since 1959.
Liggins started studying premature births in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His research shows that the application of hormones can accelerate the maturity of the baby lung.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also mourn Luna.
Tommy Chase said, "Luna was the first Queen, my first manager. Luna died on a bimonthly night. It's as special as she is. She's a strong woman."
Dustin Runnels said, "Luna is as elusive as I am and she may be more difficult to understand...I love her and I want her to... want her to go to a better place."
1,400 respondents were surveyed prior to the 2010 federal elections, and the number of respondents opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
Guardian Prime Minister Julia Gilad said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the Queen Elizabeth II resigned.
34% of respondents unanimously expressed the hope that Queen Elizabeth II would become Australia's last monarch.
There was a polarization in the vote, with 29% of respondents arguing that Australia should have a republic as soon as possible, and 31% that Australia should never have a republic.
The Olympic gold medal winner should have participated in the three relays of the 100-m and 200-metre free swim and the Commonwealth Games, but his health has been questioned because of his complaints.
He has never been able to use drugs to relieve pain, because contestants are prohibited from taking these drugs.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the Central University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known numbers so far on 25 January.
In early February, several people validated the discovery using different hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water and organic matter on Earth that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists want to know how planets have been formed since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, especially how the planet has been formed.
At the beginning of this year, Cuomo, 53 years old, became governor, and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriages.
He called the rumour "political fragmentation and stupidity".
It is assumed that he will run for president in 2016.
According to the United States Federal Aviation Office (FAA), a new generation of air transport systems (NextGen) could shorten aircraft flight routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology rather than old ground radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional means of transport were added, the train on the ground was stopped at Wembley, and there was no parking lot or parking-for-flight facility on the ground.
Fearing a lack of transportation, the game may be forced to take place behind closed doors without team supporters.
On Thursday, a study published in Science magazine stated that a new bird was formed in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved for only two generations, although it was thought that the process would take longer, as a result of breeding between the brave bird in the local Darwinbird and the outside cactus mouth.
Gold can be processed into different shapes. It can curl into small shapes.
It can be tangled and tangled. It can be beat or crushed.
It can be very thin, glued to other metals, and, by reaching such thinness, can sometimes be used to decorate hand drawings in books known as "Glossy Books".
It's called the pH of the chemical. You can use the red glycerine to make the indicator.
The color of cabbage juice will change depending on the acidity of the chemical substance.
pH values are expressed in the number of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the measured chemicals.
The hydrogen ion is the proton that lost the electrons (because the hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron).
Mobilize the two dry powders and mix them up with a ball with clean wet hands.
The water in your hand reacts to the outer layer, and it creates a shell-like layer, which is very interesting.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro have flush toilets in almost every household, which are linked to a sophisticated sewage treatment system.
Sites of sewage systems were found in houses on the Greek island of Crete and in the city of Santoriniminos.
There are toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets are sometimes part of mixed public bathrooms.
You call people thousands of miles away, you use satellites.
Satellites in space received telephone calls and almost immediately reflected them back.
Satellites are launched from rockets into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts certain light and vision.
To send satellites or telescopes into space, a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheels changed the world in an incredible way. The wheels' greatest contribution to us is to make our traffic easier.
With it, we have trains, cars and many other means of transport.
Below them are more mid-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Ultimately, there are many small cats (including scattered pet cats) that feed on a much larger number of small preys such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of profit, and each cat is responsible for a special job to prevent them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the cats with the most visible residential properties and live in large groups known as lions.
Lions are made up of adult males with one to three relatives, and up to 30 females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters of the extended family, females are usually close to each other.
The behaviour of the lions is very similar to that of wolves or dogs. These animals behave like lions amazingly (but unlike other large cats), and they are also very deadly to their prey.
Tigers are all-power athletes. They climb (though they're not strong), swim and jump, and pull up five times the strength of human Hercules.
Tigers belong to the same type as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four big cats are the only cats that can scream.
Tiger growls are not as deep as lions growls, but more like an angry scream.
The cat likes to eat small animals. If conditions permit, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. The cat's prey is almost much smaller than its own.
Scientists believe that leopard cats track and search for predators by smelling and sniffing their prey on the ground.
Their night vision is strong, they can see clearly in the dark, and their actions are hidden. The way the cat hunts first integrates into the surroundings and then hits the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) are separated from their primary stocks (e.g. they cross mountains and rivers, or they reach a new island so easily that it is impossible to return), they usually find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new stocks will need different characteristics or adaptability to become a strong competitor rather than what they needed before.
The original stocks have not changed at all, and they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
Over time, new stocks began to adapt to new environments, and they began to become less and less similar to other stocks.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two species will eventually look very different so that they cannot be described as the same species.
We call this process "species formation," which is the formation of new species. The formation of species is an inevitable consequence of evolution and an extremely important link in evolution.
Plants can produce oxygen inhaled by humans and absorb carbon dioxide from humans.
Plants get nutrients from sunlight through photo-cooperative use. They can also provide shade.
We make houses with plants, we make clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals can't survive.
Dragons were the top predators of that era, and there was nothing to fear except their kind.
Its long jaw is full of more than 70 razor-like sharp teeth, and there's a row on the upper jaw. That means there's no way to escape anything that meets it.
Its tongue may be fork, which we are not sure about. Its food includes sea turtles, large fish, other final dragons, and even humans.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus are not its rivals.
Although most of the Romans' food is common to us, they do have some strange or unusual dinner dishes, including boars, peacocks, snails and a rodent called thugs.
The other difference is that poor people and women sit in chairs for dinner, while rich people like to come together and have dinners and sit on their sides.
Food coming into Europe from America or Asia several centuries later is unlikely to appear in ancient Roman diets.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes and cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever eaten turkey.
The Babylonians built a master house for each one of them, and they saw it as the house of God.
The sacrifice will be given to God, and the priest will meet God's needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner house accessible only to priests.
Some of the special towers are shaped in pyramid shape, known as pyramids, and were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower is God's special holy place.
Houses are not so important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The Hebrew family spends most of its life outdoors.
Women cook in the yard; shops are actually open counters for the streets. They build houses with stones.
Canaan doesn't have big forests, so wood is very expensive.
Greenlanders are scarcely smoked. According to the Nordic Ssysssaagah, Redbeard Eric was expelled from Iceland for murder. He sailed west and found the land and named it Greenland.
But whether he found it or not, the Eskimo were already living there.
Although they all belong to Scandinavia, there are many differences among the population, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the film National Treasure, you might think the Declaration of Independence will have a treasure map behind it.
But that's not true. Although there's something written on the back of this document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776 (original Declaration of Independence, July 1776)" are written on the bottom of the document, in reverse.
Although no one can determine who the author is, this large parchment document (size 293⁄4 inch multiplied by 241⁄2 in) is said to have been rolled up and stored at the time of writing.
So it's very likely that the symbol was only added as a label.
Normandy landed and then fought to liberate the north of France, but the south has still not been liberated.
It was ruled by the French "Wish." The French had reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940, not to resist the aggressors, but to cooperate with them.
On August 15th, 1940, the Allies entered the south of France and this attack was called Operation Dragon Cavalry.
In just two weeks, the United States and the Free France army liberated the south of France and turned to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by people (society) living together and working cooperatively.
The word “civilization” comes from Latin “civilis” (meaning “citizen”), which is related to Latin “civvis” (meaning “citizen”) and “civitas” (meaning “city” or “city State”), which in some way defines the size of society.
The city is the nation's precursor. The civilizational culture means that knowledge is passed on from generation to generation, that cultural footprints are preserved, and that culture can spread equitably.
Minority cultures often disappear without pertinent historical evidence and are not treated as decent civilizations.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Federal Regulations (the National Assembly is its only component).
Congress does not have the power to tax, and because there is no executive or judicial branch of the State, the Congress relies on state governments to implement all bills, which often fail to cooperate.
Nor does it have the power to overturn tax laws and customs duties between states.
These provisions can only be amended with the unanimous consent of all states, which are so slow in their attitude towards the central government that their state representatives are often absent.
The Italian National Football Team and the German National Football Team were the second most successful teams in the world, winning the championship of the Football World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, waterball, swords, rugby, bicycles, hockey, roll hockey and first-class equations.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic competitions.
Japan has nearly 7000 islands (the largest is the island of the state), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's large island population, Japan is often referred to from the geological point of view as the "Island"
Western knowledge of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century. The passing European sailor named the island "Ilha Formosa", meaning beautiful islands.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Corporation set up a base in southwest Taiwan, started changing the way indigenous people produce food, and hired Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885 the Da Qing Empire announced the construction of Taiwan's province.
In 1895, after the defeat of the Midday War (1894-1895), the Qing Government signed the Ma Guan Treaty, cede Taiwan ' s sovereignty to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu is made up of three main buildings: Intihuatana, the temple of the Sun and the house of the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt in order to give visitors a better understanding of the original features of the complex.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been repaired and the restoration work continued until today.
For example, the most common static image camera format in the world is 35 mm format, which is the dominant movie size at the end of the film age.
To date, production is still available, but more importantly, its width ratio is applied to the format of the digital camera image sensor.
The actual size of the 35 mm format is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, so the format is a little confusing.
So the width ratio of this format (the simplest integer ratio divided by 12) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format series) are the same or quite close to this width ratio.
The dichotomy, which is often abused and mocked, is a simple guiding method in creating dynamics and keeps images in order.
It points out that the most effective position for the subjects is the crosspoint of the line that divides the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see examples).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church has been closely monitored.
Despite the diversity of languages and customs among European countries, Christianity has linked them together for more than a thousand years.
From the king to the civilians, its power spreads across 10 different sides, affecting everyone.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the Church's Monetary Fund was created specifically for that purpose.
The concentration of power and money, which has existed in Rome for more than a thousand years, has led many people to question whether they have complied with this doctrine.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to impose a maritime blockade on Germany.
They cut off the supply of life- and death-related military and civilian goods. This strategy proved to be effective, despite the fact that the blockade has violated international law that has been universally accepted under several international agreements over the past two centuries.
British mines in international waters prevent any vessel from entering the entire sea, and even threaten the ships of neutral nations.
Given the limited response to this strategy, Germany expects a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 20th century and 20th century, the dominant attitude of most citizens was pacifist, separatist.
After witnessing the atrocities of the First World War, all countries were eager to avoid repeating their mistakes.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 and accepted a job from Edison in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had four cents on his body, a poem collection and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the manager of his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
The different periods of the ancient Chinese era have their own characteristics; each time in China or every family in charge of the world is a distinct dynasty.
By the same token, the period of conversion from generation to generation has been a time of instability in small countries. The most famous of these has been the period of three countries lasting 60 years, which is between the Han Jin generation and the other generation.
During these turbulent times, there was a fierce war between the world's hobbies over the throne.
The three countries are one of the bloodiest times in China ' s ancient history. Thousands of people died fighting for the supreme power of the Xianhua Palace.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of units of measurement, the transition from dictatorship to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the State is not the sole ruler but the people.
Moreover, after the revolution, the official position was open to all men, giving the most ambitious and successful people a chance to fly.
The same applies to the military, because rank is no longer based on rank, but rather on merit.
The French Revolution also encouraged the oppressed working class in many other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was very interested in things other than life in the world. He used to go to a cave called Sheila on the hill.
The cave itself has not only survived the test of time but has also created a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
The cave sits on a mountaintop north of Macca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even knowing that it exists is not easy to find. Once you enter a cave, you are completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Nothing can be seen except the clear and beautiful sky and the mountains around it. In the caves, the visions and sounds of the outside can hardly be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only building that has remained undefeated so far in seven miracles.
The Great Pyramid, the masterpiece of the Egyptians in the third century B.C., was one of many large pyramids paying tribute to the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau of Egypt's Death Valley (i.e. the "Giza Pyramids") includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small graves, several temples and large lion faces.
The Great Pyramid was built to honour the memory of Huff Pharaoh, and a number of smaller pyramids, graves and temples were built to honour the memory of Huff's wife and family members.
The upper bow symbol is like the letter V, the lower bow symbol is like a nail or missing the bottom square.
Upward refers to pushing the bow from the top and down refers to pulling the bow from the roots (i.e. the place where the bow is held in hand).
The upper bow usually makes a softer voice, while the lower bow makes a stronger and stronger voice.
Make your own mark with pencils of your own free will, but remember, the notes printed are musical, so they should normally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antoinette and their two children (11-year-old Mary Teresa and 4-year-old Louis Charles) and the King's sister, Elizabeth Elizabeth, were driven back from Versailles by a group of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, and a group surrounded them, shouting and threatening the King and the Queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage completely.
In front of the frightened Queen, a thug once waved the head of a royal guard who was killed at Versailles Palace.
The war expenses of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States colonial regime to pay most of their expenses and interest on bonds issued through Wall Street Bank in the name of the Philippine Government.
Of course, the high profits earned by the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people became the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the formation of the Templars.
The era in which events took place was usually referred to as the medieval peaks of European history, i.e. the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1,000-1300 A.D.).
The medieval period predates the early medieval period, followed by the late medieval period, and it has been agreed that the late medieval period ends around 1500 years or so.
Technical decision theory is a term that covers many ideas in practice, including technology push theory, technology necessity theory, and a strict definition - human destiny is driven by the underlying logic associated with scientific law and its performance in technology.
Most interpretations of technology decision theory include these two general ideas: first, that technology itself has developed to a large extent beyond cultural or political influences, and second, that technology in turn has an inherent “impact” on society that is not constrained by social conditions.
One might say, for example, that cars will certainly contribute to the development of roads.
However, it is not economically feasible to set up a national road network for only a few cars, so new production methods should be created in order to reduce the cost of car ownership.
High levels of mass motor vehicle ownership will also lead to higher rates of road traffic accidents, which will facilitate the invention of new medical technologies for the repair of injuries.
Romanticism has a strong cultural determining colour. It comes from writers like Goethe, Fihit and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time geographic-related customs and cultures have emerged, which are much better integrated with the local harmony of society than laws arbitrarily imposed.
Constantinople is considered a fashion capital of the feudal era in Europe, just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world.
Its reputation as a luxury centre began around 400 years A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its position declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the gifts brought by the Crusades upon their return, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this point that the title of the fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th - 11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by the East Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow cultural exchange, Western fashion may be 25-30 years behind.
As the Middle Ages moved towards the end, Western Europeans evolved their style. One of the greatest advances at that time was that, after the Crusades, people began to tie their clothes with buttons.
Self-supporting agriculture is an agricultural activity aimed at producing food that only meets the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and usually organic system that maximizes production by using local seeds stored in the ecozone, combined with crop rotations or other relatively simple technologies.
Historically, most farmers are engaged in subsistence agricultural production. This is still the case in many developing countries today.
Asian culture unites like-minded individuals who feel that they are ignored by social standards and that subculture develops a sense of identity among them.
Subcultures may be unique, given the age, race, class, location and/or gender differences of members.
The characteristics that make subculture different may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography or multiple factors.
Members of sub-cultural communities often use their unique style of conduct symbolically to indicate their membership, including fashion costumes, behaviour and black lines.
To illustrate the importance of socialization, one of the most commonly used methods is to take advantage of the few cases of unfortunate children who, as a result of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, do not grow up socially with the help of adults.
Some wild children are hidden by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because parents refuse to accept that the child has severe mental or physical defects.
Wild children may experience severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or leaving home.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some live alone in the wild.
If a wolf child is raised entirely by a non-human animal, his behaviour (to the extent that physical conditions permit) is very similar to that animal, for example, by displaying fear or indifference towards human beings.
While the project learning method should make learning easier and more interesting, the back-to-back learning method goes further.
Pedagogy is not a learning method, but a means of assisting those who have just learned to use new computer programs or start new projects.
Pedagogy can be done online or under the line, in other words, teachers are a form of pedagogy, just like the echo needle helper in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support internalizes in software to question, prompt and explain programs that may be difficult for students to handle on their own.
The children were placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an uneducated, unloved and uneducated environment, but it would be counterproductive.
We see the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable medical care.
The foster care system should provide for all the necessities that are lacking in the original family.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet add additional dimensions in terms of their use and means of satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “interconnection” are considered important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
In studying the audience's response to the website, Emmett and McDell (1998) also used “individual involvement” and “continuing relationships” as new motivation.
The use of video has led to significant discoveries in explaining micro-expressions (face movement that lasts for a few milliseconds).
Specifically, it is said that it is possible to judge whether a person is lying by correctly reading micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his paper, The President's Speech, that those who are unable to understand language because of brain damage can still judge accurately whether or not they speak.
He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior might be shared by animals such as family dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variability: explicit and invisible.
The mutation adds new genetic mutations, and the selection removes the mutation from the expressed gene variant pool.
As a result of separation and reorganization, variations change from generation to generation between two banks.
In the savannahs, primates have human-like digestive systems, and existing plant resources are difficult to meet the amino acid demand of primates.
Moreover, failure to do so would have serious consequences: stunting growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources should be proteins in leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for primates like ours to digest these proteins unless they are cooked.
By contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) not only digest easily, but also provide a large amount of protein containing all necessary amino acids.
In conclusion, we should not be surprised if the way our ancestors solve the "protein problem" is the same as the way chimpanzees use today in the savannahs.
Sleep interruption refers to the process of consciously waking up during normal sleep and sleeping after a short period (10-60 minutes).
It's easy to use a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without being completely awakened.
If you find that you will reset the alarm clock when you sleep, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room and force yourself out of bed to close the alarm clock.
Other biological rules-based options include extensive pre-sleep drinking of liquids (especially water or tea — well known pro-urbation roles) and forcing yourself to pee.
The degree of internal calm of a person is contrary to the level of physical and mental tension.
The smaller the pressure, the more active the vitality. Everyone is likely to find absolute calm and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach the enlightened horizon, and the only obstacle to its realization is our own sense of tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been expanded through the universal love of Buddhism and many techniques of yoga in India.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes the methods of Quindalini yoga, meditation and universal love.
In Quindalini Yoga, Quindalini energy (inventive energy) is awakened through yoga positions, breathing exercises, speech and visual images.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is Sky-Yuga. By projecting the image of different gods, purging energy channels and activating the wheels, it reaches the horizon of enlightenment.
Germany was the common enemy of all countries during World War II, which facilitated cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. As the war ended, institutional, procedural and cultural conflicts divided the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies are now enemies and the cold war began.
The war lasted 40 years, and the proxy army fought real battles on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defense line had been breached, and the only hope left was to withdraw and reconfigure the army along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were abandoned almost overnight, after which more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered the country and set up positions in Belarus and Ukraine in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet Polish Non-Aggression Treaty and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties and invaded the eastern part of Poland.
To date, shipping is the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across the ocean.
Traditionally, the task of the Navy is to ensure that the State retains the capacity to transport people and goods, while interfering with the enemy ' s ability to transport its people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy modern examples is the North Atlantic War during World War II. Americans try to move people and goods across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which is predominantly a U-boat, tried to intercept the shipment.
If the Allies failed then, Germany would probably have conquered Britain just like the rest of Europe.
The goat seems to have been domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, eat and use their milk, meat, fur and skin.
Home goats are usually grazed by herds on mountains or other herds, usually under the care of goat herders (mostly children or adolescents), who are similar to the more widely known shepherds. These grazing methods are still in use.
Britain built the truck lane as early as the 16th century.
Although the Mara orbital vehicles were made up of parallel wooden boards, at that time, in terms of slightly bumpy roads, they allowed the pullers to run faster and more.
Early in the day, a pillow was introduced for the stationing of the tracks. But, gradually, people realized that the tracks would be stronger and more effective if they were placed on the tracks.
This has become a common practice, but iron blades can make the wooden wheels of the carriage wear worse.
In the end, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron track came to life.
The first mode of transport known is walking. Two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus, meaning straight people, human beings started walking straight.
Their ancestors, ancient southern apes, have no habit of walking straight.
In the South ancient ape fossils of 4.2 million to 3.9 million years ago, double-foot specialization was discovered, although the Sahelanthropus could have walked with their legs 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly environment, join environmental movements, even become environmental activists, and to some extent reduce future disasters.
In many cases this is very similar to symptomatic therapy. But if we want more than just a temporary solution, then we should find the root causes of the problem and root it out completely.
It is clear that the world has changed considerably as a result of the scientific and technological progress of humankind, and the problems are compounded by overpopulation and human luxury lifestyles.
The handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary-General Charles Thomson, was approved by the mainland Parliament on 4 July and then sent to the John Dunlap printing shop a few blocks away for printing.
150 to 200 copies were printed overnight, which is now known as Dunlap Broadside.
On July 8, John Nixon read this document publicly for the first time in the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and Washington read the letter to his army in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The remaining 25 copies of the single-sided version of the paper (Dunlap broadsides) are the earliest available versions of the file. The original manuscript of the handwriting could not be retained.
Many ancient biologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and have survived to this day, what we call "birds".
Many people think they're not dinosaurs because they have feathers and they fly.
But birds still have a lot like dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and they walk with two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus.
Today, almost all of the computers in use are based on information that handles binary code.
Binary numbers can only account for one of the two values, i.e. 0 or 1, which is called binary numbers, i.e. the "bit" in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are widespread and therefore cannot be diagnosed immediately.
Perhaps the strongest indicator of ingestion of poisons is the container opened at the site, containing drugs or toxic chemicals for domestic use.
Look at the labels on the poison and get a specific first aid guide.
Insect scientists use the word "bug" to officially refer to this category of insects.
The term stems from people's familiarity with bugs, an insect that is well adapted to human parasites.
The hunters and bugs are nested insects, adapted to live in the nests or houses of the host.
In all regions of the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which has become the leading neurological disease among middle-aged youth.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed of brain, spinal cord and visual nerve).
Studies have found that women suffer from multiple sclerosis (MS) twice as likely as men.
A couple may decide not to have children because of their own interests or for the benefit of their children.
These couples may develop adoption plans for their children.
During the adoption process, the biological parents terminated their parental rights so that the other couple could raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through scientific methods. In fact, such methods can guide most scientific research.
Experiments are experiments that are used to eliminate one or more scenarios, but experiments are not the only method. Asking questions and observing can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers pay attention to classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West has moved away from its Greek philosophy and scientific roots.
Many of the physiological and behavioural rhythms observed by researchers often depend to a large extent on the inner life cycle and its existence through biological bells.
The cyclical rhythm is not just a simple response to external cycle signals. It is recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological bells are self-sustaining swinging devices that, even without outside hints, last for a certain period of time to function freely.
The experiments of Hershey and Chase are one of the main indications that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used ingested organisms or viruses to plant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, one with the DNA of radioactive phosphorus and one with the protein of radioactive sulfur.
The effect of mutation is varied and varied, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cell is a reproductive cell.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural wind tourism attracts tourists interested in natural areas who come to watch natural landscapes, including wildlife.
Field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visits to parks and researching ecosystems.
For example, in Borneo, visit, film and learn about chimpanzees.
Every morning, people drive away from small towns to work, and the place of work of the people they cross on their way is exactly where they left.
In this dynamic traffic shuttle, everyone in some way connects to and supports the private car-based transport system.
Today, science shows that this large carbon economy can no longer stabilize the biosphere that has supported human evolution over the past 2 million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or similar levels of the collapse of bridges.
Why do traffic systems cause such complaints? Why do they fail every day? Is it an incompetence traffic engineer? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flows study the movement of drivers and vehicles between the two points and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the traffic flow, as it is impossible to make a 100 per cent positive prediction of the driver ' s behaviour.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable degree of consistency; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable degree of consistency, which can be expressed roughly in mathematical terms.
In order to better express traffic flows, a relationship has been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships contribute to the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects are the animals that fly early in the air. The ability to fly makes it easier for them to hide from their enemies and find food and spouses more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of folding wings backwards along their bodies.
This gives them more space to avoid predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and thugs.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Ali Stacks said that the solar system was spinning around the sun.
Some people think he's right, but there are many who disagree; they think that the solar system functions around the Earth, and so does the sun (even other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second-largest and largest river in the world, with more than eight times the size of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, some of which can be as wide as six miles.
The Amazon River accounts for 20 per cent of the flow of all the world's rivers into the sea.
The Amazon flows 6387 km long (3980 miles). The water comes from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of the Stone Pyramid continued until the end of the ancient kingdom, the size of the Giza Pyramid and the high construction technology were never exceeded.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom lamented the monuments of their predecessors for more than a thousand years.
Vatican City has about 800 people. It's the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in laws and regulations and in official communications.
Italian is also the language most people working in the country use on a daily basis, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since ancient times, as they can be found in nature and are easier to exploit with original tools.
The philosopher Aristotle put forward the theory that everything is made up of one or more of the four elements of soil, water, air and fire.
It's more like four states of matter (the order doesn't break up): solids, liquids, gases and plasmas, but he also put forward theories that they will turn into new substances and make up what we see.
Alloys are basically made of two or more metals. Don't forget, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Calcium, potassium, etc. are metal, and silver and gold, of course, are metal.
There are also alloys containing small quantities of non-metal elements (e.g. carbon).
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all of which is made up of tiny particles known as atoms.
Atoms are so small that the end of the sentence can accommodate trillions of atoms.
As a result, the pencil became a good heart for many people as soon as it came to life.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, pencils are becoming weaker and less and less used.
People now write information on computer screens and never have to touch a pencil knife.
One can only guess what happens when the newer product appears.
The working principles of the fission atomic bomb are as follows: bringing together an atomic core and many protons and neutrons requires energy.
It's kind of like pushing a stupid little pusher up the hill. Breaking the atomic core again and releasing some energy.
Some atoms contain unstable atomic nuclei, which means that they are likely to split up with little or no incentive.
The surface of the moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the immediate side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
The crust below the dark side is thinner and the crust under the high ground is thicker.
Because the crust is thinner, there may be more darkness on the near side, and lava is more likely to rise to the surface.
The core of the incentive content theory is to look for identifying or generating an interest.
These theories show that some needs and/or desires are internalized when people mature to some degree of adulthood.
These theoretical studies examine why certain people want to do what they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do something.
The two popular content theories are Maslow's demand-level theory and Hertzberg's twin-factor theory, respectively.
Generally, when managers begin to lead past colleagues, two kinds of behaviors occur. In one case, they try to keep a close relationship with the team members.
It is difficult for managers of this type to make unpopular decisions, and there are difficulties in enforcing disciplinary measures, performance assessment, allocation of responsibility and accountability.
In another extreme case, this person becomes a very different individual, feeling that he/she has to change what the team does and appropriate the results.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
Such behaviour often leads to divisions between the leadership and other members of the team.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as contact points for their counterparts' downline teams.
They tend to have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams may schedule meeting times for different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The existence of a truly invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
"Invisible team" means the management team to which each member reports. It sets standards for all members.
Why does an organization take so long to build a learning organization? One of the objectives of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity occur when all available resources are used effectively between the functional units of an organization.
Thus, in working together to overcome obstacles, an organization often brings new and innovative processes to meet clients ' needs.
Before organizations can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge and conduct organized learning.
Angel (2006) interprets the continuum programme as a way to help the organization reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiology data provide physical evidence of theoretical methods of cognitive research. It therefore narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can support scientists in their research.
We knew early on that different types of brain damage, trauma, disease and tumors could affect human behaviour and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study the structure and work processes of the brain, which have never been seen before.
This provides us with a great deal of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in which the brain works.
Artificial intelligence has strong science fiction colours, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning and intelligence adaptation.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research involves manufacturing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and dispatch, the ability to respond to client diagnosis and client questions, and handwriting recognition, voice and face functions.
All of these became separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, and some home computer and video game software applications already have built-in artificial intelligence systems.
Field visits are an important part of any teaching activity. Teachers will normally be happy to take students to places where buses cannot reach.
Virtual field trips are a high-tech solution. Students can watch museum artefacts in classes, visit aquariums, or enjoy fine works of art.
The virtual sharing of field visits is also a good way to review travel and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their state capitals every year. The website is redesigned every year, but the old version is kept online and used as a clipboard.
Blogs can also help students improve their ability to write. Although students often use strong grammar and spelling when they start blogging, the appearance of readers usually changes the situation.
Students tend to be the most critical readers, so bloggers start working to improve their writing standards and avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "will force students to be more visible about the world around them." Students are encouraged to become intelligent and interesting to meet the interest of the audience.
Blog writing is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to extend their studies beyond traditional school instruction.
"The proper use of blogs" can make students more analytical and critical; by responding positively to web material, students can find their own positions in the context of other people's articles and can make their own point of view on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's capital, attractive and bilingual, with a series of art galleries and museums showing Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, to the north is Muskoka and undeveloped natural beauty across the river.
All of these make Ontario a typical Canadian image of outsiders.
The vast areas northwards are sparsely populated, and some are deserted.
An amazing comparison of population data: African Americans living in the United States outnumber Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island and an independent continent for wildlife.
The smaller islands, most of which are independent countries or belong to France, are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs have also brought Islam to the land, a doctrine that prevails in the Comoros and Mayotte countries.
The influence and colonialism of Europe began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Town route from Europe to India.
The north is bordered by the Sahel region; the south and west are bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
Female: It is recommended that all female tourists, regardless of their actual marital status, should declare themselves married.
It'll help if you wear a ring, but don't wear a ring that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to what they perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed, etc.
Be firm when refusing men, and don't be afraid to hold on to their positions (reject with or without differences in culture!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C. and used as a strategic port by Phoenicians, Romans and Marinides (Merenid), which was once known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it, and named it Casa Branca, until the earthquake of 1755, when they abandoned it.
The Moroccan Sultan re-established the city as Daru l-Badya, where Spanish businessmen established a trading base and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping places in Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old city of Medina, stores selling traditional Moroccan goods such as taji pots, pots, leathers, water smokes and all sorts of small items are visible, but these stores are aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the easternmost part of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano. Volcano buried most of the town's streets, especially the town centre.
Although Goma is safe, travel to any place outside Goma should be investigated in advance in order to see whether the ongoing fighting in North Kivu has subsided.
The city is also the base of the Nyiragongo volcano and the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking project in Africa.
You can visit Goma on the Boda-Boda (rented motorcycle) tour. The normal (local) fare is 500 Congolese francs.
And because of its relative remoteness, Timbuktu has been used as a metaphor for distant foreign countries.
Today, although Timbuktu's reputation has made it a tourist destination and has an airport, it is a poor town.
In 1990, it was placed on the endangered World Heritage List due to the threat of deserts.
This is Henry Louis Gates, an important part of the American Public Broadcasting Corporation's special "The Miracle of the African World".
The city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country, as it is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in north-eastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and Crocodile River in the south.
Parks occupy 19,500 square kilometres and are divided into 14 different eco-regions to support different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the main attraction of the South African National Park System (SANPARKs).
As in all South African national parks, the park collects maintenance fees and ticket fees on a daily basis.
There's a lot to buy a Wild Card. With this card, you can enter some or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is a nominee for Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The many buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline are like a flashy strip of light, which is particularly visible in the waters of Port Victoria.
If you want to enjoy Hong Kong's beauty from the best angle, you can leave the island and go to the Kowloon Seafront opposite it.
Most urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the land on the North Bank.
This is the place occupied by British colonists, so if you want to find evidence of the colonial history of this territory, this is a good starting point.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove belt in the world, with a forest belt of 80 km (50 miles) extending from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This forest in India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps, but there are also traces of huge jungles that once filled the Ganges plains.
Sunde Bens has an area of 3850 square kilometres, of which about one third are waters/wetlands.
Sundelpens has been a wildlife reserve since 1966. It is estimated that there are currently 400 royal Bengali tigers and about 30,000 meadow deer in the area.
Bus travel from the inter-city bus station (cross the river) throughout the day, but most of the buses, especially to the east and Jakar/Bumtun, travel between 0630 and 0730.
It is recommended that tickets be purchased a few days in advance, in view of the frequent number of passengers on the inter-district bus.
Most districts can get a comfortable and strong Japanese Coaster minibus.
To go to nearby places like Nu 150 and Pu 200, sharing taxis is a quick and comfortable way.
The Oyabok River Bridge is a tilted bridge across the Oyabok River that connects Oyabok, Brazil, and St. George, French Guiana.
Two bridge towers are 83 metres tall, the length of the bridge is 378 metres, and there are two 3.50 metres wide lanes.
The project was completed in August 2011 but did not start until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
Guaraní people are the most important indigenous group living in the current region of eastern Paraguay, living in semi-nomadic hunting and engaging in subsistence farming activities.
Chaco is home to other indigenous tribes such as Guaycuru and Payagua, who depend on hunting, gathering and fishing for their livelihood.
Paraguay in the 16th century, once known as the Indian Province, was the product of encounters between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century colonial period.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve many of the local features and characteristics of the city.
Argentina is famous for having the world's top polo team and players.
The largest tournament each year took place in December at the Las Cañitas polo court.
In other days of the year, smaller championships and games can also be seen here.
If you want to know about the tournament news and how to buy tickets to the polo game, please consult the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound sterling, which is equal to the pound sterling.
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, located across from the FIC West store in Stanley.
Pounds are generally common everywhere on the island, and money can often be paid by credit cards and dollars in Stanley.
On the outer islands, credit cards may not be available, but they may be used in British and United States currencies; please contact the landlord in advance to confirm acceptable payment patterns.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the island, so it is necessary to do so before leaving the island.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so it's summer in winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during summer months, temperatures often exceed 30°C.
Winter may look colder than it looks: the temperature is rarely below zero degrees, but when the wind and humidity combines, it makes people feel colder than the temperature indicated by the thermometer.
There are no specific rainy seasons and dry seasons: rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are common to humans, wildlife is, after all, wildlife, and we should not feed or disturb them.
The park manager said that the distance with bears and wolves is at least 100 yards/m, while the distance with all other wildlife is 25 yards/m!
No matter how gentle it looks, it is possible that almost all the big animals, such as bison, moose, moose, bear, etc., will attack humanity.
Dozens of tourists are injured every year by failing to keep the right distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave some space for them.
In addition, care should be taken that the smell attracts bears and other wildlife and therefore avoids carrying or cooking odour-distributed food and keeping the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on Upolu Island and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 19th and 50th centuries and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
There was an infamous naval confrontation in the Gulf in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the Gulf.
Except for one British cruiser, the rest sank. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle organized by the Maoist movement for independence, a peaceful assembly in the town killed Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Oakland crosses two ports, so there are lots of beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three regions.
North Shore Beach (in the North Port region) is located in the Pacific Ocean, extending from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It's almost all sandy, it's safe to swim, and most of the place is shaded by New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Whitemata Harbour, a high-end suburb of Mission Bay and St. Hurlers in central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with families on vacation, and the coast is lined up with a variety of shops, and it's safe to swim.
The main local beer is the "No. 1" beer. It's not complicated, but it's good, and it's clear. Another local beer is called Manta.
A lot of French wine can be bought here, but wine from New Zealand and Australia may be more affordable for long-distance transport.
Local tap water is perfectly acceptable for safe drinking, but if you are still worried, you can easily buy bottled water.
For Australians, the concept of "coffee" coffee is relatively new. A small black cup of coffee is "concentrated coffee", Cappuccino's butter (not foam) is high, and tea is not accompanied by milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Juice is expensive, but of good quality.
The Great Barrier Reef is visited by a large number of people throughout the year, and there are very few cases of injuries due to participation in any of the above-mentioned activities in the Great Barrier Reef.
Nevertheless, it is important to follow the advice of the authorities concerned, observe all signs and pay close attention to security warnings.
The tank jellyfish will appear in October of each year to April of the following year near the beaches and estuaries of the town of 1770. They can occasionally be found at other points.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and swim.
The main habitat for alligators in saltwater is not the ocean, but the mouth of the river north of Rockhampton.
An advance reservation would reassure the traveller to know that there would be a place to spend the night upon arrival at the destination.
Although travel agencies may book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, they usually work with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport shuttles, or even flights and hotel accommodation.
If you need time to consider whether the price is appropriate or if you need other documents (e.g. visas) to travel to your destination, they can keep reservations for you.
If any changes or requests are required, they should be handled first through travel agents rather than directly contacting hotels.
At some festivals, the vast majority of participants chose to camp on site, and most participants saw this as an extremely important part of the festival experience.
If you want to watch the show close enough, you have to get there early and take over the camp close to the stage.
Remember, while music on the main stage may be over, the rest of the festival may continue to play music until late in the night.
Some concerts set up special camping areas for families with small children.
If we cross the northern Baltic during the winter, we will check the location of the cabin, because sailing on the ice will cause very terrible noise to those most affected.
The cruise ship of St. Petersburg includes an in-city tour activity.
Casinos usually try to get their customers to spend as much time and money as possible. Casinos usually have no windows and clocks, and it's hard to find exits.
They usually offer special foods, drinks and recreational activities to keep guests happy and stay in casinos.
There are sites where alcoholic drinks are provided free of charge. However, drunkenness weakens the ability of people to judge, and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Any person driving or crossing the mountain entrance at high latitudes should take into account the possibility of snowfalls, ice freezes or freezes of temperature.
On the ice- and snow-covered side of the road, there's little friction, and you can't drive like a light tar road.
In snowstorms, snowfalls can be enough to trap you.
Snowfall, snowfall, water beads on windows or ice freezes may also block sights.
On the other hand, ice and snow weather are common in many countries and traffic is almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Hunting is perhaps the most attractive tourist activity in Africa and is also the highlight of many tourist trips.
The term "safari" is commonly used to mean that African wildlife, especially on the savannahs, is observed by land travel.
Some animals (e.g. elephants and giraffes) tend to be close to cars, and standard equipment can be better appreciated.
Lions, leopards and leopards are sometimes afraid of people, and you can see better with binoculars.
On foot travel (also called jungle walks, hiking trips, or hiking) mainly takes a few hours or several days to walk by foot.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some of the events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to hold two summer Olympic Games, the first in 1964.
If you book flights and accommodations for 2020 before you announce a postponement, you may face a difficult situation.
The elimination policy varied, but by the end of March most of the cancellation policies introduced as a result of the new crown virus had not been extended until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most of the tickets will be in the range of 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with a general fare of about 7,000 yen.
The ironing of damp clothes helps them dry up. Even if there is no ironing and ironing boards in the room, many hotels offer loan services.
If you don't like ironing, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try with a wind dryer (if any).
Be careful not to get your clothes too hot (which may cause contractions and burn in extreme cases).
There are many methods of water purification, some of which are more effective for specific pollution.
In some areas, one minute of boiling is enough, and in others it takes a few minutes.
The filters have different effects, and if there is some concern about them, you should consider buying sealed bottled water produced by reputable companies.
Travellers may encounter harmful animals that are not common in their home communities.
Pests destroy food, cause irritant reactions, cause allergies in more serious cases, and spread poisons or infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can kill and maim humans through violence, are usually not among the pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase duty-free goods at a given location.
Passengers who travel to countries/areas where heavy taxes are levied can sometimes save a large sum of money, where it is particularly cost-effective to buy products such as alcohol and water and tobacco.
The most challenging part of the Bufaro-Pizzburg highway is the road between Point Marion and Fairmont, which travels frequently through many remote areas.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, then keep your head clear: there are steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp turns everywhere.
The speed limit is clearly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections, with the usual speed limit being 35-40 miles/hours (56-64 kilometres/hours), while strict compliance with speed limit requirements is more important than in other sectors.
Strangely enough, however, mobile phone service here is much better than many other routes along the way (e.g. the Pennsylvania wasteland).
German pastries are good, Bavarians are more colourful and very similar to their southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit snacks are common, apples can make snacks throughout the year, and cherries and plums can be eaten in summer.
Many German baked foods are also characterized by almonds, sorghums and other nuts. The popular cakes and espresso are often perfect.
If you want some flavoury little snacks, you can try jam packs, which have different names in different regions, such as Berliner, Pfankuchen, Krapfen.
Curry food is a dish dominated by vanilla and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either dry or wet, depending on the amount of water.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry, while in some other coastal areas in southern India and the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, so Indonesian food is only a generic term, and it covers a wide variety of local dishes throughout the country.
But if there are no more qualifiers, the term often refers to food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now, Java food is available everywhere on the islands, with a variety of simple recipes, while Javans prefer peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Java coconut sugar) and various spices.
The horse is hanging on both sides of the saddle to support the rider's feet.
They provide better stability for riders, but there are also security risks, as the feet of the riders may be stuck.
If the rider is thrown from the horse immediately, but one foot is stuck on the horse, the horse may drag him away while running. In order to minimize this risk, some precautions can be taken.
First, most horse jockeys wear belts and boots, and the soles are smooth and quite narrow.
Secondly, some saddles — especially the British saddle — are equipped with safety buttons, and if the fallen rider pulls backwards, the horse's belt will fall off the saddle.
Chile's preferred mountain destination, Cochamó Valley, is known as Yosemite of South America, with a variety of granite walls and cliffs.
From the mountain peaks, there is an amazing view. Mountain climbers from all over the world continue to open new paths on the cliffs that they continue to use as support walls.
Mountain skiing, which includes regular skiing and snowboard skiing, is a very popular sport in which skiboards or skiboards are fixed on your feet and slide down from the snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is the main tourist activity of many skiers, sometimes referred to as "ski freaks", who plan the whole vacation to ski somewhere.
The idea of skiing has been long-standing -- painting cave murals with skiers, dating back to 5,000 B.C.!
As a sport, mountain skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, when Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia in 1861.
Free skiing: The event is also called a field trip, a ski trip or a ski hike.
This activity is related to Alps skiing or mountain climbing, but these two activities are not usually carried out. These two activities are carried out on steep terrain and require harder skiboards and boots.
Imagine the ski route as a similar hiking route.
When conditions are good, you can walk further than on foot — but only in a few cases can you get the same speed at which you can ski across the country without carrying a heavy backpack and on a flat track.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. As a rule, travelling across a number of countries means having to undergo multiple visa applications and passport checks.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area is somewhat like a country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually pass directly through the border without being re-checked by passport checkpoints.
By the same token, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply separately to each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money and formalities.
There is no uniform definition of which processed items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, and the annual limit may be shorter in North America and elsewhere than in Europe.
Handicrafts may be defined as antiques, although they have a much shorter year than the same products produced in bulk.
Reindeer breeding is an important livelihood for the Sámi. Culture around the industry is also important for many people who live in other occupations.
However, even if, in the traditional sense, not all Sámi are involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, they will earn their living by fishing, hunting and similar activities, and usually use reindeer as an enslaved animal.
Today many Sámi are engaged in modern industries. Tourism is a major source of income for Sapumi, or the Sámi region.
Although the term “gypsy” is widely used and is more prevalent especially among non-Roma, it is generally considered an offence because it is associated with negative stereotypes and erroneous perceptions of Roma.
If the country you want to visit is bound by travel warnings, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult with governments other than your own, but their advice is made for their citizens.
For example, United States citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Tourism warnings can only provide a brief summary of the situation on the ground.
Compared with more detailed information provided elsewhere, the recommendations provided here tend to be crude, general and too simple.
Bad weather is the overall name of any dangerous weather phenomenon; such weather can cause destruction, serious social disruption or human casualties.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world. Bad weather has different types, depending on geographical location, terrain and atmospheric conditions.
Winds, hails, excessive precipitation, mountain fires, thunderstorms, tornadoes, water tornadoes, cyclones are all manifestations and effects of extreme weather.
Regionally and seasonally severe weather phenomena include storms, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Passengers are strongly advised to pay attention to adverse weather risks in their locations, which may affect travel plans.
