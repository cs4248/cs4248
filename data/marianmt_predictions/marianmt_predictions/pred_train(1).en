A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead this week in a staircase in a local mall.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't think of anyone who wanted to harm him and said, “It's all right.”
According to the office of the San Francisco Coroner, the body found on Wednesday morning at the Nishida shopping mall was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department stated that the death had been convicted of murder and that an investigation was under way.
Louis Galicia, the victim's brother, told KGO, the ABC radio station in San Francisco, that Frank, who had previously worked as a stream cook in Boston, found an ideal job as a stream cook at Sons & Daughters' restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A speaker at the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that they were “very shocked” by Frank's death.
The speaker said, “We are a small group of close family members, and we will miss him deeply”.
At this time of grief, we express our deep sympathy and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia says Frank lived in the guesthouse at first, but recently, "It's all right now."
Louis Galicia told KGO: “Frank found an apartment and was at the same time dating a girl”.
Louis Galicia says he can't think of anyone who would want to harm his brother.
Frank has a good heart and a wide heart.
Louis Galicia says, "Frank cooks dinners for his family all the time."
He never wanted to argue with his family.
He's a follower.
Louis Galicia said, "All things in the world can go wrong, but Frank is a man who glows every day."

Primary doctor ' s strike: call for new labour action
Representatives of junior doctors called on the Union to approve new labour action against new contract disputes.
The Board of Physics of the British Medical Association will ask all its members to support more labour action starting in early September.
The Board of Physics indicated that the ministers had not addressed their concerns about the contract.
Primary doctors and medical students voted in July to boycott a contract deal with the British Medical Association.
Fifty-eight per cent of the members who voted opposed the contract deal.
Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Board of Primary Doctors, in a letter to members on Twitter on Thursday evening, stated that the Government was “always silent” on the issues that led to the boycott of the contract.
She stated: “In view of this, the Executive Committee of the Board of Primary Doctors has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and has called for a resumption of formal consultations on all concerns.”
In response to the Government ' s silence, the Executive Committee of the Board of Primary Doctors had today formally requested a special meeting of the Council of British Medical Associations to approve a long-term plan to upgrade labour action from the beginning of September.
The dispute has led to six strikes by junior doctors this year, including the first full strike in the history of the United Kingdom National Health Service.
Dr. Johann Malawana, Director of Junior Doctors of the British Medical Association, resigned after voting against the contractual terms recommended by the British Medical Association.
At the pre-voting meeting of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students, he had stated to members of the British Medical Association that the deal was a good one and should therefore be accepted.
Following the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, indicated that the contract would be enforced among the medical staff in England.
Russia and Turkey: “Does it not fit into the Union?”
A gesture ended a crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday, when both sides shook hands and announced an official end to the eight-month saliva and economic sanctions.
However, as Vladimir Putin greets the Turkish President in a golden hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I have a strong feeling that this reconciliation is the most desirable one for Ankara.
Yes, both sides did shake hands.
However, even in the light of the standard that Mr. Putin has always held in his heart, Putin has only smiled lightly and has shown little enthusiasm.
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan reportedly mentioned Putin as a “good friend” five times.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that his relations with Russia would return to the pre-crisis level, or even to a higher level.
The following day, a newspaper wrote that Mr. Erdoğan was acting as if nothing had happened.
But I think his enthusiasm suggests something to the contrary.
However, Mr. Putin's continued indifference demonstrated that he had not forgotten anything.
Indeed, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the reason for the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
The reaction in Moscow was intense.
Mr. Putin vehemently criticized the incident, accusing Ankara of being behind Moscow.
Attacks from so-called friends are even more unacceptable.
It is difficult, if not impossible, to re-establish real trust on both sides.
Russian public opinion has also turned around since November.
For several months, the Government-controlled media have carried out an alarmingly full-scale attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seemed to be responsible for everything.
Of these, the most serious were accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdoğan ' s family had profited from the illegal oil trade in the so-called Islamic State-controlled Syrian region.
He has categorically denied that claim.
However, news from St. Petersburg suggests that it is time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was premised on Putin receiving an apology from Turkish President Erdoğan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are obvious.
First, Erdoğan was pushed out of power after a failed coup d ' état last month, and he therefore needed the support of all his friends.
It is clear that he has suffered a great deal as a result of the ongoing terrorist attacks.
There is also economic motivation.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, in particular by prohibiting charter flights that can transport millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
This figure has fallen significantly by almost 90 per cent.
As flights resume, Russian travel agencies and charter companies will be relieved.
They will approach the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
Even this week, State television projects that the prices of fruit and vegetables will decline once imports of Turkish agricultural products are reopened.
A story from the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti says, "The tourists are there, the tomatoes are back."
The visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara was outraged by the weak reaction of the Western world to the intention to take over.
Moreover, Ankara has long been dissatisfied with the slow progress of EU accession negotiations and Putin ' s involvement, which is keen to exploit political chills and weaken Turkey ' s relations with the Western world.
By championing the elected authorities following the failed coup d ' état, the Russian leadership will certainly receive a credit from Ankara.
Note that this is a gift to Moscow, which has always had deep fears of regime change.
Thus, the meeting held at this glorious beachside palace led Russia and Turkey to forge alliances with two countries that were rejected and abused by the Western world, described by an analyst as “unincorporated”.
However, despite open reconciliation, significant differences remain between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors. Moscow has recently played the role of peacemaker in Syria, while Russia and Turkey support the opposite.
It is foreseeable that, after almost three hours of preliminary talks, the two Presidents stated at the launch that the subject had not yet been addressed.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the issue of the differences between the two sides, which Putin emphasized.
There was no clear consensus between the parties on how to reconcile differences on the Syrian issue.
The resumption of the dialogue between the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, in the context of months of open hostility and the possibility of a major catastrophe brought about by the shooting down of Russian warplanes by Turkey, is certainly a good thing.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve clients outside Scotland.
According to the Chief Executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the Bank will be streamlined into a logistics department.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEun told BBC Scotland that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand had been dedicated to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago, on the verge of collapse, relief had to be accepted and that quest had since been abandoned.
During that time, brand strategists used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
The group spent millions of pounds to sponsor international sports events such as the football six-nation and Winboldon tennis championship champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right thing to do is to make more national brands visible.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish clients, but will not revert to the status quo ante.
In England and Wales, all references other than at headquarters and on the stock exchange will be changed to National Westminster Bank.
The Alest Bank brand has been used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Autonomous Region.
There are other, more prominent, smaller private bank brands, such as CBP, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan was interviewed during a visit to Inverness County by clients and employees.
He told BBC Scotland that “The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and one of the employee brands, as we are now, in the larger sense, a bank with many brands”.
Because the bank itself became an international brand, RBS became a global brand.
For the time being, I would like to say that we are no longer focused on the globe and that we have turned our eyes to our own homeland.
Each brand represents a different industry, while our employees serve their clients through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that it will not continue to sponsor the six-nation championships; at the same time, efforts have been made to raise the profile of different brands sponsoring sports events.
The CEO stated: “It is time to become a multi-brand bank, because in private we have been searching for ways to become a better bank to serve our clients.”
It would be a mockery if we were to become a big bank with a lot of brand names three years ago.
We are now focusing on the needs of our clients, and I am sure you have taken note of these changes.
I think we can restart these brands, and now is the right time.
Dituly won his career at Newmuckett with the success of Predilection.
Newmuckiet's two victories, Dituli, won his profession by 3,000, and then he's wearing champagne to celebrate it.
Friday, professional horse jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th victory in Newmarket.
He's got his trainer, John Gosden, on the horse track, and he's got two victories that night, and he's got 3,000 jobs.
The 45-year-old Italian was the sixth professional horse jockey to achieve this milestone in the field of the flat-ground race.
The first five are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion rider of Ghayyar said, "This is special."
I'm excited because my family was there.
I am pleased with what I have achieved in Newmucket, because I started here 30 years ago.
This is not a large-scale horse race, nor is it the Royal Ascot -- it's just a normal Friday night with 20,000 viewers.
I am pleased and humble.
After the victory, Daituli brought it in, and the whole place was cheered.
In the barrier field, two jockeys, Sir Richard Johnson, the champion, and Sir Anthony McCoy, the 20-year-old champion, among them, Sir McCoy, in his record career.
Berger was a nine-time German champion. He won 4,493 victories in his career.
Dayturi is one of the best jockeys of our time, so it is not surprising that he has achieved this landmark achievement, which has not been achieved before him.
He was fashionable and robust, but what really made him emerge from the heavy room was his tactical rationality.
He is a remarkable art ambassador whose enthusiasm and charm have attracted a great number of fans to this movement over the years.
A few weeks ago, I told Epsom that if he wasn't just a weekend with a jockey, he would have won 6,000!
Seriously, it's so important that Daituri is the best horse winner in Britain in 30 years.
He's very active, and it's a good thing for the British horse racer, but beyond that, he's an incredible jockey.
Dituli celebrates this milestone with his iconic leap.
From jumping through the jump line to jumping off the horse, for 20 years Detouri has been a typical representative of the British field of flat-ground competition.
His career is like a roller coaster.
He won a number of championships, including the famous “Seven Leagues” in 1996 at the Royal Escobar, but he also suffered a plane crash and a ban on the use of forbidden drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned to the field after the six-month ban, he had had a hard time. However, he had demonstrated an amazing personality advantage and had finally returned to his peak, giving the skeptics the best shot.
He may not be able to do it for too long — as Daituri said before, he hopes to be able to compete at least until he reaches the age of 50.
Russian President Putin relieved Sergei Ivanov of his post as Director-General of the Office
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly removed Sergei Ivanov from the post of Presidential Chef de Cabinet.
For many years, Mr. Ivanov has been part of a core group that has gained the trust of Mr. Putin.
Ivanov, 63 years old, has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
A Kremlin statement stated that Mr. Putin had “declared Ivanov's post as Head of the Russian President's Office”, but did not give reasons.
Anton Vaino, who began serving as Mr. Ivanov ' s deputy in 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Mr. Vaino is 44 years old and a former diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the Estonian capital, and graduated from the famous Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he managed the President ' s draft and government employees, as stated on the Kremlin website (in Russian).
Upon his appointment, he said to Mr. Putin, “Thank you for your confidence”.
I believe that the most important task of my Government is to support the Head of State in drafting laws and controlling the implementation of directives.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself had asked to resign and had recommended Mr. Waino to take his place.
Is that a good smile?
Moscow is puzzled by this move.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest assistants and, like Putin, worked in the Soviet Security Service (KGB).
As Chef de Cabinet, he was one of the most influential persons in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcasted on national television, both claimed that the Chef de Cabinet had requested his resignation.
Despite the smile in front of the camera, there is hardly any credibility — especially at this time before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of a defeat in some sort of power struggle?
It's not known yet.
However, the official argument — that a candidate who was once considered a presidential candidate suddenly chose to dominate Russia's environmental policy — has raised many doubts.
Mr. Ivanov ' s dialogue with Mr. Putin was quoted on the Kremlin website, and he said, "Yes, in early 2012, I asked you to give me this difficult position, which could even be described as a difficult one, for a four-year term."
As a result, I've been Presidential Chef de Cabinet for four years and eight months.
Mr. Ivanov assumed this position in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, a former member of the State Security Service.
At the end of the 1990s, Mr. Ivanov was appointed deputy to the Federal Security Agency (FSB), formerly the National Security Agency, when Mr. Putin was appointed.
When Mr. Putin took office, he designated Mr. Ivanov as one of his five most trusted.
It was once thought that Mr. Ivanov might become President of Russia after the end of Mr. Putin's second term, because three consecutive terms were unconstitutional.
However, the position was ultimately attributed to Dmitry Medvedev, another close assistant to Putin.
Before returning to office three and a half years later, Mr. Putin assumed the post of Prime Minister of Russia.
Mysterious fish. Banff, a garden.
A resident of Banff found a fish in his garden and subsequently sent a request for help.
Kevin Bain believes that this 75 fish could have been saloons from a sea tornado.
Mr. Bain, who lived about 500 metres from the sea, released a video of this strange scene on Periscope in the hope that he could be explained why the two-inch fish appeared.
The Quince Ferry Bridge has now reached Farf.
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north side of the Queensfery Crossing bridge with the high-rise bridge, which means that the bridge has now reached Farf.
The four “bridge windmills”, located near the three bridgeheads of each bridge, are now nearing completion, and the project is the first of its kind.
The bridge, which started in Farf, was 600 metres long and weighing 30,000 metric tons.
It used 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 slant zippers.
The Pound1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, visited the site today and became one of the first people to board the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic moment in the construction of the Quince Ferry Bridge."
We have all witnessed engineering work on such an ambitious project, and more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel were used in this section of the bridge alone.
Although the size and weight of the bridge are enormous, the completion of dragons between the high bridge and the bridge surface requires fine work and very precise assembly.
Overall, nearly 79 per cent of the main bridge surface has now been installed, and the last concrete surface of the bridge is being pumped today at Rosyth, which means that all the bridges are in place.
Michael Martin, the project director of the Quince Ferry Bridge Construction Company, said, "No matter which bridge project, the first one is a major milestone."
In the case of that remarkable project, the United Dragon presented the cutting edge of civil engineering technology.
The installation of the last section of the road panel and its connection to the expanded North Bridge road panel will then require the completion of the remaining gaps on the north side or close to the land side.
The completion of the operation will require the transfer of the northern heights to the south of the bridge 700 mm.
It's a huge operation, and it's also a very sophisticated one.
It is said to be large because the height bridge is 222 metres long and weighs about 6,000 metric tons, requiring a slope of about 3 per cent.
The precision is due to the need for the engineering team to ensure that the deviation is very small, with only a few millimetres per side.
It is gratifying to note that everything is going well.
Simon Bails has a female gymnastic champion.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is not affected by all of this.
It's full of energy.
There's more to the balance of the upper wood blades.
Free gymnastics is amazing.
The overall performance was excellent.
Now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old United States gymnastics player, who won an all-embracing championship on Thursday, fully demonstrated her talent for leading the world in gymnastics at the Olympics.
In total, she outranked the silver medal winner, the Final Five, Aly Raisman, and the bronze winner, Aliya Mustafaina.
Simón-Bails, from the United States, performed a balanced wood performance at the all-embracing female artistic gymnastics finals of the 2016 summer Olympics, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byers helped the U.S. team to achieve four consecutive championships in female gymnastics in the Olympics, where she personally won five medals, further attesting to her generation and possibly the best gymnastics team ever.
When I saw my share, Byers couldn't help but shed tears. She finally ended this long journey.
As a result, Bayers joins Michael Phelps in the “Ten Years Ahead of Athletes”, raising sports in their respective fields to new heights:
For the last three years, Bayers has been known as the Grand Prix, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold medals. She has been trained daily to achieve a higher degree of accuracy.
In Brazil, there was also the last competition, but it was not so much a competition between Byers and other gymnastics players, but rather between herself and the pressure of great expectations.
Everyone would be very disappointed if Byers did not return to her home in Spring, Texas, full of gold medals.
Simon Bails (left) from the United States hugged with Leisman, who won gold and silver medals, respectively, at the all-women artistic gymnastics finals of the 2016 summer Olympics, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byers won the first gold medal on Tuesday to give a surprise gift to the outgoing National Team coach, Martha Karolyi.
Although Byers maintained that he had not planned for the future in the long-standing process of taking over the Throne, that was not the case entirely.
One part of Byers' free gymnastics — including the one with her iconic upswing chain — was accompanied by Latin music, which she used to hear in her home only a block away from the Olympics in Rio.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a baby and found by the mother of Aime Boorman during a field trip to the stadium, has now grown into a strong force.
Since the summer of 2013, Bayers has not failed in the All-power competition, and if she wants to win, she will win.
It's just an illusion that Mustafa's two rotations lead a little bit.
The two projects of balance wood and free gymnastics, the champion of the world, Bayers, are waiting for an ambush.
Her balanced wood score was 15.433 and her free gymnastics score was 15.933.
While waiting for the final score to come out, Lesman hugged Bayers. When Bayers learned of what he had longed for, he left tears behind.
Leisman behaved a little like revenge four years ago, when she was in third place, but she lost to Mustafaina in the finals.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, called “Grandma” by the Americans, was far ahead.
After the completion of her free gymnastics, she gave a kiss to the crowd and declared her return, which sometimes seemed questionable before.
Byers is only 19 years old. Since earlier this week, his news has spread virally on Twitter. In the case of Byers, his life has been given a whole new meaning.
6-year-old Mahaj Brown survived the Philadelphia shooting.
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second child to be shot in the city this week.
The grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child who was shot was Mahaj Brown.
They said that Brown had multiple gunshot wounds in the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but the child was sober on his way to medical care.
"He suffered a lot, and his little body was sore with bullets," his grandmother, Dolores Meléndez, said to the television station.
I can't believe it.
The boy was in critical condition in the hospital and had undergone several operations.
His family told the television station that the child was expected to recover.
He was about to begin his first grade in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Of the other three who were shot, two were 29 years old and one was 32.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims was in critical condition; the other two were in stable condition.
The television station stated that the child and the 29-year-old victim, who were in critical condition, had been found in the front seat of the car.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether there were gunmen among the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it appeared that multiple gunmen had exchanged fire.
A large number of shells of offensive weapons were found on the scene, which leads to the inference that they used different offensive weapons.
This, in its judgement, is undoubtedly an ongoing war.
On both sides of the street, there were shell casings on the sidewalks.
“So, it can be seen that a number of armed men were at the scene in a state of heavy war,” said Anthony Ginaldi, a Philadelphia police chief, to the television station.
A number of houses and vehicles were damaged in the area.
Arrests have not yet been carried out, and police are said to be checking surveillance videos.
On Tuesday, a six-year-old child (girl) was also shot in the arm by a stray bullet while playing in front of his home in West Oak Lane.
She is currently recovering and the police are still pursuing the suspects.
Why do we need Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie?
That is how I assess this year ' s women ' s Olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First, since 1984, I have been to every summer Olympics, but the United States has never been so dominant.
Second, the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnasts - Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernán.
The formation of this team is a source of great pride for all because it includes Aly Raisman of Judaism and Madison Kocian of Catholicism.
This team finally looks like an American team.
It has also consolidated the primacy of black and Latino women in this movement.
Over the past four years, the leading female gymnasts have been African-Americans.
Last year, Simon and Gabriel were ranked first and second.
That's amazing.
The last Olympic Games, in which Gabriel Douglas “unfortunately” became the Olympic champion, cheered the United States.
Today, the world is witnessing three world champions, Simon Byers, Douglas, and Laurie Hernández, who are imbued with conventional gymnastics techniques.
On Thursday, Simon helped the United States team achieve four consecutive championships on the Women ' s Personal Capability Project.
Her teammate, Ali Leisman, got a silver medal.
We're at the top of this movement, but not in the United States gymnastics classroom.
Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie entered the Olympic delegation on the same route as Ali and Madison.
They are the Final Five, as the next Olympic gymnastics team will consist of four gymnasticsmen, the last year of teaching in Marta Karolyi.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is a costly exercise, that gymnasts are trained mainly in private gymnastics clubs, that their parents are required to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotel fees (including associated costs for coaches and gymnasts and family members) and that the list of fees is increasing.
Most gymnastic clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the industry.
All gymnastics training is done in these clubs and is a long-term and expensive expense for gymnastics families.
Aimee Boorman, Bayers coach, and Maggie Haney, Hernández coach, have been teaching them gymnastics since these two gymnastics started.
We must bring more meaningful and accessible gymnastics training to the countless young girls who are deeply affected by Simon, Gabrielle and Laurey.
Twenty years ago, I founded my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we provide free and inexpensive gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youths (mainly black and Hispanic Americans) in black residential areas and develop national and world champions.
In September, we will expand to the bottom to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this opportunity to learn and who will benefit from this remarkable Olympic movement.
Gymnastics contributes to the development of body strength, flexibility and harmony, as well as to the development of a spirit of hard work, self-discipline and determination.
These can bring lifelong benefits to a person ' s health, education and success in his or her work.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sports is significant, especially for girls.
This is an exciting moment.
Thanks go to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for their remarkable “girls' power” in winning Olympic gold medals, and for inspiring young girls of so many different backgrounds to begin the path to health, strength and success.
After the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal, the primary physician planned to launch a further strike.
The Ministers had initially hoped to put an end to the change-induced dispute by accepting a revised contract from officials of the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58 per cent of the 37,000 primary doctors who had participated in the vote opposed the contract.
In July, Mr. Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract, stating that the British National Health Service (NHS) was currently in a “vacuum zone” and that a slight delay would be detrimental to the interests of both employees and patients.
The new contract begins with a reference to the modification of the working practices of primary doctors working overnight and on weekends in order to improve care during irregular working hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Board of Physics, stated in a statement: “The primary doctor still has serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially its exacerbation of the current labour crisis and its unequal treatment of all doctors”.
With only eight weeks to go before the first doctors sign the new contract, we need to make progress, and time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve disputes through negotiations, but there has been a reluctance to participate, and sometimes the Government has responded in silence.
Nevertheless, just last month we received the commitment of Jeremy Hunte, who said that his door was always open.
“Jeremy Hunt now needs to take action to remove enforcement and address the concerns of primary doctors”.
If he does not do so, the primary doctor makes it clear that they are ready for further labour action.
The last strike, which took place at the end of April, resulted in nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 extensions of appointments, as nurses and medical doctors provided cover for doctors on the picket line.
The Ministers initially hoped to put an end to this change-induced dispute by accepting the BMA-modified contract.
BMA hopes to obtain better weekend wages for the 54,000 junior doctors covered by the contract.
NHS Employers CEO Daniel Mortimer called on junior doctors to stop playing any strikes.
Mr. Mortimer said that “labour action has had little effect, but on the contrary it has put pressure on already dedicated teams and services, leading to fear, anxiety and confusion among patients, caregivers and their families”.
Over the past two months, we have been engaged in ongoing negotiations with the Board of Primary Doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and other departments, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and the whistle-blowers.
Employers wish to continue to actively explore other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility of training, other training for those who have been re-employed after a career interruption, training costs, common knowledge of the syllabus, refresher leave and gender pay differentials in the medical field - which illustrate the employer, Health Education England (HEE)
Two pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
The officials recommended that a medication of Pound2 per day be extended to a larger number of patients and that the duration of medication be extended, after which thousands of people suffering from heart disease would benefit from the drug.
The anticoagination drug replaces the ticagrelor, which reduces the risk of a repeat heart attack for a heart patient.
The continued use of the drug for 12 months after a heart attack reduces the risk of a stroke or repeated heart attack.
The National Health and Clinical Optimization Institute (NICE), a regulatory body of the United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS), recommends continuous drug use for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now NHS Regulatory Body NICE recommends that patients be given continuous medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year, one quarter of whom continue to suffer from repeated heart attacks or strokes.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fat matter forming specks in the deposition of the arteries.
If the speck is broken, it leads to a blood clot, which in turn prevents the flow of blood into the heart and leads to a heart attack.
If the embolism moves, it enters the bloodstream, obstructs the flow of blood into the brain and causes a stroke.
A patient who has experienced a heart attack is at a higher risk of having another heart attack.
The sale of a commodity name by the British company AstraZeneca for Kargary, in the name of Berique, can reduce the risk of morbidity by reducing the formation of blood clots.
The NICE draft guidance released today recommends that patients take 90 mg for 12 months, followed by 60 mg per day and two aspirin per day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Although there is effective secondary preventive treatment, as many as a quarter of those who have had a history of heart attack will suffer from a repeat illness or stroke, usually with serious consequences.”
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person ' s quality of life.
Evidence suggests that co-admission with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of repeated heart attacks and strokes in patients who have experienced heart attacks.
We are very pleased that the temporary referral for Craig will provide more treatment options for thousands of beneficiaries.
Because of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Cagre after three years, in particular the risk of haemorrhage, the draft guidance does not recommend that his treatment be continued beyond this period.
Computer culture has made “election fraud” prevalent in Muslim regions
Tower Hamlets, former mayor of Lutfur Rahman, was brutally dismissed for corruption last year, prompting the publication of a government report.
This lethal government report reveals today that the culture of “political correctness” has led to the widespread electoral fraud in the Muslim community being ignored.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former cabinet minister, accused the police, the electoral regulatory body and the municipal council of turning a blind eye to the evidence of electoral abuse because of “exaggerated sensitivity to ethnic divisions and religious issues”.
The former Minister of Community Affairs, the current anti-corruption leader, said that the use of religious positions to intimidate voters had a negative impact and that the police should be allowed to set up cordoners outside polling stations in order to protect war-wounded voters.
He suggested that voters vote with their identity documents in order to confirm their identity.
Currently, voters only have to declare their names and addresses.
The report even recommended that the ink that could not be removed from the voter ' s finger should be painted in order to prevent a second vote.
Sir Erik said that the protection of whistle-blowers should be strengthened.
He called for increased media access to parliamentary documentation and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
“This is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect local governments from the widespread culture of corruption and financial fraud that is closely linked to it”, he said.
This report was requested by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral tribunal ruled that the incumbent mayor, Rahman, was subject to a series of corrupt and illegal practices and was subject to dismissal.
The Tribunal found that Rahman “destroyedly abused” the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and closed his mouth to allegations of racial discrimination and Islamophobia.
Rahman was said to have “proclaimed during the campaign that it was a religious duty of the Muslims to vote for him”.
As many as 300 ballots were marked with doubts and could have been cast by voters who pretended to vote.
Sir Erik stated that there was evidence of electoral fraud throughout the country.
He warned, in particular, of fraud in the postal elections, where senior members of the Muslim community were said to have put pressure on voters to vote for their designated candidates.
Sir Erik made a number of recommendations for the clean-up of the voting mechanism, including identification documents to confirm his identity.
In his report, he said: “The evidence shows that senior members, especially from Pakistan and Bangladesh background communities, put pressure on vulnerable groups in some minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote according to their will”.
“They fear that State institutions will turn a blind eye to such acts, given the excessive sensitivity to ethnic divisions and religious `political correctness'.”
Sir Erik made 50 recommendations for the clean-up of the electoral mechanism, including a strict ban on political activists from processing mailed voting documents to prevent “voting harvest”.
The report also requires that registration information be scrutinized to prevent the electoral rolls from being used for immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa May is also considering the report.
These included a requirement for voters to present their identity documents prior to the voting.
The ballot was followed by ink that could not be removed from the voter ' s finger to prevent a second vote.
Systematic verification of the ethnic affiliation of voters to ensure eligibility to vote.
The validity period for automatic mailing of voting requests is set at three years.
Political activists and activists are prohibited from handling completed post-voting and post-voting envelopes.
The police were authorized to set up cordoners around the polling stations.
The amendment of the legal provisions makes it easier to charge persons with the crime of intimidation under the People ' s Representation Act 1983 (Reppresentation of the People Act 1983).
It is against the law to take photographs at polling stations.
Only English (except Wales) is allowed at polling stations.
Increased training to ensure that staff strictly enforce the requirement that voters go to polling halls alone.
Sir Erik denounced the Metropolitan Police Department and stated that it was “surprising” that they had not made any criminal charges since the events in Tower Hamlets.
“Rahman and his electoral officers were subject to disqualification by the Electoral Tribunal as a result of corruption and irregularities”, he said.
According to the criteria of criminal proof, he is in many respects unquestionablely guilty.
He also criticized the “check boxing” of the municipal election registration department, which was virtually non-existent.
Sir Erik said, "The court judgment against Tower Hamlets last year was a wake-up call."
My country has a glorious tradition of “mothers of parliament”, but the hidden electoral frauds and all-embracing subsequent denials of certain institutions are a cause for concern and a threat to this good reputation.
At the Rio Olympics, cyclists who looked like Princess Kate and other celebrities who ran over their faces were being admired.
This week, the French biker Pauline Ferrand Prevot, who looks like Princess Kate at the 2016 Rio Olympics, was well received by the audience.
But the 24-year-old Olympic player was not the only gold medal contender at this summer Olympics, at least not in the social media.
Therefore, in honour of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that appeared on the screen at the time, FEMAIL compiled a list of Olympic players who ran into Hollywood stars.
Hunters and Wolves: Brady Ellison, an American male archer, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to Kate's face on the bicycle track, many netizens quickly found out that some archer was just Leonardo Dicaprio's twin brother.
The American male archer Brady Ellison has caused a huge commotion in the social media since his photo of Wolf of Wall Street was posted on Twitter.
In fact, the archer noticed the social media campaign and admitted to being small that he looked like a plum.
"I don't think I look much alike except for the gills," Brady said to the Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome dude, so I guess that's a compliment to me."
One of the most popular contrasts at the 2012 London Olympics will no doubt find more similarities this year: British long-distance dancer Greg Rutherford, who looks like a famous actor, Neil Patrick Harris.
Aliya Mustafaina, a Russian gymnastics player with big eyes that can speak, is referred to as the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, for many years, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh was brought here to play Matthew Morrison with Glee.
Reload: The user considers Nathan Adrian to be the "motion version" of the "Inception" actor.
Another pair of old tennis stars, Rafael Nadal, and actor Josh Hartnett, look a lot like their eyes and lips.
The silver-picked Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova and actor Annalynne McCord have the same brown skin and blond hair, while the American team's family is powdered.
Woman: Football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter (right) has similar faces and eyes
Not the only one: one Twitter user was happy to find that others saw these similarities.
Dissemination theory: According to this user, there may be a reason why the pair looks like this.
A Twitter user recently happyly declared on the Internet that “other netizens also believe that Hope Soro and Jennifer Carpenter actually look exactly the same.”
Indeed, this American football star and this Bloodthirsty Forensic lead have very similar faces and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh Jennings, who smiles almost exactly the same as the actress Laura Linney; and the gymnastics player who won the gold medal.
The president of the Olympic Games apologized for the comment that Chinese swimmers were "slow as pigs"
Wednesday, Byron MacDonald's comment on 14-year-old Abzo's 4x200-metre free swim relays provoked a live viewer of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)'s Olympics.
A spokesman for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation CBC said that 14-year-old Chinese swimmers would “go faster than stink” in the competition and end up “slow as a pig”, after which the CBC was forced to apologize.
The interpreter, Byron MacDonald, at the end of the women ' s 4x200-metre free swim relay final, made some observations of his own, when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
The audience heard from the CBC team, Byron, a reviewer with "coloured glasses", who said, "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
As a result of the excitement, the start of the journey was faster than the smell, but later it was as slow as a pig.
Thanks to her.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, Ai Yu, is the second best, with 1 minute and 57 seconds to 79 — 1.61 seconds behind Taylor Ruck in Canada, which then led the Canadian team to narrow the gap with China.
The entire Canadian audience was shocked by this interpreter's tone and language, and they reacted to it on the Internet very quickly.
Emmett Macfarlane tweets: "The CBC writer says that 14-year-old Chinese swimmers are "slow as pigs?"
This idiot doesn't realize it's live.
“The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake.”
Twitter criticism of Byron MacDonald quickly came on Twitter, and many asked him to withdraw.
When Twitter users heard that Byron McDonald had been slow to react to it, they did not stop.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wow#Baylan MacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and all of us sound like a bunch of racists.
Shortly after, Scott Russell, CBC broadcaster, apologized on the air for Byron's statement, saying, “We apologize for the comments we made on the performance of the swimmer”.
“We are sorry for this inappropriate wording.”
CBC apologized more than 90 times to Twitter users who responded to the speech.
Another interpreter, Scott Russell, apologized on behalf of Byron.
The CBC then copied their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users protesting against what Byron said.
The channel also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We are deeply sorry to say that and to broadcast it live.
Last night, we moved quickly to apologize to those who watched us live and those who watched us in the social media.
It should be noted that Byron's statement was about the performance of the swimmer, but not about her personally.
That is, the wording is indeed inappropriate, and Byron is deeply sorry about it.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the live air, saying that his words did not mean a little physical assault and tried to justify his remarks.
“I would like to take some time to apologize for what he said last night after the women's relay,” he said on the CBC Omnibus.
"I'm just commenting on the performance of swimmer, not personal."
“Of course, I didn't mean disrespect, I'm sorry.”
Primark, the customer expressed anger at a brazen woman who tried to wear underwear in the middle of the store.
A woman took off her underwear on the spot in the centre of a Primark shop, where customers did not know where to look.
Worse still, she took her panties off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelf and eventually tried four panties at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkeston.
This woman kept wearing underwear at the Primark store in the Bouverie Place mall in Folkeston and then put it back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson, who was also in the store, said that after trying on her underwear, the mysterious woman "get dressed again and then walk out of the store and buy nothing."
She said, "Everyone can't believe what they see."
She stood in the middle of the shop and took a pair of panties off the shelf, took off her tights and panties and put them on.
“She didn't try to find a hidden place to try it on — she was just standing there, and it was brazen.”
"When she took off her panties again, everyone was stunned. Apparently, she was still not satisfied because she put them back on the shelf."
Then she tried three more like this and found out she didn't like them, and then she went out of the shop and dressed again.
"She doesn't seem to care if someone's looking at her -- or if she doesn't think who's gonna finally buy the underwear she tried to wear."
Ms. Davidson (33 years old), who lives in Kent town, says, "It's disgusting to think that someone will buy someone else's underwear that they wear and they're not washed."
This happened Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “As soon as she leaves, it is clear that the shopkeeper is going to take down the underwear, which is fortunately the case.”
"I hate buying home a new pair of underwear, but I find another woman trying to wear it and not being washed."
A spokesperson for Primark said, "Primark already knows what happened at our Folkestone store on Tuesday, 9 August."
All problematic commodities have been set aside.
How to use Maga to protect yourself in a gun attack.
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com may give you a sense of security.
We're going to the master of the Maga Union in New York, Rhon Mizrachi, to teach you how to get close to the gunman.
Whether he comes near you from the front or from the back, the video will teach you how to win.
Mizrachi said that if the shooter approached you from behind, the first thing you had to do was turn around so that you could see the attackers and “clean the fire”.
Then, put a gun in the forearm and shoulder, and then hit the assailant in the face with your elbow.
He then took his knee to his groin, turned the gun in his hand, hit him in the face with a barrel and a back-up gun, and kept his weapon on him.
If the shooter approaches from the front, a similar technique is used — to keep your body outside the line of fire, to take the gun and to reverse it so that the gunman cannot fire.
At the same time, he put his weight on the gun and hit the assailant in the chest, turned the gun from his grip and then pointed it at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video and see what Mizrazi really does.
But remember, if you're not a magnate, the safest way to get out of the robbery is to hand over the cash.
A rogue family destroyed a rental house in Soltash, Cornwall County, before being evicted.
A rogue family who had been evicted for intimidation of its neighbours had destroyed the low-cost rental housing they had occupied prior to their departure, resulting in a loss of Pound50,000.
After a long series of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and his husband, Shaun Trebilcock, were evicted from a rented house in Soltash, Cornwall County.
After being forcibly removed from the house, the housing association officials were surprised to find that there had been serious damage.
The walls were full of holes, the floors were torn, the garbage was littered and the walls were covered in chaos.
After being evicted, the family has been moving and is said to be living in a private home.
Donna McEvoy, the housing manager of the Cornwall County Housing Association, said that she feared that the house could no longer be saved.
She said, “This is a nightmare for people living here, and I don't think that people can live like this”.
There are a lot of things to weigh, as this house is likely to be a bad element in Cornwall County.
The family is notorious and their names are equally notorious.
The couple has three sons who live here from time to time. According to the police, the family’s acts of terror include fighting in the streets with baseball bats, terrorizing nearby residents, drug addiction, drug trafficking, yelling, arguing and cursing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant, Skeldon, received a resolution on anti-social behaviour.
There's a lot of garbage in this house that could have been demolished.
The floor was lifted in a room that once traded drugs.
Neighbors say they often see them fighting in the streets, and they often call the police.
After giving them an 11-week extension to move voluntarily, the Cornwall County Housing Association forcibly removed her and her husband from the house this week.
At last, the relieved neighbours cheered for it, saying that life had been a hell of a world before.
A neighbour said, "They don't care about anyone."
We've been living next door for 20 years. It's been so bad.
We have seen the police on countless occasions.
"This morning, we couldn't sleep."
We're up early because it's too quiet here -- we're not used to it!
They're finally gone, that's great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the community executive manager of the Cornwall County Housing Association, said that the family had failed to cooperate well with the local government.
The family has lived in this house for 20 years. The police often visit.
Garbage and old toys are being dumped on the side of this low-rent weed.
He added: “It is regrettable that the tenant did not bear any responsibility for the acts of her and her family, and that the eviction was the last thought of the Cornwall County Housing Association”.
This is a very difficult case because of the extreme nature of their behaviour and the fear that they must be doing to their neighbours.
I thank my team for its work, as well as the Devon and Cornwall Police and the community members who courageously provided us with information.
I hope that this will bring some comfort to our neighbours and send a message that we will not tolerate antisocial behaviour.
Mr. Fitzpatrick stated that their three sons had lived in this house at different times, but also that they were in their 20s.
After they were removed, a dirty mattress was thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms.
The housing association workers will soon be cleaning up all the garbage around the house.
In 2014, police searched the house and discovered over 70 grams of marijuana, as well as scales, drug-using devices and £1,700 in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of B-type drugs and for the intent to traffic them.
She claims that the money was used to buy tombstones for Lee Skeldon, the son who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is understood that after becoming homeless Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were painted with graffiti.
The police indicated that they would expel tenants who had disobeyed the Tenant Rule.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall County Police said that the eviction had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to defy the Tenant Rule.
“This warning is directed at those who believe that their actions will not be blamed and those who have been devastated by such acts”, she said.
Devon and Cornwall County Police have no tolerance for crime and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Reed: The elected President of Hilary will nominate Garland to the Supreme Court
The leader of the Democratic Party of the Senate, Harry Reid, said that he was convinced that if the Democratic Party presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, was elected President, she would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senator Republicans have been blocking the confirmation of Garander since President Barack Obama nominated Garland in March.
The leader of the Senate majority, Mitch McConnell, said that the next President would choose him to replace the late Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
Reed stated at a telephone conference on Thursday that he predicted that Hilary would choose Garland “with some credibility”.
A woman spokesperson for Reed then said that Reed had no direct conversation with Hilary about whether or not he would nominate Garland, and that he was only guessing.
He commended Garander for his efforts and said that the Hilary team did not want to “disturb” the new candidate.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States District of Columbia Federal Circuit Court of Appeal.
Reed said that the Republicans who prevented Garland from nominating them were the “principals” and the “achievers” of Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate.
He said Trump wasn't fit to be president.
"Treats": Naked Calendar "Women and Men Love"
Treats will be working with photographer David Bellemere to film a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
This time, they plan to find a new generation of top models for their 2017 NUuses calendar, rather than prominent nudists.
Steve Shaw, the president of Treats, said earlier this year that their magazine, dominated by nudity, was different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "the latter is male-oriented."
And we're looking at women.
Obviously, he believed that the same was true of the calendar.
"We need to show the eternal and classic nudity that makes women and men feel comfortable, and this is what inspired us." Shaw said at a calendar launch.
Women will be happy to participate in this film because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photo applications online, as well as make their own visits to L.A. and New York for open field recruitment.
Video reports show that small sleeping sharks are the longest-lived vertebrates.
Scientists say that the sleeping shark is the longest-lived vertebrate on Earth.
Julius Nielsen, who had been studying sharks, said that it had been documented that a female head sleeping shark was expected to be between 272 and 512 years old and five metres old.
The French courts rejected the petition to dismantle the shops in the jungle camp.
A French court rejected a petition by the Government of Calais to dismantle dozens of temporarily constructed shops and restaurants in the “circle” refugee camp, where thousands of refugees are currently living.
At this week’s hearing before the court, the Galay government argued that the French government should have the right to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops in the camp.
The Governor ' s Office of Galle believes that these sites should be dismantled because of the parallel economy of non-tax payments and the presence of fire and health hazards.
The humanitarian community, however, indicated to the Court that these shops and restaurants were extremely important because the free food provided by State-sponsored associations and other groups was simply not sufficient to meet the growing needs of refugees in the camp.
They claim that these temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
A Ryer court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of the operators of the 72 temporary shops, but stated that the concerns of the Governor of Galay were “explicably understandable”.
Judge Jean-François Molla stated that the utility of these grocery stores, cafés and restaurants goes far beyond simply providing food to refugees living in “extremely dangerous conditions”.
These places, he said, were points of calm between refugees and volunteers.
One of the locations threatened with demolition was the “Jungle Book Kids” café in the camp, which provides 200 daily food, English and French lessons and offers asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was written that the closure of the café “will be a catastrophe for these children, many of whom are only eight years old”.
Two charitable organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, predicted that the number of refugees in the bush camps had surpassed 9,000 on Friday, the highest level since the surge in the number of refugees in the summer.
"This $5,000 grant is a relief to my immediate needs."
Chou Feng, a poor Licadu girl from the village of Mijo, Huaxiang County, received a letter of acceptance from the University of South China.
On 9 August, at a time when she was upset about the cost of her admission to school, the Committee gave her a grant of $5,000 in time.
For more than 690 students living in poverty, the district authorities have also implemented a grant of 2.83 million yuan for school attendance.
In the case of families whose economic situation is particularly difficult, assistance is also provided to them to complete their studies, including through the organization of social grants.
This year, Hana-chan consolidated over $18.5 million in student assistance funds and raised over $2.5 million from the financial sector, with the financial sector entering the real bank cards of poor students within the prescribed time frame.
She said with gratitude: “I thought my father was dead, my brother and I could not go to college, and I didn't expect the county to solve our problems in time”.
As at 8 August, Hana-kun had secured over $21 million in various assistance funds for the first half of the year for 1,3140 needy students.
All needy students in the district have achieved the necessary assistance, which is supplemented by the necessary assistance.
The press observed at the scene that a large cargo truck head had been moved under the command of the traffic police on the fast track, that the container had fallen on the green lane and that a 2-centimetre pit had been thrown out on the side of the road.
According to Xinhua, the New South Wales Government of Australia announced on 11 November that $200 million (approximately $154 million) would be spent on the largest renovation of the famous Sydney Opera Theatre since its inception.
The Government of New South Wales indicated that the renovation would not change the shape of the opera shell.
The Sydney Opera House, one of the landmark buildings in Sydney, was designed by Danish architect Jon Utsson and built in 1973 to receive approximately 8 million visitors per year.
Rory Jeffs, General Manager of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes that the Sydney Opera Theatre will use this to “turn back into one of the world's most vocal concert halls”.
Non-King citizens who have resided in Kyoto for more than six months and who meet one of the conditions of legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence and continuous schooling in Kyoto may apply for a residence permit.
In recent days, the regulations implementing the temporary residence permit regulations in Beijing have been introduced, which means that the “temporary residence permit” will be upgraded to a “resident's permit”.
According to the heads of relevant departments, the shift from a “temporary residence permit” to a “resident permit” meant that Beijing would move from a “managership” to a multiplicity of services for the non-King resident population.
Journalists today learned from the National Tax Administration that, by the end of June of this year, 2,470 “blacklists” of tax offences had been published by tax authorities at all levels.
It is known that in July 2014, the Directorate-General of State Taxes, a first step in the central Government ' s functions, and in conjunction with the Tax Credit Management Scheme, issued the " Information Disclosure Scheme for Major Tax Offences " .
However, the facts of the violations, the legal basis and the penalties imposed in these cases are published, and the basic information of the offenders and those responsible for the relevant intermediaries are disclosed together with the “black list”.
Government departments such as the Quality Review, Finance and Customs have also taken appropriate disciplinary measures against persons on the “blacklist”.
“The credit restoration mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and, indeed, in the construction of the entire social credit system, marking the continued development and maturity of the country's social credit system.”
“Environmental problems manifest themselves in the atmosphere, water, soil pollution, but roots are also productive lifestyles”.
For example, in 2015, the Jiangsu province had as much as 21 per cent land development, the highest in the country ' s provinces and autonomous regions.
As a result, the issue of high levels of pollution, energy and land tenure has not yet been fundamentally addressed in terms of a shift from productive lifestyles.
On the one hand, in the light of the results of the creation of various ecological environments at all levels in Jiangsu province, the absolute advantage is paramount in the country; on the other hand, the resource environment is under considerable pressure.
A solid advance in eco-environmental protection and governance requires a fundamental move towards a transformation of productive lifestyles in order to build eco-civilization for the benefit of the people in transition.
On 11 November, at the Bay of Lien Yun, 42 wind blades, produced by the State Electric Group, were loaded for export to South Africa.
Since last year, a total of 163 wind and wind projects have been exported to South Africa from the port of Lianyun.
The third-party company (non-Chinese) commissioned by the OSC to produce the flag is located in São Paulo, Brazil, approximately 75 kilometres from the city of São Paulo.
In order to urge the producers to complete their work as soon as possible, the Chinese Consulate General in São Paulo organized an intensive mission to the factory.
After 30 hours of overtime work, the factory finally completed the Chinese flag production and loaded the shipment, bringing to an advanced stage the tasks that would have required four to five working days.
According to the information received, the flag is expected to arrive in Rio on 11 November, and the Olympic Committee will receive it and send it to the Olympic complexes, and the entire process will be completed under the supervision of the Chinese embassy and consulate in Brazil.
On the 10th day of this newspaper, the city of Nantong organized an industrial cooperation initiative at the Shanghai International Conference Centre, in which more than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate and more than 2 billion yuan were contracted on site for the project.
A total of $8,063 million has been invested in 20 centrally contracted projects in a number of sectors, including new energy sources, new materials and modern services.
Qingdao is the twelfth largest city in the country and the first pilot city in Shandong Province for paid use and trading of sewage rights.
On 11 November, several enterprises each went to the Qingdao City Sewerage Trading Centre to submit a claim for sewage rights, which will be followed by payment of a fee for their use.
The first transaction list, which is about to be completed, also heralds the formal opening of the Qingdao Drainage Trading Pilot, which will also be the first in the province and the first in the country's city-level Stewardship Trade.
On the morning of 11 September, Zhao Xuping, General Manager of Twin Peaches Chemical (Group) Ltd., came to the Qingdao City Decontamination and Drainage Trading Centre to submit a claim for the right to decontamination.
At the end of last year, the company, located in the Old City district of Qingdao, was completely shut down and relocated to a new plant site with a level environment.
Following the submission of the application form, the environmental impact report for the construction project, etc., Qingdao City Decontamination Rights Storage and Trading Service Centre began the initial examination of the application materials.
Based on the collection criteria established by the Qingdao City Department of Prices, Finance, etc., the initial estimate of royalties is currently estimated at approximately $64.12 million and the staff member will complete the approval within seven working days.
The first list of transactions to be completed also pre-dates the formal launch of the Qingdao Drainage Trading Pilot, which will also be the first in the province and the first in the country's city-level Stewardship Trade.
According to Zhao Xuping, the corporate environment is now invested in 400 million dollars, apparently in large amounts, but it has a significant impact on the concept of business management, on social benefits and on the scope for innovation in business management.
On the same day, the Qingjio Qingjio Shinzhengshi Chao Car Parts Company Ltd. also applied for the right to acquire sewage disposal for the 4200 high-iron and interior fittings items produced annually.
The project is a mechanical processor and the initial sewage rights requested are 0.514 tonnes/year for chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 0.052 tonnes/year for ammonia (NOX).
The right to air pollution is used and traded on a reimbursable basis to supply priority industrial enterprises throughout the city with electricity and heat production.
Existing EVA sewage units acquired by 1 January 2016 are not subject to a reimbursable user fee.
“According to the right to sewage on a reimbursable basis does not amount to a right to discharge illegally and does not release pollutants at will.”
The Deputy Director of the Qingdao City Environmental Protection Agency, Han Hongyan, explained that it was not possible to allow illegal businesses to avoid punishment by purchasing the right to sewage if illegal sewage, over-marked sewage, was still subject to penalties in accordance with the relevant regulations.
This means that environmental offences are severely combated by means of legislation and that companies are severely punished for excess-marked sewage, thereby protecting the environment and protecting public health.
Businesses now, for their own benefit, have increased their incentives to treat pollution, valued limited sewage rights and reduced pollutant emissions.
Driven by economic benefits, the reduction of pollutant emissions has been transformed from a coercive act by the Government to a conscious market-based act by the enterprise that truly serves the purpose of protecting the environment, protecting nature and safeguarding public health.
The right to discharge, also referred to as “emission rights”, is the right to discharge pollutants, which refers to the right of the emitters to release pollutants into the environment within the limits allocated by the Government, in accordance with the law.
This right is essentially the right of the polluter to occupy, use and reap the benefits of resources of environmental capacity.
Next, to the extent that total pollutant emissions do not exceed permitted emissions, the amount of discharges is transferred through currency exchange between internal sources.
Since 1968, when the deal was initiated by United States economist Dales, the United States applied it in the 1970s to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources.
We have been piloting since 2007 and are now fully operational in 14 provinces (districts, municipalities) such as Zhejiang and Jiangsu.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, in order to assist the six strategic bombers in carrying out an aerial strike against the targets of the “Islamic State” in Syria, several Russian warplanes provided support from the Syrian Hemeim airbase.
On 22 February this year, the United States and Russia reached an agreement on a ceasefire between the parties to the Syrian conflict, which has been in effect since 27 of that year.
According to the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes against terrorist organizations designated by the Security Council of the United Nations, such as the Support Front of the Islamic State.
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of its military personnel will be guaranteed accordingly.
He also said that if extremist forces were not combated, they would spread to Russia.
Although there is no agreement between Russia and the West to jointly combat Syrian extremist forces, Russia will strengthen its cooperation in this regard with Syria, Iran and Iraq, among others.
In September 2015, at the invitation of the Syrian Government, Russia began a military strike against Syrian extremist forces.
While the withdrawal of the main Russian military forces in Syria began on 15 March this year, the Russian side has committed itself to maintaining its airbase in Hememim and its naval base in Tartus.
In the case of newborns in old homes and successful village creations, Ho Pao is a good example: a hundred-year-old house is passed on, along with a story of a land inheritance.
Today, an average of 100,000 people come together every year, either to bring a variety of ideas or to seek inner peace.
In fact, the relationship between the village and the city is supposed to be with each other, as is the case with mothers and children, there is no strength or weakness, and it is supposed to be warm that no one is needed to rule over anyone.
There are no fixed patterns of rural development, but it is difficult to make spontaneous changes in the countryside, the most important of which should be to allow the right people to go to the countryside.
In recent days, the Songjiang District Department in Shanghai has used electronic police to fix drivers to play with their mobile phones, and more than 30 cases have been detected in one week.
With the spread of smart phones, mobile phones become more and more fun, with micro-mails, tweets and even games, shopping for treasures becoming the norm, and many people seem to be forced to walk away from their mobile phones and to be unable to stop driving.
The Road Traffic Safety Act expressly prohibits driving mobile phones and defines it as “impeding safe driving”.
Unfortunately, due to the presence of offenders, difficulties in obtaining evidence, etc., this phenomenon has not been adequately punished and the legal provisions have been almost formalized.
Such violations can always be curbed if the authorities are determined to “declare war” on driving mobile phones and to regularize the measure.
The management of the civil registry file should be closely monitored, and electronic and paper files should be created on each of the non-resident ' s household registration materials to ensure that the file is complete and effective.
The public security organs shall notify the relevant authorities in a timely manner of the registration of non-residents.
A focused clean-up of policy measures that are not in line with the spirit of the present implementation will be carried out, a serious revision of the amendment and a firm repeal of the repeal.
In the collective shed of the village of Eastwood in Taikura, Wang Shefin, age 48, was carrying workers to spray pear trees with pesticides.
More than 150 acres of orchards and more than 10 trees were planted throughout the village, requiring only 12 workers and 1 technical engineer.
That's $50,000 last year, like my age, and I'm sure I won't get it if I work in a factory.
Last year, the village income of Eastlin reached 22 million yuan, of which total agricultural income accounted for almost half.
The village secretary Su Chifan: The average land area per capita is rising each year, starting with 50 acres, and now exceeds 100 acres; the average yield is increasing each year and there is scope to increase the income of working farmers every year.
Quantified shares to every villager, the greatest highlight of the collective economic reform in the south of the country is the clarity of the property rights of the rural collectives and the exploration of political and economic separation.
In July 2015, 14 Rural Economic Cooperation Organisations (RECs) and their Village and Village Councils (VCs) managed rural public affairs, while the cooperative organizations were mainly operating.
The two institutions have two accounts and do not “combin” each other, preventing the involvement of village cadres in the management of collective assets from becoming corrupt.
The Deputy Director of the Rural Committee of Jiangsu province informed him that Jiangsu ' s next step would be to continue to promote community partnership reform, encourage farmers to develop jointly and establish mechanisms for the democratic functioning of power at the village level.
To Phiping: to move forward further with reforms, community equity partnerships, the quantification of assets to members of the community, the stationing of assets to farmers and the formation of clear property rights.
Through the Internet+, he is given the right to information, the right to participate in decision-making and the right to supervise the democratic administration. Three rights are given to farmers, and they are indeed translated into a functioning mechanism of regulated equity cooperation.
At present, the country ' s new rural collective economy consists mainly of four development models: asset leasing, business equity, agricultural development, and joint development.
It is understood that the overseas fairs serve as an important platform for promoting “one-way” construction in Zhejiang province.
The successful organization of these overseas fairs has generated valuable experience and a good basis for continuing to open up emerging markets along the “one-way” route and to build an integrated platform for overseas fairs.
Pike will always be guided by the need to raise the demand for sports among consumers, to build an ecclesiastical community in the sports industry, and to accelerate the strategic upgrading from a single sporting goods manufacturing enterprise to a professional sports service enterprise.
Hamir added that 34 others had been wounded and taken to hospital, including three firemen who had been lightly injured and who had been discharged from hospital.
He also appealed to the inhabitants of the fire apartment to contact the authorities, as some of the occupants were still unaccounted for.
According to the information received, Ms. Mariana Turay, who had lived in the apartment for 30 years, said: “It seems that a bomb fell”.
According to the information received, the local fire brigade took one hour and 45 minutes to put out the fire and residents of nearby buildings were allowed to return to their homes after a few hours.
The United States Red Cross estimated that approximately 100 people were homeless, 60 to 70 of them staying in shelters in nearby district centres, mostly of Hispanic origin.
On 11 August, the first festival of wetland tourism and culture in Jinzhou was inaugurated on the eve of Lake Crane Springs in the East of Chinatown, Jinzhou.
From 2014, the tourism industry generated 10 per cent of GDP in the city of Jinzhou; it reached 11.3 per cent in 2015.
The wetland hot springs of the Eastern city of China Dynasty are located in the city of Jinzhou, on the coast road No. 1, which is 70 km from the urban area of Jinzhou, 50 km from the urban area of Linghai and 70 km from the city.
Indoor hot springs cover 3,000 square metres and outdoor hot springs cover 4,600 square metres.
Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: "Beautiful hand" has been "reversed" in his career on the road of shooting.
Chang Donghong, from Dong Hong village in Xiamenang district, replaced his home's 29-inch old television with a 65-inch television.
The daughter of the average farmer was Zhang Binbin, who captured the silver medal of the 50-metre female rifle of the Rio Olympics for China on the night of 11 November.
On the night of 11 September, just before this new television, the Chang Donghong couple and dozens of relatives and friends witnessed the amazing process of running their daughters all the way up and running from almost pre-game to almost reversal.
During that day's race, Zhang Binbin once came down the middle and seemed to be far from the finals.
Parents and close friends, however, did not give up and kept their words on the air, seeing that as other players finished the race, Zhang Binbin was raised and eventually locked in the finals, and his family was cheering from a moment to time.
In the finals, when Zhang Binbin was one of the lower rankings, the last shots became more secure, winning silver medals with only 0.2 ring marks.
This year, 27-year-old Zhang Binbin, during his 16-year-old shooting career, almost passed through this hard-won silver medal.
Her mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told the press that, when they hesitated, Zhang Binbin came to a few “novels” from his village.
These novelists were the same village children who were also recommended for training in the same year, including Zhang Binbin's cousin.
Shortly after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin took the initiative to return to Xiang's school for reasons such as family difficulties.
But after his enlightenment coach, Zhang Ajay, repeated his work, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once returned home for lack of hope because of delays in entering the national team.
This time, not only Coach Zhang Yaji, the head and coach of the Xiamen Shooting Arrow Campaign Centre and the Fujian Provincial Team came to the house and eventually persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the Provincial Team.
Just like yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl's insistence achieved a reversal on the road of shooting.
"The way in which each coach chooses his team is different, and when I see Binbin's hands are beautiful, it's just a moment away."
Zhang Donghong also recalled that while the girls were not the best performers in the training tests, the number of rings produced was stable, which was also an important reason for Zhang Binbin to attract coaches.
In the course of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yaji was most impressed by the input of the farm girl.
He recalled that, more than a year after his entry into the Xiamen firing team, Zhang Binbin was required to remain in the team for half an hour for sustained firing training.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter had always been a quiet and sweet child, and had always liked drawings and homemade hand-made toys since childhood.
"I used to make clothes and stitches at home, and Binbin would pick up a few edges to make his own dolls."
She said that her daughter often sews her own handmade toys, and that she is good at drawing, from the five officers to the dress of the doll, and can always do well.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and his family are very close to each other, and only on holidays can they return home, often by telephone.
Parents said that whether they meet or call, Zhang Binbin rarely talks about their hard work and more about having fun with their parents.
Daughters are not usually seen, and their parents keep their paintings and the honours of the years when they were young in their homes.
Zhang Xiaolong presented her daughter's cartoons to a journalist, “if she is not a shooter, she should continue painting”.
In the second floor living room of the Zhang Binbin family, there was a cabinet full of the medals, medals and certificates she had received.
Zhang Donghong put the medals and medals together, and the certificates were put together in the folders, “These are the honours of more than a decade, and we all cherish them”.
In recent days, the Xiao Xiao Xiao Xiao Foundation of Hebei Province has sent $16,000 in condolence money to six families in the villages of Koshio, Taiwan, Guiquan and other villages in Ijiang county.
This is yet another act of compassion that the Fund has inspired society to look for “disappeared children and lonely old people” in the wake of the 7.19 floods.
7.19 Heavy rains affected many parts of Hebei Province, causing flooding in parts of the province, as well as deaths and disappearances.
The good man, Iron, who had unfortunately lost his life by helping the community to drain, left behind two-year-old children and a wife with six nails, and the good man, Iron, touched the entire town.
On 4 August, the staff of the Tzu Xiao Xiao Foundation in Hebei Province, together with Hebei's brand volunteers, came to the good man's “old iron” home and paid $3,200 in love to the family of the “old iron”.
When the vice president of the brand association, Yelly, became aware of the current situation of the “old iron” family, it was decided to carry out a “love for sale” campaign among the business members of the brand association to help the “old iron” family share their difficulties.
Hebei Province Tzu Xiao Foundation, known as Hebei Province Voluntary Service Foundation, was established in August 2015 under the auspices of the Hebei branding committee.
According to the Hong Kong newspaper Orient, on 12 August, the sale of diamonds in the interior is currently cited as having three major problems, including a net increase in the price of fraudulent diamonds, the weight of false diamonds, and the lack of security after sale.
Antwerp, for its part, is one of the largest diamond trading centres in the world. Local craftsmen are well known for their diamond cutting techniques, and the diamonds sold are highly validated and well received by Ms. Mainland.
“A small bag, holding hands, a small handful of lightly floating, worth almost millions of dollars”, a Lao mother, who was involved in buying diamonds, described her experience in Antwerp in June this year to the Mainland media.
She indicated that she hid the diamonds in her underwear, went to the toilet for several days, bathed them and slept on her feet.
She claims that the price of diamonds purchased in Antwerp is approximately $55,000 per carat and that the retail price of diamonds of the same quality is about $111,000 per carat.
She sold all the diamonds she had purchased, adding 20 per cent to the purchase price, making over $200,000 at a time.
According to Mainland Customs, diamonds, which are not goods or necessities for passengers in their journeys, fall within the category of goods and are subject to declaration at the time of entry or exit, or are listed as smuggling, and are severely liable to imprisonment.
According to external sources, on 10 local time, the British Prime Minister's Office, Downing Street, announced that British Prime Minister Teresa May would spend the summer in Switzerland without disclosing a specific place for the holiday.
According to the media, after the British referendum, the new British Prime Minister chose “neutral” Switzerland on the European continent for a holiday with some symbolic policy.
The British Guardian commented that the symbol represented by the neutral State of Switzerland played a role in the choice of the British Prime Minister ' s first resort.
According to the British Daily Telegraph, Teresa May chose Switzerland for a holiday, the first time since Mrs. Suchcher, the British Prime Minister went to Switzerland.
The choice of two female prime ministers contrasted with the preference of two male prime ministers, Blair and Cameron, to take vacations in hot spots.
According to the information received, the new British Prime Minister, Teresa May, will return to London on 24 August and will await her as a result of a series of important tasks and activities.
The British Parliament will resume its meeting on 5 September and will debate topics including the request for a second Trans-European referendum on the Internet.
On 23 June, the British referendum decided to de-escalate, but the new British Prime Minister did not wish to launch paragraph 50 of the Lisbon Treaty before the end of the year.
The city of Huangshan has one hundred and thirty-five intangible cultural heritage projects, all of which are the province's top in number and type.
As the cultural non-genetic heritage of the emblem is largely dependent on oral reproduction, many non-relicts are on the verge of being lost, and the use of digital technology for preservation and protection is imperative.
In accordance with the main elements of the work of the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress this year, the Standing Committee plans to hear the consideration of specific reports on its work and to conduct a thematic inquiry on the implementation of the Banking Supervision and Management Act to serve local economic development.
In mid-August, the Standing Committee will organize two research teams to undertake research in selected municipalities in preparation for thematic inquiries.
Han Jianhui noted that, for the first time in my province, the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress had heard, considered and conducted ad hoc reports on the work of vertical management and had conducted thematic inquiries, which had been a positive exploration to strengthen and expand its monitoring work.
In Xinjiang Qash, the Commanding Department of Exercises, with the orders of the Director-General, the armed police units in Kash, Wada and Aksu quickly proceeded to conduct a mobile assembly to the theatre of the exercise, in accordance with the command instructions.
China's Mars program is here.
Our Mars mission is about to be rounded up, landed and patrolled at once, a form that has never been seen abroad.
The mission of my country ' s Mars exploration launch, which is designed to be a step-by-step orbit, landing and patrolling, is quite difficult.
Because Mars exploration takes 26 months to meet a window of time, experts are closely developing engineering plans for the launch of our first Mars probe in 2020.
According to Xu Da Chul, although our aircraft are already in deep space, the completion of Mars exploration remains indispensable, and it means that China is entering the age of deep space exploration in a true sense.
“It is only every two or three years that Mars has the closest opportunity to Earth to launch a Mars detector at this point in time, which is the most energy-efficient for a launch vehicle.”
“Considering the quality of the Mars probe, the launch mission will be carried out by our Long March Five carrier rocket.”
My country's Mars mission is about to be rounded, landed and patrolled once. This is a form that has never existed abroad, and it was planned to be rounded and landed once abroad, but the landing failed.
There are many technical areas involved in Mars exploration, especially since, while the Mars vehicle is a space detector, it has a distinct character in comparison with a space detector in general.
In other words, Mars detectors need to have the ability to determine the route and detect the hazard of an obstacle.
Researcher Pan Kihoho of the China Space Science and Technology Group V said that humankind's preference for Mars exploration was due to its many scientific, technical and other significance and even to its relevance to the future of mankind.
Mars has now become the planet with the highest level of human research, except on Earth, and the history of human exploration of Mars using space detectors runs almost throughout the history of human space.
Humankind therefore hopes that one day a living base will be established on Mars, eventually migrating to Mars and turning it into a second home for mankind.
There are also numerous indications that Mars, like the present Earth, was likely to have evolved over billions of years into thin atmospheres, low temperatures and depleted water sources.
Therefore, research into the detection or manned landing on Mars could provide a scenario to prevent the planet from becoming the second Mars where humankind is unable to survive.
As of June 2016, 114 lunar surveys and 43 Mars surveys had been conducted globally.
However, from the 1990s to the present, there have been 18 Mars expeditions, compared to 14 on the Moon.
There are currently five Mars orbital vehicles and two Mars cruisers, but only one month of orbiter and one month of landing vehicle are working.
As can be seen from the fact that the vast space-faring nations of the world have developed exploration programmes targeting the Mars system, today ' s Martian exploration is more hot than the Moon.
On 5 November 2013, India launched the first Mars probe, Mangarian, as the first country in Asia to successfully explore Mars.
Mangarian is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars and to find out if there are signs of methane and life on Mars.
The hardest part of this mission is that there's only one chance of aerodynamic and parachute deceleration when the probe enters the atmosphere on Mars.
According to Sun Zechua, the Master Designer of the Mars Explorer at the Central Department of the China Space Science and Technology Corporation, Mars exploration missions face many technical challenges.
The atmospheric pressure on Mars is low, with only 1 per cent of atmospheric pressure on the Earth ' s surface and high uncertainty.
Scientists have yet to have a thorough understanding of such factors as its variability and storm-time characteristics.
Mars often forms dust storms similar to the Earth's dust weather during the summer, which can lead to a sharp decline in the solar light energy received by the Mars vehicle, which must be designed as a “slept” mode, allowing it to wait patiently for the dust to pass.
At the same time, the Mars atmosphere also has a reduced effect on solar light, which poses a challenge for the energy supply of Mars exploration.
This requires a larger solar wing of the detector and constant adaptation in an effort to target the direction of the Sun.
Also, the surface gravity of Mars is only 38 per cent of the Earth, but it is much more than the surface of the Moon, so the probe needs more power.
“The most central and difficult part of this Mars mission is the process of aerodynamic appearance and parachute deceleration after the probe enters the atmosphere of Mars, with only one opportunity to ensure success.”
Sundze said that because of the distance between the Earth and Mars, the entire process could not be controlled in real time by the ground, and that it had to be done on its own by means of detectors.
In the absence of so many propellants to offset that high speed, the speed of landing on Mars depends on the atmosphere of Mars, which is difficult to simulate on the ground.
On the whole, Pang Chiho says that Mars is detected in a manner similar to that of the Moon, and that it is also a “round, fall, cruise, return” that ultimately achieves the goal of human landing on Mars.
As Mars is much farther from Earth than the Moon, the detection of Mars requires a series of more complex technical difficulties.
According to the Taiwan media, the “President of Administration” Lin announced yesterday morning that “the regulations governing the improper acquisition of property by political parties and their affiliated organizations” would be in effect today.
The Vice-President of the National Party, Jan Qingxian, stated that “a more than a hundred-year-old National Party, with the commitment and responsibility of society, will not collapse”.
Lin Bing stressed that if a political party, an affiliated organization or a trustee, among others, violates the prohibitions laid down in the regulations, the Committee will investigate ex officio and impose sanctions and penalties “in accordance with the law”.
Lin has also announced that the Deputy Chairman of the Irregular Party Production Committee will be the Deputy Director of the ICAC, Hung Bacon.
He stated that the Chairman of the Improper Party Committee was no longer a candidate, drawing on the experience of Hong Beagan in past investigations of relevant major cases, which would serve as a basis for the Committee ' s identification of related cases of improper party production.
According to Gen Qingxian, no one will make a contribution to your society as long as there is a party today, and if the party's output is confiscated, the National Party can just ask for social support and sponsorship, “it is true that today there is no other opportunity to do so”.
Gen Qinghyun also stressed that, even if the PNP party had not been completely confiscated and confiscated after the improper party regulations went on the road, the rest would still be donated, as promised, to allow the party to return to zero, and the party would want everything to start from scratch.
Original title: "Master of the Corridor" Randal Peak v. Tribute Facilitator Wang Zhian's honour violation first instance
The rule of law evening news report was published on Xinwa Weibo by its host, Wang Zhian, in response to the incident of the “column doctor”, who was brought before the court by Mount Land on behalf of Wang Zhian and Beijing's Micro-Nightmare Network Technology Ltd.
Yesterday afternoon, the Heining Court handed down its judgement in the case, in which it found that Wang Zhian and Microdream did not constitute a violation and dismissed all the claims in the Landing case.
At the beginning of 2014, a survey of journalist Wang Zhian found that, despite having been sitting in the hospital corridor for more than 600 days on the Randal Peak, the media had been transformed into sad heroes under institutional pressure, there was a great deal of false information about these reports.
On 29 March 2014, the corridor doctor programme produced by the Public Information Survey was broadcast.
There is no evidence to support any of the information reported to the media on the so-called excessive medical treatment in Lantern.
Wang Zhi-Am also described in his authenticated tweets that “it was through character, with obvious paranoia, and so forth that Mount Lande has come to this point”.
Randal requested Wang Zhian to remove Weibo, apologize to him and compensate him for the moral damage in the amount of $100,000.
During the trial, the parties argued whether Wang Zhian had violated the right to honour of Mount Land.
Look at the 12th: The track opening Chinese team is busy with girls rushing on four bikes looking forward to a breakthrough.
The bicycles are expected to make the Olympic gold medal “zero breakthrough”, and the girls will challenge the two world champions, the German team, and expect to burst into the top four.
Wang Town has gained prominence in the last two seasons, with the Beijing track and track World championship winning silver medals last year and the graduation of the individual project champions from the World Cup in May this year.
According to the foreign media, 27-year-old Korean archer, Zhang Hye-Jen, won gold medals in the female archery personal competition, followed by an Olympic gold medal and became a double champion.
Zhang Hye-jin, who was considered to be a late-coming contestant, regretted not having received a ticket to the last London Olympics, is now proud to stand on the highest stage of the Rio Olympics.
Zhang Hue-jin won a gold medal in the finals of the female archery competition held at the Samba Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in which Lisa Onwlu of Germany was defeated by a total of 6-2 points.
She didn ' t shoot for the first time in the fourth grade of primary school until she was 27 years old in 2014, when she won the first individual gold medal at the World Cup, a later-known contestant.
Zhang Huijin recalled that “before attending secondary school, there was no level of participation in national competitions.
Zhang Hye-jin won only the fourth place in the London Olympics competition four years ago. Unfortunately, he lost the tickets to the Olympics and was only able to watch his colleague and best friend, Chiv, take two gold medals.
Zhang Hye-jin spoke of her gold-earning sentiment after the end of the women's arrow-shooting personal awards ceremony, “until the end, as many arrows as possible were fired, perhaps with good results and satisfaction.
Chivbe, a 28-year-old Korean archer, “One Sister” and individual archer winner of the London Olympics, won the bronze medal.
Chivbe lost to Zhang Huixiang in the semi-finals and fought for the bronze medal against the Mexican contestant, Alejandro Valencia.
Kifbe is making sure that the copper medals are followed by tears and tears at the playing field, and the surreptitive financial burden that he bears can be imagined.
First, the coach team has accumulated a wealth of experience in ongoing research, and secondly, the way science is trained, which needs to be built up over the long term.
The archery squads helped the crew focus and remained normal, including through military training and night-time passage through the cemetery.
Although not confirmed, many sources have indicated that the Apple launch in the fall of 2016 will take place in September and that iPhone7 is indeed coming.
Although Apple did not respond, news has been posted about the new iPhone functionality, configuration and even online images of the iPhone 7.
The new generation of iPhones is called “the eyes of all”, hot, tight, rich... if you want to buy the real thing the first time, you have to choose a good channel, for example, Sunin.
This adds to the disappointment of people with the new cell phone, “It's longer, but it can't project holograms! This generation of iPhones sucks.”
Like other iPhones, iPhone7 was born with countless secrets.
In addition, several sources claim that a new generation of iPhones will remove 3.5 mm headphone interfaces and switch to bluetooth connections and charging interfaces, which will provide space for a second speaker for apples.
Another piece of evidence to support this information is that apples allowed headphone manufacturers to produce headphone products connected by charging interfaces as early as 2014.
These messages are either true or false, and the answers will not be available until the Apple will be released in the fall of 2016.
But this does not prevent industry from looking at the prospect of iPhone7 — which, according to many, is likely to be the last major upgrade of Apple to iPhone.
Although the market share of iPhone has declined, according to data released recently by IDC, a market research institute.
Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained the “buy-in” rating of Apple stocks, while BMO analysts believed that iPhone7 would reap a historic sales score.
At the same time, the company CEO Hock Tan has indicated that the future increase in apple harvests is likely to exceed 20 per cent, thanks entirely to the introduction of iPhone7.
Seven per cent of the respondents indicated that they had plans to buy iPhone7, compared to 4 per cent of those who planned to buy iPhone6 two years ago.
It is understood that 20 per cent of the user groups currently holding iPhone6 or 6Plus are planning to purchase iPhone7, which is a significant proportion.
Secondly, there is expert analysis that most of the fruit powder prefers to replace its iPhone in later generations.
According to statistics, about 26 per cent of all iPhone users have not changed their cell phones for two years, iPhones, which has almost 120 million users for two years.
According to the media, during the production of iPhone 7, Taiwan was hit by several earthquakes, “the level of damage to power production facilities on the table was greater than imagined and could have had an impact on the initial supply of iPhone7”.
The mismatch between supply and demand affects ordinary users, and it is time to choose a good channel for the first-time low-cost iPhone7.
According to informed sources, there have been frequent meetings with Apple in recent times at the senior level in Sunning to prepare sufficient supplies.
Operators have negotiated with Suning and it is foreseeable that, as the parties work together in depth, they will inevitably bring lower prices and more caring services to the users.
“at the lowest price, consumers may be ‘seven dollars a day to buy iPhone7’.”
A sufficient supply of goods and a variety of preferences to make the purchase of iPhone7 no longer “pressure mountain” and the logistics of Sunning turn this beauty into a more intuitive sense of experience.
Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Suning buys, your iPhone 7 is here."
The sponsors hoped to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two countries through an exhibition of antiquities that would make the local people more aware of their long-standing Chinese culture.
Barcelona's “Monster Cultural Fair” is part of the European tour and will continue until early October.
The first half of 2016 was published yesterday by the Bank of Warschae and the Bank of Plumbing, and the second quarter of mid-term certificate gold was again able to increase its shares.
Of this amount, Chinese gold increased to 29,293 thousand shares of the Bank of Huaxia and, by the end of June, Chinese gold held 387 million shares in the Bank of Huaxia, which also increased from 3.35 per cent to 3.62 per cent.
Trader securities were also measured, net of a transfer, and the Chinese bank increased its share by 38 million shares in the second quarter, increasing its holdings to nearly 600 million shares, accounting for 2.77 per cent of the shares in the bank.
In recent days, the Hobo Garden, which is a lion's garden in the village of Jeongfu in the town of Kyung Fu, Zhejiang province, has been officially opened to villagers and tourists.
The park consists of more than 100 small circular ponds with about 300 varieties of ornamental flowers, sleeping Lotuss, etc.
The rural flower industry, with its perceived, leisure and economic benefits, has become a bright spot for new rural development in the country.
According to external sources, the Rio Olympic “Green Pool” incident has been of concern to the outside world in recent days as a result of the shift from a blue to a green pool.
However, in the morning of 10 years, water from the pool of balloons adjacent to the diving pool was also turned green.
The Australian waterball player, after the race, indicated that his eyes were sore that he wanted to shed tears.
Previously, officials of the Rio Olympics had confirmed the greening of the pool and stated that the coloring of the pool was due to weak alkaline and did not affect the health of athletes.
However, Australian athletes, after winning a race with the Japanese team in the pool, said that their eyes were sore.
At the earliest, following the greening of the pool, the competition organizers worked overtime on the night of 9 days to deal with the diving pool, but in the morning of 10 days, it was observed that the colour of the pool also changed rapidly.
During the Australian and Japanese team competitions, environmental conditions deteriorated, but official emphasis was placed on restoring the water quality of the two pools to their original colours on 11 November.
The spokesman for the Rio Olympics, Mario Andrada, said: “In the first place, yesterday afternoon, the alkaline level in the diving pool became weaker”.
“We are aware of a range of possible causes for the coloring of the pool and the alkalinity of water quality.”
Water sports centres have conducted a series of tests of water quality, and hundreds of divers and swimmers have used pools to determine that water quality conditions meet standards.”
“These days we've been following normal procedures, but we may have overlooked the impact that more athletes can have on water quality.”
“But a change in the colour of the water certainly has no effect on the health of the body, particularly the athletes.”
“This independent team confirmed our assessment and the measures we took to restore the pool to its normal colour and chemical state.”
“We had hoped that the pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the rate of recovery was affected by the rain.”
According to Taiwan's “Central” agency, a prison on the outskirts of Metro Manila was bombed last night, injuring the warden and killing 10 prisoners, including two Chinese.
ABS-CBN TV reported that the incident took place at about 9 p.m. last night in Paranaque prison, but the police did not make a preliminary statement until 2 a.m. today.
According to the police, the 10 prisoners sought access to the governor of the prison and complained about the transfer, but they were not speculative, and the prisoners threw grenades, which resulted in an explosion.
The prison authorities have not yet published the names of the deceased prisoners, but according to GMA television, which includes two Chinese.
As at 8 a.m., no detailed explanation had been provided by the prison authorities, including how the prisoners had access to grenades.
Yesterday, the central police of the country entered the Leyte district prison, killing one of the prisoners “attempted to attack the police”.
Urumqi has to sign contracts with tourists for travel agencies that regulate the operating order of the tourists ' market
Xinjiang has now entered the tourist season and, in order to regulate the operating order of the tourists ' market, the Urumqi Municipal Tourism Enforcement Branch, in conjunction with the Enforcement Branch of the Municipal Transport Authority, conducted a survey yesterday on the irregularity of the travel vehicles in the dispersed market and the low rate of contracting between travel agents and tourists.
Yesterday morning, at 8 a.m., around the Cabinsky Hotel, there were about 10 buses full of tourists, most of which were on a daily tour to the pool.
"Hello, I'm from the Urumqi Tourist Bureau. Have you signed a contract with this travel agency?"
Urumqi's law enforcement branch staff member U. U. U.U. stated: “Residence tourist cars and shuttle buses operate tourist passenger projects in the Urumqi market and are not qualified to do so”.
“A fine of between 300,000 and 100,000 shall be imposed on over-the-counter operations, and the driver's lack of qualification shall be a fine of 2,000 dollars.”
It is understood that previously, Urumqi's tourism law enforcement authorities had inspected areas of concentration of tourists, such as the Western Park and Red Mountain.
In a combination of the two inspections, Maggie, Deputy Chief of the Tourism Law Enforcement Branch of Urumqi City, said: “The first is safety, the second is regulation, the tourist vehicle is fine, and in the event of a problem, it is a mass casualty”.
“We are jointly and continuously inspecting the market to regulate the use of vehicles by travel agents to ensure the safety of tourists.”
On the morning of 12 August, the Press Office of the State Council held a press conference on the functioning of the national economy in July 2016.
In July, the national economic sector saw a slowdown in the rate of growth of the national economic sector indicators, but was still operating in reasonable areas, according to the news spokesperson of the National Statistical Office and the Director of the General Department of National Economic Integration Statistics.
Data released by the National Statistical Office show that data on the growth of fixed asset investments, total imports, etc., declined in July.
As for the performance of the national economy in July, I would like to borrow the words of the Prime Minister, “in a volatile and still in good shape”, which would give a better overview of the characteristics of the economic performance in July.
He explained that “volatile” meant that the rate of growth in some of the economic indicators in July had indeed declined.
Export pressures remained relatively high as the domestic and foreign economies were still undergoing deep adjustment in July, the international situation was complex and the world economy recovered less than expected.
Domestically, the economy as a whole is still at a critical stage of adjustment, with the pain of adjustment being unleashed and the economy facing considerable downward pressure, some indicators are somewhat volatile.
It was noted that in July there was another special situation, with severe flooding and some impact on production operations in some areas due to hot, hot and hot weather.
According to a recent release from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people throughout the country were affected, with direct economic losses exceeding 200 billion yuan.
These areas are affected to varying degrees in terms of industry, investment and transport-related indicators.
The weekly transhipment of goods in July increased at a rate of 3.6 percentage points over the previous month, and the floods had some impact on transport in these areas.
In the light of these factors, it is also normal and expected that some of the indicators will fluctuate in July.
He stated that “good still” meant that, although the rate of economic growth had returned somewhat, the economy had generally functioned smoothly, with steady progress and positive progress.
In July, the CPI rose by 1.8 per cent and the ring rose by 0.2 per cent; in January-July, the CPI rose by 2.1 per cent, thus stabilizing the price situation overall.
According to statistics from the Chongqing Meteorological Department portal on high temperature weather in the districts and districts, the rest of the city, with the exception of Xiaoyang, receives high temperature allowances of varying degrees.
Currently, at least 28 provinces across the country have defined the criteria for the payment of benefits, although the criteria vary from one province to another, and Chongqing receives a high-temperature allowance in the form of a high-temperature working day allowance.
The rate shall be no less than 10 yuan per person per day for those under 37°C and no less than 15 yuan per person per day for those above 37°C.
High-temperature workers above 40°C are entitled to a maximum allowance of $20 per day per month (except in cases where the worker is already entitled to a high-temperature job allowance under the law).
According to this standard, Kaiju, which received the highest number of days in high temperatures last month, received $330 and the lowest number of days, the city entrance, $80, while the highest temperature in Xiaoyang, which did not meet the high temperature standard, did not receive the high temperature allowance.
In the past, a number of units had used cool drinks to offset the high temperature allowance, and the Municipal Security Inspectorate indicated that the practice was not in line with the current scheme.
The employer may not deduct or lower the wages of the worker if the work is suspended or the working hours are shortened due to the heat of the day.
According to the Municipal Social Bureau, employees who work at high temperatures and receive no compensation for high temperatures may seek legal rights and interests through the labour dispute mediation agency in which the enterprise is located or call 12333 to lodge a complaint.
If the employer refuses to pay the high temperature allowance, the worker may file a complaint with the social security authority for human resources at the county level or above in the place where the worker is employed.
At the same time, since high-temperature benefits are part of wages and are not benefits, they are included in the total wage and are reduced by one tax.
High-temperature benefits are therefore not covered by the minimum wage and must be paid in cash and cannot be replaced in kind, such as beverages.
The newly constructed Urumqi station is located in the high iron section of the city of Urumqi, with an overall area of approximately 100,000 square metres.
Grounds on the 1st and 2nd floors are for entry, waiting rooms and office and commercial rooms, and on the 1st basement level is for outstations.
At present, the Urumqi station is the largest integrated traffic hub in Xinjiang, bringing together high iron, orbital traffic, public transport, rental, etc., to achieve seamless docking by various modes of rotation.
There are 3 ticket offices on both the north and south sides of the station level and on the north side of the outer level, with 39 person ticket windows and 34 automatic ticket machines.
With regard to tickets, there are 30 passages on both the east and west sides of the waiting hall, and passengers can undergo rapid screening and waiting procedures based on the number of the stop on the ticket.
If you need help, you can select from the 41 call buttons set up on the motion station, which will be available in a timely manner.
From 1 July, the old passenger station, the passenger train at the southern Urumqi station, moved in separate steps to the Urumqi station.
In other words, all moving vehicles and 30 pairs of exterior trains can stop at the Urumqi station.
Tickets are now available for both stations, and the train between them takes about 10 minutes, and passengers need to be aware of the exact name of the stop from which the tickets are issued and the terminal.
The official operationalization of the Urumqi new passenger station will be an important platform for the construction of a national integrated transport city in Xinjiang, advancing the “silk route economic belt” and the construction of new districts.
Grescia is a cute female big mouth bird, full of tropical rainforests.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the story of the giant mouthbird Grescia and its story is well known.
At a press conference on 10 August, the post-operative recovering Grescia finally showed the people its brand-new 3D plastic beak.
A year and a half ago, this giant beaked and dying bird was finally reborn.
This day not only proclaims that it has recovered 100 per cent of its health, but also that it has moved into the luxury birdhouse and met its human friends who care about it.
Gracias, the first to enter the new home, is slightly stunned, but not very often it becomes lively, playing around in the basins and eating grapes with new beaks.
In order to remind people of the injuries it had suffered, the technicians had not colored its new beak, but had retained the original white of the 3D print material.
The bird's beak is a thin layer of angular gills, in which there is nothing but a slender stagger of bone support poles.
Despite this internal reinforcement, the beaks of the giant beaks are fragile and break when they are hurt.
The Animal Rescue Center, the Ornithologist and an American 3D printing company worked together to produce several “test beaks” for Gracia, which eventually produced the perfect beak for it.
Gracia is now skilled in using new beaks to drink water, eat and even peck small grains.
"The design of the final product took about two months, and it took only four or five hours to print it out."
“3D printing is not a future technology; it's actually going into your life.” Thomas Lange, President of SG3D Printing, United States, said in an interview with Xinhua International.
In January 2015, at a farm in Gracia, Alajuela province, central Costa Rica, a blood-covered giant mouthbird, Grescia, was discovered.
At that time, its upper beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, who were completely unable to eat and whose lives were in danger.
The tragedy in Greivía, which was reported in the media, has generated high levels of animal abuse in and around Costa Rica.
More stringent animal protection laws and increased penalties for abusers were called for.
The people came spontaneously and did their best to help Grescia recover as much as possible from his pre-injury life.
Even the 3D print technology inventor, Chuck Hull, was involved in the design of Grescia's upper beak.
“Grescia is in a very special situation, where the rest of its upper beak is less than 1 centimetre, which poses many difficulties for the installation of new beaks.”
"We first scan Grescia and then design and produce an extended prosthesis slightly longer than the rest of its upper beak and stick it to its upper beak."
“This would reduce further intrusive harm to Grescia.” Lange told Xinhua International.
Prior to the installation of prostheses, staff had to clean Gracia's beak every day to prevent infection.
A thousand miles away, the story of Grescia was touched by the famous documentary director, Paula Eredia, and by the producer of the Discovery News Channel, John Hoffman.
They recorded points and drops during the installation of a new beak in Gracia, and they recorded a documentary, The Kingdom of Big Mouthing Birds, which was shown on the Animal Planet channel this month.
The documentary State of Big Mouthbirds shows how a small big mouthbird can change a country and involve its citizens in the fight against animal abuse.
Core reminder: Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of small independent oil refineries in China, known as teapots.
According to the Japanese media reported on August 12, Japan's largest oil company, JX Energy, “the expansion of China's exports is one of the reasons for the downside.
Japan's oil companies are particularly vigilant about the rise of small independent oil refineries in China, known as teapots.
China’s quality of petroleum products is coming closer to Japan’s oil products as the Chinese government enforces environmental regulations.
Before obtaining an import permit for crude oil, the Teapot Refinery usually imports heavy oils with high sulphur content from places such as Russia for refining.
The high levels of sulphur and poor oil products produced are among the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining a crude oil import permit, the Teapot Refinery was able to import Omani and Russian crude oil with a low sulphur content, and the quality of its petroleum products improved.
According to the General Oil Company for Eastern Flame, “as the quality standards for petroleum products in China continue to improve, so does the capacity of refining equipment.
As a result, the quality of China's petroleum products exported abroad has gradually reached the same level as that of Japan (the world's highest quality).
According to JX Energy, “after the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia to compete with Japanese products in Asian markets.
Although Japan's “high oils” are facing a crisis, Japan's oil companies have only responded with a strategy of “exporting to profitable areas while paying attention to market conditions”.
Since China ' s exports of petroleum products have had a significant impact on Asian market performance, there is also a growing interest in teapot refineries.
In 2016, the Sunshine Assistance Initiative for the Yangzi Evening News was launched on 26 May, and after two months of registration, the total number of poor students applying for scholarships was over 800.
In the course of the study assistance, social contributions of more than 1.2 million yuan (in five volumes) have been received, which can help at least 240 students of the University of Dreams.
Contributions are still being made, and the newspaper calls on society to continue to reach out so that more children from families in need can receive financial support and social care.
In order to ensure fairness, openness and transparency in teaching aid, the newspaper has since now issued a series of notices on the basic information of the students, which are now being published under the supervision of the readers.
The Liam Sunshine Initiative, a prominent charitable brand in China, has been operating since 2003 in Jiangsu to help more than 4,000 poor students.
This activity is funded by the admission of students to higher studies in undergraduate studies, with no tuition-free specialization; merit and merit; and family poverty.
According to the Bureau of Statistics, the population growth in New Zealand previously exceeded 2 per cent of the “baby boom” population at its peak in 1974 and the early 1950s to 1960s.
As of June this year, New Zealand ' s net immigration inflows amounted to 69.1 million people over a 12-month period, which has been a major driver of New Zealand ' s population growth in recent years.
In addition, during the same period, the natural population growth in New Zealand was 28.2 million.
The data show that New Zealand ' s average annual net immigration inflows have been 21,800 people in the last 10 years, with a natural increase in the average annual population of 3.23 million people.
In terms of population structure, the influx of immigrants means that the proportion of the “working-age population” aged between 15 and 39 is gradually increasing.
During the 12 months to June 2016, New Zealand ' s working age population increased by 3.6 per cent to 1.58 million.
At the same time, the number of older persons over the age of 65 also increased by 3.6 per cent to 700,000.
Yesterday, at about 10 a.m., X9003 international cargo flights were taken from the new station in Xian to Almaty, Kazakhstan.
The departure of the train marked the successful departure of 10,000 vehicles by the Xian Railways since the launch of the Central Asian International Freight Line in 2013.
It is understood that the class of goods transported in this class covers industrial raw materials, mechanical equipment, industrial spare parts, construction materials, food, light products, and 206 varieties.
As of 11 August this year, a total of 221 and 1009 trains had been opened at the new station in Central Asia, with a cumulative shipment of 338,000 tons of export goods, of which 84 were in 2016, an increase of 47 per cent over the same period.
It is understood that the first shipments in the Central Asian class were “manufactured” and that it now attracts a large number of field sources.
By the end of July, Central Asian class containers had reached 64,000 mark boxes, an increase of 8 per cent over the same period in 2015.
With the encryption of the Central Asian class, the volume of cargo at the new Xian Railway Station has increased year by year.
In 2015, traffic at the new station amounted to 24.77 million tons of cargo through the year and, as at 10 August 2016, shipments had reached 1.53 million tons, an increase of 6.7 per cent over the same period last year.
In order to meet future development needs, plans have been put in place for the construction of a new integrated railway logistics centre in Xian, which is centred on a new station, with a major effort to modernize the new integrated railway logistics park.
An Indian uncle, who had just experienced an airplane landing last week at Dubai International Airport, won a $1 million prize in the same airport this week.
Muhammad Bashir Abdul Hidar, an Indian from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, is used to buying lottery tickets every time he returns.
His 21-year-old son was paralysed by an accidental fall 13 days after his birth, and he has worked hard to repay his son ' s medical loan.
“It was God who gave me a second life to escape from the crash, and he gave me this money to do good,” Hedar said.
Although it is now autumn, the power of the Autumn Tiger seems to be no less powerful than summer.
Ultraviolet not only darken their skins, but also sunburn their skins. How can they survive the training without sunburning?
SPF and PA are usually marked on sunscreen packaging, SPF being a sunscreen index for UVB UV, and our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50 etc.
Products marked with PA are intended for UVA, so sunscreens can be more effective, and usually PA strength is expressed in +, and an additional + indicates an extended effective protection time.
Oil-based skins should choose water protection supplies with a high permeability, and sun-proof spray is also a good option.
Dry skins should choose sunscreens of frost; neutral skins are generally not strictly regulated and any maintenance items on sensitive skins are a burden, and pure physical sunscreen products are recommended.
Remember to wear sunscreen half an hour in advance, as sunscreen products take time to fully penetrate the skin.
Military training days are long, sunscreens are polished every two hours in order to have a lasting effect, and it is important not to be lazy.
Since the skin has just been irritated by the sun, the army has been instructed not to immediately use white and white products.
After the military training, conditions can be used to cover the ice with towels for the burning skin of the town in order to slow the local heat.
Farmers who purchased agricultural machinery during the fair continued the policy of cumulation subsidies, with farmers receiving up to 40 per cent subsidy for the purchase of agricultural machinery.
The event was aimed at global outreach and, in particular, increased invitation to countries along the “one-way” route and to target market countries.
The exhibition sought to complete 60 contracting projects, introduce $22 billion in funds and conclude more than 160 trade contracts with a value of $3.2 billion.
According to the information received, for seven years in a row, the “Hong Kong Expo” had settled in the country because of its very strong manufacturing base and its long history of industrial development in the city of Loudy, Hunan Province.
As the host of the Expo, Lou has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
“The Expo” has become an important platform for local development of niche industries and for moving them out of the country.
In some nights, the ionosphere is full of free electrons, which means that radio signals can go further.
The U.S. Air Force is interested in copying this effect, as reported on the U.S. Mass Science monthly website on 11 August.
While the presence of a stable large number of free electrons in the ionosphere can help people listen to this radio station on the edge of a university radio station, it may not be the interest of the United States Air Force.
The electrons-filled ionosphere means that the radios used by the military have a greater reach and that it may provide some protection against solar storms for Global Positioning System (GPS) signals.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of Cube satellites on demand that can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
In the first place, however, the teams that contracted with the air force had to prove that the scientific principles in question would work.
Industry data indicate that the total size of coal production in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons, with a national excess capacity of 1.8 billion tons.
Over the past 10 years, the Department of State has issued five notices before and after phasing out excess and backward capacity.
Although the first four times did not target the coal industry, the target industry has a direct relationship with the coal industry.
Between November of last year and January of this year, the price of 5,500 kilocalories of coal on the island of Qin hovered for a long period of time at a low price of $370 per ton, leaving 90 per cent of the coal industry at a loss.
Coal prices have risen steadily since February, and recently the price of powered coal on the island of Qin has risen four consecutive weeks, rising to a 16-month high, once reaching $436 per ton, almost $70 more than at the beginning of the year.
As prices rebounded, there were fears that a small coal mine would resume work.
In response, Xi Xianming, Director of the Institute of Economic Studies of the China Institute for Reform and Development (Hiannan), analysed and interpreted it.
Qing Xianming: The elimination of capacity has attracted a great deal of attention from all sides, and today's published report card on the power of the coal industry is indeed a source of some concern.
These three surface factors are also a reflection of the relative lag in the shift in our growth patterns in the past, i.e. the fact that government-led growth patterns have not yet undergone a fundamental shift.
Second, it is also directly related to the advancement of local governments, where funding and accompanying measures are in place during the process of carrying out capacity-building, and where differences between regions do appear to be greater.
Thirdly, some provinces that are currently slow may be at greater risk if they are to catch up in the second half of the year.
In such cases, reliance on central award funds to advance the process of decapitulation may have a negative impact.
First, decapitulation is not a simple measure of volume control.
Our aim is to promote structural optimization through the phasing out of backward production capacity and to reshape the new industry in the coal industry as a whole.
In the process of deploying production capacity, it is important that local governments combine the transformation of the production capacity with the upgrading of the coal industry and vigorously develop the related services sector.
Secondly, if we are to complete this year's decapitation mission, we will also need to maximize the strength of administrative oversight and administrative oversight.
Finally, we would like to strengthen the play-offs of social security.
Since the market is directly related to employment, we need to strengthen job skills training for both employees and employees.
“The decline in the ranking is due to the expected deterioration in the development of Brazil's GDP in the medium term.”
Brazil ' s participation in global direct investment was 3.7 per cent in 2015, down from 5.7 per cent in 2014.
The Bank ' s international investment attraction index includes four sub-indicators: infrastructure, economic prospects, the business environment and direct investment volumes.
In 2015, Brazil ' s international direct investment was $64.6 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year in Brazil, the “greenfield investment” (the investment model for foreign investment plants) was $17.9 billion, a decrease of 2.1 per cent from the previous year.
“There are 288 `Greenfield Investment' projects in Brazil, compared to an annual average of 314 from 2003 to 2014”.
However, international direct investment in Brazil reached $33.8 billion in the first half of 2016, an increase of almost 10 per cent compared to the same period last year.
Original title: Canadian police killed supporters of IS: home-made bomb attack near the end of the city's preparations
The taxi company stated that the taxi had been transferred to Trevor ' s house before the police arrived.
In a press conference on Wednesday, the Canadian police indicated that they had received information, including a "satisfaction video" from the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the young man's intention to carry out the attack.
According to a German voice, a man wearing a black Balaklafa cap was reading the Koran, referring to crimes against Muslims, and vowing to attack a Canadian city soon.
In the video, he stated that the attack would take place within 72 hours and at a peak.
The incident was the first time that the police had killed a terrorist suspect before the incident, following the inauguration of the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, last year.
Tolls have been collected on 1 September for the upgraded Jinghangen branch of the canal channel, the Old Van Fu River and the North Great Leakway.
These two tributary routes are being built in the form of social financing, which has been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.
The old Van Fu channel runs through the gold fields and fish towers, entering the main channel of the Great Jinghang Canal via Lake Namyang, which is 32.5 kilometres long.
In accordance with navigational needs, the old Van Fu channel has been modified in a conservation and preservation manner, with deep dredging of the local water depths, stubbling of the local bends, etc., and improved navigation conditions.
The channel runs through the prefecture of Kim and the Qingtown area and enters the main channel of the Jinghang Canal via Southyang Lake for a total length of 19 kilometres.
The renovation of the two routes began in February 2011 and was completed in January 2015 with the construction and operation of the Anping Canal Logistics Centre in Jinning City.
In accordance with the principle of “loan construction, repayment of fees”, the Anping Canal Logistics Service Centre in Jinning city collects tolls on the route in accordance with the rates approved by the Provincial Price Office of Shandong.
Of this amount, base tolls are calculated at $1.75/heavy tonnage, and mileage tolls at 0.05/km heavy ton.
The toll was levied from 15 June 2016 to 14 June 2019.
According to the reporter, there are currently four toll lanes in Jinning, namely, the Su River channel, the White Ma channel, the North Great Leakway and the Old Van Fu channel.
The four canals, the tributary of the King Hang Canal, were upgraded by means of social financing.
The Susu Waterway Upgrading Project was the first to adopt a “Government + Market” model for the construction of the riverine infrastructure in Shandong Province, with the government taking the lead in investment and the social capital replenishment gap.
The sea lanes of the White Horse River, the Old Hail River and the North Great Leaking River follow a purely market-based approach.
The funds allocated by the State budget do not meet the construction needs and limit the pace of the upgrade of the course.
Social funding for the construction of public infrastructure is in line with national policies and serves as a means of defusing financial bottlenecks.
Ning Zeto's performance in the 100-metre free swim semi-finals has left many Chinese viewers speechless.
But in the 50-metre free swim premonition, Ninzawato has once again refreshed people's “bottom line”.
The fact that 50 metres of free swimming is not Ning Zetao's main item, his performance and best grades in the Kazan World Cup also determine that he is unlikely to make a breakthrough in this project.
As a matter of fact, the Grand Communiqué of Hong Kong ' s authoritative media revealed that the biggest cause of Ningzatao ' s loss was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many factors outside the scene may have had a great impact on his thinking about the future, and he may now be more interested in entering the entertainment world.
After the Kazan World Cup, Ning Zetao became red in an instant, thanks to his super-flame and good grades.
As a result, the terms “national husband”, “sweet meat” and “beautiful man” were constantly labeled on him.
All kinds of commercial activities come to the door, and the good money road becomes a golden path.
In such circumstances, Ning Zetao, even if he chooses to retire from the entertainment business at this time, is not only his freedom but also a seemingly viable path.
After all, he was 23 years old and, after a certain amount of study, he could do one or two television dramas on his own.
But Ning Zetao needs to see if he has sufficient qualifications to compare himself with his predecessors.
The 2000 Sydney Olympics, already 21-year-old Liu Xing, have come to the end of their athletes' careers.
Ms. Liu's appearance was quickly remembered and laid the foundation for her future entry into the entertainment business.
After the retirement, Liu Xing performed several television dramas and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tanya took part in the single-double-man 10-metre games of the two Olympic Games and obtained 2 gold and 2 silver.
However, after losing to our teammate Hu Jia in the 2004 Olympics single-man 10-meter race, Taomi's competitive position fell and was fired from the diving team.
And he and his daughter went to a variety of entertainment programmes like "Where Daddy goes" to make him an eyeful.
Former gymnastics gold generation Yang Wei, Lee Xiaoping and Chen Iixeng are high-profile participants in the various art programmes.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei Li Xiao Peng, who led China to the 2008 Olympic Boys League, was twice given a personal all-power gold medal, known as the All-power King.
Chen Ician, who led China to the 2012 Olympics, also became the King of the Rings.
And after the London Olympics had been misjudged to have lost the gold medal, Chen ' s massive move had also made him a huge fan of it.
But the main energy of these athletes is still on the playing field, and it's just like a dragonflake — running away.
However, both retired and active athletes need to be assured that they will be able to enjoy the benefits of the entertainment industry.
After all, athletes have embarked on a new field in which capabilities and connections are a vacuum.
Even for the “old people” who have been in the entertainment business for many years, such as Tayo and Liu, ordinary viewers mention them and think more about their performance at the Olympic Games.
Newcomers such as Yang Wai and Li Xiaojun, who were presented on the occasion of the festival, were all, without exception, Olympic champions.
In comparison with the above, Ning Zeto's title as a swimming championship champion is still slightly thin.
Moreover, the negative impact on the image of Ning Zetao would probably be incalculable if he were 23 years old and had suffered a setback in his sports career, compared to the success of others.
After all, when it comes to athletes, people are asking for “no battles, but no risk”, which is far from Ningzeto.
Ten thousand steps back, Ning Zetao is handsome and can count on face value to gain support for thousands of brain powders.
It's not as difficult as training to get what's supposed to be.
The path of life is one of personal will, but how it is chosen should be known in Ning Zetao's mind.
On the surface, social networking platforms expand the circle of communication and reduce people ' s sense of isolation.
The growing reach of cybersocialization has not only gradually replaced traditional telephone connections, but has even infiltrated the real life under the line and transformed the social life of the current population.
The benefits of online socialization are obvious, such as convenience and speed, and are therefore particularly attractive to young communities.
A survey of the social habits of university students shows that 57 per cent of university students use mobile phones for more than five hours a day and that daily life is largely “stopped”.
“Society networks are characterized by low cost, speed of transmission and simultaneous communication among many people, and meet the needs of contemporary university students.”
Broadening the circle of relationships, more equitable dialogue and avoidance of social concerns are the main reasons why we are talking more and more in love.
Newcomers who have just entered the company love to communicate with their colleagues on the line, “because they're not very familiar with each other, and they're much closer to each other through social networking forums”.
Friends-to-friends also communicate online, “when friends haven't been in touch for some time because of misunderstandings, then talk in a large group before they get back together.”
The IT engineer, Wu Xin, is an in-depth network social lover, and most of his social life takes place online, and the number of online contacts is several times higher than the number of people in the inner circle of friends.
Wu said himself to be more “waterful” on the Internet.
“A friend can be answered at his convenience, because there is a lot of discretionary time, and the expression can be made clearer.”
“I have avoided face-to-face interpersonal collisions by hiding under IDs, not only giving room for manoeuvre, but even giving each other more time and space to think and act.”
“People of different identities have the same right to speak and the same efficiency, and social concerns in real life seem to have been eliminated in cyberspace.”
A friend of Wu-Ning's thought, however, that Wu-Nin was a “fun-baby man” in life.
Peng and Ng Yi knew each other in a large group, as both speakers were active and quickly became acquainted.
Peng felt that if Wu and the Internet were two people who were bored with their words and did not express themselves, it would be a few words: “Huh, yes, yes”, or “I'm going to check this on the Internet”.
The mausoleum police are now involved in the investigation, and the mausoleum traffic department will intensify its efforts to combat the illegal operation of vehicles.
“The conflict police of 4 August has yet to investigate, and the taxis of two other drivers were smashed again at their place of residence on 11 August at around 0100 hours.”
“Most of the tricycles now operate illegally at night, and it is hoped that the competent authorities will also intensify their efforts to deal with them.”
Reporters from the South China Sea Network have learned from the Public Security Bureau of the Autonomous Hills County of the Bays that the police have received reports of both cases and that the causes of both cases, who committed them and whether they are connected are under further investigation.
Wang Wenyi, Director of the Traffic Control Station of the mausoleum water and transport department, said that the mausoleum transport department had begun to clean up illegal camps carrying three-wheelers at the beginning of the year and had banned 613 illegal camps carrying three-wheelers.
As a next step, the transport department will apply to the county government for joint multi-sectoral efforts to clean up illegally operated vehicles such as tricycles, motorcycles, black cars, etc. throughout the county.
On 11 August, at 8 a.m., a reporter from the Tsiru Evening newspaper followed the “Healthy China Line” medical service team to the village of Lake Town, West of the East Port Region.
The remote location of the village, approximately 24 kilometres from the urban area, and the presence of more than 200 households, due to economic, transportation and physical constraints, has made it difficult for many elderly and middle-aged patients to go out and visit the hospital.
The programme is comprehensive and includes internal medicine, surgical, respiratory, psychiatric, dermatology and paediatrics.
Many villagers were told that specialists were coming and had already been waiting in the small squares of the village.
67-year-old Mrs. Xue suffers from a congenital spinal curve, and in recent years she has been suffering from “asthma”, which has caused her to breathe even on the previous slope.
The doctor told Mrs. Xue that chronic bronchitis was not likely to be fully cured and that the usual adherence to medication could be alleviated.
At the dermatologist ' s clinic, an elderly person in his 60s came with her grandson for consultations.

The head of the conference jointly awarded medals to the second batch of “Sweet Hearts” private vehicle convoys.
Over the past 20 years, the Hearts of Love Mountain has written about the great love between the humans, and the former mountain fields have taken over and replaced five hardship units, placing almost a thousand people directly in the workforce.
In the face of every major disaster, the original mountain people spontaneously organized donations and extended a helping hand to society.

The Mayor of Rivas, Verfrido López, at the teacher training site, indicated that various institutions of the Government of Nicaragua were working together with the HKND Group to advance environmental management plans and implement tree planting activities.
The HKND group, which is the developer of the Canal Project, has always followed international best practice in building the Canal in accordance with international standards and in order to maximize the protection of Nicaragua's ecological environment.”
Through a combination of theory and practice, university students bring together primary and secondary students to plant trees and teach the next generation of Nicaraguans how to green the environment.
Francisco Reyes, Professor in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment of the National University of Agriculture of Nicaragua, was part of the entire team involved in the reforestation education project.

The news agency “Avesta” of Tajikistan quoted information from the central bank of Tajikistan that the rate of inflation in Tajikistan was 3.7 per cent for the first seven months of the year.
According to reports, the rate of inflation in the Tatmadaw for the first seven months of the year was 3.7 per cent, of which 0.6 per cent in July compared to 6 per cent in the recent year.
According to reports, the goal of the Tatmadaw is to keep the annual inflation rate at 7.5 per cent in 2016, compared to 5.1 per cent in 2015.
In addition, reports point to a certain discrepancy between the Government and the projections of some major international financial institutions with regard to the development of the country ' s economy and inflation in 2016.
According to the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development, growth in Ta ' a is expected to reach 7 per cent in 2016, and the country ' s inflation is also largely above that level.
The Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, on the other hand, gave different projections for the development of the Tajik economy and inflation in 2016.
For both indicators, the Asian Development Bank forecasts are 4.2 per cent and 7 per cent, the World Bank projections are 4.8 per cent and 7.5 per cent, and the International Monetary Fund projections are 3.4 per cent and 8.2 per cent.
According to the information received, despite a series of negative external factors, such as the international economic downturn, the devaluation of Russian roubles and the decline in remittances, the economy of the Tatmadaw had achieved 6 per cent growth in 2015.
On 11 August, when the journalist interviewed Huang Elin, who had returned to his home in Sichuan, she said: “It was too urgent and all I had in mind was to save people!”
Huang Elin is a student of the 2015 level of the Central and South Linco Grand Forest Institute.
Huang Elin, who studied urban and rural planning, wanted to study the local architecture in Sichuan. The family then went to travel.
On 8 August, at around 10 a.m., Huang Elin ' s father rested at the hotel, and the mother and daughter came out to visit the ancient city.
It was not far away, and suddenly a group of people shouted and went out out out of curiosity.
Looking at “The little boy has disappeared, the little girl has stomped in the water, her little head appears on the side of the river, sinking from time to time”, Huang Elin, who learned to swim as a child, jumped in a hurry to save his life.
After the water, Wong Elin, 165 centimetres tall, found that she couldn't get to the bottom!
It used to look calm on the surface, but there was a current down there!
But she still swims to the little girl at all costs.
According to Huang Elin, the river was thick and fast, less than five metres away, and almost all her strength was spent.
She tried her best to push the little girl to the dyke, "The slopes are particularly slippery, and I'm afraid I'm losing my strength."
As a result, Huang Elin requested help from her mother, heard her daughter's call for help, and Ms. Yoon, who was not well-watered, was prepared to go into the water and was stopped by tourists next to her.
On 10 August, Ms. Yoon was “accountable” when she received a lot of condolences and praises from relatives and friends, following the spread of Huang Yiling's escape from the river.
“It's true now that I am afraid. To be honest, my heart is breaking when the children are dying on the river's embankment, and they're begging me for help.”
Ms. Yoon said that, despite the danger, she would still support the daughter's choice and she was proud of her daughter if she were to be there again!
Since they were forced to do so, Huang Elin rarely took the initiative to come back into the water after learning to swim and “didn't expect this skill to be useful”.
According to Chief Chen Jian of Huang Elin's class, Huang Elin is a well-known “teacher” of Banari and is willing to help.
The opening ceremony of the first Youth Games in Yunnan Province, on the 13th, was a sign of youth.

Since 1 September, 60-64-year-olds have been able to take urban buses at a half-price.
On the morning of 11 a.m., at the IC card marketing centre of the Djinn city bus company, older persons who had been waiting for the card window were waiting for the card, and Master Yao, aged 62, received the old-age half-price card.
Previously, the Djinning City Committee on Ageing, the Municipal Fiscal Board and the Municipal Transportation Board issued a circular on the semi-priced use of urban buses by older persons aged 60-64, which was officially implemented on 1 September of this year.
“Eligible older persons may have access to IC marketing centres with a second-generation identity card; this benefit is also available to older persons who meet this age in a non-resident household.”
Liu Xia, Deputy Director of the computer centre of the Djinning City bus company, said that more than 200 old-age half-price cards had been put in place since the start of the operation on 1 August.

SMSs are sent in groups to a certain number, and even if they are not successful, they can be criminalized as fraud.
The People ' s Court of the Hoyong District of Namyang City, Henan Province, found that from 30 September to 4 October 2015, the accused, Li Xingwang, sent fraudulent information using pseudo-based station equipment in Yongpa County and in Namyang City District.

Northeast Tiger, currently listed as endangered (EN) species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Endangered Species.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, data from joint monitoring in 1998 by countries such as the United States of America and Russia showed that there were only 4 to 6 wild north-east tigers and 3 to 5 north-east leopards in Jilin Province.
According to the Chief of the Protection Service of the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, Changchun, the protection of wildlife has been increasing in Jilin Province in recent years, with the number of north-east tigers and north-east leopards in China growing significantly and the distribution of areas expanding.
The latest monitoring data for 2015 show that 27 wild north-east tigers and 42 north-east leopards were monitored in Jilin province alone.
Cooperation between China and the Russian Federation as the world ' s flagship wildlife conservation species in the region of the border between China and Russia is important for the recovery and reproduction of wild north-east tigers and leopards.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, a long-standing cooperative exchange mechanism has been established with Russia in Jilin Province.
The forest sector and animal conservation organizations of the two countries have once again reached a number of consensus at the 2016 China-China Forum on the Protection of the Chun-Hu Panthers, which concluded on 11 November.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, strengthening cooperation in the protection of tigers and leopards in China and Russia is not only an urgent task for the protection of tigers and leopards in China, but also an urgent priority for the health of the Russian tigers and leopards.
As a party leader, Sun Fook-jin lost his idealism and seriously violated the party ' s discipline, and the party ' s eighteen-year-olds remained silent, unstoppable and undisciplined, of a bad nature and in serious circumstances.
The social impact of this case, which became the focus of a number of media reports, was extremely bad.
Following the incident, the head of the criminal police unit of the Public Security Bureau of Haiguchi immediately attached great importance to the organization of a team of competent police officers from the branch to launch an active investigation.
The police immediately pursued the suspect online, took a variety of measures to locate him and, by contacting the police in the field, investigated the whereabouts of Wang's country.
As the suspect is a repeat thief, he has repeatedly been dealt with by the public security authorities, has a strong counter-detection capability and, together with his long-term drug use, is frequently subjected to interrogations and addictions, and interrogations are very difficult.
Greenland sharks, also known as small sleeping sharks, are widely distributed around Greenland and Iceland in the North Atlantic, reaching a height of 4-5 metres when they reach adulthood.
But they grow at an extremely slow rate, sometimes only about 1 centimetre in a year, which suggests that Greenland sharks may have the life expectancy of Foreign Minister Gertrude.
Traditional year-to-year methods typically use animal calcification tissues and some sharks can use fin ridges, but this calcification tissue is very rare in Greenland sharks.
New research led by Julius Nielson of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, turned to an eye crystallized Greenland shark for a radioactive carbon year.
This method was previously used to determine the age of whales, but for the first time to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis showed that the life expectancy of the largest shark was estimated at 392, with an error of 120 years.
This means that the shark is at least 272 years old and at most 512 years old.
In addition, female Greenland sharks are said to be about 4 metres long for their sexual maturity and converted to age, i.e. at least 156 years.
Researchers have therefore written in their papers that Greenland sharks are known to be the longest-lived vertebrates on Earth, surpassing the previous long-lived champions of the whales (211 years old).
Over the past year, the exchange rate of the renminbi has remained generally stable, and the foundation has been laid for the internationalization of the renminbi.
In terms of market performance, the two-way movement of the RMB exchange rate over the past year has been marked by increased exchange rate elasticity and the expected overall stability of the exchange rate.
To date, there have been repeated upwards and downwards fluctuations in the renminbi over a hundred points in the median value of the dollar, but the process has become counterproductive.
Last year's last transfer measure, prior to the 8/11 transfer, was implemented in 2005, with a significant appreciation of the renminbi against the United States dollar over a decade.
Since the introduction of the new remittance, the renminbi has changed its previous appreciation, with the median exchange rate depreciating by about 8 per cent over a year.
On 1 October this year, the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the renminbi as the weight currency of the SDR (SDR).
This week, the statistics published by the General Customs Administration of China show that, during the first seven months of the year, China ' s exports and imports totalled 13.21 trillion yuan, a decrease of 3 per cent over the same period last year.
In the month of July, China's total exports and imports fell by only 0.9 per cent per year, especially exports, which increased by 2.9 per cent per year.
The experts were of the view that, despite signs of stabilization of imports and exports in July, expectations should not be overestimated.
In July, China ' s total value of imports and exports was RMB 209 trillion, a decrease of 0.9 per cent over the same period.
Of this amount, exports of RMB 1.22 trillion increased by 2.9 per cent; imports of RMB 873 billion fell by 5.7 per cent; and trade surpluses of RMB 34.28 billion increased by 34 per cent.
Although total exports and imports have declined over the same period, there has been an increase in export data, which has also been the fifth consecutive month of export growth since March of this year.
Shanghai police captured more than 3,400 people for four months against 157 gangs.
In parallel with the investigation of the case, the police also pursued the recovery of the stolen property in excess of 33 million yuan yuan.
According to statements made by members of the gang, they entered Shanghai from the outside by means of a black car, then stepped out of the car and committed separate crimes, and then joined each other in a few hours and left together.
Suspects often used a building as a unit during the crime, using the exterior wall to break the window fence, to steal from the top to the bottom by “scanning the floor”.
The suspect in question had been handed over by the Xu-cheong Public Security Directorate to the Xu-cheong District Public Prosecutor ' s Office to examine and prosecute the case.
The police reminded the general public of the importance of locking the doors and windows of their homes when they go out and, in the case of the choice of windows to protect against theft, advised the public to choose hard steel.
In late August, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan will travel to Kenya to attend the Sixth African Development Conference, as reported by Voice of China News Night Summit.
The Conference on African Development, led by Japan, had been held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, and would therefore be the first to move to Africa.
In this regard, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan indicated that the convening of a local conference in Africa would help to draw attention to Japan in African and European countries.
In conjunction with Shinzo Abe ' s visit, according to the Joint News Agency, the Japan Democratic Party will send parliamentary delegations to the countries concerned.
It is no coincidence that Japan's “normal” path began in the early 1990s, and that the African Development Conference, launched by Japan, also began in 1993.
With 53 seats in the United Nations, Africa is an important ticket warehouse for the United Nations. If Japan wants to be “normal”, how can it abandon Africa?
Exchanges will also be held with national stakeholders on the response of extremist organizations, the “Islamic State” and terrorist activities.
The Western Group will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.
The Foreign Minister of Japan, Man-sung Arisaka, also recently stated his intention on the occasion of the African Development Conference before the United Nations Security Council.
On this occasion, Abe announced that, for the sake of stability in sub-Saharan African countries, 100 billion yen (approximately $6.1 billion yuan) would be provided over a five-year period.
It has been widely recognized by observers that Japan ' s generosity to Africa has been aimed primarily at two objectives: first, to increase Japan ' s sense of presence in Africa; and secondly, to gain the support of African countries on the issue of normality.
Japan's expert on the Yang Bojiang has analysed it as “politically, Africa, despite its relative lag, has a relatively large number of countries, so Japan has always considered it as the so-called `big ticket field'”.
Japan will not give up in the future, nor will it end its work in Africa and will continue to strengthen it.
On the economic front, because of Japan ' s relatively strong productive capacity, the domestic market is relatively limited, especially as domestic demand is currently relatively low in the context of the ageing of young children.
However, from Junichiro Koizumi 10 years ago to Abe 10 years later, Japan has repeatedly launched the usual “strikes” to return.
Japan's expert on Japan, Yang Bojiang, believes that Japan's usual intentions are obvious, but that the path to normality is bound to be difficult.
In order for Japan to achieve its goals, it must first establish relations with the neighbouring countries, in which it needs to adopt a correct attitude, whether in geopolitical or ethnic disputes or in historical awareness.
The Maritime Court of the Sea mouth opened a case in the morning to ensure the rights and interests of the parties involved in the sinking of the fishing vessel.
The relatives of the three deceased crew members arrived at the Maritime Court at 4 a.m. on 7 August to file an application for the preservation of property and the seizure of a suspected cargo vessel prior to the indictment.
After the incident, the suspect cargo vessel was detained by the Maritime Authority in Haiguchi Soo Ying Port to assist in the investigation.
Since the 72-hour detention period of the Maritime Authority expired at 9 a.m. on 7 August, the victim ' s relatives filed an application for the preservation of property with the court in the early hours of the seventh day.
At 4.20 a.m., the applicant filed an application for the preservation of property prior to the indictment, which was received patiently by the judicial police on duty.
The main event was chaired by Professor Cho today, Vice-President of the School of Political and Public Administration of Shandong University.
What are the challenges to governance posed by the globalization and integration of the world economy?
How can national governance adapt to a changing world?
At that time, Van der Schener will conduct a full-scale analysis of the above-mentioned issues.
Ph.D. in Law, Beijing University, Vanderchen, Deputy Director and Secretary-General, Centre for Global Governance Studies, Beijing University, former Director, Beijing Office, Cornell University, United States of America.

The opening of the Hong Kong Garden with the introduction of a new highlight of traditional practices, the 2016 Xianan Cultural Festival
Music with drums, traditional snacks, fancy decorations, scenes with crowds.
Hong Kong's largest Xilan victory was held in Victoria Park from 12 to 14 on the occasion of the 2016 Xilan Cultural Festival, hosted by the Hong Kong Congregation.
In addition to the continuation of the already existing “shunting contest”, the participation of the whole family in the “parents-battle-battle race” was added.
Not only is the history of Xinan culture presented in cartoon form, but there are self-profiling areas for the Xinan theme 3D, traditional snack areas and traditional handicraft mobile classrooms, which attract a number of young people and people from abroad.
A couple from France stayed at the event for almost three hours and experienced it in a mini-fashion mobile classroom.
"We found this special holiday online, so we decided to come and see it, and it was fresh."
They stated that, while France had similar festivals to those of its predecessors, the atmosphere was heavy and unlike here, there was music and food to learn traditional crafts.
She said, “In such a busy financial city in Hong Kong, such a large and organized ritual of worship for the ancestors can also be seen.”
“not only does it reflect the diversity of Chinese culture, but it also allows more people to learn about these traditional crafts and to inherit them.”
“We do not want to set up Xinan cultural festivals to be horrifying and to keep people from approaching them, especially young children”, said the event.
“We want to make young people aware, through the rejuvenation and organization of the scene, that what is behind the Xinan culture is the expression of good faith and gratitude.”
He also indicated that there were 24 teams involved in the “sunting competition”, which included not only community organizations but also a number of schools in which students participated.
It is known that the Hong Kong Tsing Lian Xin will be included in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage Directory in 2011.
On the night of 11 September, the Chinese National Kyoto Theatre travelled to Mexico City with the famous " White Snake Passage " , where it gave the local population an original juicy Kyoto dinner at the Ink National Palace of Fine Arts.
As a highlight of the “Year of Cultural Exchange in China and China”, from 9 to 23 August, the Chinese National Kyoto Theatre performed seven Kyoto plays in Mexico City, Mexico, as well as in five cities, including Córdoba, Ciudad Juárez and others.
The viewers followed the story of the White Snake, and the actors sang, and they smiled and ovated.
Marissa Jiménez Cajo, who watched the Kyoto play 15 years ago, was with her daughter at the end of the show.
“It was a wonderful performance, and I was impressed by the music, the lights, the stage performances and I felt it was necessary for my daughter to also learn about Chinese culture and the art of the Chinese Kyoto drama.”
The enthusiasm of the Mexican audience was impressed by the well-being of white actresses and young actors.
“I didn't think Mexican viewers were so passionate, I was worried about their ability to understand the story, but it was unexpected to see today that they were able to grasp the story plot and a lot of laughs.”
China's Ambassador to Mexico, Qiu Xiaoqi, said that cultural exchanges during this year's “year of cultural exchange in China and Latin America” played a positive role in promoting greater understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two countries.
Next year marks the forty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of the Chinese-Mino-Mino border, when more cultural exchanges will take place in both countries.
Liu Xigui went to Sanya to study double repair, double city, to raise the level of urban buildings.
In the morning, Liu Tsigui chaired a symposium to hear reports on the progress of the Sanya “two-city” pilot project and suggestions from the various departments concerned.
Liu Jigui has given full recognition to the phased results of the pilot exercise and to the good experiences and good practices that have been generated.
Liu Chigui stressed that Sanya must seize the opportunity of historical development and take the lead role in the economic and social development of the province, using the “two cities” pilot as an important tool.
It is important to play a leading role in raising the level of internationalization of international tourism islands, starting with a drop in detail, enriching international elements and building international excellence.
It is important to play a leading role in urban-rural integration and global tourism, to speed up the construction of niche towns, to integrate tourism elements into each project and to create tourist attractions in every village and town in Sanya.
It is important to play a leading role in Action 100 Days for Social Investment, to promote a number of major projects and parks, to ensure that high-quality projects are located and that the requirements of the initiative are put into practice.
The Secretary-General of the Provincial Council and the Sanya Municipal Council, Zhang Qi, Vice-Governor Wang Lu, participated in the workshop.
During his 14 years of sports career, Deng Yaping won 18 world championships and became the first person in the history of the Chinese Olympics to win four Olympic gold medals.
She was ranked first in the world for eight years in a row and the longest female athletes in the history of Ping-Pong.
On 26 September 2010, he served as Under-Secretary-General of the People ' s Daily News and General Manager of the People ' s Search Network Holdings Company, with a cadre at the central level.
She will join forces with Yu Minhong to build the country ' s first sports industry innovation platform.
China also has such a group of star coaches on its body: they have won countless glory for the country as athletes; after retirement, they have taught the lessons learned for many years to the later generations, training them to win the championship.
As the first world champion of Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yubin opted to take the whip.
From female coaches to male coaches to general coaches, Huang Yubin built an “Olympic Gold Regiment”, and even better team achieved 9 gold and 1 silver and 4 copper myths at the Beijing Olympics.
Since then, Tanyo has continued to advertise and, in recent years, has played such important roles as “Cowro” and “Rayfing”.
A lot of NBA players have proven their strength. But some people progress and others fall.
The performance of some players during each season has been reversed, whether due to increased age or time limits.
Of course, some “regression” may simply be a reduction in data, and the strength of these players may not decline.
Even though Wade remains one of the best trackbacks in the league, his performance in the bull should not be as hot as that.
The limited range of the rear range between him and Londo, with only 32.8 per cent of the three-point hit by the player Butler, will crowd them in the next season.
When the wind comes to the city, the Flash will have to give more power to Butler and Londo, and it is likely that he will choose the way to feed himself in the regular races.
The situation in Okafu was awkward, and as the first option for 76 people in the last season, he had to compete with Simmons and Nbid for time and rights in the new season.
The competition may not come quickly, Simmons will have to adapt to the NBA, and Embide will recover from the injury and illness as soon as possible, but it is still a question whether Okafu will be able to find a place in the 76-member Long March.
During the last season, 32 per cent of Okafu ' s score came from low-level attacks, which were higher than those of Coxins, Vuchevich and Brooke López, while his usage was also high at the top 40 in the Alliance.
As Simmons has demonstrated a remarkable front-loading potential, and Embide has a better figure for the NBA, it is unlikely that Okafu will be as strong as ever.
In the past two seasons, Thompson's usage has stabilized at the top of the Alliance, and these are the two best seasons of his career.
The problem, however, is that with Durant's arrival, Thompson's rate of use is bound to decline, and this is bound to affect his performance.
This effect will not only affect the number of hits, but will certainly be significantly reduced during the next season, which in some ways will make it less difficult for his opponent to defend himself.
Durant's arrival will definitely shrink the numbers of the warriors, but the most serious of them will be Thompson.
But that doesn't mean that the Tang Gods are downgraded, which is more like the sacrifice he made for the team as a whole.
Parker performed better than the data for the last season, not only because of the efficiency of his basket, but also because of his chemical reaction with Aldrich, which benefited the Stabbers.
Duncan retired, Ginobli announced another year of war, and the combination of GDP finally ended, as the youngest of the three, with little oil in the tank of the French running car.
With the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russellby James won more regular MVPs, and Jordan was the only one with more FMVPs than James.
Oh, by the way, James just brought Cleveland's first professional sports championship in the last 52 years.
James, who has come to the fourteenth season of his career, needs better physical security to prepare for the after season.
So, in the conventional race, James's data is likely to fall further, and he'll give Owen more weight, but he'll still easily be the top three players in the league.
“It is important to build on the talents learned from the country in Russia.”
On the 12th of local time, the President of the Federation of Chinese Expatriates in Moscow, Huang Jing, spoke with excitement when he saw Chinese and Chinese online journalists.
Not long ago, she attended a training course on Chinese talent (book law, painting) in Chinese cultural associations abroad, hosted by the Department of State's Office for Expatriates and hosted by the University of South China.
When he first attended the course, he knew nothing about where to draw the book, and he was able to draw and write his own work after the course had been completed.
When he returns to Moscow, he must make his own contribution to the dissemination and promotion of Chinese culture, using the knowledge and skills he has learned.
Yan Wei, Secretary-General of the Chinese Cultural Promotion Association of Russia, who also participated in the course, felt the same.
She said that she had made great progress with the help of the teacher of the training course and had also felt the burden of being “the overseas distributor of Chinese culture”.
Yan Wei said that when he returned to Russia, he would spread and promote Chinese traditional culture among Chinese and Chinese-loving Russians.
Today, at 19:35, during the 22nd round of the competition, the Chongqing sailground challenged Beijing ' s national security.
In the 29th minute, Wang Dynasty hit the door, in the 39th minute, New Aid Cardek overtaken the harvest with Fernando's help, and in the 81st minute, the country brought back one ball.
Ten minutes after the race, the bullsails were hit by a series of round-the-clock opportunities, and Fernando's small angles were pulled out of the line by the State's security line.
In the 15th minute, Zhang Hae-chul's midfield line spread, Ilmaz had stormed the restricted area, and Liu Woo, a single guard, had taken the first step to destroy the ball.
One minute later, Park Xiao Fei confiscated the ball when he opened fire in the middle of the restricted area of Dabao.
On the two-to-two right side of Fernando's road, the door was suddenly picked up in front of Caldock when he was plugged in by the Rayten Dragon, and the judge decided to point the ball and presented the Yellow Card to the Raytenlong.
On the 37th minute, the country's security was changed, Zhang Xiaobin went to the scene and Zhang Chi Ming went to fight against the old master.
In the no-go area of Caldock, where a low-altitude pass on the left side of Fernando's no-go area, Caldek swooped through the door.
And that's where Calderke gets the ball in the middle of the race, with 2-0 in the lead.
As soon as the second half of the game began, Fernando won any ball on the right by force, unfortunately hitting the door from a small angle.
After Deng Xiaofei was found to have delayed obtaining the yellow card, Peng Xinli, who had replaced it, also received the yellow card because of pre-prescription in the restricted area.
In the 56th minute, Zhang Ji Ming's internal cut was accompanied by Zhang Hae-chul's passing and his arc ball was blocked from the door by Deng Xiao Fei.
The Pre-Professional District of Liu was brutally looted against Kremetz, and he was given yellow medals with an emotional monarchy.
In the 63rd minute, during the attack on Fernando ' s right road, which was hit directly by Kremitz, Fernando was very unhappy with Kremitz ' s movements and Kremitz received yellow cards.
One minute later, Fernando showed up again on the right side of the road with the ability to run, and Dabao won the yellow card to follow the rules.
Ilmaz was forced to break through the no-go line and fell to the ground under Cheng Yuen's extended leg intercept, and the judge ruled on the ball, Ilmaz broke the door, and he swam 2:1 national security.
In the 86th minute, on Monday's right way, Sergeyev pulled off the ball in the middle of the restricted area, and Deng Xiaofei blocked the ball again with a brilliant rescue.
After four minutes, the two-to-one score was kept to the end of the road to prevail over the security of the nation.
After taking this valuable three points, the score is now 27 points for the sails, temporarily numbering 10 on the scoreboard.
Lehman will then serve as an expert for the Dekha Asia Media Partnership and participate in a variety of local fans.
It was reported that in the fall, Ambassador Lehman and Mateus of the UNC image would launch a legendary tour of Asia and the Americas on behalf of Deca, which would serve as outposts for the opening of the 2016/17 Satidaka.
The event, which will span two continents and cover four top cities, will heat up for the new season everywhere and with fans.
The Dicah League, one of the five European leagues (E.T.A., N.A., I.A., I.A., D.A., and F.A.), is a flagship event that the German sports community in the soccer kingdom has refused to allow.
As one of the most powerful leagues in the world, in the 2014 - 2015 season alone, Deca attracted some 13.3 million viewers to the field.
The representatives of Dekhaumen, Bainmunich, Dotmond and the famous players Thomas Muller, Ram and Gtze are well known in China.
In conjunction with the previously online microblogging, cooling and micro-letter platform, the Chinese side looks forward to providing Chinese fans with wider and more accessible access to the latest news of the tournament.
The British team won silver medals in a seven-man football game, and the Fiji team won gold medals.
In the finals of the seven-man football game on Thursday night, the British team failed to continue its outstanding performance in front of the Fiji team and was defeated by the Fiji team at the Rio Tiodoro Stadium at 43-7.
The Fiji team won the gold medal on the basis of its impeccable performance in controlling the ball, seizing it, evading it, collaborating, running and strength, which was the first Olympic medal in the country ' s history.
Silver is also a great comfort to the defeated British team, which was the third silver medal the British delegation won that day. This score is enough to make the British football team proud: they beat New Zealand all the way to the first seven-man football game in the Olympic Games.
Earlier that day, the British team won the South African team seven to five, which could have affected their state of play in the finals.
But in any case, the current Fiji team is enough to defeat a fully fledged 15-man team.
Tomorrow, at least one Englishman will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort to the British team, but it may not be. This Englishman is Ben Ryan, the head coach of the Fiji team from Wimbledon, who was the head coach of the British team.
It is not easy for the British team to achieve what it is today.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's teachings, they had not won the results of a seven-man international football game in Adelaide.
And now they're only one step away from the champion.
Although they had been hit hard, they had also made very impressive progress.
Fiji had taken the lead, leaving the British team helpless.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it's like bumping into a series of moving buses. When Osi Colliniso entered the Cape Flag Zone, the world championship team was already five to zero ahead.
Only four minutes after the race, Jerry Towley scored right-wing touchdown again.
Twelve to zero, the British hardly ever hit the ball.
Mitchell's powerful interdiction left Leon Nacalava, a giant in general, with no third score, but it merely slowed Fiji's score.
At seven minutes, Yassa Willeymaru hit the ground on the right corner. 17 to 0, the British team is getting worse.
The Karava score is one more, and the first half of the game is one minute away.
Then, Vatmo Rawovo broke into the British defense and went straight to the score line.
In the middle of the break, the score is already 29 to 0.
Fijians were born to play seven-man football, while the British team was still the first to emerge.
That is the case.
The British team made a huge change in the second half of the game and hit the Fijian defense line for four minutes, which was good enough in the first half. But then the Fiji team joined forces, and Joshua Tuesova scored again.
Dan Norton created an opportunity for the British team to score, changing the score to 36-7 on the left corner, but the race was already under the control of the South China Sea island nation, with fans singing loudly on the platform, waving flags and dancing songs.
The excellent performance of the Fiji team has made it necessary to clapping.
At the end of the day, Mata William stopped an unimportant attack by the Fiji team.
The final whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged together, and the defeated British team left only to regret.
Earlier that day, the Fiji team defeated the Japanese team by 20 to 5 in the semi-finals, while the United Kingdom managed to win the South African team in a fierce semi-final.
In the first half, Kyle Brown helped the South African team take the lead, but in the second half, Dan Norton broke the door with excellent footing.
After that, Antony's brother Marcus Watson of England secured the team's victory with a brilliant intercept, and eventually the British team won the silver medal.
Helen Graves and Heather Stanning, inspired by their cancer coach, won the gold medal.
It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most moving piece of gold.
From the first rowing to the present, Helen Graves and Heather Stanning have been trained 220 times in punitive pull, and the gold medal they seized in Estacio da Lagoa is of even greater significance.
Although only two of them were the rowers, the voice of one of the men on board — Coach Robin Williams — was always accompanied by their impact on the second consecutive female pair of Olympic gold medals, the first English pair of women to reach this height.
They have maintained 39 undefeated records and have had an absolute advantage.
What we are seeing is that these two talented athletes walk in grace on the surface, but that is not all of this victory.
There are many volunteers behind each of the medals, and it is their constant dedication that has created a difference, and none of this can help more than a coach who learned 30 months ago that he was suffering from cancer and did not know whether he could live to see the day.
As he had said, death could come at any time.
I had bladder cancer, and they operated on me.
If we don't operate, the cancer cells spread to the whole body.
In that way, the situation would be much worse.
It's gonna change your mind a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he began treatment in early 2014, minimizing the impact, although it may not be appropriate to say so in this context.
I need to get paid, so I have to get better.
It's an incentive for me.
I live in the hospital, and although they say a few steps is enough, I walk around the ward 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time.
That is the starting point for everything.
The sport itself is a journey, which makes the journey a little longer.
At the moment of the gold harvest, they first thought of Williams. This morning Williamsby talked a little bit, in order to overcome his anxiety.
When Stanin, who was the head of the Royal Artillery Corps, went to Afghanistan, she said, “I'm in a bad mood this week and may be a bit extreme, but this gold medal does mean a lot.”
It has repeatedly told me how important this is to me, how hard I, Helen and Robin have worked.
That's what Helen, Robin and I have been trying to do for three years.
Without Robin, we're just nobody. Thank him very much. He's the best coach in the world.
I can't find better trainers and coaches than him.
Helen Grave and Heather Stanning have not lost in five years.
The punishments imposed on the combinations were incomparable to their opponents.
Even at the last 500 metres, even as New Zealand and Denmark moved closer, Stanin and Grave still had large physical reserves.
It was quite a shock.
Helen says, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is indeed very important not to be influenced by rivals.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not expect to do anything dramatic.
We didn't think about the glory of today, we just wanted to row every oar and win the race, and we did.
It took a year for the combinations to determine their own future.
Graves will marry Steve Bucksall next month as a television explorer.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say this is my last game.
It's putting too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It's a whole new experience, and I'm very nervous.
It has now been about four minutes.
She said, "I feel better."

Snapchat's vibe effect is blamed on Asians for sarcasm.
Snapchat indicated that the filter was automatically inspired, but some observers considered it to be racial in nature.
The 150 million daily users of Snapchat can change reality and make people look ridiculous through their filtering tools.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in a Roy Lichtenstein.
These lenses have the effect of passivating and bending characteristics, generating more than 30 million self-records modified on a daily basis.
Any mistake will be immediately brought to the attention of the public.
The Snapchat lens had been criticized for encouraging black people to play or for being beautiful in white skin.
Thus, when this week the application provides some users with a filter that creates the effects of slashed eyes, weird teeth and pink face, some commentators refer to it as racial irony against “yellows” in Asia.
They even considered whether these recurring issues meant that the company had greater problems with its diversity.
After Snapchat indicated that it had deleted the feature, the Wednesday report of The Verge and Motherboard provoked anger.
The company explained that the filter was a tribute to the moving role rather than a sarcastic Asian.
For observers who have experienced racism, however, the filter reminds them of the harmful stereotypes of reality.
Others are also strongly opposed to these moving images.
In an e-mail, a Korean-American artist who tweeted about the photos and was widely shared said that the filters were “at least painful and uncomfortable”.
She also said, “It is very difficult to distinguish between the extremely disgusting image of Asian sarcasm and the effect of the filter.”
Although the filters are not exclusively yellow, yellow people are extremely devalued.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches these cultural bottom lines.
From company boards to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, it seems that American culture has been promoting diversity and inclusiveness.
The large youth group of Snapchat may be very sensitive because it is more racially diverse than the older generation.
When a filter in Snapchat created an insulting image of the user, 25-year-old Chu Kaiti said in a Thursday interview: “This kind of thing is more difficult to escape than it was before.”
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, who was a product manager and engineer in Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article and a telephone interview for Medium, she stated that she believed that the ethnic controversy reflected the lack of ethnic diversity in the recruitment process of Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company ' s employees, most of whom were white, and the leadership, all male, and added a label at the end of the article: #DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese American, Ms. Chu said: “ Either their employees are not of all colours, so that they can make such a decision, or some of their employees are of all colours, but their positions do not allow them to speak freely.”
Other observers shared her complaint that she had not been responded to by Snapchat.
The company did not publish data on the diversity of its employees and stated that it was a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of his staff, but one speaker stated that the company had recently hired a recruit to focus on the low-level internal population and promote internal inclusion.
Ms. Chu said that she would close her Snapchat account: “I wonder if they need more users like us against this act”.
According to the Congressional team, military officials distort ISIS intelligence
In a report released on Thursday, a Congressional team noted that officials of the United States Central Command had changed their intelligence reports to describe the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than it was on the ground.
The midterm report comes from a special working group formed by the President of the Republican Party, the Military Committee of the House of Representatives, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Sub-Committee of the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee. The report states that there is “a wide range of dissatisfaction” among Central Command intelligence analysts who say that their superiors are tampering with their assessment of the war between the United States and the Islamic State.
Central Command (Centcom), located in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news article on the report, “information that has been reviewed by the senior leadership of the Central Command is more optimistic about the description of United States counter-terrorism operations than is actually the case and has always been more optimistic than analysis by other intelligence agencies”.
The representative of the Republican Party of California said, “The behavior of the Central Command is unacceptable. On the one hand, our fighters suffer from war, and on the other hand, high-level policy makers get wrong analysis.”
The question of the leadership of the Central Command extends to the highest levels of the Agency.
The report details the long-standing problems of the Central Command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing the training of the Iraqi army by the United States.
Although there is no conclusive evidence that high-level officials of the Obama administration have ordered changes to the reports, according to their description, these analysts feel pressured by the leaders of the Central Command to express more optimistic views on the threat posed by the Islamic State (ISISIS or ISIL).
According to the report, “in the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and parliamentary testimony were far more optimistic than they were on the ground”.
For example, an official of the Central Command has publicly indicated that a major military operation could take back Mosul as early as April or May 2015.
The second largest Iraqi city, Mosul, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
In a statement, the representative of the Republic Party of Kansas, Mike Pompeyo, said: “This result has become apparent after months of investigation”.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most of the high-level intelligence officers of the United States Central Command manipulated the Command ' s intelligence products and concealed the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq.
After learning from the analysts that intelligence concerning the Islamic State had been manipulated, the Republican Party set up a special working group.
As the investigation continues, more will be discovered after the report is released on Thursday.
The Attorney-General of the Ministry of Defence has also conducted a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
Members of the Democratic Party of the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives published their findings on Thursday, which are in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
The Commission's Democratic Party leader, Sheanda, stated in a statement that, between 2014 and 2015, the Central Command had developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessments of the Islamic State and Iraqi peacekeeping forces.”
According to Mr. Sheanda, the process “impedes the dissemination of information”, reduces the morale of analysts and “cannot accept differences of opinion”.
However, Mr. Sheanda and the Democrats also stated that they had found no evidence that the White House was trying to exert pressure on the analysts of the Central Command, so that their conclusions were consistent with “pre-set or political narratives”.
The Beast Daily reported on the preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation on Tuesday.
In August last year, the New York Times reported that the Prosecutor General of the Pentagon had opened an investigation after receiving a complaint from the central headquarters analyst.
In a statement, the Pentagon spokesman, Navy Major Patrick Evans, stated that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on this parliamentary report until the investigation by the Attorney-General had been completed.
He stated, however, that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security topics”.
The impact of the investigation has exceeded the success of the United States-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria (as claimed by an increasing number of Defense Ministry officials).
Last year, however, these claims called into question the extent to which President Obama could trust the assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas issued by the Central Command.
The criticism of ISIS intelligence is reminiscent of the controversy over more than a decade ago, when the Central Command intelligence analyst, Gregory Hook, wrote a research article in which it was stated that George W. Bush's Government, despite the opposition of many analysts, insisted on sending small troops to Iraq and gave little consideration to the situation following the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hook played a key role in this campaign against Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials stated that Mr. Hook ' s team had come to the conclusion that the air strikes against ISIS oil refineries had not significantly reduced the economic revenues of terrorist organizations, which had built temporary refineries and continued to sell oil on the black market, in contrast to the statements made.
According to the Times Weekly report in September, the Central Command did not publish the discovery.
When many lawyers reviewed Senate testimony about overly optimistic assessments of the war, the Commander of the Central Command, Lloyd Austen III, was criticized last year.
General Austen retired in April and is currently being replaced by Joseph Waters at the Central Command.
The U.S. has won four consecutive victories in the Women's Hockey Competition, and it's going to win against the U.K.
Katie Bam, the only three-dollar winner in the six-to-one victory over Japan, took the lead for the American Women's Hockey Team twice on Thursday, helping the American team to beat the Indian team by 3-0.
Two games with five balls could have been amazing, but 27-year-old Bam had indicated that she did not know that she had performed so well.
She said, “I don't know anything about it.”
I'm not the kind of guy who remembers how many balls he made.
What she knew was that the United States team had won four consecutive games at the Olympics and would be number one with the British team that had failed after winning the Japanese team by 2 to 0 on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States met on Saturday at the last round of the game.
Both teams will be promoted to a quarter final, which will determine who will appear as the first team.
The team that gets the team first will avoid encountering a strong Dutch team, thus making it possible to go further. The Dutch team will be on the line as the other team first.
In Saturday's game, the American team made a miracle with amazing performance. You know, at the London Olympics four years ago, the American team was down in 12 teams.
Bam was in that team at the time.
Bam grew up in Brubel, Pennsylvania, and first picked up a hockey stick when she was three years old (her twin sister did this in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming the youngest national team ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympic Games because she was unable to be elected to the final list.
In 2012, neither she nor her teammates were well received.
The following year, the British, Craig Panham, became the coach, and everything began to change.
According to Bam: “This is a change in culture, mentality and substance”.
We had not reached the current level in London at that time.
We've come a full turn.
On Thursday night, Bam pulled his head out in the first half of the field with a close reflection.
India has not yet won the game, but this team has shown remarkable perseverance and has kept the score of 1-0 near the end of section III, when Bam broke out.
She travelled long distances along the left side of the field with the ball, then cut inside to the middle, pumped into the net, and the United States team was two to zero ahead.
Melissa González hit the last ball in the middle of section IV.
For the first time in the game, the American counterpart, Jackie Briggs, was a zero-hatting opponent, and in the first three victories, each played a single ball.
This time she's exaggerating.
Bam, too.
Panam says, "We're in good shape right now." But it depends on the results of the Saturday game.
A cold food during the Great Depression.
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had just been elected President, sat in his office for lunch.
As a cuisine, President Roosevelt likes to eat on Fifth Avenue, such as foie gras and salmon stew in Maryland.
On that day, his menu was very simple: ketchup devil's eggs, mashed potatoes and pastries as snacks.
“This is to share the suffering of those who are suffering with food”, Jean Zigman said.
Her husband, Andrew Ko, added: “It also reflects the way Americans eat.”
The couple living in the Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Mr. Ko's last book, Buffet, was about American Chinese food, while Ms. Zigman, in her book, orchard 97, described the lives of slum tenants through food.
The book they co-authored, The Big Meals, will be published by Harper Press on Tuesday, describing the food history of the United States during the Great Depression.
After showing a common view of food, they met a journalist at Eisenberg's sandwich store, a simple lunch counter in the iron district that had been open since the collapse of the economy in 1929.
A 54-year-old Ms. Ziegler ordered a creamed cheese with a broken olive sandwich, while a 57-year-old Mr. Ko ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The press ordered a baked roll, which the couple considered fit to discuss during the Great Depression.
Ms. Ziegler said: “Bread was very popular at the time.”
There were peanut bread, liver bread, soy bread.
They are all made of a raw material and a cheap rinse that can be poured on the raw material.
Imagine, your dinners are peanuts.
Mr. Cobb's got a weird face.
He said, "They must be like lead in your stomach."
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, the Americans were serving buffets, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cook for male farm workers and have fresh pies for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
In the First World War, it was the Americans who gave food to the hungry Europeans. The Great Meals documented how the country suddenly stopped becoming a rich place.
Mr. Ko explained why he and his wife had to write this book: “Food had become the main topic of discomfort for Americans at the time”.
Another unpleasant topic was that of new foods that were sour: “frozen foods”, such as bread and stew, became the main dish, which was the “best way to cook leftovers”, as Ms. Ziegler said, because cooks could use butter from the sauce to hide the bad food.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat that has been leading the American table for many years has become a rare luxury.
Strange groceries consider calories only, and nutrition is the first to be considered than the taste or even the basic common sense of cooking.
In the course of studying the book, including various recipes, Ms. Ziegler produced a roasted onion filled with peanut oil.
Mr. Ko said, "This is not common at dinner tables."
Ms. Zigman said: “It's too strange”.
Peanut oil and roasted onions are simply not compatible.
This is characteristic of many family economic meals.
Family economists influence the country ' s eating habits, such as Louis Stanley and others, who served as chefs of the Federal Bureau of Family Economy from 1923 to 1943, which is unprecedented in history.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines to encourage women to “tell carefully” and to be brave in turning bad foods, such as pasta and carrots, into good food.
The Great Meal is a rich “historical treasure”.
Particularly interesting is the government’s response to hungry people, such as the President’s citizen Herbert Hoover’s “I can’t do anything about others” attitude.
Although he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse as a child, his diet was as delicate as that of a millionaire.
Mr. Ko said: “He likes to eat European foods, such as cucumber with fish”.
He was wearing a tuxedo and eating in a gold-plated restaurant.
He was apparently separated from the people.
If his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example on the diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As this book says, Ms. Roosevelt's butler has no interest in the taste, so the White House “food is not only the worst food in Washington, but also the worst food in cooking”.
As soon as the United States returned to formality, many of the cooking methods during the Great Depression were abandoned.
Ms. Ziegler said that what remained was our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking.
This means that, in writing this book, they learned more about Ms. Zigman ' s mother ' s eating habits, such as how she did not throw away her food.
Mr. Ko said: “She is very afraid of wasting her food.”
Ms. Zigman recalled: “She actually made many people sick.”
For example, there was an incident with "Cream Bubbles".
After removing the plate, she and Mr. Ko pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: this was the fruit pudding that President Roosevelt had at lunch.
Ms. Zigman said: “It's called creamed fruit, and added that the name of a new wave for a normal dish is “the usual trick”.
There is no cream in this dessert, but only fruit, flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
And it's hard for all of us to make the picks go deep into the sticky brown paste.
Surprisingly, this dessert tastes good.
Mr. Ko ate a second and a third.
He thought it was an acceptable dessert, and he said to his wife, "It'll be better to have a piece of walnuts."
Unfortunately, the latest monthly OPEC report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, with Saudi production rising even further.
The report does not prohibit the market from questioning the credibility of OPEC, and the road to a recovery in oil prices is likely to remain thorny.
On Monday this week, the OPEC Chairman-in-Office and Minister of Energy of Qatar, Al-Sada, indicated that OPEC would hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on 26-28 September.
The monthly reports published by OPEC on Wednesday show an increase of 46,000 barrels per day in July for the entire OPEC organization, including Gabon, up to 3.31 million barrels per day.
OPEC also stated in its monthly report that low crude oil prices have led global refiners to produce more refined oils, thus increasing market oversupply.
As a result of this information, combined with the projected increase in crude oil production in the United States and the unexpected increase in crude oil stocks, international oil prices fell for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday, the price of light crude oil futures delivered by the New York Commodity Exchange in September fell by 2.48 per cent, while the price of London Brent futures delivered in October fell by 2.07 per cent.
Reuters is of the view that the proposed oil-producing countries conference is unlikely to result in a clear tightening of supply, and that the data published by the United States Energy Information Agency also depress the market.
On Wednesday, the official Iranian news agency Fars, citing a statement by the Iranian oil minister, Zangane, stated that Iran ' s daily crude oil production amounted to a maximum of 3.85 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
Immediately after the news of the meeting, Russian Minister of Energy Novak stated that there was no need for a new round of frozen negotiations under oil prices.
The last meeting of oil-producing countries had been held in April, and OPEC member States had been unable to agree on any measures.
According to the BMIResearch Oil and Gas Analyst, Emma Richards, the market and media may have overreacted to the forthcoming OPEC conference.
Helima Croft, head of the Grand Commodity Strategy of the Royal Bank of Canada, said that OPEC would change the mood in the market by releasing signals that they would facilitate the agreement.
It's like a smoke and mirror that distracts people's eyes.
According to Eugene Weinberg, the head of bulk commodity research at German commercial banks, OPEC was considered to have a low probability of attempting to stabilize the market through the September conference.
This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, after all the organization's “wolves come” once.
Medical advertisements for violations of the law, the centralization of complaints, and medical institutions that have been repeatedly sanctioned have been the focus of spot checks.
In due course, the National Board of Health and Planning and the National Directorate of Chinese Medicine will organize monitoring of the performance of special monitoring inspections in selected provinces.
According to the media, the current homogenization of products has become a serious problem as a result of the massive influx of capital into Internet medicine, the tide of investment has dwindled and capital has entered the wait-and-see period.
Also, according to data from the Alipei Hospital Management Research Centre in Hong Kong, Internet medical companies lost a large number of lives in one year of entrepreneurship, and about 20 per cent of start-up Internet medical enterprises ceased to exist.
However, as most Internet-based medical enterprises struggle on the A or B financing path, several of the leading firms in the subsector still have access to capital.
It appears that Internet medical entrepreneurship must not be “a beehive”, but rather depends on the needs of the quasi-market, and is so focused and deep.
Fish jumps of 120.0 million yuan, or 40 per cent of the registered capital, and Kyushu public equipment companies of 180.0 million yuan, or 60 per cent of the registered capital.
In recent years, the electronic, integrated supply chain management system has gradually entered hospitals at all levels, with national policy support in the area of health information.
This jump in cooperation with Kyushu Chase was an opportunity to seek more cooperation by targeting market demand and helping hospitals to build up advanced supply chain management systems.
Unlike many Internet-based medical companies, iBaby has been focusing initially on the vertical area of Internet obstetrics, in which pregnant mothers and doctors are working.
Pregnant mothers have access not only to a competent doctor on a 24-hour and one-to-one basis free of charge, but also to a doctor-in-charge.
At the doctor ' s level, iBaby breaks the geographical limit by organizing micro-teaching sessions for grass-roots doctors on-line, peer-to-peer exchanges, case discussions, etc.
Currently, there are three sections at the doctor ' s end, one for continuing education of doctors, one for socialization of doctors and one for help of doctors.
Provision of services such as online learning, case discussions, academic exchanges; social networking platforms with hospitals, with clinicians; legal assistance, entrepreneurial support, etc. needed for patient relationships or personal life.
According to media reports, King CEO recently stated that Ali's health was “willing to sink” to take down the big health data.
Internet companies and data companies lack professionalism and are not uniform in their writing methods on the same phrase.
Ali is currently organized into three sections in the field of medical health, namely, Ali ' s Health, the Catalogus and the Future Hospital.
Wang told me that medical and health-care start-ups are harder than any other business: “This is not just about how much money it costs, but it's about how much it costs, and it's about how long it takes to be lonely.”
It's easy to break the heart to stay up all night watching the Olympics.
The Brazilian Olympics were held in the middle of the night, even when the event was broadcast in the country, and many citizens stayed up to watch it.
In this regard, the doctor particularly warned of the health risks associated with staying up late for the event, which may lead to cardiovascular disease.
If the hormone stays up for long periods of time, it will remain highly secretive, the human body will remain in a state of tension and tension, unable to recover normally, and prone to a contraction of the blood pressure and an increase in cardiovascular disease.
In particular, he warned that groups with high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood fat, smoking habits, family history and other cardiovascular risk factors are more likely to cause cardiovascular disease if they stay up late in the night.
If staying up long enough, not only cardiovascular functions will be affected, but also gastrointestinal functions, immune systems, neuroendocrine systems and even the risk of tumours will increase.
In the case of older friends, he advised that he should try not to stay up for the Olympics, especially for groups with a history of cardiovascular diseases.
During the last “World Cup” football game, Han Chi-won had a patient in his 60s, whose heart infarction was triggered or linked to the night watching the game.
He reported that, since the beginning of the year, his office had received patients with myocardial infarctions or strokes at the age of 25, largely as a result of the patient ' s long-term overnight lifestyle.
1. Not to stay up late every day and occasionally stay up late to watch the favorite sports items, other items may wait until the next day to see the event resume.
2. Staying up at night is timely to replenish water and eat more fruit in order to prevent vascular congestion and increase the immunity of the body.
On 12 August Beijing time, it was reported that the women ' s 50-metre rifles at the Rio Olympics in 2016 had come to the finals in three positions, and that China ' s old General Durie had won bronze medals.
Durie became a four-year-old member of the Olympics, and four Olympics were awarded two gold and one silver and four bronze medals.
In 1998, a shooting team from Shandong Province joined Coach Wang Devon for professional shooting training.
In June 2003, the gold medal of the 10-metre air rifle for women participating in the World Cup and breaking the world record with a 504.9 ring.

In August 2008, gold medals were won in the 50-metre sport rifle game with a total score of 690.3 around the Olympic record.
In August 2012, after the London Olympics, Durie filed a request for temporary retirement with the International Shooting Union.
In January 2015, Durie announced a return to the national team to begin training in preparation for the Rio Olympics.
In March 2016, the Rio Olympics selection competition was concluded, and the women ' s 10-metre gas rifle Olympics were eligible for re-election eight years later.
On 6 August 2016, during the Rio Olympic women ' s 10-metre air rifle race, Durie won a silver medal with 207 rings.
On 12 August 2016, bronze medals were won in three positions for women ' s 50-metre rifles at the Rio Olympic Games.
The film, which is expected to be broadcast on central television and music premiere early next year, will also be launched for the first time in the VR panorama.
The documentary Polar is a large-scale work focusing on the planet ' s third polar highland, presenting a new perspective on the convergence of Tibetan traditions with modern times and the interaction of Tibet with the world.
The greatest advantage of VR works is the unique sense of film “immersion”, which also imposes higher demands on the filming process.
The production team of the VR special edition of the Polar Panorama stated that they had to ensure that every image in every location was impeccable and gave the audience a sense of being present.
On 11 August, a special combat sniper, organized by the Sandong Smoking Unit of the Armed Police, came to Mount Kunjong to carry out training in the jungle at a temperature of 34 degrees Celsius.
During the cold war, the Soviet Union brought missiles into Cuba, almost leading to a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.
This incident was seen as the culmination of the cold war, known as the “Cuban missile crisis”.
But it is little known that, also during the cold war, a strong solar storm was in danger of causing the United States to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, which was only announced for the first time by researchers on 9 August.
On 23 May 1967, a strong solar storm severely disrupted United States military radar and radio communications in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the United States ballistic missile early warning system and are used to monitor Soviet missiles.
The paper, completed by researchers from the University of Colorado in the United States, interviewed United States military personnel who were involved in the forecasting and analysis of the Sun at that time and consulted non-confidential literature.
It was written that, in the 1960s, in order to prevent a sudden nuclear war in the Soviet Union, the United States Air Force always had a segment of its warplanes with nuclear warheads flying in the sky.
The U.S. military commander did not know that the main cause of the interference was a solar storm, not the Soviet Union, and ordered the aircraft to be ready for combat.
Fortunately, the solar activity of the United States military, which began in the late 1950s, and its study of Earth ' s electromagnetic interference, ultimately prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the United States Air Force Aviation Meteorological Service and submitted a detailed report.
As a direct consequence of this solar storm, the United States military has since considered space weather to be a combat concern and has established a stronger space weather forecasting system.
During their daily travels, citizens find that a car of love is blocked by a strange vehicle and, in the absence of contact with a strange vehicle driver, they can use a “micro-move” function to solve this problem.
On 11 August, the “MicroMove” service was launched by the Xian Traffic Security Service, the “Xian Traffic Police”.
With the introduction of this service, in everyday life, citizens who find themselves in a situation where an unknown vehicle hinders the movement of their vehicle in the absence of the driver, can solve such problems by using a “micro-move” function.
This new service function is one that is fast and saves administrative costs; two that respects and protects the privacy of citizens; and three that is full-time, round-the-clock.
It is very easy to operate on its own, as long as the citizens have a small trust, in a way that makes it easier for both parties to move vehicles to meet each other more amicably and easily, to ease parking problems and to reduce the incidence of traffic-related security cases.
On the other hand, with respect to owners of vehicles who refuse to move, illegally park or obstruct movement, the Xian Border Service indicated that the traffic police would then take different measures, depending on the circumstances of the case, to deal with them as appropriate.
On 9 August, more than 10 young employees of the Commercial Lo Power Company came here in the cultural tourist area of the town of Suhuahua, in Tianfung County, to carry out a special event on the theme “The city of Toyogu is full of electricity” and our festival of the 7th of July.
In the context of the construction of spiritual civilization, the Commercial Løj Electricity Company, Tang Fong County, has actively organized a special event on the theme of “Emergency in the City of Aoyagi” and our festival of the 7th of July.
The employees of the companies participating in the event stated that “their main focus is on work and learning, and there is a lack of time and a platform to communicate with colleagues and friends”.
“This company has given us such an easy, happy and harmonious platform, which I very much like, meaningful and interesting.”
The 7pm event was widely well received by the youth workers on the ground, and it was hoped that the company would organize more such events in the future and increase communication and communication with a wider range of young people.
The high-profile male champion of the Beijing Olympics, the Spanish star Nadal, had two rounds of victory in the male contest that day, and the male pairs had also advanced to the finals.
The three-line strike was a good one for the Olympics, as the golden ruler, Nadal, who was wounded and left unrepaired.
He and his teammate López will compete for gold medals against the Romanian contestants Tekau and Megja in the male duel.
The Rio Olympic Women's List project experienced the withdrawal of many seed players and, after several days of intense competition, all emerged on the 11th day.
Kovitova will compete with Puig for a final ticket, while another final seat will be created between Keith and Kobel.
All four of the female pairs were formed, and the semi-finals were: Singis/Basinsky vs. Herdka/Hravakova; and Makarova/Vesenia vs. Strikova/Safarova.
The mixed-twin match of the day was also the best, but the fall of the first seed, Maho/Gascia, and the fall of the Nanbeans match made the mixed-twin competition a little bit less colorful.
On 27 April 2015, the United States and Japan jointly launched a new edition of the United States-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines in New York, which allowed Japan ' s armed forces to play a more offensive role globally.
This was the day when the United States Secretary of Defense, Carter, the United States Secretary of State, Kerry, the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Man-sung Akida, and the Japanese Secretary of Defense, Nakagawa, attended a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth time that the Chinese civilian think tank has published a Japanese military force assessment report and the fourth time it has been launched in English.
The report consists of nine chapters, including general policy adjustments, military strength, defence budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, institutional reform, military training, foreign military security cooperation and military security relations with China.
According to the report, 2015 was the year in which Abe's Government took office for several consecutive years to advance major policy adjustments in the area of security.
Since then, Japan ' s initiatives in the area of security will be primarily at the operational level of rule of law application, strategy implementation, policy implementation, etc., rather than at the level of significant adjustments and changes in frameworks, mechanisms and policies.
The report stresses that Abe's Cabinet has attempted to achieve, through the three above-mentioned breakthroughs, the multiple objectives of promoting “normal nationalization” in Japan, the departure of the Self-Defence Forces from international security, the strengthening of the Japan-United States Alliance, and anti-Chinaism.
Earlier, the China Society for the Promotion of Strategic Culture issued assessments of Japanese military power on 5 June 2012, 19 July 2013, 23 July 2014 and 30 June 2015.
The British Financial Times released a collection of atlases of the residence of the United States Ambassador to China on 12 August.
In contrast, according to the article, the residence of the United States Ambassador could, from its appearance, be considered a safe house in the next film, adapted from John Le Calle ' s Cold War spy novel.
The residence is grey and is heavily guarded by perimeter fences, secondary inner walls, barbed wire and vehicle roadblock layers.
Completion of short boards for public sports facilities
Black coal farm warehouses have become “green grass” football fields, and red brick-top factories have become modern sports galleries.
On the occasion of the National Day of Physics, a mysterious veil was uncovered by the South Falling Horse Camp Sports and Culture Park outside the Gang Gate in Hangzhou.
It had been a coal mine and had been idle since its closure more than a decade earlier, leaving a large quantity of illegal buildings and household waste.
As a result of its rehabilitation, it has become a sports culture park, which will be officially opened to the public in November, offering free sports places to the public, and will undoubtedly create a new fertile ground for sport for all.
This is reminiscent of Hangzhou's Chen Quan Quan Quixada School, the Chinese swimming altar's “Hang Po military school” that has swam out of the world's champions.
The name of the swimming altar will continue to emerge, interpreting vividly the relationship between competitive sports and sport for all — a rich popular base that provides good conditions for the selection of professional players.
The level of competitive sports is closely linked to the basis of sport for all, which in a sense depends on sport for all, which in turn depends on the conditions of the site.
It is reported that, as of 2015, our per capita area of sport, while 150 times that of the new China, is still far behind the sports powers.
In June this year, the State Council published the National Fitness Plan (2016-2020), which focuses on the development of mass sports.
In order to complete this short sheet, on the one hand, the departments concerned must take fully into account the layout of stadiums in their urban planning.
On the other hand, established public stadiums, including those in schools and others, should be as open and efficient as possible.
The current Rio Olympics, like the flames of fire, inspires movement and awakens a sense of participation.
Gillid got a lawyer's fee in competition with Merk's Hepatitis C patent.
According to the judgment of the United States District Judge, Gilled Science is entitled to legal fees arising from patent proceedings for hepatitis C with the pharmaceutical company Merk Group of the United States.
In June, following the discovery by United States judges of violations committed by Merck, including perjury and other immoral acts, Gilled was exempted from paying $200 million in compensation for two violations of Merk's patents by Sofé Bouvet and Havoni, the best-selling drug of Gillid.
In the proceedings on Thursday, the United States District Judge, Beth Ramberson Freeman, stated that Gillid was not required to bear the costs of the defence.
Merck is trying to catch up with Giled, who rules the new generation of Hepatitis C drug markets.
The case first dates back to 2013, when Gilid and Merk sued each other and both claimed to be the owners of the work of the laboratory in Sofibwe, an active part of the drug in Gilid.
The U.S.-backed forces announced that they had taken Manbitt back from the Islamic State.
The Force spokesman said on Friday that all remaining ISIS soldiers in the city had left and that the United States-backed forces had taken full control of the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border.
After the departure of the radicals who had taken refuge in the city, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) were now sweeping the entire city.
Sharon Darwish, of the ADF-Manbit military committee, told Reuters that they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians abducted by militants.
He told Reuters: “Manbitt is under our control now, but we are still sweeping.”
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2 per cent of the federal tax.
Hillary Clinton published his 2105 tax return on Friday, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax.
In 2015, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton ' s charitable contributions amounted to $1 million, the bulk of which was given to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton ' s speech fees amounted to nearly $5.3 million, while the former Secretary of State earned $3 million from the publishers Simon and Schuster on the basis of a book on her tenure in the State Department.
Bill Clinton's campaign partner, Senator Tim Kane of the Federal State of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, published a 10-year tax return.
In 2015, they paid 20.3 per cent of the federal tax.
In a statement, Clinton's campaign assistant, Jennifer Palmieri, said that Hilary Clinton and Tim Kane would continue to be the banners of financial transparency.”
In contrast, Donald Trump concealed and retracted his previous commitment to publish tax returns on false grounds.
Although not required by law, it is customary for United States presidential candidates to make public their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyers used the audit of the United States IRS as grounds for refusing to publish tax returns.
Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, on Twitter, said you were in charge and attached a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, the Special Counsel for Trump, Michael Cohen, indicated to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish the tax returns until the audit had been completed.
Critics of Trump, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, and other Republicans, have indicated that Trump ' s refusal to publish tax returns raises questions about their net capital value, charitable donations, commercial transactions and various other relationships, including with Russia.
Caught up on this issue, Clinton released a video on Friday highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Trump to publish its taxes.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in a speech on economic policy in Michigan.
She said to the public: “For decades, he refused to publish his tax returns as other presidential candidates did”.
According to Politicians News Network, in two years in the 1990s, Trump had barely paid a single cent in taxes, and business columnists in The New York Times quoted several tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, saying that the current situation might still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a major problem in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named Warren Buffett, a billion-dollar investor, a rule that guaranteed at least 30 per cent of taxes to those who earned more than $1 million a year.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett stated that he was also being audited by IRS and that Trump's “fearing” was not a tax authority, but a voter.
The earliest tax returns issued by the Clinton campaign team were in 2007.
The average federal tax rate paid between 2007 and 2014 by the Clintons, currently residing in Chabak, New York, was about 32 per cent, and the combined rate was about 40.5 per cent.
The 2015 tax returns of the Clintons show that, unlike most Americans, they earn only $100 in wages.
Their main investment was the low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons' dividends and interest income were $109,000.

The Jewish film producer criticized the Berlin Hotel for removing Israeli phone code -- Reuters News -- according to an Arab client's "request."
A French film producer of Jewish origin revealed to the media that the Kebinski Hotel in Berlin did not include Israeli telephone codes and that the hotel staff stated that it was in accordance with the “requests” of Arab clients, which triggered a public outcry.
The author of the Holocaust documentary The Shoah, Claude Longzman, expressed his disappointment at the Kebinski Hotel and published an open letter in the Frankfurt Report of Germany.
During the recent stay, Lunzman wanted to find Israel on the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
However, Israel is not among the countries where guests can speak directly from their rooms.
Israel disappeared in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany?
Rantzman wrote.
Instead, guests can call the Israeli telephone through the call centre of the Cabinsky Hotel.
In an attempt to find an explanation, the film producer asked about the hotel's front desk.
In his letter, Lunzman stated that the answer he received from the front desk was “astonment to him”.
According to hotel personnel, this was “a deliberate decision by the management of the Cabinsky Hotel”.
The reason for this is to anger the film producer.
Ranzman quotes the employee: most of our guests are Arabs, and they ask for Israel's code to be deleted.”
According to the Nande daily, the Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Yakov Haddas Handelsmann, referred to the matter as “a great shame”.
We were surprised to learn of the incident.
This in itself is a great shame.
And what happened in Germany and in that chain of hotels is a disgrace.
There is no need for any explanation.
“We hope the hotel will come to the right conclusion”, said the official.
The incident triggered a lively discussion on the Internet, which was widely regarded as a scandal.
It was argued that the Cabinsky Hotel was simply a “downgrading” to meet the demands of Arab clients.
Another post refers directly to the hotel, “Faceless” and states that the street, which is located on the famous Kudam Street, is near a synagogue.
According to the weekly Sunglasses, the hotel quickly clarified all the allegations, claiming that everything was “neglected” and expressing its “apologies” to Lunzman.
The Nande daily quotes the representative of Cabinsky: “No direct order has ever been issued to remove Israel from the fast dial-up list”.
The newspaper also indicated that Israeli codes had been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to drive out the protesting Brazilian students.
On Thursday, in São Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with the police in protest against the reform of the Government ' s public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesters.
The reason for the incident was an attempt by law enforcement officials to disperse the students, and the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in the march and expressed their dissatisfaction with the programmes.
In order to save money, the Governor of São Paulo, Okmin, planned to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students would be transferred.
Some of the students who took part in the protests expressed their dissatisfaction with interim President Michel Temel through graffiti on the wall.
Just a few days before a recent protest, protesters collectively took to the streets in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who had been impeached by the National Senate.
The Scottish biker, Kalm Skinner, won the medal of the bike.
The Scottish bicycle rider, Kalm Skinner, last night at the men’s races at the Rio bicycle races helped the British trio to organize the successful Olympic medals following the 2012 London Olympics.
The 23-year-old Glasgow biker, who replaced his Scottish compatriot, Sir Chris Hoy, became the backbone of the team. Even the legendary biker was proud of him when young Skinner defeated the champion New Zealanders and returned with his reputation.
Four years ago, the British team sounded amazing, and Hoy took the fifth of his six Olympic medals.
The British team was ranked sixth in the March London World Quarters Championship, and Hoy has since retired. Then the British team is brilliant again.
During the Beijing Olympics to the London Olympics, the problem for the British team was the replacement of the “first circle expert”, Jamie Staff.
That was exactly what the convoy did when Schindler showed up.
Hoy's retirement also left a gap, which Chin Emady and Matt Clapton both wanted to fill.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's coaches insisted that he be elected to the national team, and Skinner ultimately did not fall short of expectations.
Skinner's partner was Schinds and Kenny, who won the gold medal with Hoy four years ago. The three men updated the Olympic record in the qualifying competition, but this was overtaken by the New Zealand team in the first round.
And the three British bicycle races eventually beat the opponent and won the gold medal.
Although Schinds is slightly behind, Kenny has taken the lead for the team, and Skinner has kept this lead to the end.
The change in strategy was the key to that reversal, and Schindler chose the larger flying wheels, so it was slower, which allowed Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to maintain the pace.
Hoys watched the game as a BBC commentator. Skinner, Kenny and Schindler saw him on the stage.
Twenty-three-year-old Glasgow biker Skinner said, "It's flattering me."
I'm just doing everything I can to make myself famous.
We created the Olympics record in the finals and defeated the world champions.
This is unbelievable.
There's nothing better than this victory.
After winning gold medals with Kenny and Hoy at the 2012 London Olympics, Schindler admitted to falling deliberately on the track in the face of a poor start.
Subsequently, he withdrew his comments, and the British team ' s opponents were unable to appeal.
And this victory has no such problems.
“It's like in London, where the stations are all British flags.”
We just formed a team three months ago.
We've lost many world champions, so it's amazing to be able to defend Olympic champions.
This was only a game and a gold medal for the British team that won 7 of the 10 cyclist gold medals at the Beijing and London Olympics.
If that symbolizes the progress we have made over the past five months, we will continue to succeed in the bicycle halls over the next five days.
According to Kenny, it was not impossible for him to repeat the three gold medals he had won at an Olympic Games.
If that's the case, Behoei is 12 years old and also on March 23rd, and Kenny, born, will have six gold medals and six gold medals.
This achievement is at the same level as that of Hoi.
Kenny's next battle will begin today with a three-day race.
The 28-year-old Bolton said, "I'm going to focus on this game for a while.
Team races are always the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
Frankly, a man wins a little lonely.
“If he can take the other two gold medals, he should be awarded a jazz seal.”
It was the only game that produced medals that day, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wilkins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doyle were promoted to a four-kilometre group with the fastest grades.
Their achievement was 351.943.
The 2012 London Olympic gold medal winner has a world record of 351.659.
The first and final round (10.42 p.m.) will be held today in the second race, and Wilkins will undoubtedly be the focus of attention.
Yesterday, he had a dispute with the competition officer before the qualification competition, who had asked him to measure his height.
Laura Trot, Joanna Rosell Chand, Eleanor Barker and Kate Archibald from Milgay were promoted to the new world record of 413.260 in the women's group that will end tomorrow.
The British team, relying on its strong field bicycle team, took the initiative and won several medals in the middle of the Olympics.
After displaying its absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British bicycle teams were somewhat disappointed in their journey to Rio.
A number of swings occurred during the period, including the resignation of Technical Director Sean Sutton in April on allegations of gender discrimination and bullying, and the retirement of legendary figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night of the bike house is enough proof of the legend that the British team will once again be at the peak of a critical moment.
When little lives come to this world, parents are responsible not only for their children ' s physical health, but also for their spiritual development, i.e. education.
If the education of the children fails, even if the cause succeeds, it will not make up for the lack of life and the failure of the family.
When a new life arrives, the new parents will have to devote time and energy to the care and education of the child and be accountable to him.
Responsibility, in addition to physical care and health care, is also about spiritual education, that is, teaching children how to be human, how to be adult and how to succeed.
Good family education means that parents need to accompany their children on a regular basis, to care for them, to be patient, to teach them to behave in a civilized manner, to learn better and to improve their intelligence.
A parent's words and actions affect the child's development, and they imitate their parents, as they are often told, the dragon, the phoenix, the mouse's son, and the parent's children.
So parents need to be good role models in front of their children, to regulate their words and deeds, and to develop their own qualities, all of which indirectly help them to shape good hearts and make them better.
Amy's a smart and pretty girl.
She was very active, able to live well with her friends, and able to adapt to the environment.
But Amy has a little secret in her heart: she can't focus for long on what she's going to do, what she's going to do.
This secret has been with Amy for a long time.
Even with decentralized, modular time for learning and working, she was largely able to accomplish her tasks and achieve good results.
But when the task is heavy and the time is tight, Amy feels very painful and painful.
The resistance of individuals to self-exploitation and their emotional experiences is aimed at not putting their self-awareness and self-esteem at risk.
There are also behavioural psychologists who interpret resistance as an insubordination on the part of individuals to correct their behaviour.
I tried to get Amy to do an exercise to calm herself down by breathing lightly, to feel the pain.
And once she left that trapped situation, she felt relaxed and regained her freedom.
One of the 63-year-old vagrants, Han, had a quarrel with another vagrancy, and he was stabbed to death.
Before the commission of one of the claims, he and one of the homeless Hunshaw lived on the ground in an alley in the eastern part of the city, more than 20 metres apart.
According to Han, on the day of the crime, they were asked by friends to drink together, and they had two quarrels with each other during and after the meal.
According to Han, he was afraid that Shaw would hit him, and he picked up a fruit knife from the garbage and stunned it to death.
In court, the victim ' s family claimed compensation for funeral expenses, death compensation, etc. for a total of over 530,000 yuan.
Uber entered the Taiwan market for four years, which had a considerable impact on the traditional local taxi industry.
On 12 August, the Taiwan Joint News reported that more than 100 taxis had bypassed Taiwan's “administrative court” in the morning to protest, leading to serious traffic paralysis in the surrounding area.
However, the Governor of the Taipei City Drivers ' Union, Jung Liqah, stated that Uber had been on the stage for four years and that the authorities had met only at the end of the month and that the drivers could no longer wait.
However, the Government ' s rhetoric was not credible and was delaying.
The law-abiding taxi drivers belonging to the bottom labourers, who competed with the unbridled Uber, feel deceived by the authorities.
Original title: 2,000 chickens from the Jiangsu I farm who were arrested by the court and sold without permission.
After the judgement came into force, Mr. Li failed to comply automatically with his obligations as determined by the judgement, Wang applied to the court of Suyang for enforcement.
On 16 October 2014, the court issued a civil decision in which it ruled that only 2000 eggs and chickens in one of Li ' s farms should be seized and not transferred or sold without permission.
Upon receipt of the seizure decision, Li-Xiao sold some of the eggs seized from the farm without the permission of the court of Xiaoyang.
By 8 March 2015, only 142 eggs had been found in the farm at the time of the survey by the Public Security Bureau of Xiaoyang County.
The journalist was informed on 12 August that the Beijing Winter Olympics 2022 and Winter Paralympics Organizing Committee had issued an announcement that the Beijing Winter Olympic Committee had inherited intellectual property rights such as the Beijing Winter Olympic Committee emblem and logo.
No one may use the emblem or logo of the Beijing Winter Olympic Committee for commercial purposes without the permission of the Committee.
The head of the Industry Coordination Division of the National Development Reform Commission pointed out here today that overcapacity in steel production is a global problem.
In recent years, our capacity utilization rate has been higher than the global average and higher than in countries and regions such as the United States and Europe.
We have taken resolute and effective measures to address excess capacity, and the results are gradually emerging.
The Officer-in-Charge noted that the Party ' s Central State Department attached great importance to the global problem of overcapacity in steel production.
Various departments and regions are actively following up on the deployment of the State Council and are working hard to reduce the capacity of rough steel production by about 45 million tons this year.
From the perspective of our national situation, we do not encourage the export of steel, but rather take a series of practical measures to control the export of steel.
The Officer-in-Charge emphasized that international trade in iron and steel products was essentially market-based and an autonomous choice derived from the demand of importing countries and from the combination of factors such as the value for money of products by consumers.
The implementation of trade protection measures would not help to address the root causes of the development of the global steel industry, but would, on the contrary, only have a further impact on the international trade order.
Turning to debt, the Officer-in-Charge stressed that debt resolution was an important issue that needed to be properly addressed in the process of resolving excess capacity.
Owing to the size and scope of the assets of the steel enterprise, the complex debt relationships of some enterprises may give rise to regional risks if not disposed of properly.
According to the head of the office, in recent years, with the downward pressure on the economy, aggregate social demand has gradually diminished, the productivity of some sectors has declined and the production and operation of enterprises has become more difficult.
Some enterprises do not adapt to the changing market environment and are unable to sustain or even close down production operations, but are constrained by a number of institutional factors that create more barriers to market-based exit and become “zombie enterprises”.
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces factor resource efficiency, increases social management costs and hinders the establishment of a level playing field.
The main causes of the loss are the same as the global iron and steel industry — weak market demand and low capacity utilization.
The main approach in the country is market mechanisms, economic instruments and the rule of law, and the Government is primarily working to ensure a fair and equitable market order for workers and social stability.
The Officer-in-Charge stressed that the next step should be to remain steadfast and to keep pace with the ability to produce and ensure that the five-year target of 100 million to 150 million tons of crude steel can be addressed.
In the afternoon, as soon as the Chinese tourist police opened their eyes at the Red Square in Moscow, attention was drawn to the fact that Chinese tourists waved with surprises, and that local and foreign tourists could not help but look back.
On the same day, members of the tourism police unit of the Sanya City Public Security Bureau, the first professional tourist police force in China, came to the Red Square in Moscow in Hainan Province to exchange information and study with the local tourism police on duty.
The Moscow Tourist Police split into three teams on operational patrol in Redfield, Nikolski Walking Street, Gum Department store, etc., and the Chinese Tourist Police followed the course together for more than an hour.
In her 20s this year, a female police officer, Liu, who knows both English and Spanish, joined the tourist police force last year.
On his way, he carefully observed the words and actions of his Russian counterpart and interacted with her from time to time.
When Spanish tourists came to consult, the Moscow Tourist Police had been impressed by the patient explanation given to each other in fluent Spanish.
“Moscow Tourist Police, each of whom knows a foreign language and some more than two, has touched us very much.”
“Hainnan, as an international tourist island, is giving increasing attention to attracting international tourists, and we hope to improve our ability to match the status of international tourism islands.”
On the same day, the Chinese Tourism Police went to the Moscow City Tourist Police Brigade site to interact with their Russian counterparts before following their studies.
“I often deal with Chinese tourists, and it is a pleasure to see them travel to Russia.”
“The question they usually ask is how they walk, where a monument is, how they rent it, how they get back to the hotel.”
The head of the Moscow City Tourism Police Brigade, Resakov, said that the urban environment and the tourist climate in Moscow had become more favourable in recent years and more attractive to foreign tourists.
In response to tourism development needs, a tourism police force was established in July 2014 to patrol and secure major attractions and assist and channel tourists.
Currently, all Moscow tourist police officers are proficient in English and, in part, in Spanish and German.
The Police Brigade divides them into nine teams according to the level of foreign languages, where they are taught twice a week in self-defence exercises, laws and regulations and foreign languages.
“There are two tourist police officers who are now learning Chinese, and they're doing well, and we're going to continue to raise their level of Chinese,” Rezakov says.
Rezakov told journalists that the Moscow Tourist Police had gained some experience since its formation and hoped to inspire his Sanya counterpart.
In his view, cooperation between the Russian and Chinese police services would enhance the sense of security of citizens travelling to each other ' s countries.
“Moscow tourist police recruitment, policing models, equipping and good interaction with tourists have given us much inspiration,” Chen Xiaokun said.
Chinese and new Internet journalists found that at least nine provinces and municipalities, including Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian and Beijing, have issued regulations for the implementation of residence permits.
With regard to the conditions for obtaining a residence permit, it is generally suggested that the requirement of more than six months of residence is one of the conditions for legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence and continuous schooling.
NJNJ noted that the range of public services and facilities provided in some areas has expanded in comparison with the national version of the regulations, as regards the treatment of residence permits, which vary from place to place.
All of these areas have increased the facilities for children to participate in the local upper secondary examinations, provided that the conditions are met.
In addition, many places, such as Beijing, have clearly called for the gradual expansion of the provision of public services and facilities and their regular disclosure to society.
For example, Fujian proposes to disclose to society, at least once every three years, the scope of the public services and facilities enjoyed by the holders of residence permits.
The Provisional Ordinance on Residence Permits stipulates that the public security organs shall produce and issue a residence permit within 15 days of the date on which the permit is processed.
With regard to the time frame for the issuance of certificates, most regions agree with the national version, i.e. within 15 days.
Hebei made it clear that a residence permit must be issued within three working days from the date of receipt of the application and the police station of the place of residence in which the application is made.
Jiangxi requires the public security organs to produce and issue a residence permit within five working days of the date on which the application for a residence permit is processed, provided that it meets the requirements for obtaining a residence permit and that the certificate is fully documented.
In accordance with the Temporary Ordinance on Residence Permits, all of the above-mentioned areas have expressly applied for a residence permit for the first time, exempting them from the payment of their fees.
For example, Sichuan requires that local public security police stations or commissioned community service agencies strictly enforce approved fee lines and rates, and firmly prohibit over-extension, over-standard charges or fare charges.
On 27 July 2016, Chen Yangxia, former Secretary of State Committee for Dingnan County, reported to the Provincial Disciplinary Committee and served as Director of the Party ' s Parliamentary Office (in the rank of Deputy Director for a trial period of one year).
The wine that was used in the evening was provided by Liao Yu personally, and the other costs were borne by one of Liu ' s individuals.
The Jiangxi Provincial Disciplinary Committee informed that Chen Yangxia and Cheng Ziqiang, among others, had organized and accepted an invitation to eat at a private meeting, in violation of the eight provisions of the Central Act and in violation of the Party ' s discipline.
Borgba ate two yellow cards in the Italian cup during the last season and automatically banned one game according to the rules.
Although he has moved back to the British Super, the UK General has continued to extend his cumulative ban on competition to the British Super Bowl.
As a result, in the August 14 guest fight against Bernmouth, Borgba will watch the wall, and his return to the League's premiere will be extended until the 20th match with Southampton.
As the first round of the 12th new show in 2014, Saric will officially land at the NBA in the next season and join 76 parties in Philadelphia.
As a young European player, many fans did not know him well, but, through the Olympic Games, it was very impressive to believe that Sarić was acting.
In the last Croatian race against Spain, Saric succeeded in sealing Paul Gazor ' s attempt to drag the race into the add-on basket.
In recent days, the Commander of the 76-man squad, Bret Brown, gave a very high rating to Sarić, who was considered to have seen the shadow of Manu-Ginobiri in his youth in Sarić.
It is clear that Saric has shown his talent and has given 76 people great expectations of him.
In the first two competitions in Croatia during the current Olympic Games, Sarić received a total of 24 points, 17 baskets and 12 reinforcements.
During the first half of the trial, Sarić demonstrated his ability to open space in his presence and, after breaking through his teammates, he was shot in the basket outside the three-point line.
Although this 76-person insiders currently hoards a large number of talented young players, they do not have the outer-line capability of Sarić.
The number of insiders who can do this in the NBA arena today, from caps to long-range rapid attacks and completion of the offensive.
Since the beginning of the Olympic Games, each of the three contests has received 13 points, eight baskets and five succours, with a comprehensive performance.
Since the decision to return to the Knights in the summer of 2014, James has signed two successive 1+1 contracts.
As NBA enters its final year, James will be at the forefront of collective agreement negotiations as Vice-President of the NBA Staff Council.
In view of the significant increase in the Alliance ' s revenues, thanks to the new televised agreement and the battle between the boss and the players over how to deal with the money, there is a fear that the NBA will come to a standstill in the summer of next year.
But for James, he didn't have to worry about becoming a free player next summer, because he had renewed a three-year contract with the Knights.
No matter when the 2017-18 season officially begins, James is in the contract.
Since the iPhoneSE stunned, the mobile phone market has also hit the tide of small screens.
Not long ago, Nubia also launched its first work in the Z11 series: Nubia Z11mini.
Nubia Z11mini has continued its traditional excellent photo genetics and has been equipped with a 5.0-inch screen with easy-to-use and ready-to-use back-print identification, which has led to an extraordinary experience of use.
The small screen camera phone Z11mini, which had just been listed under the Nubia flag, was reduced by $200, from $1499 to $1,299.
In terms of appearance, nubiaZ11mini uses a 5-inch 1080-P screen, which is still the classic design of the “small red circle” below the front.
The middle frame is the metal material and the bottom is symmetrically designed and configured for the Type-C data interface.
The future of the Portland smelter is fraught with uncertainty as a result of the cancellation of the power contract.
As the power company that supplied the plant disclosed that a factory owner would terminate a supply contract, thereby rendering all supply contracts ineffective, the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria, as well as hundreds of factory workers, are now facing an uncertain future.
This initiative took place after the Victorian Government decided not to continue to grant subsidies for the operation of the guaranteed plant.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will expire in November.
Two thousand workers at the Aluminium Company Portland factory may face unemployment.
Up to 2,000 people may be unemployed, either directly or indirectly, once the factory is closed.
And since the plant is responsible for about 10 per cent of Victoria ' s total electricity output, a chain reaction may also occur.
In 2014, Aluminium shut down the Hanry Corner Smelter, which led to the closure of the Angarsi power plant last year.
The Aluminium company Portland Smelter is currently losing and at risk of closure.
This was done after projections were made for the plant in the coming years, initially because of the strong Australian dollar and, more recently, because of the price of plant products.
AGL provides power to this large aluminium smelter through the old Eryan power plant in the Rutlob Valley. The company predicts that the owners of three other plants will also terminate their agreements.
The largest shareholders in the plant were a joint venture of USA and Aluminium Oxide, while China’s Sino-China Group and Japan’s Maroon Society also held small shares.
According to the joint venture, “AGL expects that the Portland plant will continue to operate, meaning that the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand”.
AGL states that these contracts were “flash contracts” that should have entered into force as of November 2016.
The termination period of the contracts was 12 months, so that they would be terminated in 2017.
According to the electricity company, “AGL therefore still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue for the financial year 2017”.
Any potential revenue impact on AGL since 2018 is currently subject to optimistic outlooks in futures markets for bulk generation prices.
AGL stated that the company had written off the contract value of $187 million in the “termination of activities expected”.
Aluminium stated that the decision to terminate the contracts “would not affect the ability of Aluminium to operate the smelter or to secure its electricity supply”.
The United States company stated that it had signed a 20-year contract with the old Eyan in 2010, which would have entered into force in November of this year, but did not explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts were cautious about whether the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle would close down because of the poor economic situation in the industry.
In response to the analyst ' s comments earlier this week, the AGL operator, Steven Michaelson, stated that Portland had about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and the Tomago plant about 900 megawatts per year.
If two factories were closed, the demand for electricity markets would be significantly reduced.
He said, “This is not good news for us as an electricity company”.
One hundred and sixty thousand people are denied access to community law centres every year.
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are denied access to community law centres every year. Funding for this service is already stretched and is now facing further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of five people were denied free legal advice and representation, most of them older persons, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and people without resources to fight unfair evictions.
The lack of funding for community legal services has long exceeded the limit and is now facing further funding cuts.
Since June of next year, federal funding for these legal centres will be reduced by a further 30 per cent.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Centre, stated that according to the latest report of the National Community Association Law Centre, thousands of people are denied access every year.
Mr. Farrell stated that the situation would only get worse if the federal Government did not change existing decisions.
“The Community Law Centre in Queensland is chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people will not be able to access the essential services they need”.
Those who need to stay away from violence, those who bear huge and unpayable debts, those who face breakdowns in their families and those who are squeezed are faced with problems at the legal level, and the report shows that they are unable to obtain the help they need.
The federal Government will cut another 30 per cent of its funding from June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Member of Parliament Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately rescind these cutbacks so that people can get the help they need when facing legal issues.
Last year, the State Government committed itself to raising the funding for legal aid to the national average.
Attention must now be paid to community law centres and their responsiveness to the needs of the community, and the Government must be involved in that important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team is being prosecuted for pulling their guns.
New York: The Trump campaign team was indicted for inaction by the head of Northern California when he pulled a gun at a staff member while driving a jeep in February.
Vincent Bodini, former software trainer for the state campaign team, described the incident on Wednesday in the state court in Charlotte.
Bodini indicated that he had hoped that the matter would be resolved internally, but after several months of waiting, he realized that “it could not happen”.
According to Bodini's description, the head of the operation, Earl Phillips, “drawed out a pistol, put his right index finger on the plate and pointed the gun at Vincent's kneecap”.
Having complained to the leadership of the local and regional electoral teams, Bodini learned from the file that at least four more people had experienced the same thing.
In his complaint, Bodini stated that “the failure to shoot does not mean that harm will not be caused”.
Just two days before the incident, the Republican presidential candidate in North Carolina told the public that if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was elected and selected the judge she loved, then the “substantiators of the Second Amendment”, i.e. the gun holder and the gun lover, might take action, a statement that provoked outrage.
Trump ' s campaign team stated that the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not advocated violence.
In his complaint, Bodini demanded that the campaign team pay compensation for his negligence and that Philip pay compensation for his assault, beatings and psychological injuries.
The Trump spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to this information.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
According to WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte, Philip recently left the campaign team.
His consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services did not respond immediately to calls.
The electoral team of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was controversial.
In this case, the parties are the Presidential Election Corporation of Bodini and Trump, 16-CS-14300, General Division of the High Court of Mecklenburg County (Charlott).
The United Kingdom must deliver the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport.
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our community, to London and to our country as a whole.
For me, this is Heathrow ' s charm, just as at the 2012 London Olympics we did our utmost to ensure that our countries and regions could benefit from those events.
The Olympics would greatly benefit Stratford and the Eastern Sector.
And we will once again benefit the region by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and free young people around the airport from unemployment.
As in the lead-up to the 2012 London Olympics, some consider Heathrow ' s expansion to be too extensive.
I have been told that Britain will not be able to prepare for the Olympics and that we will be humiliated in front of the world.
Doubters ' doubts about the 2012 Olympics were wrong, and their doubts about the Heathrow project would also prove wrong.
While obstacles always arise that need to be overcome, Heathrow is addressing each and every problem facing him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not a minority.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs and generate £211 billion in economic growth, leaving behind a wealth of technology and employment around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have an excellent Heathrow team. The team has completed £11 billion in infrastructure investment on time and within budget, including the T5 terminal, which was elected for five consecutive years as the world ' s best airport terminal, and the T2 terminal, which is located between the two of the world ' s busiest runways.
They are now ready to build the third runway with £16 billion in private investment.
The United Kingdom successfully organized the 2012 London Olympics, and I am confident that the Heathrow airport expansion project will also be a great success.
It is a good time for us to pass on the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow airport so that we can protect our future and create a technological and employment wealth that makes all of Britain proud.
Lord Paul Dayton is Chairman of the Heathrow Airport Board of Directors and former Business Counsellor of the British Treasury.
A woman killed herself on the Swiss highway.
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
The woman who tried to commit suicide was hit by several cars on the highway in the early morning of Thursday. The police are now looking for witnesses.
The accident occurred on the A1 highway near Morzh, Vaud County, in the morning of Thursday.
According to the Vaud police, a woman was “dry” in the middle of the night on the road and was driven by a number of cars.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman whose behaviour was clearly suicidal.
The woman died instantly.
The police revealed that several of the drivers involved had been investigated, but that some of them had still not been identified. The police are now calling on them, as well as witnesses of the accident, to come for an investigation.
According to the Geneva Tribune, a criminal investigation has now been initiated, which is a routine process of such incidents, as indicated by counsel Gilles Hofstadter to the Geneva Tribune.
It is not known, however, whether drivers will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
According to Hofstadter: “This will be determined by the Prosecutor”.
On the basis of the results of two other similar cases over the past five years, the driver will not be held responsible.
According to the newspaper, both cases were caused by people walking on the highway late in the night. The final verdict was that the driver could not have anticipated that pedestrians would cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was accused of negligent deaths in August 2014 when she hit and killed a man on the A1 highway near Payena.
The court was informed that the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking alcohol.
Upon investigation, the judge stated that the driving behaviour of the police officer at the time was perfectly legal, that the man appeared on the road “unfortunately and unexpectedly”, and that the police officer subsequently called the emergency number.
Anyone who can provide information on the incident near Morse on Thursday should call the police at 021,644,8346 or 021,644,444.
NASA Climate Model: Used to be suitable for human habitation on Venus
According to NASA's new climate model predictions, Venus used to be suitable for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Research have developed a model that explores the past of Venus and uses tools and algorithms very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, with high surface temperatures, waterless and carbon dioxide-filled atmosphere, has ever had an environment similar to the Earth.
Previously, scientists had argued that the slow rotation of Venus was due to its thicker atmosphere.
However, recent simulations suggest that Venus may have had a thiner, Earth-like atmosphere and was also slow to rotate at that time.
The model also shows the early terrain of Venus.
Venus may have more dry areas than the Earth, but there have been enough water and geographic changes to feed life and prevent rapid evaporation.
At an early stage, the light on Venus was 30 per cent darker than on Earth.
At a press conference, Anthony Del Genio, scientist at the Godard Institute of Space Research, explained: “In the model simulation of the Godard Institute of Space Research, Venus slowly rotates its side of the day for almost two months”.
This warms the surface and produces rain that can form thick clouds that block most of the sun's heat for the ground like an umbrella.
The result of the simulation is that the average climate temperature of Venus is actually a few degrees lower than the present Earth.
The model simulated the evolution of Venus in a manner similar to that previously assumed by planetary scientists.
Although life may have existed on Venus, it was exposed to excessive temperatures and ultraviolet light over billions of years.
The ocean on the planet evaporates and the water vapour burns out of ultraviolet light.
With the flight of hydrogen, only the thicker atmosphere of carbon dioxide and the deadly greenhouse gas effect have been left, thus forming the Venus that we know today.
Researchers published simulations of the new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Newsletter.
Patrick Roy resigned as Chief of the avalanche team.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from his position as Principal Coach and Vice-President of the Colorado Avalanche Iceball Team, stating that he had no say in the team ' s decision-making.
Joe Sachs, Managing Director of the Executive Vice-President of Colorado, confirmed the news and said that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
In a statement, 50-year-old Roy stated: “In the last three years, I have performed with vigour, passion and determination the duties of coach and vice-president of the Colorado Avalanche team.”
Throughout the summer, I thought hard about how to improve the team and give it a higher level of strength.
To that end, the goals of the coach and vice-president must be aligned with those of the club.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
At present, however, these conditions have not been met.
Sachs engaged Roy on 23 May 2013 and expressed his appreciation for his contribution to the team.
Sages said, "Patrick told me his decision today."
We thank him for his contribution to the club and hope that he will be well in the future.
Roy was nominated as the best coach of the Jack Adams Award League during the first season of the Avalanche team in the period 2013-14.
He helped the club get 112 points, ranking first in the middle. However, the Colorado team was eliminated from the Minnesota team in the first round of the post-season race and lost its hand in the last two years.
During the 2015-16 season, the avalanche team achieved 39 out of 39 and 4 out of 5 and eventually lost its second card qualification in the Western Great Alliance.
As a celebrity goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups and two each for the Canadians and the avalanche teams in Montreal.
North Sea oilfield workers stopped the strike and continued the negotiations.
According to the chief negotiator, workers in the North Sea oil fields had stopped the wage strike and the parties to the dispute had begun a new round of negotiations.
There were several strikes on the North Sea oil platform operated by the Royal Dutch Shell against the oilfield service company Wood Group.
According to a joint statement, “Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the current dispute resolution process.”
Starting earlier next week, we will be revisiting these issues with a number of full-day meetings in the coming weeks.
The trade union indicated that its recent action was to protest the possibility of a 30 per cent salary reduction, which it had taken for the first time in 25 years.
Wood Group reduced the remuneration of North Sea contractors by about 9 per cent this year as a result of market pressure.
Prior to this reduction, the company reduced the remuneration of the marine contractor by 10 per cent in 2014.
The company stated that a further reduction in salaries would help it to survive the depression.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries because of the need for the company to streamline its operations following its merger with the British Energy Corporation British Gas Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices and the British de-European decision of June.
Members of the Scottish Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute of the North Sea generation.
He stated that the North Sea was vital to the region ' s economy.
In his statement, Dave said: “In the North Sea and in the country as a whole, we need an economy that serves the majority and not a few”.
In 2016, new North Sea projects are expected to spend no more than $1.4 billion, compared with an average project expenditure of approximately $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of the stars of the Orion.
The latest mission of the Caper Space Telescope has helped astronomers to capture the most complete star rotation speed of the Orient Cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the constellation have different rotation speeds and how the cycle is associated with the planet.
In a press conference, Luza Rebur, research scientist at the Infrared Processing Analysis Centre of the Pasadena Institute of Technology, stated: “We would like to learn more about the relationship between the mass of stars, their age, and even the history of their solar systems by comparing our results with other clusters of stars.”
The Orchestra is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born some 125 million years ago and are now just reaching adulthood.
They have reached the highest rotation rate in their lifetime.
When the maximum rotation speed is reached, these mature stars emit large amounts of star wind.
When these stars wind through the magnetic field of the stars, they have a brake effect on the stars.
As the age of stars increases, their rotation starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time of the appearance of an identifiable star's black child (like the sun's black son).
The latest spin-rate data sets indicate that larger-mass stars rotate at a slower rate than smaller-mass stars.
Rabel compares stars to dancers, and larger dancers rotate at a slower pace than smaller dancers.
Rabel said, “In the Ballet performance of the Orchestra, we find that slowly moving stars tend to be of greater mass, while the fastest moving stars are often the lightest of stars.”
Because of the proximity of the Orion constellation, it could be the ideal cosmopolitan laboratory for comparing the mass of stars with the speed of rotation.
According to Rabel: “The Orchestra has laid the foundation for a two-way rotation theory model for young and old stars.”
We still have a lot of knowledge to learn about how, when and why stars slow their rotation and “take up their shoes”.
Raeble and her colleagues have elaborated on their latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Orchestra in three new papers. These papers will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
The Chief of the Water Management Section of South Lake Park, Chung Jianjun, described that the bottom of the South Lake was more than 10 metres deep and that people who were unaware of the water under the circumstances were likely to be at risk.
“Although the South Lake Rescue Team is very professional, it is hoped that the vast number of rowing tourists will be able to wear life jackets, refrain from illegal actions on the lake and play safely.” According to Cheng Jianjun.
The village has a unique marine environment and is host to two major recreational tourism resources, natural and human.
“But the individual owners who purchased the spaces in the area, fearing that doing so would affect the rental price of their spaces and suspecting that others were self-inflicted, continued to sabotage their backs, resulting in the renovation of the spaces being put on hold.”
There is still a diversity of views as to when the potato will be introduced by whom.
In the prevailing view, there are three main routes for the introduction of potatoes.
The most influential and widespread of the three routes introduced by the cassava is the introduction of Chen Zhenlong from the Philippines into Fuzhou.
The Beijing Municipal Office for the Management of Social Groups will be carrying out a special inspection of the use of the unified receipts for social groups ' contributions as of that date.
Inspections are conducted on a unit-by-unit basis and on a case-by-case basis.
The head of the municipal association office explained that the scope of the inspection included the organization of municipal associations in 2013 - 2015 with a unified receipt for membership in the community.
In the communication strategy for the Olympic Games developed by the Rio Olympic Committee in 2012, it was stated that “the success of the Games is defined by those who share stories in social media”.
From the coverage of the Olympic Games, the media have changed considerably in terms of modes of communication, product patterns, language styles, news perspectives and so on.
The IOC and media practitioners from around the world seem to have come to grips with this round of challenges.
On August 11, the Gwang Da Securities H share went into the final day of the open sale. According to reports, the market had been flat for the first two days of the campaign.
According to a domestic voucher analyst, Eastern securities are not well-established in the port base, and management of business under the flag is the chief Eastern Officer. This is less than natural than bankers such as Sino-Sino International and Sino-Sin securities.
Experts noted that, while the performance of many coupons had declined since the beginning of the year with the return of securities markets, it could not be said in general terms that the company ' s own business was developing more when it was listed.
With the introduction of the New Deal, Suzhou will be the first second-line city in the country to reopen the buyout.
Second-line cities that have or are about to introduce a policy of building and city regulation include not only Suzhou, but also compost, Nanjing and others.
Prior to that, the compost had taken the lead in issuing a loan-restrictive policy, and banks would refuse to provide mortgage services to buyers who had two flats under the compost name and had an open housing loan.
Last week, there was a temporary suspension of the play " American private room food " , which unexpectedly triggered a lively debate about the counterfeiting of national production.
Civil rights groups have issued travel warnings against Missouri.
As a result of Missouri ' s discriminatory policies and racist attacks, the American Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued travel warnings to colored populations preparing to travel to Missouri.
“The NAACP Missouri Travel Consultation, which came into effect on 28 August 2017, called for special attention and action to be taken by all African-American travellers, tourists and Missouri travelling in Missouri as a result of the recent series of suspicious racial incidents in Missouri.
NAACP noted that the recent adoption of a Missouri law made it more difficult for people to win discrimination suits and that the State ' s enforcement of laws targeted minority groups to some extent, prompting the organization to issue travel warnings.
Violations of the rights of citizens are happening to people.
They were questioned by parking and beaten or killed because of their skin colour, “Missuri NAACP President Rod Chapel told The Kansas City Star.
“We have received an unprecedented number of complaints.”
This was the first such warning issued by the organization against a state in the United States.
The organization cited the racial defamation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of a black male, Tori Sanders, 28 years old, in Tennessee.
Earlier this year, Saunders died under suspicious circumstances. He spent fuel fuel while travelling in Missouri and was detained without charge by the Missouri police.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by the Office of the Attorney-General of Missouri indicated that “Black drivers in the State are 75 per cent more likely to be stopped and examined than whites”.
Chapel said: “The consultation was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri.”
“People need to be prepared to travel to Missouri with bail or to let relatives know that they are travelling within the state”.
According to the latest data from the FBI hate crime reporting programme, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; according to the crime volume, the state ranked 16th in the country.
Travel warnings were also a response to the new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to prosecute businesses that discriminated against housing or employment.
Prior to the adoption of immigration law enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to detain immigration offenders, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) indicated that it would increase the number of racial litigations and issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the United States Government against other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have adopted this approach in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
After the “Golden Age” of the 2015 surge, the overall film market entered a cooling period in 2016, and the ability to break through last year's $4,069 billion gross house performance became a suspense.

BBC called Beijing the most exciting city: to make the foreigners feel “living in a new era”.
According to the English media, on 18 January, Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly becoming today's modern city of charm.
The Chinese capital, which has an alarmingly fast Internet, has sophisticated technologies such as face-to-face recognition software, has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has unmatched internationalized energy, and it is one of the most exciting cities for a foreign country rich in exploration.
According to the BBC website on January 16, German expatriate Clemens Sethi says, “If I succeed there, I will succeed anywhere in the future.” He quotes a singer, Frank Sinatra, who sings the words of New York City.
Seth, who is the creative director of Traveler Archives, says, “If Sinatra survives today, he will probably sing about a city like Beijing.” He says, living in this city will make you feel like a “new age” and always keep up with the tide.
Simon Norton, who lives in England, but recently in Beijing, wrote on his personal blog website, 4 Corners7 Seas: "People generally have a feeling of being at the centre of something big, and it's hard to tell, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it becomes.
It was reported that the city ' s high-quality and high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment made daily life easier than ever before.
Andy Peña Fuert, from Manila, who is currently the Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Beijing Children's Web site, says: “Beijing is rapidly turning into a cashless society, where the Internet integrates traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions.”
However, reports indicate that smart phones are only the beginning of Beijing ' s technological ambitions, that facial recognition software has become widely available, and that many mobile phone applications use this technology for bank transfers and payments, for access to apartments and offices, and even for verification of the identity of network drivers.
Beijing has also recently announced plans to invest 13.8 billion yuan in the construction of an artificial smart technology park, where more than 400 enterprises will be established and will focus on the development of various artificial intelligence technologies, from biometrics to autopilot.
Food is also at the core of many major festivals in China over the years, which are celebrated by foreigners. Spring is one of the most important social and economic festivals and one of the most easy days for foreigners to participate.
And Seth said, "I suggest that we help Chinese friends prepare for the New Year's Day. It's just as important to clean up their apartments and put a new year's blessing on their doorsteps. On New Year's Eve, all members of the family have to come together and eat a great meal, and then watch their age until midnight.
It was reported that the number of foreigners in Beijing was large and growing, but the language barriers in China and the ease of communication among the diaspora could easily be used as a pretext for their incomplete integration into local cultures.
“Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but they have had little experience with their host countries. If your initial attempts to reach out to the Chinese have not been successful, then it is easy for you to feel more comfortable with other foreigners.
In these so-called “foreign bubbles” (“foreign bubbles” are those in which foreigners mix only among foreigners and do not touch local people and local culture — translaters note), foreigners congregate in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and friends only foreigners.
The simplest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin — which is simpler than one might imagine.
Seth said, “The Chinese private classes of one or two hours a week, or the introductory radio drama, should suit everyone's busy schedule.”
Even a few classic short sentences can help with shopping, ordering meals in restaurants or chatting in taxis.
It has been reported that persistent air pollution is also a fact of daily life, although in recent years the Government has made efforts to contain some problems.
Residents stressed the importance of outdoor activities during the often lighter warm months of pollution, using the blue days as an opportunity to tangle in long-standing alleys or to explore popular solar parks.
According to Norton, “Beijing is the Chinese city that can find the most things on the surface, and you can find great artistic and musical activities, angry night life, historical wonders, super-modern commercial zones and ancient alleys”.
The report argues that the role of ageing as an impediment to the growth of human capital is increasingly evident, particularly in the north-east, where ageing contributes to human capital growth at an average annual rate of -1.28 per cent.
He noted that the risks of cross-border capital flows were currently manageable and that the underlying factors underpinning the balance of payments remained long-term.
On December 17th, the China-China-News-China World Summit Forum on the Restoration and Conservation of Chinese Ancient Books, 2016, was opened at the People's University of China on December 17th.
In April this year, the European Commission accused Google of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre-package software such as Google Search and Chrome Browser, otherwise they would not be allowed to use other Google applications.
The EU Commission considered this to be detrimental to the interests of consumers and an impediment to competition.
EU regulators initially requested Google to respond by 27 July.
If an anti-monopoly charge were to be found, Google would face a fine of up to 10 per cent of its global revenue, amounting to approximately $7.4 billion.
Google has not yet commented on this immediately.
Google is also being investigated by the European Union for favouring home shopping services in search results.
Zhang Yuning's legacy is solid, and it can be said that it was not by chance that he “stepped” from the youth to the Olympics, and that his leap to growth was still surprising.
A picture of Bitcoin's legal status around the world.
Summary: In addition to the price retrenchment that is naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the collapse of the current round of digital currency is also linked to the “hosting enemy” - regulatory risk.
From visual maps, Eastern countries have a more conservative attitude than the West, countries with global dominance are still looking at digital monetary legitimacy and represent a “black swan risk” that remains high.
*This is from Wall Street (Web ID:walltreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more excellent information, please visit Walltreetcn.com or download the Wall Street APP.*
With the rise of regulatory storms in key Bitcoin markets such as China, the Republic of Korea and the European Union, the global digital currency headed by Bitcoin has been bled out since this week, with the price of bitcoin falling by $10,000 on Tuesday and the largest single-day fall in three years.
In addition to the price reversals that are naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the fall in the current round of digital currency is also related to the constant “hosting enemy” - regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, the big visual data site HowMuch.net has produced a map showing the legitimacy and degree of regulation of Bitcoin in countries across the globe.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legitimate market of bitcoin; orange yellow represents the neutral market, although it has not publicly legalized bitcoin status, but there are no major restrictions on its use; light pink represents the restricted market, where local governments try to use digital currency through red-line policies or regulation; dark pink.
(The above figure is drawn by the HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15)
According to the article, the traditional attitude of Eastern countries of Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West, as can be seen from the green mass distribution in Central Africa.
Russia is currently the largest country to define Bitcoin as illegal; China is one of the largest restricted markets in Bitcoin; and India is one of the largest countries in which Bitcoin has not yet been evaluated and has not yet introduced relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of bitcoin, i.e. the more concentrated distribution of green pieces.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America are clearly divided among them, with a more mixed distribution of coloured matter in those regions.
Of these, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil are legitimate bitcoin markets, and Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bolivia have some restrictions on their trade and use, while more Latin American countries have yet to make a sound.
Combined with the above data, a total of 99 (or 40 per cent) of the 246 countries surveyed globally have unrestricted transactions and use of bitcoin, i.e., green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3 per cent) were restricted markets (light pink), 10 countries (or 4 per cent) defined Bitcoin as illegal (deep pink) and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) did not treat digital currency information more (grey).
This suggests that countries that make up the global majority (53 per cent, more than half) are still waiting to see the legitimacy of the digital currency headed by bitcoin within their borders, and that the “black swan risk” of bitcoin remains significant, as some of them may eventually take legislative decisions to limit the digital currency.
According to the article, the emerging category of digital currencies is not fully understood by global regulators and may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made a pronouncement.
Although the “human face” of Bitcoin has grown exponentially since last year, it does not represent the interest of all countries, and there may be concerns in some countries about the threat of local French currency or, more importantly, about the use of digital currency by criminal organizations.
Wall Street interviews have written a detailed summary of international regulatory news against Bitcoin since last week, including China's launch of a centralized online service platform and mobile App against off-site exchanges, South Korea's continuing consideration of closing the digital currency exchange, the EU's belief that Bitcoin has not yet been widely accepted and warning investors to “pay”
The editor-in-chief of Wall Street selects the Year of Digital Currency as the year of the global central bank's digital currency, either from the point of view of regulation, acceptance/criticisation or adoption.
Major Powers such as Russia have criticized the legitimacy of Bitcoin, in fact in order to give way to the official issuance of digital currency.
Xinhua Society in Madrid on 8 January (Reporter Xie Woo-ji), Barcelona's New Aid Kutinio 8, first time in a pizza shirt in Nokamp.
Cutinio passed a medical check-up in Bassa that morning and signed a contract with Basa President Bartoméu, which will expire in the summer of 2023.
He then appeared as a Bassa player in front of nearly 7,000 fans in Nokamp.
According to the Spanish media, Curtiño ' s total transfer of contributions, amounting to Euro160 million (approximately RMB 7.77 (Euro 1)), is the first price for the Basa Club and the history of Nishika.
As Kutinio is still wounded, he will have to rest for nearly 20 days before he will be able to meet himself in a virgin show in a pizzard.
What else is sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most definite sign of regime change was when they started attacking the statue.
Americans, like anyone else, agree with this. So, in 2003, Saddam Hussein of Paradise Square in Baghdad was deliberately pushed down.
Stephen Miller, one of the key thinkers of the Trump government, must have known when Jim Acosta was actively debating the President's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, a group of cruise ship owners and liberal followers would surely eat him alive.
But he did attack the meaning of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was carved on the base in 1903 (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller denounced Acosta, “I do not want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America's freedom to light the world ...
The poem to which you refer, which was added later, and which is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
In fact, Miller was right, but, as he himself said, this is not really about history.
This relates to the modern echo of the language of Lazarus, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: “Your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowd of people who want to breathe freely,/the suffering reject your crowded beaches”.
There is no “rejection of the suffering” at a time when our screen has become more dazzling.
Miller had not worked on literary reviews, and he had made it clear that those people would not be welcome in the United States of America in the Trump era.
This conflict over the meaning of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is in fact a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, as well as her friends, who engraved her poems on the ground after her death, are well aware of the highly political nature of the acts in which they are participating.
The purpose of the sculpture was to express the link between French and American republicanism through the ancient classic metaphors of the femininity of the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poem, the image of a woman was no longer abstract, and she had to speak.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of exile.
The poem, combined with the painting, was a successful feminist coup d ' état and a devastating blow to United States indigenousism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers always wanted it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker, Rush Limbagh, a temporary baptizer of Trump, argued in 2010 that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, but that he was an early neoconservative who brought America's intellectual flame to the ignorant world: “Freedom.”
Her intention was to bring the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not the path of America.”
What is unusual is that Limbo is actually touched by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive angle.
The most imaginative thing about Lazarus is to be able to see it. When weary, poor but hopeful people can see it on the deck after a long and often terrible journey.
On the face of it, this relates to the world view of those who seek refuge and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveys to them and requires the hope and welcome they hear.
Of course, that is not the point that Miller and Trump wanted to acknowledge.
Their torches are not intended to light the way, but to ignite hatred from their sole source of strength.
In 2006, Sacap became the first Chinese to sign a contract with Universal British Headquarters with a unique musical style.
The 2017 World Cup: Neil Black highly praises Scotland's team in the British National Team.
Eilidh Doyle remembered that there were only two Scottishs in the British National Team at the time.
Neil Black, Executive Director of the Athletics Association of England, said that a 16-strong Scottish team from the World Cup team would make a huge contribution to the National Team.
The number of Scottish field athletes selected for the London Athletics World Cup in 2017, which opened on Friday, was the highest in history.
Black believes that “Scotland is making extraordinary progress”, from which UK trackers must learn.
“We accept and try to understand this, and we will persevere until we succeed”, Black says.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute. They think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish trackers think this has something to do with what they're doing.
The Athletic Association of England considers this to be relevant to their actions.
Even street people think so.
Whatever it is, it's brilliant."
Many Scottish trackers are contestants, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be 5,000 meters below Mo Farah.
“Erid is a little modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible." Blake said.
“Many trackers, whether Scottish or not, or wherever they live or train, walk out of the house with pride and energy.
Eric's natural passion and true feelings are very good."
The winner of the Commonwealth silver medal, who will be participating in the 400-metre cross-column contest in his fifth World Cup, says that there are 16 Scottishs in the British National Team, which is “unbelievable”.
Previously, the number of Scottish track and track athletes participating in the World Series was up to seven, i.e. in 1983 and 2015.
Midrunner Muir is a leader. She has made five British records and two European records over the past year.
She's going to the 1,500-metre and 5,000-metre project competitions.
Chris O'Hare, who took part in the 1500-metres contest, was another notable Scottish player who had done well in the season and won the pre-selections and the annual Olympics in British countries.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first World Championship, when the only other Scottish on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said that she was very proud that so many of her compatriots would not only join the team, but also, in some cases, challenge the medal and enter the finals.
“The special thing about being a captain of the national team is that it was elected by the other members of the national team. So, knowing that your teammates voted for your extraordinary achievement, it was a great honour for me anyway”, she added.
“Of course, I am very proud of all the Scottish team members.
This is just an indication of how far we have gone.
And they're all old track and track athletes here, track and track athletes who are about to move towards the purposes of the Medal.
What did my captain say?
Well, I think it's very good.
I have just referred to the fact that, under these circumstances, we are very fortunate because we hold the World Cup in the main arena.
That is why it is really important that we grow up with home support and by returning to the Olympic stadium.
I will be given a second chance to compete, and there will be a wonderful atmosphere.”
The total number of employees in 2016 was 180,000 and the cost of employees amounted to $121.8 billion, an increase of 21 per cent over the same period.
Curb critics on Facebook: if you can't stand the blame of voters, don't run for office.
Our Father is aware of the bad media.
The Americans loved Washington, but shortly after that, major newspapers began to speak out against him, from domestic policy to political principles.
He was angry at those criticisms, no doubt.
But he did not silence those critics.
Because, as early as 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of expression is denied — we will be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance”.
This reminds me of the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff blocked and deleted at least 450 people’s posts because they had published their views on his official Facebook home page.
The American Civil Liberties Union instituted proceedings against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff described the lawsuit as hasty and the online coverage was full of their fierce resistance: “Who cares?”
A lot of people say, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
This is particularly important because people like Hogan are confronted.
It was a Republican who served as governor in a state with a democratic majority, and he was surprisingly popular.
Of the country ' s 50 governors, he was ranked second in good ratings.
Hogan is not a reactionary maniac.
He has smooth control of Maryland and strictly abides by the rules.
He was also very good at using Facebook as the main way to communicate with voters, showing his bald head after chemotherapy for the first time on the home page.
So the people who came to the governor’s home page for comment are completely unnecessary, and ultimately dangerous. The home page is a public forum, an official management platform for public tax-supporting employees.
In an interview with the Washington Post, the spokesperson for Hogan, Amelia Shas, defended the Governor ' s behaviour by saying that she believed that she was merely trying to shield their comments from restraint.
But they were too hasty to describe it as a flood beast or cynic overflowing the network.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with people who had been blocked by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their chosen leaders: they are teachers, small business owners and priests, not flood beasts.
They have often said that their comments are profound, respectful and undisguised.
In his post, the priest quoted the Bible and called on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Lamani, a barrister in Boye, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked about hate crimes.
As she wrote in the news story review section of the Washington Post, “I am very polite to comment that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes and other recent news incidents.
Nor do I like to have a group of people comment on the same subject, because they are simply ignored by those who think that they are so-called people's minds, rather than treating them as citizens who are worried about their country.”
In the view of others, what the governor's staff termed “intense garbage information bombing” may be “persistent”.
The Facebook era has made it easy to modify a message by blocking a critics or removing a negative comment.
It was also much cleaner than in the past, when the same effect required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical comments or to arrest or silence protesters.
But that is what is happening now, just at the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for scolding others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was being sued by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
Last week there was a landmark ruling in the state of Virginia on such issues.
According to the District Judge of Alexandria, James c. Cacharis, in the United States, the Chairman of the Lawden County Supervisory Board blocked voters from her Facebook page in violation of the First Amendment.
The state governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevan (R), was also targeted by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet had a similar impact.
The number of newspapers had quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters criticised his leadership.
And even then, Washington had an anonymous flood beast against him.
The pseudonyms of Yulikla, Valerius, Belisaeu and Pozius were used to write to newspapers to criticize Washington's decision-making harshly.
According to historical documentation collected by the George Washington newspaper online project, his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his attitude to the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America, signed with the United Kingdom.
But he didn't snort them.
Freedom of expression, dissent and speech are the foundations of this country.
And true leaders need to accept that.
The wiring of the city's wind and motion is holding on to people's sensitive nerves.
Restricted purchases are a hard bar for many urban property regulation policies.
(a) In May 2017, Jinan introduced a six-month period in which undergraduates would be eligible for equal access to housing for residents of the local permanent household;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy whereby university students could be registered within three years of graduation on the basis of a diploma and an employment certificate.
The policy was then added to the official statement that “university students can buy a house at less than 20 per cent of the market price”;
In July, Chengdu introduced the requirement that young people with undergraduate and higher degrees in field universities could apply for a residence permit.
In addition, cities or regions such as Kunshan and Shanghai have introduced “brain-in-kind” policies that lower the threshold for home-buying.
Zhang Xuan believes that it is in fact the cities that compete for and retain people, especially people, that are competitive, which is the most important aspect of these real estate policies.
It has even been argued that this means that the time has come for the “restrictive purchase” of the building city to be cancelled.
The director said on that day that the film was planned for a very long time, that the first script was adapted in 1999 and that he was even looking for the Golden City Wu to play Yan XIII.
Ronan Lafferty looks forward to enjoying his home at the Renaissance Club.
The East Loosean Renaissance Club holds the 25th Scottish Open Springs, and Ronan Lafferty, the former European champion, will enjoy coming home in the next three days.
This Northerner led the next-door Archerfield Links to the finals last year, but eventually lost to Paul Iles. He now works for the new conference, representing Jerry Salvatti, founder and CEO of the club, as an ambassador for the race.
Lafferty said, “I witnessed the establishment of the Renaissance Club, and we will witness its glory through this game.
The athletes will see the best face and state of the field.
Jerry built this place like nothing else.
He was a keen supporter of the game and was very proud of what had been achieved here.
This is the best stage to show the field."
The Englishman, Ils, looks forward to the first crown, although in 32 years of his career, he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
This Southport player says, "This is really special.
I didn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was cancelled the second year I won.
It's amazing to be here.
It's wonderful to play golf here.
Last year's memory came to light, and for me and my wife Sharon, the victory last year was of special significance to us.
It's really a special memory, and we'll always remember it."
Returning to their homeland was Gary Orr, who had just turned 50 earlier this year and then participated in the European Youth Tour.
This is his first competition in Scotland since the 2013 Scottish Golf Open.
“There will always be more meaning in homecoming games,” said Helensburger Orr.
You want to be good; but you can feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed being able to play again. I've been playing golf.
I am satisfied with the current state of affairs.”
The three-member group on the scene was the former winner of the master race, Ian Woosnan, and the champions of the Evergreen race, Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNuit.
There were six Scottish athletes on the scene, two of whom were Sam Torrance, Al and former Leader of the Leed Cup, and four of whom were Andrew Odcohn, Stephen McCallyst, Bill Langmue and Ross Drummond.

In August, the Director-General of the Environment Inspectorate of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China introduced in Beijing a total of 57 cases of daily and continuous punishment throughout the country. The new amendment to the Environmental Protection Law, introduced earlier this year, significantly added to China ' s environmental enforcement efforts.
At present, environmental protection agencies in all parts of China can use such punishments as continuous daily punishment, seizure, lock-down and transfer to administrative detention to detect and punish environmental offences and cooperate with the judicial authorities to punish them.
According to the head of Zou, in August, a total of 335 seizure and seizure cases were carried out throughout China; 177 were restricted or suspended; 189 were transferred to administrative detention; and 166 were transferred to suspected environmental pollution offences.
Of these, Henan has imposed seven consecutive daily punishments, and China is now moving from end-of-pipe control to full-scale environmental pollution control.
Despite the downward pressure on the economy, China's Ministry of the Environment had previously made it clear that China should properly address the positioning of environmental protection in economic development and enhance the “green force” and that the more the economy grows, the less the environment can be relaxed and the better the role of environmental protection for the economy can be optimized.
Not the highest, but the higher, and the high value of ownership on the innovative road in Guizhou.
On 9 January, A's “Sharelord” in Guizhou once again made an all-time high of $782.52, with a total market value of $983 billion and just one step away from the trillion market value.

An announcement was issued on 28 December 2017 in Maotai, Guizhou, stating that, as a result of the study, the prices of the taupulega products had been adjusted appropriately since 2018, with an average increase of about 18 per cent.
This price increase has stimulated a sharp rise in market prices in Maotai, Guizhou, where according to the Beijing Morning Reporters, the price has risen by more than 14 per cent since the announcement of eight transactions in Maotai, Guizhou, where prices have increased by more than 95 dollars.
Statistics show that in 2017 the province of Guizhou had a total production value of 950 billion yuan in the first three quarters and that the market value of Maotai had pushed the province ' s GDP far behind in the first three quarters of the year.
Under the leadership of Maotai, white wine-listed companies have opened up the price-fixing rhythm to reap the dividends of rising consumption.
Since 2017, the stock prices of most of the companies listed on the white wine market have continued to increase significantly, with the shares of the wells, the five grains, the Shanxi wine and the Kuotai in Guizhou having more than doubled.

In recent days, the IU-China has organized a group of 19 representatives of the arts and arts community and prominent artists to travel to Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Shanghai, Guangdong and Guizhou to lecture on the spirit of the 19th.
They went to grass-roots mass art galleries in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Gansu, local campuses and some high schools, where they carried out a new cultural mission to the nineteen spiritual Chinese artists.
I'm deeply proud and happy, and I'm willing to sink again and write more about the fate of the big-time characters.
What kind of advice can you have on this grass-roots artistic development?
There's a lot of popular literature going on right now. It's a little bit popular.
It's a time-honoured masterpiece that is constantly being introduced.
It should take root at the grass roots, go deep into life, and then produce works with a certain cultural thickness, positive upwards and long-standing artistic charms.

Our first star in the space science satellite series, and also the world's first dark matter particle detection satellite, Goku.
Over the past two years of on-orbit operation, four scans of the entire sky zone were conducted, detecting more than 35 billion high-energy particles and obtaining the most accurate particles in the world.
This result has been published in the international academic journal Nature.
In space, we have observed a new one that has not been observed before, one that cannot be explained and described with an existing theory.
The significance of this research is multiple, and most importantly it shows that Chinese scientists use the cutting edge of technology.
The ability to manufacture scientific instruments to detect a very difficult scientific problem.
It's been the last century, and there's a lot of memories of Chinese toilets.
And more and more human design.

Not just to change the hardware, but to keep up with the software.
The tourism sector requires toilets in the landscape area to be equipped with toilet paper and hand-washing fluids.
But in some parts of the world,
Is it because of the uncivilizational behavior of a certain individual, that this civilian service is stopped?
The local administrators have made their choice.

Public toilets in Jiangsu Namking, Cebu, etc.
You'll get a free toilet paper for three seconds, but it'll take another 10 minutes to get a double.
Avoiding the misuse of public resources
It's a habit that some tourists do want to take the paper back, but on the other hand, we have to reflect.
Isn't the next toilet we're going to have no paper, so that's what we're focusing on in the new three-year plan?
We need to fix this imbalance that's not enough.
To push the toilet revolution deeper is to think more about what people think.
A third toilet must be available to facilitate family escorting the elderly and children to the toilet.
We're bringing the baby. We're embarrassed to be in the men's room.
It's like a little awkward when a girl's room is so small, that the board is very comfortable and it's very convenient for us to take the kids with us.
When people feel civilization, they become the builders of civilization. In the countryside, villagers from the Guangxi River pool are building new flush toilets in their homes.
Much has been achieved, and the active promotion of the toilet revolution will not only help people to stay away from disease, but will also lead to economic development to narrow regional development gaps.
The issue of the toilet is a public issue and a node for the development of social issues.
It is a national civilizational project that guides the layout from a national point of view and then addresses small social problems with varying degrees of participation.
That's how we complete all our shorts.

Poverty and death in Phnom Penh, Indonesia
Baddina Dejay doesn't cook with stoves.
She doesn't even use pots.
Her cabin is located in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai district, Papua, Indonesia, where the housewife usually simply puts a potato — referred to by the local people as “nota” — directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the burnt potato was taken out by an unwashed hand and eaten by the swallowing.
Daiji sits on the mud — she has no furniture, and this is where she does her daily household chores, such as washing clothes and washing water, which is so thick that it comes from nearby swamps.
There's a bucket in a room without a roof. It's an outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of the four wives of her husband, so she was not assigned to the field.
Polygamy is common here.
It is of course dangerous to work late: most of the men in the village are unemployed and many are drunk and there are many soldiers here.
She said, "No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.."
This is a rare glimpse of everyday life in the highlands of Papua, once a colony of the Netherlands, incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, which was also controversial when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands in front of the army occupying the area.
The current campaign, which is strongly for independence and opposition to Dutch rule, soon again targets the Jakarta Government, which exercises high-handed rule over the region and isolates foreign journalists and defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is remote and empty; it takes 90 minutes from the provincial capital, Jayapula, to fly to Nabyre and then rent a car for five hours, and rides all the way across the river's stomach.
There's no public transport here.
In this town of approximately 19,000 people, outside the cabin is surrounded by bamboo fences, and the wrinkled iron-coated roofs are all kinds of rusty shades.
Few Indonesians came, let alone journalists, and few foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian preacher, Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here as well.
Djay says, "We're not used to these clothes." She means her beautiful handkerchief, her dark shirt and her fancy half skirt.
"We used to cover our bodies with leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and is the region with the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also Indonesia's gold continent.
Paniai County is about the same size as New Jersey, with 153,000 people. The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Glasberg, is only 60 miles from here.
In 2015 alone, Felipe mined around $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, the timber resources in Papua are abundant, with an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, these vast resources are also the source of the tragedy of the Papuans, and that is why the strong military power of Indonesia has been able to keep them down.
According to a 2005 New York Times survey report, Philips paid nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004 to local military personnel and troops, up to $150,000 for one official alone.
The growing claim of the Papuans to independence threatens the gold owner and as a result they have been subjected to cruel treatment.
According to defenders, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the highlands of the Papua tribe in the 1970s escalated into genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Brisbane General diocese, " We will lose everything " , contains evidence of the perfidence of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture — another reported that rape and electrocution were particularly widespread — and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
According to Human Rights Watch Indonesian researcher Andrias Harsono, “violence occurs every day, and it is therefore difficult to calculate the number of victims”.
The repression began when the resources of Papua brought in large numbers of immigrants outside Indonesia.
Eighty-three per cent of the 3.5 million people in the province are Christians, but the demographic structure of Muslim economic migrants has changed since they arrived from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Javan snack stand sells a combination of fried chicken and vegetables, with peanut butter.
The locals struggled.
The 24-year-old Paniai native, Abos Yu, moved to Chayapura, the provincial capital, to find work, explaining that “those immigrants began selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans.
This has caused the local Papuans — the mama-mama — to lose their market.”
During his 2014 campaign, Indonesian President Zorko Widodo, commonly called him Zokovi, vowed to address the inequality and abuse of power in Papua.
The carpenter's road to the Jakarta presidential palace was supported by 27 out of 29 districts, including Paniai.
But there has been no change in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
You said, "We're heartbroken, and in 2014 we voted for Zorkovi, hoping that he will live up to our wishes and restore justice."
In fact, just two months after Zokovi took office in October, Paniai had the worst nightmare ever.
On December 7, 2014, Enarotali 11 children sang a Christmas hymn in front of the bonfire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly came on a motorcycle.
The frightened kids told them to turn on the headlights.
According to the local pastor, Aveit Tebai, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
The victims and witnesses claimed that the drunken soldiers were chasing the children with their guns.
One of the soldiers then opened fire on the children.
The 16-year-old Yulianus Yemmo was severely beaten and unconscious.
A few hours later, a fire broke out in the nearby government agency, the Electoral Commission building, and the incident escalated the following day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of local police stations and military command centres to demand justice.
With ritual bows, they danced the waita of the Babouya Mee Pago tribe -- running around and imitating birds.
Some of the protesters started throwing stones at regular military checkpoints.
According to an official document seen in Times magazine, when the mood continued to intensify, soldiers were ordered by internal radio: “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot immediately.” This document was not made available to the local media.
The young Jeremiah Kayamu, the leader of the Enerotali Kego Koto neighbourhood, felt the imminent danger and appealed to the crowd to calm down and beg them to return home.
But no one's in the mood to listen to him.
He stood on the porch of his beautiful cabin and told Time magazine, "When I turned back, my left wrist was suddenly shot."
Kayamu still does not know who fired the gun, but he said that the bullets came from among the assembled soldiers.
And he said, "It was crowded and they fired a lot of shots."
According to the cousin of a local citizen, Alfyous Yur, he witnessed the shooting and saw that Alfyous Yur was shot three times in his body.
Juhanes sadly told Time magazine, "I ran over to check his body to see if he was him.
I found him dead and I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yoji Mende, told journalists that his subordinates were only at the “protective” police station, which had been attacked.
In 2015, Puggio Sulistio, police spokesperson and police chief of police in Papua, said, “When there are threats to kill us, we must defend ourselves.
It's a matter of life and death."
According to HRW, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killing the following day spread slowly only in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi gave a well-spoken speech in Jayapura, expressing deep sympathy to the families of the victims and vowing to address the abuse of power inherited from the history of Papua.
He said, “I hope that this case will be settled as soon as possible so that it will not happen again in the future”.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Valando, stated that he would establish a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuse for the escape is almost instantaneous.
He said, “Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but that still requires a process.”
Then, on 5 June, in Jakarta, during a conversation with the Times magazine, Vilando went back and said that he had no plans to establish a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, “everything will be settled in accordance with the law”.
The United Nations had filed a complaint against Virando for “crimes against human rights” in the 1999 bloody independence vote in East Timor, but he said that 11 cases of human rights violations in the Papua area had been resolved, including the Panié incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai incident were scorned by these statements.
Juhanes said, “I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed at all”.
Years later, he said, "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I fear being arrested and shot by the army.”
His brother Yukabus also felt that the people of Paniai were afraid to talk about the incident.
He stated that he had been beaten by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
He said, "When the body was buried, the military came to me."
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police opened fire on villagers in Deyai district, Paniai neighbourhood.
A construction company manager refused to assist in transporting a unconscious man to the hospital, and a clash resulted in the death of one man and the wounding of 17 others, including children.
A 24-year-old man, Lavianus Dowu, drowned while fishing near the river and died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company's field office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at the police, so the police fired warning shots.
However, the mobile anti-riot forces (the Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and one person was killed.
Dominiya Bady, aged, told Time magazine that “we were all panicking and now are afraid that they will retaliate.” He lived near the hospital when he witnessed the wounded being rushed into the hospital.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deyai Parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and for the mobile anti-riot forces to be withdrawn from the area.
Panai has always been a land of right and wrong for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has contributed to the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which are scattered in the central highlands of Paniai.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the Papuans by spreading its attacks and abducting Indonesian soldiers by surprise.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Paniai, including Tadius Yuji and Daniel Yodas Kogoa.
As a result, in recent years, thousands of Pani have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military under the guise of “preservation of national sovereignty”.
Some never showed up again.
In the eyes of Papuans, Paniai is a “forgotten place of tragedy”.
Poverty breeds discontent.
Enarotali sells rice that is poor, and the locals can't afford it.
The bread is so far away.
The people here grow what they can eat: mainly potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is a woman ' s job, and each woman can take care of four or five pieces of sweet potatoes.
They usually use the bulk of the harvest for re-authorization and the rest for sale on the local market.
Ten potatoes worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has spread among the local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased significantly since the opening of new routes to the airport at Nabyre.
The few jobs available are usually in the hands of better educated and richer migrants.
Papuans have little money or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
The Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council, John Gobai, said, “Youth do not want to stay in this village because there is no job or money”.
Papua is isolated from the world.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Lonchen were expelled from Papua because they “did not cooperate with the agencies concerned”, even though they had rarely obtained authorization to film.
According to Felim Kane, Deputy Director of Asia, Human Rights Watch, the electoral oath to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development was not met.
In one statement, he stated that “if foreign journalists try to cover the disgruntled provinces of Papua and West Papua in the easternmost parts of Indonesia, there is a new risk that they will be denied visas and blacklisted”.
The absence of media oversight means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely confined to neighbouring countries in Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “all types of widespread human rights violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Almanata Nassir, who had no interest in the group's allegations, told journalists in Jakarta that “the democratic institutions in Indonesia and the freedom of the media make it difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations”.
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention.
According to an informed source, on 4 May, when the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights, Keith Van Bar, led a delegation of officials to Jayapura, the local people broke the silence and cried “We want freedom.” He also attended the meeting, but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans claim that they are unlikely to vote again.
The Chairman of the Tribal Council, Gobai, said that “Zokovi's intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting”.
He wanted to let Zokowi know that the people of Paniai lived not only under the threat of a greedy army but also with nothing, that the region was poorly educated and that public health-care services were scarce.
Gobai said that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, believed that the vote they had cast for Zokovi was a debt that he had to pay.
He said, "They don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting made their last symbolic protest: the body of the victim was buried opposite the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family was killed.
What else can we do?"
On 10 February 2017, the CSRC approved the initial application of Guangdong Huxemburg Co. Ltd. for a detailed exchange of information with China's small and medium-sized board.
According to the industry, with the matchmaking of the home and the succession of the European family, the area of custom-made home, which was already in the air, would shift from competition for products to competition for capital.
At the beginning of the new year, the announcement that a typical representative-brand-based home in the area of customizing the home was about to be placed on the market attracted the attention of the entire household industry.
Reuters, 9 Beijing Time, stated that the release on Tuesday of the first set of auto-drive components developed jointly with Harman International, as well as the information and entertainment solution, was an important initiative for the company to enter the electronic market for military vehicles.
Three star electronics acquired Haman International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Fair (CES) held in Las Vegas this week, Samsung issued vehicle cameras with collision alerts, traffic diversion alerts and cruise control functions, which were developed in cooperation with Haman.
The Samsung project started this year with the delivery of the camera system, which is built on technology such as automatic machine learning and scaling-up.
The three stars also display a “digital cockpit”, which, even if the driver is not the owner of the vehicle, can make the vehicle more personal, as the system allows users to download driver information from mobile devices and clouds.
Tonight, the 20th regular race of the CBA is about to begin, which also means the second half of the CBA tournament in the 2016-2017 season.
The fire has once again swallowed the Tower of Dubai's Torch.
On Friday, a fire broke out in one of the highest residential buildings in the world in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the super-high-rise building, which is 337 metres high, 79 floors tall.
It was the second fire in just two years that swept the high-rise building, and it happened in the sky tower, known as the torch.
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported and no cause of the fire has yet been identified.
“We're sleeping, and then we wake up with a fire alarm and people start screaming.
We run down the stairs, down from 50 floors, it takes about 10 minutes, "A resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Authority, the fire brigade extinguished the fire around 4 p.m. on local time (US$ 00000 Greenwich Standard Time) and is in the process of cooling down the building.
The Government indicated that efforts were being made to provide refuge for those affected.
The accident could rekindle worldwide concerns about the safety of the use of outer-wall materials in high-rise buildings.
A survey carried out by the management of the Ferris Tower following the fire in 2015 found that most of the damaged objects were coated walls for decoration and insulation.
The British police have indicated that they believe that the problems with the insulation and overpanding systems of the Glenfield Building in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire, which killed about 80 people.
The Williams convoy also suggested that Massa might return, although he had announced his retirement.
On 9 January, just one month from the opening of the Ping Chang Winter Olympics in Korea, the atmosphere in the country became stronger as the Olympic fire spreads from the south to the north and preparations intensified.
Korean public opinion expects this long-defeated inter-Korean talks to bring an “egg” to the Ping Chang Winter Olympics in a month's countdown.
On 1 November last year, the Pingchang Winter Olympics holy fire arrived in Korea.
The heat of the fire was reflected directly in the sale of tickets to the Pixen Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the Pixen Winter Olympics ticket sales rate was still at 32 per cent, the Winter Paralympics ticket sales rate was 4.3 per cent, and the low ticket sales rate was once a source of concern for the Pixen Winter Olympics.
But, as Lee Xifan, Chairman of the Panchang Winter Olympic Organizing Committee, recently predicted for journalists, “The Winter Olympics are becoming more and more hot, and it is believed that the sales of tickets will soon improve” with the passage of the Winter Olympic fire across Korea.
According to Korean media reports, as of 3 January, Pingchang Winter Olympics ticket sales had reached 64 per cent, and the Winter Paralympics ticket sales rate had exceeded 50 per cent.
In order to encourage foreigners to go to the Korean Olympics, the Korean Ministry of Justice also announced on 8 that it would extend the stay in Korea for up to 120 days for foreigners visiting Korea to watch the Ping Chang Winter Olympics.
The investigation found that more than one in five American travellers had boarded the plane with prohibited items.
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had boarded the aircraft with illegal items, intentionally or unintentionally, through a United States Transportation and Security Administration checkpoint, and that at least 6 per cent of those passengers had boarded the aircraft unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1 per cent of passengers claimed that they later discovered that they were travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The investigation of more than 1,000 individuals was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc., which also found that young travellers were more likely to be in flagrant disregard of the rules.
19.7 per cent of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately attempted to board TSA prohibited items were millennium generations, compared to less than 15 per cent of the X generation.
The most common items of deliberate pass-through of TSA security officers are food and drinks.
More than 3 per cent admitted to having intentionally carried the blades through security checks, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents indicated that they had intentionally boarded the plane with prohibited drugs.
The company stated that the purpose of the investigation was to find out the number of people who had boarded aircraft by accident and intentionally carrying embargoed goods.
It is not surprising that those most likely to carry embargoed goods through security checks — intentionally or unintentionally — are those who fly most frequently.
However, it noted that the TSA Guide was somewhat complicated and difficult to understand.
It is often uncertain what and how many liquids can be carried.
So it's not surprising that TSA caught the most contraband liquids.
It was once thought that TSA might have used books as an embargo.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry them.
US EPA Prutt changed his mind about Obama's era emissions reduction regulations.
One day after being prosecuted by 15 states, the Director of Environmental Protection, Scott Pruitt, changed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama's era air pollution emissions reduction.
Prute proposed this change, as the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state bodies that regulate the environment than the previous Government.
He did not mention the legal challenges brought by the Federal Court of Appeal against his predecessor.
The controversy focused on setting 1 October as the deadline for states to start meeting the 2015 terrestrial ozone standard.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance for one year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid “disrupting local decision-making or impeding economic growth”.
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Prutt, the State Attorney General of Oklahoma, had long opposed the tightening of environmental regulations.
Since their arrival in Washington, Prute has repeatedly turned to preventing or delaying regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden reverse on Wednesday was one of the most recent legal obstacles to the return of Prute to the agenda.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Director of Environmental Protection had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration ' s requirement that oil and gas companies monitor and mitigate methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Prute proposed a major shift in his attitude towards the ozone standard, expressing the need to strengthen the commitment of the Environmental Protection Agency to work with the states to adopt complex procedures to achieve new standards.
Prute stated that “under the previous government administration, EPA usually did not meet the prescribed deadline and then waited for the radical groups and others to sue and agreed to set a specified timetable by agreement.” He had initiated dozens of prosecutions against EPA in his previous work.
“We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the rules and authorities seriously.”
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that Prutt may again use his “extension authorization and all other legally available authorizations” to ensure that the provisions are consistent with “good policy and best available information”.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for extensive rewriting of ozone layer regulations.
The House Bill approved last month was intended to delay the 2015 rule by at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
The State Attorney of New York, Eric Schneiderman, led the State Union this week to sue the United States Environmental Protection Agency for its intention to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said, "The reverse of the US EPA -- after we filed a lawsuit -- was a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with more than 115 million American communities directly affected by smoke emissions."
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont.
Ground-based ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants from vehicles, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources to sunlight exposure in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive populations, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Prute for his amazing transformation.
Lori Ann Bird, Biodiversity Center, stated: “It is disturbing that this common sense measure is under great pressure from the heads of the departments that protect the air we need to breathe”.
“We must end our struggle with the Trump Government's ideological movement to cater to polluters and special interest groups.”
In addition to external factors such as the heating of steel, enterprises are also struggling to move towards lower costs.
With the return of large areas of the enterprise, steel prices began to fall.
At present neither the China Steel Association nor the National Statistical Office have published any data on the profits of the iron and steel industry for the month of June.
According to the Beijing Railways Bureau, the spring of the 2017 railway runs from 13 January to 21 February, for a total of 40 days.
My goal is to understand the current state of artificial intelligence — progress we are making far beyond what people expect, but there is still a long way to go.
Yesterday, two parcels of land, located on the hill of Hampshire, entered into a live auction, with a total of 1,845.2 million yuan.
Recently, the Japanese animated " Your Name " , which in Japan was the first film to break 20 billion yen in 15 years after becoming Miyazaki ' s director, " Thousands and thousands " , took the second place in the ticket house.
Since the second half of 2009, Xiaoshan Hanaki sales have remained high, especially this spring, when Xiaoshan Hsiaoming sales have reached an all-time high, sales have increased significantly and prices have risen. According to statistics, revenues from the Xiaoshan mountains from January to June of this year increased from the same period last year.4
The Deputy Director of the Xiao Mountain Forestry Authority, Xi Hae Yong, said that, along with good sales, the production of Xiaoshan Hanaki had also developed more rapidly.
During the past two years, the area of Xiaoshan flowerwood cultivation has been expanded by 30,000 acres, with a total area of 180,000 acres, while at the same time there has been an active out-of-area development, with Xiaoshan seedling farmers establishing 80,000 acres of flowerwood bases throughout the country, an increase of 30,000 acres over 2008.
In parallel with the expansion of the area under cultivation, the quality of seedlings has been improving, the value of nurseries has been increasing, large-scale, high-quality seedlings have been retained and some of them have been sold.
He also warned that, in the face of the current boom, producers should face it with calm and objective analysis, recognizing that the demand for flowers in society will be long-term and increasing, while recognizing that there will be more competition in the market.
On the morning of 13 July Beijing time, the United States company Somaltus filed a suit in the Eastern Texas District Court against Apple for violating a battery technology patent that it had applied for in 2010.
The same patents were used by the company in the past to sue Huasumi, Associatives, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.
The suit alleged that both iPhone 6s and similar apple equipment violated US patent No. 7,657,386, entitled Integrated Battery Services.
The plaintiff sought compensation in cash or a patent fee for post-judgement tort equipment.
It appears from the indictment that the plaintiff argued that the iPhone ' s fast-filling function violated the company ' s patent.
iPhones with fast charge functions quickly charge up to 80 per cent of the charge, followed by trickle-up charge.
Somaltus is in fact a so-called “proprietary hooligan” because it does not provide obvious products and services and it is difficult to find relevant information online.
However, they have been successful in reaching an out-of-court settlement with car manufacturers such as Ford and Nissan on the patent.
The meeting recognized the importance of accelerating information development, promoting the integration and efficient use of resources, and raising the level of digitalization and intelligence in the industry, in promoting “China to create 2025” and popular entrepreneurship and innovation, in fostering new energy and in improving the quality of life of the population.
Taiwan's hot-blooded youth film, The Six-Do Café, by Dong Jianxian, is a big-time media competition for the current film festival, while another, his Chinese-language film, The Duran, is competing for the Golden Lord's Award.
He's 23 years old. He's wearing t-shirts, black sports pants, and he's young and sunny. Because there's not enough chairs in the interview room, he just sits on the floor, and he says, "Come on, it's nice to talk."
As a result, it has been revealed that the railway sector has expanded the 12306 website, introduced new services during the spring ticket purchase period, and that nearly 60 per cent of tickets no longer require certification codes.
According to leaked phone records, Trump had pressured Mexico to pay for the construction of the border.
The Washington Post leaked telephone records between United States President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On 27 January, in a call to the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
It was reported that the President of the United States had expressed dissatisfaction with his public criticism of the wall, as he had allegedly said to him, “Don't tell the media”.
During the presidential campaign, Trump pledged to build the separation wall on the southern border of the United States and solemnly announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
His telephone records with the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, were also made public, showing an intense exchange between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the United States deal with the repatriation of refugees to Australia was “preposterous”, “disgusting” and “breathless”, and that he had recommended that the United States ban the resettlement of refugees and was now insisting on the deal brokered by the Obama administration, which would make him look like a “dumb”.
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull that this was the most unpleasant call of the day.
In an award-winning speech read by the United States Ambassador in Sweden, Dylan stated that he was on his way to the tour when he received the award, “it took me a while to react”.

The high-level talks between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea ended in Panmunjom on the evening of 9 January in Seoul, Xinhua, where the two sides issued a joint statement and agreed on the DPRK ' s participation in the Pingchang Winter Olympics and the military sector talks between the two sides.
In accordance with the joint statement issued by the two sides, the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea will send a high-level delegation and a delegation from the National Olympic Committee to participate in the Pingchang Olympic Games.
In addition, the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea will send groups such as athletes ' groups, cheerleaders, art groups, journalists ' groups to visit Korea, which will provide the necessary facilities.
The Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea also agreed to reduce the current military tension and decided to hold talks between the Korean and Korean military components.
The report analyses the results of the questionnaire survey involving 1,045 foreign tourists who visited Seoul last December.
According to the report, the per capita value of purchases by foreign tourists was 1.06 million won.
Of these, China has the largest per capita purchases of 2,130,000 won, 6.5 times the number of Japanese tourists and 3.2 times the number of American and European tourists.
Asked about the purpose of travelling to Seoul, 62.2 per cent of Chinese tourists answered “shopping” and 94.9 per cent of Chinese tourists bought cosmetics.
96.3 per cent of Chinese tourists shop in municipal duty-free shops at a cost of 1.56 million won per capita.

The Moor Beach tragedy: Racist lynchings and justice for activists
A 1948 Ford Mercury car ran through a crowd of viewers in the town of Monroe, Georgia, towards the little Moor Beach Bridge.
The vehicle was carrying four black passengers and a white driver, and a group of white men with guns went in front of the bridge, blocking the way forward.
The mob leader, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, took a deep breath of cigars and looked into the windshield.
The passengers in the car were full of fear.
"We want-- Roger!" that man shouts.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged down from a former row of passenger seats and screamed in silence.
Fortunately, on July 22, this terrible scene was just a repeat.
But when the neck of “Roger” was lined up, almost all the viewers made a real sound of breathing.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moor Beach Bridge, reproducing the scene of two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm, and George and Mérè Dossi, who were hanged by three-K lynchings in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
“Although we know who they are, and although we have seen them in the community, none of them has been arrested over the years, which is incredible,” Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize this repetition, said.
“This is the stain of history, the burden of our souls.”
Brooks, 71 years old, was a former member of Georgia's Parliament and a lifelong defender of rights.
For him, the repetition was a remarkable call that reminded the people of the Monroe community every year that injustice had never been redressed.
“We want to prosecute, we want to close, we want to heal, we want to reconcile, but we must first get justice,” he said.
“Unless we get justice, we will not be cured and reconciled.”
On 27 July 1946, the coroner laid a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the lynching on Moor Beach.
According to the FBI file obtained by the National Broadcasting Corporation of the United States, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in lynchings.
None of them, however, had ever been prosecuted.
Although suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists have stated that the dual motives for lynchings are well known throughout the town: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the initial elections later in the summer of that year.
According to the FBI, at about the same time, the black tenant Roger Malcolm stabbed white landlord Barnett Hearst in a fight that looked like it was for a woman.
Brooks said that the town rumor was that Hearst had slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband's.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the prominent white landlord, Roy Harrison, spent $600 to release Malcolm on bail.
Dorothy and cousins Michael Murray and George Dorsey accompanied him to prison.
However, when they returned from prison to the Moor Beach Bridge, a mob of thugs surrounded the car.
“It turns out that Harrison organized and ordered the murder,” an FBI report concluded.
“It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement authorities, who not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witness.”
Brooks is very concise.
He said, “This is a tragic vote.”
“They were murdered and the murderer sent a message to the black people of this community: ‘If you register and vote, you will have the same end.”
For almost a decade, Cassandra Green has been responsible for leading the annual recurrence of the lynchings at the Moor Beach Bridge.
Her modus operandi was impressive, well-known and had a profound racist background. Many hoped that that racism would cease to exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, not harder to see, but Green says that's the key.
“We don't want to talk about lynching, because lynching makes us face the ugly side of everyone”, she said.
“But if you don't listen to me or hear me tell my story, I can't have a relationship with you.”
This year's performance began in June, with nearly 30 actors on the first day - a dozen whites, the rest of them blacks - combing in a room and listening to Green's release of a rehearsald performance overview.
Wade Malbau was co-director of Green.
He's been playing the role of the three Ks for years, but he says it's never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Malbau said.
“But I think it is very important to keep this history alive, because we do not want to go back to that era.”
In the room, actors like Roger Malcolm and Barnetthurst, Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, are rehearsing their lines.
At the beginning of the scene, Malcolm shouted and pushed Hearst away, angry that he had slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, get out of my house!"
Rascona echo.
And then they fought.
And then everybody laughter.
Green had the greatest laugh.
"What's going on?
He was panicking and confused.
Did I go too far?
"No," Green laughed.
"I just don't think white people say "ah" when they strike back."
"Yes," another black actor plays fun.
"You have to be strong."
As a result, the energy in the room has changed; the feeling of fraternity has driven the feeling of discomfort away.
Everyone tried to do so not only to perform the scene, but also to honour the memory of the four victims.
The scene begins again.
And this time, when Rascona said the word "ah", it was sharp and strong.
No one's laughing.
The reoccurrence came to a strong and quick end.
The screams, the gunshots, then the silence.
A woman dressed in black in funeral clothes stood next to the body of the actor and sang Billy Harold's words of condolence, the strange fruit.
Her voice slammed over other words.
About 40 viewers, 100 yards away, are swirling their sweat and tears.
Blacks and whites make up almost half of the audience.
There was a couple who came to see the show from Isaka, New York, and a lot of people lived near the road.
Brooks took them to the cemetery of Malcolm and Dorothy for nearly eight hours, and everyone was enduring Georgia's uncomfortable wet fever.
Until then, the murderer remained obsessed. But now, on the same land where lynchings took place, there was anxiety in the air.
When the last note of the song disappeared, Green asked people to come closer and examine the body of the actor.
The children bowed down, watched fake blood and bodies and whispered among themselves.
"They're not really dead," a little boy whispers to himself as if he were reminding himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and then the show ended.
The actor threw away the lynching rope and wiped out the tears.
Bradshaw embraces a man in a suit who plays the three K's leader, Malbau.
Nick Rascona hugged two of his colleagues and wept in their arms; the emotions in the performance eventually infected him.
“It's okay,” one of the women whispered.
“We know that your heart is not that way.
There's a reason you're doing this."
After that, the audience sat down and had dinner with the actors.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted closely with a black couple they had just met and talked about reoccurrence.
Dennis Duplinski had difficulty finding words to describe how she felt after watching.
“It is hard to imagine those terrible words and acts... which are made out of people like you, because they look like you,” she said.
“This really makes me think that lynching is still going on,” she added, “Now this is just a police shooting.”
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sits at the table watching, tasted and reminiscent of civil rights.
He said he'd already started planning next year's performance.
“Recurrence is an encouraging way because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also very educational,” he said.
“If you do not learn from it, it may happen again.
Those who do not study and do not know their own history are doomed to repeat their mistakes.”
For gas market-based reforms, the importance of “net independence” reforms is self-evident, but resistance and controversy are also greater.
The journalist was informed by Kaiji Hebei Group that at 11.25 a.m. on 7 a.m., 13 workers were trapped in an explosion at the emulsification workshop of the Kaiser Chemical Company Ltd., located in the ancient smelting area of Tangshan City, Hebei Province.
To date, of the 13 people trapped, one has been rescued and rushed to hospital, while the remaining 12 are under intense search and rescue.
It is known that the scene has been closed and that the local public security, fire and medical services are in the process of being rescued.
According to witnesses, there was a loud noise and an instant mushroom cloud emptied.
According to members of the Open Group, which organized a search and rescue on the ground, Tangshan Kaihai Chemical Co. Ltd. is located north of Zhao Chao, a State-approved site production company for civilian blast equipment located in the Gumel district of Tangshan City, Hebei Province. It was established in 1958 under the name of the Open Mining Authority.

US medium: China Air Force Engineering University scientist researching laser satellites for the removal of space debris
The American media reported on January 18 that Chinese scientists had made a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up chaotic Earth orbits and destroy old satellites and their sky trash.
According to a 15 January report on the United States Newsweek website, researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled " Study on small-scale space debris transformation models for space-based laser removal " , which describes how space debris can be irradiated by lasers with less harm through the use of space-based platform lasers.
It was reported that space debris had been the concern of international space agencies for many years and that NASA had considered a variety of options for tracking, detecting and removing artificial debris.
Large-scale space debris is removed by means of meganets used to clean and collect waste, as well as magnets that can be used to exorcise them out of orbit. Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean up Earth orbits.
The summary of the paper states: “(Simulation studies) provide the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based platform laser removal technology.”
A 2014 study by Lockheed-Martin, the giant of the United States defence industry, found that there were approximately 200 threats per day for satellites in orbit.
High-speed debris moving along Earth orbit is considered a serious threat to future space missions and has been described by experts from the European Space Agency as a “lethal chain of threats”. High-speed debris has continued to grow over the past year.
It is also reported on January 17, of the United States monthly magazine Mass Machinery, that space is essentially empty, but space next to the Earth is becoming increasingly crowded. Each satellite that we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris around the Earth and, over time, it will accumulate.
The more debris there is, the more likely a satellite that is still operational will be hit by debris, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of dollars.
It was reported that all space agencies had plans to remove space debris in the future.
NASA was considering using jet gas to reduce the speed of debris and de-orbit it, Europe was considering launching a satellite with a large net to capture debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan was thinking of using an electric chain to capture debris.
At the moment, China is also proposing a solution to the problem of space debris, namely, the use of a large laser device to destroy floating space debris into less harmful small fragments.
According to a paper published by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University in the German monthly optical magazine, the installation of such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean space, at least on the basis of simulations.
It was reported that the only way to prove effectiveness was to conduct tests and that there were no arrangements for such missions, but perhaps sooner or later people would install lasers on satellites and send them into space.
Once that has been done, we can finally start ridding space debris once and for all.

Retrenchment of 3000 positions by PSC, substantial reduction of dividends to revive operations
On Friday, the British Education Group called for an additional 3000 jobs and a substantial reduction of 72 per cent of the medium-term dividends, as it had started another restructuring project to deal with operational pressures.
According to Chief Executive Officer John Fallon, most of the post reductions would take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, after 4000 posts had been reduced in the previous reorganization.
PSC announced in May that it plans to cut an additional Pound300 million ($394 million) in the third cost-cutting project in order to revive operations that have been hit by rapid developments in digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its shares in the Penguin Landon Bookhouse to partner Betasman, and published a report that its basic sales rose by 1 per cent in the first half of the year to Pound205 billion, but that this year ' s outlook remains unchanged.
A few days ago, the China Association issued a serious notice, severely shunned the phenomenon and was prepared to impose a heavy penalty on violators for life.
A suicide bombing attack on the convoy in Kabul killed NATO soldiers
According to official sources, a military convoy was hit by suicide bombers in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
The NATO statement stated that five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in this incident in the Karabagh area of the city.
This is the latest violent attack on Afghanistan - the bombing of the Herat mosque on Tuesday caused more than 30 deaths.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO statements, an explosion occurred on Thursday night and a joint Afghan-NATO coalition patrol was attacked by “individuals carrying improvised explosive devices”.
The statement stated that all the wounded were currently in a stable state and were being treated at the United States military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to journalists, the growing Taliban and so-called Islamic State (IS) organizations in the Karabakh region have raised serious concerns about NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, compared to approximately 20 per cent in the capital.
A suicide car bomb attack in late July in the Shia-dominated area of Kabul resulted in at least 30 deaths.
The Taliban claimed to have launched the attack.
On 31 May, a huge explosion took place in the centre of Kabul, killing more than 150 people, the deadliest attack by armed elements in the country since the overthrow of the Taliban by the United States-led multinational force in 2001.
The violence highlighted the precarious security situation in Afghanistan at a time when United States President Donald Trump weighed whether or not to increase Afghan troops in support of his army and police.
Journalists have reported that suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the Government and its policies, in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) action to overturn resolution and delay smoke regulations
When Obama came into office, he imposed a ban on all types of emissions that cause smoke, 15 states, because it sued the National Environmental Protection Agency of the United States. One day after the indictment, EPA overthrew the regulation.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision on Wednesday to continue the so-called “Ozone 2015” zone and pledged that it would work with the states.
In a statement, the United States Director of Environmental Protection, Scott Pruett, said, “We have confidence in dialogue with and are committed to responding to national partners”.
Pruett announced in June that the EPA plans to postpone the implementation of the ozone compliance area standard until October 2018, with a one-year delay - according to which existing smoke pollution in parts of the country is measured to determine which areas should reduce emissions of smoke pollution,
On Tuesday, the main states of the Democratic Party and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit alleging that the act had been unlawful.
As part of a broader agenda, President Donald Trump ' s authorities have been working to revive the environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama to stimulate economic growth.
But these efforts have provoked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups, who fear that more emissions will affect public health.
The US EPA website states that breathing ozone-containing air “reduces lung function and increases respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.

McKee Garcia and Vasili Lomachenko met for the first time to explore possible future battles.
The most notable boxing contest of up to 147 pounds will take place shortly, with Vasili Lomachenko and Macky García meeting for the first time on Thursday, now in a state of potential conflict.
In separate rooms in Los Angeles ESPN's office, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion García took the lead down the corridor, paying tribute to the World Boxing Organization's super-featile champion, Lomachenko.
At the Showtime fight on Saturday, the referee unanimously concluded that García had won the victory of Adrian Bronner, the world champion of the four subdistricts, and that both fighters had become the top five players on the same weight list.
Garcia reached out to her right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck with that."
In the ESPN competition on Saturday night at 7 p.m., Lomachenko won Miguel Mariaga and preserved his position.
When both of them took photographs, Egis Clemás, the agent of Lomachenko, pointed out that the potential confrontation between the two players depended on “the perfect size”.
"I was lightweight before," Garcia leads.
"I went up against Bronner, but I didn't weigh that much.
Compared to 140 pounds, I'm a little overweight.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he had to be lightweight (135 pounds) before we could fight.
That's what fans want.
Then we'll meet them."
This was agreed to by Lomachenko.
"The boxing world needs this battle."
Clemás asked him if he should pay the fees, and part of his strategy was to get Lomachenko to run a premiere with a 135-pound player later this year, hoping to set a date with Garcia next summer. Garcia was also interested in the 9th.
“Since all the fans are asking the question, the fight may be on a charge-by-charge basis,” says Garcia. Then he expresses his openness to the competition on the network that offers the best financial options.
“We are the principals.
No one else could have generated such a great deal of attention.
As long as they're ready..."
García appreciates Lomachenko as an “excellent player” and may be watching his boxing match on Saturday.
But Lomachenko was hesitant about Garcia's praise, saying he thought that this tri-district champion from Riverside looked "so slow." Sorry, Mikey you're gonna be out."
García said that the focus was on showing the power of the fist and then boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing contests.
“This is the battle that has to be fought.
Attention and heat are beyond the reach of other boxing competitions.
I'd be happy to compete, "Jascia says.
He said, “I've been waiting for top fighters, and this time it's Mikey's turn.
This will be a great battle.”
Promotion of environmental protection yesterday, a major environmental volunteering event on the theme “Green Homes, Booby West City” was held in West Town.
Unlike traditional methods of garbage collection and distribution of promotional materials, the sponsors have set up six special game experience areas, including water-saving toilet displays, enzyme production experiences, traffic domino dominoes, etc.
At present, many young people in the country have dropped out of school because of the targeting of professional golfers and are on a smooth career path, let alone taking into account universities.
The early completion of the 11 per cent reduction target by officials of the China Development and Reform Commission (CDRC) has given a strong expectation of recovery to the steel industry, which is constrained by limited electricity production.
Although the steel plant has not yet received a clear notification from the local government that energy-saving emission reductions have been closed, it is estimated in industry that, on or about 15 December 2010, steel plants that were otherwise restricted will be reproducing and the price of steel will begin to be pressured.
No notification of the end of the restrictions has been received, but in practice the pressure from businesses has been considerably lower than in September and October, when a private steel company in Hebei province told journalists.
In the northern part of the river, restricted production documents have been issued repeatedly and, at one point, businesses have been restricted in the form of forced locks.
Journalists have learned from local businesses that steel plants in most of Hebei have now resumed work and production restrictions have been eased.
My steel network analyst, Zhang Tieshan, expects that the end demand for building steel will gradually shift from strong to weak due to the winter in the north.
The phase-out of energy-saving emission reductions will lead to the resumption of most steel plants by 15 December and the arrival of products in local markets by New Year ' s Day.
The increase in the availability of resources will put some pressure on the right price of steel.
On 20 December, Chinese intelligent car-related sources told journalists at www.thepaper.cn that Chinese communications had acquired 70 per cent of the shares of the Joohai Guangdong passenger vehicle, on the basis of which they had formed a smart car team for communications between China and China.

International Online News (journalist Liu Xing): On 18th, the Economic and Commercial Affairs Branch of the Italian Embassy in China organized a China-Italy Environmental Relations Conference, which resulted in an extensive exchange of views and a positive consensus on cooperation between the two countries in the field of renewable resources in the light of the new situation.
It was reported that China was represented mainly by China Renewable Resources Development Ltd., China ' s International Technology Transfer Collaborative Network, and that it was composed of institutions such as the Global Energy Environment Exchange and the Bologna Regional Business Federation of Italy.
The representative of Italy said that Italy had diverse environmental technologies and solutions in the field of renewable resources and proposed pilot projects with China on industrial waste disposal, waste oil treatment and waste incineration equipment, while looking forward to extending China ' s environmental cooperation experience to other parts of the world.
Publication of the results of the latest age assessment test for asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest method used by Swedish asylum-seekers to medically assess their age shows that more than 80 per cent of those tested were sentenced to over 18 years of age, but not all were convinced of their accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (R?ttsmedicinalverket) started this test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees who claim to be minors, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) designed these tests with a view to conducting a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
To date, the Swedish Migration Board has brought 6880 testers, and the Centre for Forensic Medicine has now published the results of a total of 2481 testers for the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002 persons) were sentenced to 18 years of age or older, but in 25 other cases, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine determined that the subject “may have reached 18 years of age or more”.
In 432 tests, the result was that the person “may not have reached the age of 18”.
The test is only for persons whose age is in doubt.
According to John Grant of the Forensic Medicine Centre, these results are consistent with those of the previous months.
He told The Local: “The data are not very different from those of the previous months, and the figures are very consistent.”
The higher proportion of those over 18 years of age who have been convicted does not necessarily mean that the asylum-seekers falsely declare their age.
In May, the Centre published 581 test results and stated 442 cases “indicating that the subject had reached the age of 18 or over”.
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of the 581 tests released and found that 243 of them had publicly indicated that they would be 18 this year.
The method of medical assessment was also questioned in some areas by means of an X-ray examination of the smart teeth, an MRI scan of joints, and analysis of the results by dentists and radiologists.
One of the suspects is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to determine whether they undergo puberty earlier or later than normal age.
He told the newspaper Metro: “I have reason to think so, and I don't think that's the way to measure it.
The determination of the biological age in this way is inaccurate.
If we cannot guarantee accuracy, we should not pretend that we can do it.”
However, Grantson of the Forensic Science Centre defended the accuracy of these tests: “It is generally safe to say that there is a small risk of uncertainty in determining a child as an adult”.
The greatest risk is that the person happens to be under the age of 18, which is about 10 per cent.
The governor of West Virginia has announced a party change.
Thursday night, Jim Justice, Governor of the West Virginia Democratic Party, announced at a rally of President Trump that he would change the party.
"I like it, I don't like it, the Democrats have left me," said the governor's judge.
“Today, after a lot of prayers and a lot of thought, I would like to tell you that today I am going to tell you as a West Virginian that I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor.”
The rally broke out with cheers.
“So, tomorrow, I'll turn the Republican party into a Republican”, Justin added.
"As a coach, I'm gonna tell you it's time to start another game."
Trump promised a major announcement at an earlier rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42% of the vote in West Virginia, and Justin didn't support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justin was selected as the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
According to Forbes, he inherited his father ' s coal industry and owned coal mines in each of the five Länder.
At the moment, he's worth about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Council issued a statement on Thursday evening stating: “Governor Justinian's change is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, not to prevent our country from becoming once again great, but to make our country once again great”.
“Democrats now have only 15 governors, and control of the State Council is the lowest in history. The Governor's statement is the latest rejection of a political party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unifying slogan.” Rona McDaniel, President of the Republican National Committee, is heading for the CBS.

Sebastian Ko applauds Russia's “probably” apology for the stimulant scandal.
On Thursday, the President of IAF, Sebastian Ko, expressed appreciation for Russia's apology for the stimulant scandal and stated that the apology was “offensive”, but reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to re-engage in the campaign.
At the International Congress held on the eve of the World Athletics Championship, the President of the Russian Association of Athletics and Athletics, Mitri Chirac, stated that his country was rightly prohibited from participating in the campaign and that he was determined to combat doping.
He expressed his regret that “all athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were deprived of medals”.
Despite his comments, the Congress voted to maintain the ban. Previously, the report of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) mentioned the discovery of evidence of Russian state-sponsored doping, which was implemented in November 2015.
“I think today's response was very frank and very frank,” the FIDA Chair told the press.
“The Council as a whole and the General Assembly of the Federation are pleased ... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has gone through a very hot period and is doing everything in its power to ensure that Russia can retake the game.”
He said that he was also “joyed” that Russia had accepted the criteria for re-entry.
“I think that this is a very constructive day and that we have made some progress, but the United Nations General Assembly supports the Panel's recommendations, and this is not the time to reinstate Russia's candidacy.”
“We need to do everything in our power to normalize this situation in the coming months.
Our guiding principle has been the desire to separate innocent athletes from the contaminated system”, he added.

On 18 January, the yuan was presented at the United States dollar median price of 6.4401 and the median price depreciated by 66 basis points at the date of the previous transaction, ending the previous five consecutive increases.
The overnight market, the United States dollar warmed up, and the dollar index moved out of the V-word form, reporting 90.89000 as of 07:30 Beijing Time.
According to the Federal Reserve ' s publication of the Economic Brown Book, almost all 12 Federal Reserve regions reported moderate to moderate growth in economic activity at the beginning of 2018, maintaining optimism about the prospects for the current year.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate in the United States remained at 4.1 per cent in December, the lowest since 2000, and businesses are expected to increase their wages in the coming months.
Tax conversion is widely perceived by Federal Reserve officials as a factor supporting this modestly strong economic outlook, with the Fed forecasting an economic growth rate of 2.5 per cent in 2018, with an interest increase of three times.
Marketers have pointed out that, in recent times, the ECB’s monetary policy has tightened its expectations to boost the euro’s exchange rate, that the dollar index has continued to fall, and that the renminbi’s exchange rate against the dollar has accordingly increased rapidly, although at present it is unlikely that the ECB will be able to adjust its policy stance quickly, and that short-term fluctuations in foreign exchange markets will eventually turn to fundamentals.
It is worth noting that the attractiveness of renminbi assets to offshore investors has become increasingly apparent as markets are expected to stabilize more.
The People ' s Bank of China authorized the China Exchange and Exchange Centre to publish the median value of the exchange rate of the renminbi in the inter-bank foreign exchange market on 18 January 2018 as follows: US$ 1 vs. RMB 6,4401; Euro 1 vs. RMB 7.8482; JPY 100 vs. RMB 5.7854; HK$ 1 vs. the People ' s Republic of China

What is the impact of football financial rules on Neymar's transition to Paris?
The rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending by the European Haomen Football Club do not prevent Nemal from moving from the Barcelona Club in Spain to the St. Germain Football Club in Paris (PSG) in France at record prices.
As a result, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has further downgraded the football club in St. Gilman’s, Paris. The Union of European Football Associations is the governing body of European football games and has the right to ban teams from participating in widely publicized Eurocap leagues.
The Financial Fair Contest Rules (FFP) launched by the Federation of European Football Federations in 2011 meant that the Paris Club of Football in St. Germain would eventually have to prove that Nemal’s transfer would be funded without significant losses.
The Barcelona Club has already disbursed €222 million ($262 million) simply to cover the cost of dissolving the Brazilian player, whose salary will be as high as tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are some of the financial implications of Nemal's transfer to France.
Considering that the team is funded by the rich Qatari ruling family, the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris can, of course, sign Namar in cash and include him in the ranks of other stars.
Clubs can spend a lot of money on their players, but they must use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge amount of money they spend in order to achieve a balance of gains and losses in football-related operations.
The Financial Fair Contest Rules were conceived by Michel Platini following his election as President of the Federation in 2007.
According to the former French player, if banks or owners withdraw support funds for clubs that are heavily indebted for success, they are actually deceiving and putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from club debt to club loss monitoring.
This change means that Rome? The business model used by Roman Abramovich when he acquired the Chelsea Club in 2003, namely, to buy a club with potential and then spend a lot of money to improve the team and create a global brand, is now in a much more demanding position.
During the three-year rule assessment period up to 2018, the club may lose Euro30 million.
Despite Abu being devalued by the current president in 2015, Aleksander Ceferin, a successor to the Federation, remains committed to stopping excessive spending.
“Of course, the Rules have not lapsed, and we will certainly strengthen future regulations.” Andrew Traverso, who is in charge of the Rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although the Némal buyout clause will be paid in one lump sum by the St. Germain Football Club in Paris, it may also be allocated for accounting purposes within the contractual period.
Nemal had signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer of contributions might be shown in the annual account for the next five years at a cost of Euro44.4 million.
The first wave of rule sanctions imposed in 2014 brought the most severe sanctions to the St. Germain Football Club in Paris and the Manchester City Club under the banner of Abu Dhabi.
The St. Germain Football Club in Paris was fined Euro60 million ($82 million at the time), which was reduced to Euro20 million, and demanded that the team be reduced to 21 instead of the normal 25 in the 2014-15 season.
The Federation is looking at clubs that seek to increase income by linking to the owners of the clubs and to deceive financial regulators.
While Qatari companies can sponsor the St. Germain Football Club in Paris, if the amount of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market price, the Federation will not consider it to be a legitimate income.
This occurred in 2014, when the Federation ruled that the amount of the Qatar Tourist Board ' s sponsorship of the St. Germain ' s Football Club in Paris had been overstated.
It was reported that a portion of Nemar ' s income at the St. Germain Football Club in Paris might come from payments made by the Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee in 2022.
However, both the St. Germain Football Club in Paris and the Organizing Committee denied that Nemal would be an ambassador to the World Cup, and such an initiative would be easy for the regulatory bodies of the Federation.
The recent sanctions imposed on the St. Germain Football Club in Paris mean that the Federation will be more vigilant about any attempt to circumvent the rules.
According to informed sources on Thursday, the Federation did not engage in pre-discussions with the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris on the transfer of Nemal.
The above-mentioned individuals contacted the Associated Press in an anonymous capacity only because they were not authorized to discuss the situation at the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris.
According to the last published accounts, the operating income of the St. Gilman ' s Football Club in Paris was Euro542.4 million in 2015-16 and more than Euro10 million in profits.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not been disclosed.
The Club de Football St. Germain in Paris anticipates that the Congregation of Nemal will bring the evangelical benefits of sponsorship activities, franchising and the sale of jerseys.
The club is expected to increase revenue by at least 30 per cent after the signing of the Namar camp.
It is clear that the Spanish coalition, deeply angry at seeing one of the most famous players leave, tried to block Nemal ' s move and claimed that the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris violated the Rules.
USC President Javier Tebás told the Spanish newspaper AS that “this is a clear example of a `financial stimulant', with the same clubs and countries”, referring to Qatar, which has the ultimate ownership of the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris.
Arsene Wenger, coach of the Ascennar team (the club's owner is an American sports tycoon), has reservations about the attitude of the state-funded club and the West Armour tournament.
"This is the consequence of ownership, which has completely changed the whole ecology of football for the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the State has a club, everything happens.
This would make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, since there are many different ways or interests for a country to require large players to represent a country.”
Robid, an intelligent interactive robot developer, has a new investment.
In recent years, start-ups in the area of artificial intelligence have continued to benefit from capital.
Artificial intelligence Rukid has recently completed a new round of financing, led by Leamasi, with Swiss credit, CDIB (an investment agency under the Taiwan China Development Finance Corporation) and old shareholder IDG capital, among others.
The scale of the current round of financing is known to be approximately $100 million, with Swift and CDIB appearing for the first time in domestic financing transactions in the area of artificial intelligence.
Rokid is an intelligent interactive robotic researcher dedicated to robotic research. The product operates home-based smart devices with continuous autonomous learning and growth functions, as well as recognition, comprehension, feedback, etc.
This round of financing will be used primarily for R & D, talent acquisition, strategic push and investment mapping in the industrial chain.
In August 2014, Rokid received $8.3 million in Angel Round Investment in IDG, linear capital, Mfund, and Yuanji capital; in October 2015, the company received tens of millions of dollars in A Round Investment in Walden International;
At that time, Rakid stated that the post-financing B valuation had reached $450 million.
In May 2017, Rukid released the consumer-grade smart voice robot “Rocky Moon Stone”, combining artificial intelligence and family scenery at a price of $1399.
The robot uses speech synthesis, natural language understanding, speech recognition technology and microphone array technology, with chatting, music playing and smart home functions.
He was awarded two prizes at the International Consumer Electronics Fair Tech For A Better World and Home Audio/Vidio Components and Accessors, as well as the German IF Design Award, known as Oscar in the design community.
On the recently concluded 2018 CES, Rokid published a new product: the consumer-level enhancement reality ARGlass.
The glasses will be used as stand-alone head displays, i.e. without connection to smartphones or external computers, and are expected to be commercialized in 2018.
Previously, the company had released the first-generation family robot, Rokid Alien, and the second-generation smartphone, Rokid Pebble.

According to Apple, the iCloud service in the Mainland of China will be transferred from the Yunna Gui State Company as of 28 February this year.
Apple stated that “cooperation with Kuozhou will enable us to continue to improve the speed and reliability of iCloud services, in keeping with the new regulations in China that cloud services must be operated by local enterprises”.
During the period of deactivation, the data previously stored by the user in iCloud will also be stored in iCloud and will not be lost.
If the user wishes to use the iCloud service after 28 February, the new terms and conditions will need to be accepted to ensure that the account is reactivated and moved to Kuozhou.
At the same time, Apple emphasized in its statement that “Apple has strong data privacy and security protection mechanisms and does not create back doors in any of our systems”.
The primary data centre for the iCloud Queen's New Zone will also be the first data centre project established by Apple in China, which, when completed, will be used to store data from Chinese apple users.
When built and put into use, Chinese users are uploading and downloading data without having to transmit back and forth over long distances between China and the United States, increasing speed and reducing delays.

The Nostalgia Infective Market - Camp Harald and The Detectives.
This story is recapitulated in memory of the actors of the 80s, the 80s, and the 1990s, the era of garbage.
As a cultural art, it is an imitation and a reflection of our permanent memory in the Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is running out.
The first day of the camp echoed strongly, but not only because of its absurd humor (theatrical story about a talking vegetable canned by H. Jon Benjamin).
The double use of cynics in dramas -- middle-aged actors playing kids at the age of trouble -- makes it impossible to go back to the past and become a funny part of it.
In Ten Years later, adults play a real role as adults, their emotions are less entrenched and their mimicry is more widespread, including the improvising creation of stalking films in the 1990s, such as The Hand of Boostering the Cradle.

Many core stories are the same.
Mr. Sugar is now a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie.
Victor (Ken Mariño) remains a virgin.
There was also another treacherous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Seward), instigated by George H. W. Bush (Michael Ian Black, impressive).
As always, the best part of this series is interjection.
It was particularly interesting to see Mr. Luther, who was always young, showing off Matt Dillon's soul patch in the film Single Nobility, and Andy in the former School Giant now felt like a giant.
This is a time of random madness that could give impetus to this film, like the Recital Seven Years of Life series, until it comes to what I think is a logical conclusion: Camp Harald: Twenty Years Later, the last act of which was to get these guys to watch the premiere of Camp Harald.
At the same time, the Amazon's Detectives and Males spoke of different nostalgia: Cold War Renaissance, America's Enigma, the film The Coldest City, and even the East-West Wrestling-like GLOW: The Glory Woman's Wrestling League.
This comedy, written by Brian Gaitwood and Alejandro Tanaka, was pushed onto the television screen by director Reese Thomas: it's a comedy film with a story set in Romania in the '80s about two Bucharest officials for the truth.

It's a wonderful idea.
But this is not just an idea.
Some of them are very good visual (the police watch chess play time on TV because Americans like to play football).
And there were a lot of celebrities -- including Jenny Slater, Nick Ofman, Mahsala Hashbaz Ali and Kolo Sevini -- who made a wonderful sound.
But Detective Twos is so dedicated to creating a loud and genuine comedy where there's a killer with a Reagan mask, and it usually plays that role.
The television of the six episode was slightly delayed and the comedy effect was not released quickly or frequently.
The long-edited version of " Detective Two Males " was even more rigorous, with a better sarcasm effect when Gregor and Essev visited the United States Embassy repeatedly, as two fat boys were always swallowing a bunch of hamburgers in the embassy lobby.

Recent interviews by journalists have revealed a general decline and even a loss in the benefits of steel, orbital traffic, ships and machinery manufacturing in the north-east.
Some experts were of the view that, under the current circumstances, the new round of industrial revitalization in the north-east was not only related to the economic recovery of the country, but would also have an impact on the long-term development of our manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, and that it was therefore urgent to restructure the transformation.
The general decline in business performance in the traditional sector, which is more costly to the raw materials industry and the manufacturing industry of heavy machinery and equipment, has suffered a severe decline or even losses, which is the primary manifestation of the economic downturn in the current round of medium- and north-east industries.
In the past, the economic downturn was characterized mainly by low-end and high impact on primary products, but this economic volatility affected both high-end and low-end industrial products from traditional Northeast industries.
The Saddle Steel Group (Webbo) began with the restructuring of its products in previous years, focusing on the development of high-end panels such as container boards, steel tracks, shipboards and civil household panels, but sales of these varieties have declined considerably this year, especially since sales of board were down from the same period last year.
Saddle steel shares (Haw Kyung-soon, Director of the Metallurgical Department of the Liaoning Department, stated that metallurgy was the third pillar of Liaoning ' s industry, with 60 million tons of iron and steel capacity per year ranked third in the country.
The production of 2,154 million tons of rough steel in Liaoning Province between January and May of this year, the production and marketing of products needed for high-level local government projects encouraged by State policy, and the sharp decline in more competitive products in the market were another feature of the manufacturing industry in the north-east.

The film Trinity III and Ten Million Flowers, which is about to be launched on 4 August, was launched yesterday in Kyoto at a conference entitled “The Four Seas are For You”, in which the White Night couple, Yang Yang and Liu Yifei, appeared together.
Yang Yang, who had just had his right ear surgery the previous few days, appeared for the first time after his injuries, reading his role as “irritated”, always giving in silence and hiding all his feelings.
Yang said that there was a need to mobilize all the emotions in order to convey to the audience the tragic sadness of the role, “this is a new challenge for my performance, and I am really going to choke on my inner wound during the performance”.
Liu Yeefei, for his part, revealed that when he was acting in this film, he was crying like he was in a state of shock, and he was crying like he was in a state of collapse.
The Japanese Olympic Committee had recently indicated that the Japanese delegation had set 30 gold medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and had advanced to the top three gold medals.
Last October, the Chairman of the Japanese Olympic Committee's Sports Committee, Tae-su Yama, stated that the total number of gold medals expected from Japan's Kenja at the Tokyo Olympics was 2.5 times that of the Rio Games.
At the 2016 Rio Olympics, the Japanese delegation ranked sixth on the gold medal with 12 gold.

Yesterday, the second meeting of the four People's Congresses of the city of Guangan was held in a brevity.
There were no banners, no tea cups or even a bottle of ordinary mineral water on the premises of the Chamber.
Instead, it was replaced by a simple banner, a meeting place, a simple environmentally friendly paper bag with conference materials, and a green paper cup filled with tea.
Conference materials were somewhat thinner than before, and several papers summarized the theme and agenda of the meeting.
“Save for the people, but also for the economy. We understand and welcome the fact that we have returned to a simple, real meeting environment.” The Grand Duke of the city of Guangan, speaking on behalf of Wang Sung, said that efficient, pragmatic and non-formal meetings are something that they would like to see and participate in.

10 February news: journalists learned yesterday from the Changzhou City Council of Agriculture that this year, building on the successful creation of a national forest city in 2016, the Changzhou City will deepen the implementation of the National Forest City Building Master Plan (2014-2025) in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, to consolidate the achievements of the national forest city construction and build it.
The Bank of England will maintain a 0.25% interest rate.
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and relaxed inflation have dashed hopes for upward adjustment.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue to be “weak” because it controlled interest rates while increasing household income contraction.
The Bank ' s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers decided to maintain a 0.25 per cent interest rate with a 6-2 vote, while a few members this month called for higher interest rates, even if weak economic growth had weakened the upwards.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced growth projections to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, respectively, and issued warnings that household income contraction would continue, while inflation would soar to almost 3 per cent in the fall.
However, it indicated that interest rates would need to be raised in the coming years in order to contain the inflation associated with Europe, while borrowing costs might need to be increased substantially as expected in the financial markets.
A year ago, the European Union had been affected by a large-scale economic promotion policy, and members had voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will suspend its periodic financing scheme, providing low-cost funding to banks starting in February of next year, although it claims that under the scheme, the Bank will now need an additional £15 billion over £115 billion.
In the minutes of interest rate decision-making meetings, the Bank of England stated: “In the core projections of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) has remained weak in the near future, as real household income contraction will continue to stifle consumption.”
With regard to interest rates, the Bank had repeatedly reiterated the need for “a certain monetary policy tightening” to combat inflation and for a “greater degree” than market expectations.
The market is now expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year and for the second time in 2020.
The Bank stressed, however, that any upturn would be “slow” and “restrictive”.
The Bank ' s growth projections for this year and next year show a downward trend, compared with the projections for May of 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank maintained a forecast of 1.8 per cent growth in 2018.
The exchange rate of the pound has declined against the United States dollar and the euro has followed.
The exchange rate of the pound has fallen by 0.5 per cent against the United States dollar, to 1.31 and by 0.4 per cent against the euro, to 1.11 per cent.
Prior to this constant decision-making, rising expectations were dashed by recent unoptimistic growth data. GDP rose to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the Bank, growth in the third quarter was likely to remain at 0.3 per cent, although it would increase slightly by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report by the Bank of England did not provide any good news for ordinary households, which were hit by inflation surges and wage increases were negligible, as it claimed that austerity would get worse before it got better.
It was also stated that monetary policy “cannot prevent” the impact on income in the coming years, but that wages were expected to recover “on a large scale” at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, owing to the depreciation of the pound sterling and the significant growth in demand for British commodities, the economy will be strained to offset some of the effects of low consumption.
One year before the decision was taken, the alarming European Union referendum plunged the pound sterling to 0.25 per cent in August.
The Bank of England estimates that it may take four years to fully influence prices and the British economy.
Until the latest decision on interest rates is published in the bank, the call for higher interest rates will be heard, as inflation has exacerbated already stressful ordinary households, while three policymakers have called for interest rates to be raised to 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9 per cent in June to 2.6 per cent last month, although the Bank of England claims it is expected and will rise again in the coming months.
The line is called the 2% target, and the excess is already the final bottom line of the weak pound.
The director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, Andrew Monterey, stated: “In view of the recent fall in interest rates, the mortgage market once again seems to be becoming more competitive, as lenders strongly call for more business and look forward to a positive end to the year.
For those who may be nearing the end of existing transactions, such markets appear to be particularly beneficial, as re-collateralization (many free of charge and low interest rates) is increasingly popular.
On 13 November, at 1902 hours, China ' s seismological network officially measured an earthquake of 8.0 magnitude with a depth of 10 km in New Zealand (42.53 degrees South and 173.05 degrees East) with a strong sense of wellington ' s impact.
The British National Health Service (NHS) has a big green light on controversial HIV drugs.
The patient will be able to receive “transformational” HIV preventive treatment from September, after the high court's decision to provide drug support for NHS has come to an end.
NHS England has announced that a pre-exposure prophylactic drug (PreEP), a pre-sexually available drug, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk populations by about 86%. Health services will now provide the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary trial.
It agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court decision last year, which stated that, although NHS claimed that local authorities should fund the drug, NHS was entitled to pay for the prEP.
The announcement announced on Thursday was described by the British Chief Executive Officer of NHS, Simon Stevens, as a “big new intervention”, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a “critical moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be the first registered sexual health clinics. More clinics will join in October, followed by full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylactic (PrEP) is an HIV drug that is administered prior to sexual activity to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission among populations at risk of infection.
PEP before sexual intercourse means there's enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include homosexuals, bisexual males, transgender persons and HIV-positive carriers who have not successfully received treatment.
The clinic will determine whether eligible and agreed participants, including men, women, transgender persons and their sexual partners, who are not known about their HIV status are receiving antiretroviral treatment.
Persons residing and registered as general practitioners in England may also register at their local sexual health clinics.
The scheme will cost Pound10 million and the NHS England branch has signed a contract to purchase these drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The experiment aims to assess the full potential of PEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is located, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr. Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and reinforce HIV prevention with a broad and increasingly successful approach.
This is yet another milestone in 30 years of action worthy of progress in addressing the major health challenges of humankind.”
The Chief Executive Officer of the United Kingdom AIDS Trust (NAT), Deborah King, said: “This is a critical moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target populations in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offer the possibility of changing the UK AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, the HIV-at-risk population will be given a new, licensed tool through the NHS-funded experiment in England, a truly stand-alone tool that does not require consultation with sexual partners, which will bring about improvements in the lives of many.
We agree with this announcement.”
“The first priority now is to ensure that the test is rolled out rapidly throughout the country and that none of the people infected with HIV are left behind.
Now we've bought PEP experimental drugs, and we're ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV."
The shadow Minister of Public Health, Sharon Hodgeson, stated: “After months of delay and government delays, the start of PrEP's first test was welcome and should have come earlier.
Evidence shows how this drug can bring about change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and halting the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This experiment will give us a better understanding of the advantages of PEP.
It is now very important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us further to end the spread of HIV in society.”

High-quality life: using attics and smart designs to make the small condo of the Countess Palace a spacious home
Joanne Ray, a former banker, was very keen on renovating her house, and in 2014 she moved from her big house on the Knight Bridge to a small condo at the Countial Palace.
This apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne balcony -- and Joanne did not pack her bags and sell it -- which is a strong proof of the new design.
“Before then, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a bigger house on Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for the right house with the offer.
I saw this apartment at the Count's Palace, and it's a very high ceiling.
I'd like to make an offer on the same day.”
Since the first visit, this 1,000 square feet apartment has now been completely overhauled.
This apartment was originally a complex one-room layout -- one that needed to pass through the kitchen to get to the bedroom -- and Joanne wanted to increase storage space and the attic in order to take full advantage of the full ceiling height.
“I want high ceilings, big windows, enough light.
That's what I asked," she said.
To that end, she hired Elvan Azadi from the Duck&Shed architectural and design studio (in Notting Hill) to use this 12.5-foot-high ceiling to build a home that was not just a development project, but a place where Joanne lived.
The height of the ceiling is not sufficient to increase two spaces up and down, so the construction challenge is to create a loft that is high enough to stand up.
Ervan has to think creatively in order to solve this problem.
“The steel structure is quite complex”, he explained.
“We must make room for it to be displayed up and down, without the need for shrugs.
It is not just as simple as building a simple platform, but also starting up the steel so that it can be placed at the appropriate level to achieve its function.”
Through this arrangement, Erfan was able to acquire two rooms of full height in the space, with many interesting elements added.
The loft uses a rectangular copper window of the Retrouvius brand to overlooking the fascinating areas of life.
The overall style of the mirrored gold furniture, the small silver furniture and the archaic light of Sergei Mouille was laid down.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Put mirrors on both ends of the short corridor and make them look longer.
In the kitchen, the splatter with the mirror is like a window to another room.
At the gate, small cells with mirrors provided Joanne with storage space for the storage of dishes and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an attractive sense of space to put the kitchen away when it is not used.
The folding kitchen is not fresh.
But the uniqueness of this folding kitchen lies in a garage-style lift door.
“In this case, there is some knowledge in the field of engineering,” Ervan explains the steel-strength-enhanced and close-to-the-ground MDF door.
"This is a balance principle, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide."
As a result of the skilful use of space and storage, Joanne was given an additional 16 square metres, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"In the end, you sell the size of the house -- or your property is valued on the basis of the size of the house," Ervan says.
“Basicly, real estate agents would walk into the room and calculate it according to the size of the floor.”
They will seek to increase the occupied space while using high-quality materials, thus creating a sense of luxury in the space.
According to Ervan, “the material was chosen by you personally and thus helped to create emotional bonds in the home”.
"You don't love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they don't hold your heart."
It has been shown that, through good design and the addition of additional space, standard apartments can be shaken to surprise you.
In fact, you might as well live with Joanne.

Two brothers in the 500-million-dollar Real Estate War.
Forty years after his family founded the dynasty, two brothers fought for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million.
The former director and developer of the Carlton Football Club, Colin De Lutis, lives in a mansion in the Tulkara district, and the three doors are at his brother's residence, Paul. The latter sues him for the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have had an intense debate on the division of assets in the Supreme Court.
The brothers and their mothers owned 38 real estates worth more than $500 million, which had accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in Colin Wood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually expanded it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold it for $85 million.
After that, the money was invested in real estate. At present, the De Luttis family's portfolio includes city office buildings, the Brunswick and Solento development projects, the Golden Coast and Blue Hill apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, known by his brother Paul as the “principal protagonist and dominant figure” of the De Lutis family, owned about two thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounted for about one third.
According to the documents submitted to the Tribunal, the value of property owned by Colin was converted to $316 million, while property owned by Paul was valued at $176 million.
According to Paul, the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the bargain.
“The proposal for the division of property put forward by Colin left him what I thought was the best property”, he wrote in a first court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several failed mediations.
Now, the brothers are still competing for control of the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has kicked him out of the game.
Colin denied this and accused Paul of poor management of certain real estate.
In the early affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed a desire to settle the dispute.
"My Italian tradition determines the family as the most important option. My Italian origin determines the family as the most important option," he wrote.
The cost of the case continues to rise, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails, top law firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and seniors engaged by both parties.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were both Italian immigrants. They started running public restaurants and deli shops in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brenrich in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy Colin Wood's property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said, "I was in third grade," where he founded Westco, "when Paul was very small (about 10 years old).
Anna de Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to be able to pass on the property to his son in peace.
“Luisgui used to say to me that he never wanted his brothers to end up in court”, she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of De Lutis Group, and Colin paid Mark $10 million to him when he said that he had left the company and $26 million to Luke.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were “unsatisfied with the terms of the division of their property”.
According to a biography published from TV star Eddie McGuire until his release in 2015, Colin kept a low profile despite being a member of the board of directors of the former AFL Club.
“Fairfax Media” contacted Colin and Paul, as well as their lawyers, on Friday.
But only Colin replied by text. He said that because the case had been referred to the court, "I really can't say much."
“My brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family business to court, which is very, very sad”, he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to satisfy his brother ' s demands.
He said, “Our father does not want to see Paul and I end up in a dispute like the one we currently have”, adding that he “is still hopeful about the settlement of the dispute”.
Friday, that hope seems to be dashed.
“Our problems will be resolved through the Court in the near future”, Colin wrote.

Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the President's media time.
Others have tried, but all have failed.
John F. Kelly might really be able to do that.
If that's true, then he's the first.
According to the United States political news website Politico, the new White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump — including media reports — in order to ensure greater stability for the big boss.
The following is a quote from the journalist Josh Dauth:
“When the new Chief of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, gathered for discussion with senior officials on his first day of work, he pointed out that he was addressing one of the main issues of President Trump's admission to the White House: bad information in the hands of the President”.
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the President to make better decisions, so that the information needed to be in his hands — whether in writing or in the form of a briefing.
Kelly's diagnosis looks similar, but others tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media time, but eventually failed.
President Trump's television addiction has a long history — and his habit of watching television is still deepening in the White House.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Naberg told Politico that “if the candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, it would be useful for him to know that he has received positive coverage through credible channels.
“According to the experience of the six former campaign officials, the habit of controlling Trump's tweets was to ensure that the media messages he personally received always contained some praise.”
That's totally okay.
But Trump’s Twitter habit of being “controlled” is ridiculous.
Perhaps those campaigning officials knew something that we did not know — that if they did not intervene, Trump's Twitter would have even become even more aggressive.
We may never know those tweets that Trump did not send.
If his staff were able to save him from the fire, even a few times, their efforts would be worth it.
But no one can keep Trump from being controversial.
Part of the problem was that in the White House, a group of competing groups, people promoted their world view by presenting information to Trump that might be reliable or unreliable.
Politico — both about this story — reported in May on advisers' preferences for strategically providing the President with suspicious information.
This is an example of what the journalist Shane Goodmancher described:
“The current and former Trump officials claim that Trump's response to negative news clips, such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with destructive information leaks, would be insanely desperate to find out where it came from.
At the end of February, the President received a malicious copy of an article on the Internet incitement Charles C. Johnson website, GotNews.com, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff, Katie Walsh, of being the “source of large amounts of information leaked” to the White House, as was the case with Trump.
Even if Johnson had been permanently blocked by Twitter for harassment, no concrete evidence had been provided, and he had bombed a large number of false allegations, all of which were later openly denied.
Trump read the article and then started asking officials about Walsh.”
Goodmancher also stated that the then Chief of Staff, Reines Pribas, and the White House Secretary, Robert Potter, “had tried to establish a system to manage and record documents received by Trump”.
And?
Kelly's going to do the same thing in three months.
Maybe he can prove himself to be a more efficient manager than Pribas, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his assistant is still competing for influence.
These permanent factors of influence will make the task of Kelly even more difficult.
Traveling town: how the wind gets drunk
[Summary] The potential of Zhejiang town is gradually awakened.
Today, these towns have become important destinations for tourists to see the water of the mountains, to read the culture and to feel the pain of the country, and will also provide an important contribution to our efforts to create the most beautiful tourist destination in China, the Poetry Zhejiang.
It's better than it's better than it's better than it's better than it's better than it's better than it's better than it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it's more like it
“Society plays go with the moon and weenie smells with the wind.
The traditional craftsmanship of walking around the town of Anchangu, where traditional crafts such as buckets, bamboo-coats, iron-laying, shoes, flower-picking and cotton-swipes are fully demonstrated, and where tourists are entwined by the experience of Xiao Xianjin.
During the three-day holiday this New Year, more than 65,000 visitors to Anchanggu Town were reported.
In Zhejiang, a small town like the town of Anchanggu, star Xiaobo Xiaogang, with its warm spirits in the village of Gangnam, and the white wall of the 28th of the state, Deva, tell of the age of the ancient town of the millennium.
In recent years, the potential of Zhejiang town has been gradually awakened as the development of tourism across our province has advanced.
In 2016, the Office of the Provincial Government officially published the Implementation Scheme for the Creation of Tourism Townships in Zhejiang Province, which proposes to designate, for a period of about five years, around 100 provincial tourist towns with a strong popular culture, an excellent ecological environment and a tourism style throughout the province.
Today, these towns have become important destinations for tourists to see the water of the mountains, to read the culture and to feel the pain of the country, and will also provide an important contribution to our efforts to create the most beautiful tourist destination in China, the Poetry Zhejiang.
The head of the Department of Tourism explained that, in the midst of the emergence of a tourist-friendly town, we now place greater emphasis on the creation of a personalized tourism industry in the towns and cities of our province. New tourism projects and trade patterns have provided visitors with a rich experience and a good reputation.
Focus on promotion
Recently, the Zhejiang Province Tourist Board and Zhejiang Daily News Group hosted a town-by-future artist exchange hosted by the All Media Centre of Zhejiang, and a season closing ceremony in the Town of Zhejiang Tourism.
“Campy towns have the beauty of art and the temperature of life.
The style of a small town lies in original juice, original taste, native origin, a pure original ecology.
“The Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, Film and Animated Arts, a film department teacher at the Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, the front-line film advertising director Xie Changfeng, and the director of the Chinese University of Metrology Institute of Arts and Communications, Professor Xu Xiao Xiao Xiao, shared cross-border stories on small towns such as Small Village Renovations in the Camera.
Many tourist towns in Zhejiang have deep cultural resources, and a new town from the south of the city of Huzhou has been created to read the country.
The town of Jiangnan, which has been popular with painters since ancient times, is now in deep cooperation with such artistic institutions as the Chinese American Academy.
Tourism-friendly small towns require elements of the landscape, factors of tourism, service elements and environmental elements.
In this context, tourism services and environments are also important components.
A timely umbrella in a rainy day would also allow tourists to experience a small town better.
In this age of sharing, the hottest shared umbrellas of the Poetry Zhejiang editions were custom-made by Zhejiang, in conjunction with the All Media Centre for Tourist Tourist Group, hoping to promote the concept of “Share? Green” and to raise the awareness and common sense of civilized tourism among tourists and residents of the town.
This became one of the bright spots of the “Poetry Zhejiang? The town has the wind” of the 2017 Zhejiang tourist town during the season.
Looking forward to it.
To date, Zhejiang Province has published a list of the first 21 provincial tourist towns and 115 provincial tourist towns.
As a priority area for the development of rural tourism during the “13th Five-Year” period, windy towns will eventually be built up as tourist attractions above level 3A, which will become a new model of diversity of tourism products, high tourism efficiency, and a win-win industrial integration.
The key to the attraction of a tourist town is the taste of its original juice.
The beauty of tourist-friendly towns stems not only from smouldering little bridges, but also from long-standing cultural traditions; rural renewal stems from cultural self-confidence.
Throughout the international landscape, the small towns of Lisser, the Netherlands, Halstadt, Austria, and pumpkins, France, with tulips, “salts” and pumpkins as their core attractions, attract a large number of tourists from around the world each year, thereby enabling tourism to boost the economy of small towns.
The focus on “priming identity and keeping the town alive” has given the town a distinct personality and soul, more so as to provide cultural immersion, to carry the local art and to highlight the culture of the country.
The tourist town, which is bound by culture and gloom, with its human and landscape as its vehicle, connects the quartet of tourists and allows traditional ethos and culture to be inherited and innovative in the shared construction.
In essence, tourist-friendly small towns are complex open tourist attractions that should be built together by local residents and foreign tourists, as well as by tourists.
As the main battleground for future growth in tourism, tourist-friendly towns may not only change the ecological profile of villages, the way in which economic and social development takes place and the direction in which industrial elements flow, but also be an important force in bridging the urban-rural infrastructure divide and awakening rural cultural recovery.
The Zhejiang tourist town will provide a richer story in the context of the surge of accelerated rural revitalization.
Data show that 70 per cent of China ' s travel needs are concentrated within a 3-km radius, which means that the entire short-distance travel market is bound to share bicycles sooner or later.

In contrast to the huge annual production of over 13,000 television dramas on the watch, these “baskets” are nothing more than an apocalypse.
The tenant negotiates the ditch and returns to Monopoly Street.
Some of the richest owners of the western Midrands region have once again been in a dispute with determined tenants, who have consulted on a ditch dug by the Government to demand the return of land other than the mansion.
The tenants parked 20 of their trailers in an open area outside the plentiful Soliher Street, which was branded Rich.
The tenants, holding the horses, carrying the babies and leading the motorcade, returned in May, when they were expelled and did not prevent their entry from the “River of the City”, which was dug up by the municipal authorities.
This lean and seasoned team found a gap in the line of defence, through which their vehicles were squeezed, despite the fact that a roadblock had not been set up for passage.
The angry population criticised the Solihull Council Commission, stating that it “did a poor job dealing with the issue”.
“They arrived there on Monday night, before they came to Benliches Street and threw stones at passers-by.
The Committee should be ashamed of what they did, because they were doing absolutely nothing.
The tenants came here in May and were subsequently expelled, and now they are back.
It's been a lot last night. It's probably more today."
She added: “The Birmingham City Council knows how to handle it by enforcing a long-term ban to protect its park.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I'm not willing to continue paying municipal taxes if the council can't stop it.
A local resident who did not want to reveal his name said, “This is ridiculous. We just saw the last group of tenants leave, only to facilitate the destruction of the other group.
The number has increased this time, with some even seeing horses eating grass on the park lawn.”
“We are aware of unauthorized camping in an open area of Schultzbrook Road, and we are now cooperating with the Soliher police and taking the necessary legal action to remove them as soon as possible.
In order to support us in collecting evidence, it is important that as many local residents as possible call the police to report any anti-social or criminal acts.
This helps us to outline the situation for the Court's review when we refer the case to the Court.”

Italy ' s strong attitude towards the non-governmental organization Migrant Rescue Ship
Italy warned non-governmental organizations operating migratory rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue carrying out relief unless new operational regulations were signed.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Turin, the Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, stated: “It is hard to see what they will do if non-governmental organizations do not sign a new code of conduct”.
The day before Minniti's warning, the Italian authorities detained the crew of a German aid organization, “Youth Relief”, on suspicion that they had actually colluded with human traffickers to assist illegal immigrants.
The aid organization operated for only one year and refused to comment on the specific subject of charges against the Italian prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartocio.
In a social media statement, the organization stated that “to us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing, and we therefore regret that we cannot operate in search and rescue zones at this time”.
“When all the information is collected, we can only assess all the allegations and situations at this time.”
The Italian government has been monitoring the Iuventa ship of “Youth Relief” since October.
Its crew is suspected of carrying migrants brought directly from small boats by traffickers and of allowing smugglers to flee in haste and re-use the ship.
According to the documents of the Prosecutor, at least one such meeting allegedly took place at sea 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast and was published by the Italian media.
Its crew was suspected of blatant disregard for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversaw relief operations in the area out of humanitarian enthusiasm and not for any other motive.
According to the code of conduct, ships such as Iuventa clearly require an Italian police officer to supervise their activities on board the vessel.
At present, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code of conduct: Save the Children, the migrant maritime aid station in Malhe, and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new provisions to be unnecessary but acceptable, as they did not bring about any “significant changes and impediments” to its relief operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign were the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins sans frontières (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti claims that there has been a sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guards and to unite local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
The Minister stated: “In recent days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel.”
He announced plans for in-depth talks this month: discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development activities and with Chad, the Niger and Mali on ways to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries for Europe.
According to the Chief Financialist of the Transport Bank, the growth in industrial value added is expected to accelerate to 6.6 per cent in December, owing to end-of-season highs in the first three quarters of 2017.
The cumulative increase in fixed asset investments in December is expected to be 7.2 per cent, the same as in the previous month, which is lower than last year.
Industrial production, although weak in October, remained almost the same as in November.
In December, while our manufacturing investment was running at a low level, capital investment has improved slightly, and therefore capital investment is expected to level off in November of that month.
More than 200,000 people have entered the United States, mostly as stowaways. Similar scenes continue to unfold in the diaspora, in the absence of their families and in the absence of their families.
A new initiative in Beijing for “secondary rehabilitation”: thousands of teachers and students from the North chemical industry will be admitted to the new campus in Changping
The opening ceremony of the new campus of the Beijing Chemical University was held in Changping District, Beijing, where 1,800 acres of green campuses are officially operational.
Journalists learned from the ceremony that, in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and to combat the “big city disease”, in recent years, in the context of concerted development and defusion of non-capital functions in Kyunjin, Beijing has accelerated the dissipation of central city high schools to suburban areas, and some students and teachers of higher education schools are moving to good faith.
The new northern chemical school complex, located in Changping south entrance town, occupies 1,800 acres, 40 kilometres from the city, and is one of the priority projects in the city of Beijing to dissipate non-capital functions.
The new school is divided into three phases, which are now fully completed, and the second phase, which is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year, is expected to meet the needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduates, graduate students and teaching staff for study and life.
Looking back at this year's film market, we found that the original text of the film and the two crowds of stars in the movie form an important part of the target audience.
Today, at 1710 hours, the command centre 119 of the city of Shunyang received a warning of a fire in the storage of tetrahydrofurans at an ambitious plant located in Ryushu Tong, in the city ' s double-clean area.
Five squadrons of 20 fire-fighting vehicles were immediately deployed to the scene with heavy chemical suits, chemistries and other equipment.
After preliminary detection, fires occurred in small storage tanks where chemical substances such as tetrahydrofurans were stored, resulting in high levels of smoke at the site.
As at the time of the press release, the firefighters were under stress and the city ' s health, security, environmental, security, traffic and other services were on their way to the scene, and no casualties were observed.
Michelle Carter was sentenced for texting to encourage Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A girl from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and telephone calls.
In the current year, 20-year-old Michelle Carter will be serving a 15-month sentence, which can then be converted to a suspended sentence.
Carter was convicted in June of unintentional premeditated murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: “My family is devastated.
My son is my best friend."
While awaiting appeal, Carter was granted liberty of person.
She faced a maximum of 20 years ' imprisonment, but her team believed that she and Mr. Roy were both mentally ill.
At the time of sentencing, Carter stood standing, wearing red pants and a rice coat, holding his hands tight, with both tears and looking down.
“She did kill Conrad Roy”, the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended her life for a better life.
She didn't take responsibility”, the prosecutor said.
"She has no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer says it's “a terrible consequence, and she feels very sorry”.
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he had not found any significant impact on her “age or maturity, or even on her mental illness, on her behaviour”.
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said, “I haven't had a day to grieve for losing my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of what I've done and what I've done. I'm trying to stand with his sisters in all of my pain, and it's going to be with us forever.
Mr. Roy's sister, Cady Roy, testified that she was “spiriting” because she realized that she could never attend her brother's wedding or become the aunt of his children.
“The loss of a man who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and I will live with it for the rest of my life.” She said.
This case appears to have set a legal precedent, as the laws of Massachusetts do not provide for the criminalization of encouraging others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in vehicles; this year, Carter was 17 years old.
After Carter ' s text message revealed that she had encouraged him to commit suicide, the case was of national concern.
“There are many ways to hang, jump, stab herself.” She said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death; he was on vacation with his family.
During the period before his suicide, she wrote, “You need to do this, Conrad”, and, “All you have to do is start the generator and then be free and happy”.
Judge Monez stated that Carter had drawn attention through Mr. Roy ' s death and ordered that she not profit from the case through any media.
There are differences of law in this case.
One of the few defenders for Carter, Amanda Knox, who was charged with the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007, was acquitted two years later.
In a column published in The Los Angeles Times, 30-year-old Ms. Knox said: “Michel? Carter deserves compassion and help, not imprisonment”.
Zhang is destined to be a controversial film artist, and since he began making his first film, Red Sorghum, he has gained much dissension while leading the Chinese film scene.
On 2 February, journalists learned from the Lassa Netsa Basketball Club that the Lassa Netsat Youths had recently won the fourth in the finals of the National Youth Basketball League in Beijing.
The Lassard Nussard Basketball Youth Team consists of 11 indigenous players, and the principal coach is the Assistant Trainer of the Lassard Nussard Basket Adults Brigade.
The Tibetan Basketball Kid before going to Beijing for the finals.
The director-general of the Lassard Netsa Basketball Club, Liang Joon, told reporters that the team's performance had improved compared to last year, and that there had been a marked improvement in the self-confidence of the players and their confidence in the playing field.
At the end of the competition, Captain Jiangtsang expressed his desire to gain experience by participating in the competition and to do his utmost for the cause of basketball in Tibet.
It is understood that during the Beijing competition, players demonstrated the image of Tibet by overcoming factors such as low-altitude intoxication.
Despite the fact that the track is a gold medalist at the Olympics and that those who have access to the track have access to the world, the track name will be the bottom of the line as compared to the suction of the gold.
Automotive manufacturers are hit, and Audi will convert up to 850,000 diesel vehicles.
Audi announced that the BMW would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 vehicles the day before the conversion.
The BMW Chairman stated that BMW believed that “driving with more intelligent choices than restrictions” meant that major European cities - including Munich, where BMW had its headquarters - were considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that 3 million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be converted to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed to have done so as recall.
European car manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emissions requirements.
However, nitrogen oxides emitted from diesel engines are considered to be carcinogens and may lead to asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset diesel vehicle tail gas emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of diesel vehicles.
As German car manufacturers faced scrutiny, the Government led by Prime Minister Angela Merkel was accused of over-exercise of these powerful car companies and ignored the signs of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid repeating the popular pattern of concealing their use of so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions during vehicle tests to comply with regulations and returning to normal driving conditions.
Several public executives have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated by countries on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zacero Giovani Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected by extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a public criminal investigation in Germany, where the German Government accused Audi of installing a system to avoid European emissions requirements, expanding the scope of the investigation previously limited to the United States.
Audi was surveyed for a potentially significant impact on the general public: luxury car manufacturers account for a disproportionate share of the profits of the public automobile.
A film, from its preparation to its presentation, takes one or two or even a few years, and is commonplace.
The animated film, the Big Fish Seagull, announced its launch on July 8, 12 years from the time of its preparation to the time of its launch!
The original author of Big Fish Seagull Liang, 21 years old, from the Heat Power Industry at Qinghua University, and a friend, Zhang Chun, founded the other side of the ship, received a million dollars in venture capital in 2008 to launch an animated film troupe called " Big Fish Seagull " .
The film has won numerous national and international prizes during the creative sample phase, and has been recorded and praised as “one of the most outstanding works of art” by the Pompidou Centre for Contemporary Art in France.
As a result of the six-year period from creativity to production, the film was referred to by millions of fans who looked forward to it.
Big Fish Seagull tells a fairy tale that belongs to the Chinese. With the release of this pre-scheduled film, it brings new expectations to all viewers.
Liang said, “This is the only thing I've done for 12 years, and now it's turning from a dream to a reality, and I'm both nervous and excited”.
According to Zhang Chun, “I'm driving the team crazy to think of using one-fifth of the other's budget to produce exactly the same image as the others”.
Dong-jung, a “world factory” that used to rely on raw materials processing and a large number of popularists, is looking at high-quality people who can lead the repositioning of the city.
During the week of the high-level talent event organized by the City of Dongjung in recent days, the first financial journalist saw the participation of a number of powerful local businesses in the talent fair.
Each of the distinctive billboards on the orange and red background wall displays a price tag.
As a result, the Chinese Association of Television Production Industries decided to join the national television production industry and sign a convention on self-regulation.
Provence lavender threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but there is now bad news that it is threatened by climate change.
As a result of the continuing drought and the emergence of viral insects, lavender is declining, causing headaches among scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute of Agriculture in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is under great threat because in recent years the plant has been affected by climate change, spring rains have decreased significantly, and autumn is the fall.
This affects the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a small individual twig, a leaf twig that can spread microbacterial bacteria, and in very dry weather they appear in large quantities.”
The point is that it is huge in number.
In addition to attracting vacationers, Qingya lavender has been promoted by the perfume and cosmetics industries.
Eric Chase says, "Contrary to the many big flowers that can be opened with long grains, we have small, stunted, missing or weak individual problems.
So we have less oil."
The solutions being studied include the adoption of better irrigation techniques and the mitigation of evaporation of soil moisture, the spraying of a protective mixture of clay and water on a plant, and the development of more drought-resistant varieties.
In comparison to the science fiction element in the film, it is the stories in the film that are more attractive to them.
On the afternoon of 5 September, the Washington City journalist, who continued to interview a number of prominent and vocal figures, as well as two vocal artists, was surprised to learn that they had virtually remained silent.
One was the Berlin Film Emperor, one was an up-and-up young actor, and Psychiatry was the first partner of Liaofan and Li Yi Feng.
Mexico is dangerous. Journalists are killed.
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the riots in Sinalo County, which were caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and the endless drug war.
But today, the shadow of tragedy looms over themselves, and they come together to discuss security issues.
It is important that they be told to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed which was more safe: whether their children should be brought to the office, which had been hit by a grenade in 2009, or whether they should be left at home.
The security expert wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: the enemy, the neutral and the ally.
They asked the journalists to name themselves under each column — without the need for evidence, observation and intuition would suffice.
The presence of suspected drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on government lists, or cartels, is dangerous for Mexican reporting.
The violence continued and the body spread throughout the country, with a growing number of journalists among them: according to the Commission for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists are being attacked and threatened.
The last person who died was their editor and inspiration, as well as Javier Valdiz Cárdenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
Valdiz has written many books on drug violence, and he wrote in one of them: “The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist”.
You can feel that he's gone, though he's everywhere -- a huge picture hanging on the front of the Riodoce office building, with Valdez with the middle finger, the word "justice," and Aaron Ivala and Miriam Ramirez, both in their 30s.
Less than two months after his death, the seminar was held; journalists discussed their common wounds, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special Federal Prosecutor ' s Office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists ' cases, it has only two prosecutions, according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
The majority of the thousands of criminal cases per year involved drug trafficking and organized crime, so the perpetrators of the killings of journalists were rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they insisted on reporting violent incidents in Sinalo County, even though they had been heartbroken, even though the land had been devastated.
Ivala said that it would be of little use to hold security seminars without information about the perpetrators and without justice.
He said, "It's stupid to waste time participating in a seminar like this.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone.”
On the morning of 15 May, Valdiz left the Riodoce office in the capital city of Culiacan.
His red Toyota Carola drove a few blocks away and was stopped by two men; they forced him out of the car and fired 12 shots, presumably because of the newspaper's name — translated into Twelve Rivers.
The assailants left in his car and crashed it in the vicinity.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two adult children behind.
There are rumors about Kuliakan.
But the subject of Valdiz actually has nothing but silence.
Since Guzmán was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, where hostile forces have been killed.
One or more people are shot every day in the streets of Sinaro State, and it is common for graves to be filled with two floors of mausoleums full of drug lords.
The “quiet” state was temporarily forgotten when only one cartel controlled the coastal state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdiz was well aware of the dangers of the job, the 60-year-old founder and director of Riodoce, Ismail Pohoqui, was guilty of failing to protect his friends.
He believed that two mistakes had led to this tragedy.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damasso Lopez, who led a cartel that fought against several sons of Guzmán.
The story may have provoked the sons; the newspapers were bought by suspected gang members as soon as they arrived at the newsstand.
The second mistake was that Valdiz had not been forced to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper covering the same story had been confiscated.
Valdiz was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death was of great significance to Mexico ' s violence against journalists.
His spirit is long, and his friends and colleagues believe that he has always been with us.
He was also a senior journalist in Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues in the creation of Riodoce and sold $50 in shares.
In the state of Sinaloa, Pohoqui said, “It is impossible for the press to walk away from the drug problem”.
With the passage of time, the newspaper has gained a good reputation for its bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertisements have increased.
Journalists prefer to be able to publish high-profile investigative reports without fear of censorship, and readers prefer newspapers to publish stories that others are afraid to report.
Five years after its creation, Riodoce won the Maria Moskapo Prize for Journalism in Latin American countries.
The same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdiz International Prize for Freedom of the Press in recognition of his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug story.
He says he's scared, too.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the prize, he said, “I want to live.”
Later in October, in an interview with the local television station Rompetiento TV, he said, "Drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinalo County.
You must assume the task that falls on you as a journalist — either that or being deaf and dumb.
I don't want to be asked, "Why don't you make a sound about what's happening in the face of so many deaths?"
All the staff of Riodoce miss Valdez, remembering him for cursing like a dock worker, for a friend who never hesitated to embrace and advise, and for a teacher who knew how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar across from the office often sits on the same table.
Now, they will ask: Is it his daily habits that caused his crash?
His death also forced them to think about how to do their job and live their lives.
“They don't like you causing trouble to their women and children, nor do they like you influencing their legitimate companies and secret airports used to transport drugs.
It's all over their bottom line."
The result is to maintain a high level of self-censorship and self-protection, even in the safest of times.
Trust your instincts.
If you smell dangerous, get away.
Andres Villariel, editor of Riodoce, said that the problem was that “the breath was a feeling of deception ... and then what happened to Javier”.
He and others said that the previous rules no longer applied to the states of Sinalo — just as they no longer applied to the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where smuggling routes were lucrative and institutions were weak, government officials corrupted and smug.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the room where the staff of Riodoce participated in security training, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed; a few days earlier, spy software allegedly sold only to the Government had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two policemen took the cold under the shade and fled from the temperature of 104 degrees (40 degrees centigrade).
They were sent by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodoce, located in a four-storey building in the middle class neighbourhood of Culiacan.
Some journalists joked about whether the police officers would be 50% of what the governor himself said.
Journalists had gone to the mountains for several months, where drug cartels were under de facto control.
The week's Riodoce featured three major events.
Among them was the murder of the brother of Julio Cesar Chávez, a great former boxer in Sinalo County.
There is also a disclosure of government funds from the governor's hometown.
And the kidnapping in a expensive restaurant in Culiacan, which is only a block from the prosecutor ' s office.
There was no official publication of information on the targets and the kidnapping process, so it was necessary to write down what the city knew: the restaurant was a destination for drug traffickers and officials alike.
A journalist learned from the public record that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician of the ruling Revolutionary System Party (PRI), which dominated the political class almost throughout the past.
Recently, several Revolutionary System Party governors have been accused of corruption in several high-priority cases.
Verariel asked journalists to write about what had happened at the scene of the incident, including the escape of one of the sons of the Mexican drug lord Guzman from a military attack.
If only a few months ago, readers would look at the column of Valdiz and look for the most powerful information on the kidnapping.
46 Villaire, a young man called “Linty” because of his thin body, said, “We already knew what had happened before.
Now all sources of information are cut off.
Valdiz ' s office is now being used to store signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists, as employees become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The following morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took a sign and took it out of the room and went to the office of the local prosecutor to attend a march in connection with another journalist.
El Salvador Adamé disappeared in the western state of Michoacán three days after his murder in Valdez.
The official found a burnt body and claimed that according to DNA the test was his body.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more vocal, organizing protests and wearing the words “save the media” on sidewalks and buildings.
On that day, Director Pohoqué was not in Washington and he was trying to bring justice to the Valdiz case and to secure international support.
The day after the killing of Valdiz, in a meeting with the Governor of Sinalo County, Ramírez complained about the official spying on journalists and killed them because they had told the truth.
Since her anger had affected her objectivity, she had also asked to resign from reporting on Government affairs.
Valdiz has repeatedly reiterated that journalists in Mexico are “backed” by organized crime, complicity of government officials and indifference of society.
In his last book, Drug News, he wrote that journalists were not only mutilated by drug cartels, but were on the list of politicians and security forces who were associated with organized crime.
Media Watch Group Articulo 19 blames police and public officials for more than half of the attacks on journalists last year.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up."
Obviously, these murders are chilling.
No one forgets that six years ago, the Boss, Maria Elizabeth Macias, died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was accompanied by a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “I came for my report”.
Her head was cut off with a computer keyboard and headphone next to her.
After Miroslava Brech was killed in March, some newspapers, such as El Norte, on the northern border of Chihuahua State, chose to close down.
Others continue to be killed in 2014 by the directors of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used a front page of a public conversation about the drug cartel, entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists fled their homes or even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
It is difficult to find jobs in exile, and they still need to be careful and wary of dangers in the streets.
Sometimes they were arrested and in 2015 the photographer Ruben Espinosa was reportedly killed with four women in a Mexican city three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue to work behind the scenes, this is a routine step in high-risk decision-making.
Ivala had wanted to be a poet, and he admitted that reporting on the drug trade scared him.
He said, "Mexico is turning into hell, so I became a journalist."
Last Friday, in the middle of the night, the latest issue of the newspaper had been printed, and the editors of Riodoce sat outside the office drinking beer and suddenly their phone rang.
A series of gunfights between rival gang forces and security forces near the beach resort city of Massatland confirmed 19 deaths.
The fighting is escalating, as a series of cartel information found in the region portends.
They uploaded the news to the Riodoce website just by the side of the road via their cell phones.
The next day's headline had to be changed.
The sirens rang in the vicinity — another shoot-out in the area.
Pohoqué glanced at the police officers standing there guarding them to see if they were alert.
If they were scared, they didn't show up.
The founder of the newspaper had been killed, and in his large portrait, he pointed to the places where the entire Sinalo State needed to look, and the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
“How could you even want to shut down? The day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her on the street.”
China ' s own-car tourism market size or trillion yuan in 2020
[Summary] In the broader context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free travel, self-tourism is encouraged by national policies and is increasingly favoured by consumers.
At the same time, however, the promise of a trillion-scale spin-off market faces a double challenge.
In the broader context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free travel, self-tourism is encouraged by national policies and is increasingly favoured by consumers.
At the same time, however, there is a dual challenge to a trillion-dollar self-driving market, where the development of the self-driving industry is not commensurate with market demand, where self-driving organizations, such as self-driving clubs and travel agencies, face a low level of profitability; and where infrastructure and services are at the primary level.
60 per cent of the total number of people in the country, and the market is expected to break by trillion.
Domestic tourism was 4.44 billion times throughout 2016, with self-travel accounting for about 60 per cent of the total number of domestic tourism trips, and the size of the self-carriage market is expected to break out of trillion by 2020.
According to the statistics on the number of people travelling in and out of their own car, the number of people travelling in and out of China has continued to grow over the past five years, and the proportion of people travelling in and out of the country has remained stable at over half.
At the same time, regional and national levels have shown greater interest in and support for the emerging area of self-driving, with policy and regulations relating to self-driving, residential and camping tourism increasingly in place between 2016 and 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Board of Tourism and the National Directorate of Sports, jointly issued the Plan for the Development of Automobile Sports Camps; in the same month, self-travel was carried out in the Programme of Action for the Improvement of the Development of Rural Tourism (2017), which was jointly issued by 14 departments, such as the National Commission for Reconstruction and Development and the Ministry of Finance.
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of the country ' s own mobility.
The self-drive club has little profit, and the whole industry chain is the key.
The self-driving industry is still at an early stage, despite the enormous potential of the domestic self-driving market and the positive orientation of national policies.
According to China ' s Annual Development Report for Self-Riding 2016-2017, there are thousands of home-based auto clubs, car clubs, car clubs, etc., but tourist self-help arrangements account for a large proportion of their own trips, with only about 15 per cent of visitors participating in various institutions, such as car clubs, self-driving clubs, etc.
At the same time, the number of online tourism enterprises and traditional travel agencies that are autonomous in the development of self-carriage products is negligible, with many online tourism platforms selling only self-carriage products from suppliers and some self-carriage clubs as important suppliers.
In terms of organizing self-drives, many aspects of “eat, live, walk, swim, buy and have fun” are covered, with high fragmentation, heavy upstream supply chains and high random consumption by tourists.
The founder and CEO-Li Congjie of the Beijing Car Club considered that the self-drive club was essentially similar to the travel agency, and that the main early patterns of profit were based on offline activity, with the core being the self-drive line product and lead service.
However, now that there is a high degree of homogenization of line products and varying levels of leadership services in the self-carriage sector, the self-carriage clubs face the need for a renewed transformation.
It can be seen that self-driving is not an independent industry in itself, but rather that it is important to form a cross-geographical, industry-based eco-circumstance with its shifting character.
Experts noted that, in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important element of consumption.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving industry, it is important to enhance the empirical identity and develop the theme “self-driving +” as well as the IP for self-driving products.
The landscape is not just a road. Car camps should not be just for room and board.
In the face of the rise of self-driving, the basic development of self-driving is also relatively low.
According to Li Congjie, tourist attractions are not only a road but rather a need to integrate the elements of transport and tourism into them, but road repair and tourism are the responsibility of both sectors themselves, the transport sector increases the elements of tourism and the construction of facilities such as toilets, counselling centres, posters, etc., and tourism.
The construction experience of the well-known self-driving route, the United States 66 Highway, is worth drawing on.
The landscape design is no longer the most direct and rapid route between the place of departure and the destination, but is based on the design concept of “Employing the pleasure of driving”, which provides the best enjoyment for self-driving tourists of the beauty of the road; it connects point and face tourism landscapes, preserving ecotourism along the way.
In addition to the landscape, the camp is also an important side-facilitating facility.
However, among the self-carried tourists known to the journalists of the New Kyoto newspaper, few consumers chose to stay in the camp.
In their view, many camps were in favour of infrastructure and could only satisfy the need for many elements of self-travel by eating and living at a low level and with a single product.
According to industry sources who did not wish to reveal their names, many of the businesses that had been in the camps in previous years had been set up to take land, after which the later stages of infrastructure construction and services had not been kept up, and many of the operations had been run at a loss without later infusion of funds, making it difficult to produce some of the accompanying products.
Consumption group
According to data published in 2017 by the China Association of Tourism Boats, self-driving groups are concentrated in 21-40 years of age, mainly 31-40 years of age, with a certain economic base and a high demand for individualized tourism, mostly as parent-to-child travel clients.
According to the accommodation survey, the self-travelling population is relatively more inclined to prefer non-standard accommodation.
In terms of the type of self-driving, the most important type of self-driving is that of the perimeter, at 84.32 per cent.
Expatriate self-driving is an aspiration of many, but a smaller proportion.
At the same time, with rising consumer demand, visitors who used to like to drive their own “shows” have begun to change their mindsets, no longer “get out of the car and sleep in the car” in the course of their own trips, but focus more on the experiences and processes of travel.
Dinosaurs use disguises to hide from their enemies.
At first glance, it was scary, but it looked like a statue.
Researchers published the first research on the incredible biochemicals found by Canadian miners of the size of rhinoceros, pointing out that the fossils were well preserved and that they were therefore referred to by experts as “Mona Lisa of the dinosaur community”.
The fossil is very well preserved, and it can even be determined that the colour of its scaffolding skin is red brown. This suggests that it has had some "happy experience."
Relevant reports in Contemporary Biology magazine describe it as “the best preserved picature dinosaur ever discovered and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world”.
The fossil is a newly discovered type of pulmonary dragon that lives between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the white age.
Its preservation was so perfect that it shocked the researchers, who described it as “examining indeed”.
According to the National Geographic Journal, this herbal pavilion is the best preserved type of dinosaur that has ever been discovered.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered this fossil during mining at the Senkol Millennium Summit site near McMerriburg, northern Alberta, Canada.
At the time, he ran into something that seemed different from the surrounding rock, and he decided to look closely.
The fossils he discovered were then taken to the Royal Museum of Tyrell Biology in Canada.
It took the researchers six years to show the real face of this beast, hidden inside the 2500 pounds (1100 kg).
After such hard work, the final results are now being made public.
"If you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a scientist and first author of the Royal Terrill Museum. The creature was on display at the gallery.
"It will be one of the most beautiful and well-saved dinosaur specimens in the history of science -- the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world."
Researchers, by studying their skin, found that the herbivorous creature, although wearing armor, like a foot tank, could be exposed to a major threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
It uses red and white disguises to escape predators, as well as covert techniques known as “deshade”, which are also used by many modern animals.
In this way, the experts indicated that it could be better integrated with the surrounding environment, thus avoiding the enemy, indicating that it was preyed upon by larger dinosaurs.
This 110 million-year-old creature, a member of the Journey family, became the headline for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Terrill Biology Museum.
Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who is a member of the team, has spent over 7000 hours carefully unmasking the beast's veil, and the researchers are now studying it and naming it “Borealopelta marktelli”.
The samples were extremely well preserved, allowing Dr. Mitchell, as well as the international team of scientists, to record the patterns and shapes of the scales and armour on their bodies.
They discovered the “shade” technique, a common form of defence in the animal community, which meant that the animal had a darker back than its side.
Despite the fact that anti-shade techniques are common, the results found are surprising, as the dinosaurs are much larger in size than the existing animals that use anti-shade techniques.
The dinosaurs are under pressure to be hunted by meat-eating dinosaurs, which evolves in a favourable direction, allowing them to hide in the cross-base as a means of survival.
However, most existing animals using anti-shading techniques, such as deer, zebra or zebra, are as small and vulnerable as prey, indicating that the creature faces real survival pressures.
“The frenzied capture of large-scale alpha dinosaurs shows how dangerous the white-collar eating dinosaurs are”, Brown says.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin colour of the dinosaur is red brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the life clues of the creature, including the stomach content it retains to find food for its final feeding.
In their view, the dinosaurs fell into the river at the time of their death and were then washed into the sea and then sank in a back-down way into the sea floor.
At that time, Alberta's climate was as warm as it is today in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans may be deeper inland than they are today.
Brown said, “The Lumpy Dragon is truly amazing because it is completely covered by the staircase skin that it is preserved and, so far, is preserved in the dimension so that its original shape can be preserved.”
“Therefore, the shape of the creature is now almost identical to that of the white age.
You don't need too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping.”
The time of chalking is a time when large animal foot dinosaurs walk around the planet on two feet.
Although the Tyrannosaurus is the king of the dinosaurs, it only appeared a few million years after the Pilar dinosaurs, which could have been captured by some of the Tyrannosaurus' ancestors.
They include high-crested dragons, a giant beast weighing 6 tons long and 38 feet long (11.5 metres).
Recent studies have found that scientists in Contemporary Biology magazine believe that nodes were washed into the sea after their death and that mummies were formed in the soil.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink dug up the creature at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurley, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world ' s best-saved cape dinosaur, with complete skin and armor in areas ranging from the nose to the hips.
The average length of this organism is about 18 feet (5 metres) and weighs 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
It's got two 20 inches of sharp angles from the shoulder.
According to researchers, this herb-painted dinosaur operates in the current western part of Canada and is then washed into the sea by flood-spilling rivers.
However, such dinosaurs are buried at the bottom of the sea and their coats are preserved in their entirety.
The fossil remains of this particular sample are very well preserved, so that the remaining skin still covers the punctuated pieces of the skull of the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geography magazine, this preservation is very rare, as it is in the middle colour.
The more I look, the more I find it incredible.
Residue skin fossils continue to be covered by refrigerated armor over the skulls of dinosaurs.
It's right in the front palm on its side, five toes up.
I can count it."
Journalists learned that adding natural or plant-based kelp acids, corrosion acids and amino acids to the urea production process allowed for the adaptation of traditional urea, resulting in urea for kelp, zinc corrosion urea, and urea nitrogen for cereals.
Environmentally friendly, the potential for increased crop yields is evident, especially in the case of large granular value added urea, which is a good raw material for BB fertilizers.
This total number of security personnel is twice as high as the number of security personnel at the 2012 London Olympic Games.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest-ever security connectivity programme.
Previously, the Brazilian Government indicated that a total of 85,000 people from the army and the police, including 20,000 troops and 65,000 police officers, would work together.
The majority of the military will be responsible for the protection of Olympic stadiums, while the additional 3,000 will be responsible for the security of international airports, metro stations and streets.
The police patrol the rest of the city, including subways, buses and streets.
According to the information received, 6,000 military personnel have now arrived in Rio to provide security for the Olympic Games.
They are responsible for patrolling the airport and the main roads connecting the airport to the Olympic complex, in addition to the four major areas of the Rio Games.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service sector is no longer new, and for evaluation mechanisms to be effective, it is important to make regulation more effective and non-formal.
How radicals learn to answer this question: "Whose street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was disturbed.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis man sat on a rent-in bed in Episode, browsing Facebook on his cell phone.
She accidentally found a post by a high school student.
It says, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid who was lying on the street."
She was confused when she found out that no other person had published the message on the feed. She turned off Facebook and turned on Twitter.
A @TheePharaah user kept pushing her for the Dynamic Times.
Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's body lying on the street, where he lost his vital signs, and his body was lying on the street for four hours.
"Magic," Ferrer thought.
But death is nothing new for her and her community.
She dropped her cell phone and did not turn on Twitter until the same night to read the tweets about the crowd gathering on Canfield Avenue.
There's a police video and a photo of people screaming, and there's a photo of a man who claims to be Brown's father, and it says, "Policies Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed and a policeman standing in front of a crowd of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman raised his rifle and screamed: “I will kill all of you ... animals”.
"It's not normal," Ferrer recalled.
“This is not what we used to call a typical murder.”
At that moment, I was chilling.
I'm angry, I'm crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father ' s home and decided to go to Ferguson the following morning.
In the next three years, what happened to Ferrer and Ferguson was the theme of a new documentary, "Who's Street?" that was shown at the cinema on August 11.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of those who live in this community and are crowded with streets and alleys demanding answers.
When Ferrer drove to Ferguson with her daughter, wearing a flower dress and wearing a coronation, they revisited the numerous topics they had discussed before that morning: “About black experiences and the situation of blacks”.
"Do you remember when I taught you when black people had to fight for their faith?" She recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is wrong.
I had to take her with me, "Real said later.
“What happens today is the climax of everything in the past.
She needs to know, see and rise from this.
She needs not only to develop well in radicalism and organizational aspects, but also to understand the different dimensions of the black experience and the black situation and what we must do to be free and free.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with experiences of racism that she had not experienced personally, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I think I'm hurting her."
They arrived at the first stop in Ferguson at a site opposite the South Florence police station. The site became their camp when the militants waited for the final outcome of police officer Darren Wilson’s failure to prosecute.
Ferrer and her daughter contacted a local business owner who was packing lunch.
They have prepared bags and are responsible for handing them over to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new type of activism.
She said, “My radicalism changed completely after 9 August.” At St. Louis, Missouri State University, she was President of the Association of Nurses and Students of Ethnic Minorities, focusing on the gap between food justice and health in the black community.
“I have no organizational experience.
And that's all there is to it."
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with film co-director Sabah Fryyan during a night march.
Fleiyan said that she and her photographer, Lucas Alvarado Fall, “just wanted to record what happened”.
A question arises in Ferrer's mind: "Do you want to record or find a story you can use?"
This suspicion stems from many cases in which people, usually whites, enter a community to benefit from their pain and resilience.
As Fryyan explained in his most recent interview, “we have heard that native-born people in Ferguson do not concentrate their voices, and we want to do it differently”.
Fryyan has contacted co-director Damon Davis. Damon Davis is a regional artist known for his activism against death row prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrer to join with six other locals in the “Whose Street?” project team, which lasted several years after Brown was shot.
“This documentary is not a talk or talk to us, this is our statement.” Davis says.
"I'm concerned about how these people are presented, because that's the way I'm being presented."
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrer’s experience – but to show that the campaign “is not about the Savior’s leader, but about community cohesion”, Fryyan says – she has proved to be the most open of film participants.
As a result, “Whose street?” is a surprising record of Ferrer's personal life, such as falling in love and entering into marriage.
"I feel naked," Ferrer laughed when he first saw the finished product.
“But I understand that there must be a degree of vulnerability to do this and to humanize blacks.”
In addition, Ferrer ' s story reaffirms and repositions the role of black cool women in the wider black life event movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- the creation of #BlackLivesMutter on social media following the 2012 shooting of a black teenager, Trevor Martin -- were identified as cool.
“Black cool women in leadership generally support this movement,” said Ferrer, “That's because we fight on multiple fronts.
Black cool women have to live with this."
Fryyan agreed and said, “This movement really enjoys the support of black women and many black cool women.”
Because of her identity, Ferrer was chosen as the core of the film. However, she insisted that this was not “a positive action for the sake of the matter”.
"She's the one who inspires this energy," she said.
“Although she's on the front line, it's not a coincidence. Because in these crossroads, as a black cool woman, you have a lot to do.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras had long disappeared, but ethnic tensions between the community and the police persisted.
As a result of an attempt to block the highway during a demonstration, Ferrer was given a suspended sentence of more than two and a half years.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in what she called the area of the home: “a mess”.
Nevertheless, since she went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has been insisting on the Holy Song she tried to remember.
“It is our duty to fight for freedom.
It is our responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We can no longer afford to lose except the shackles of our bodies.”
In fact, online translation services had been available on the Internet 10 years earlier, and the argument that “machines were about to replace humans for translation” had been heard a long time ago.
Similarity: Artists use Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
There are multiple faces in the centre of the museum in Friedman, New York: white, black and brown, with almost undetectable similarities between each face, which is tied by the ropes drawn from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea Manning's cheek tampons and hair scraps.
Manning sent hair fragments from Livingworth Fort Prison, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years ' imprisonment for leaking confidential diplomatic telegrams via WikiLeaks website.
The exhibit was opened on 2 August under the title “Similarities”.
This is the result of two years of communication between Dewey Hargerburg and Manning, Dewey Hargerburg, who combines his discipline with his own technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a famous dissident, who went to prison and completed a sex reassignment surgery in prison.
An arithmetic analysis from Manning's DNA, which created 30 portraits of "exceedings very likely." Heather Duway Harborg made a sharp and somewhat heartless comment. His comments were both of a multi-minded nature to DNA.
Manning was born under the name Bradley Edward, who publicly admitted that she was a woman at puberty. He was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including 6 espionage offences, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photograph, a photo taken in black and white with a pelvis, apparently uneasy, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum-colored wig.
In 2015, Heather Dudwig had a great success in her 2012 project, The Face of Strangers.
In that piece, she used DNA taken from cigarette butts and chewing gum in mid-court exhibits, from scraps, to create portraits of possibly similar 3D characters.
That's exactly an e-mail she received from PaperSmart magazine.
“They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison, and they need a portrait,” Heather Duwie Hubberg said to the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning couldn't visit or take pictures at the time, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
As a result, the artist and her imprisoned muse became impossible pen friends and exchanged many letters over a period of two years.
They even created a comic book, The Repressed Head, by Shoili Kanungu. The comic book envisaged that the president would grant Manning privileges in the future, and that she would be able to see an exhibition in prison.
And Obama asked for her release just a few days after the publication of the book. This may be a coincidence, when Manning spent his seventh year in Kansas Military Prison.
In addition, the exhibition has another meaning. Because of the current US, the Trump government has continuously declared war on government leakers and transgender soldiers, while seeking new ways to unmask the split, which it is trying to bridge.
When asked about all this particular occasion, Heather Duway Harborg said, “Anything happens for a reason”.
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's super-large signature is on the bottom, calling for an end to the “mixed images of parties based on gender, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, with pencils twisting Cs, Gs and As symbols.
With 200 letters (or nucleic acid, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heather Duway Harborg wants to express itself, at least in a physiological structure, by drawing these amazingly similar portraits.
“I hope that people get out of this dilemma, that our genome doesn't care who we are, how open genetic data are interpreted, how subjective it is.” Heather Duway Harborg says his 2007 video, "False Memory," is also on display.
"DNA data can tell many different stories, so this is 30 of them."
The last piece of work in the exhibition, in a room, came from a page in a novel in the illustrations preceding it.
The soldiers in the United States were shown to be exaggerating under a loudspeaker, makin' a manning model.
"When they stop your speech, they win," says the wall.
"So don't shut up."
"This came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm afraid again, and I'm still going to say it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition herself, as foreseen in the comic book, but when she does, she'll have her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters cheering in the center of the gallery.
It's also purposeful, just like all the items in the exhibition, to reach the height of the genetic monolithic information she wrote in pencils (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
“In the past, I put them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a group of people”, Dewey Hagburg said when he spoke of the portrait.
“But I want them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting against her release.”
Professor at Northwestern University and staff at Oxford University are wanted for murder.
According to the police, a man was found to have been fatally stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago and a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were subsequently wanted and are currently searching for suspects throughout the country.
The Cook County Court records show that on Monday, 42-year-old Windham Lesem and 56-year-old Andrew Wallen were arrested for the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranlo for murder without bail in the first instance.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell Duranlo died as a result of multiple stab wounds.
According to a community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July.
Upon receiving a telephone call, the police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment and found several fractures on the victim ' s body.
According to the police, Cornell Duranlo died on the spot, the detective is investigating the murder, and the police are actively looking for the two suspects.
Lessem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement, the Deputy Director of Campus Relations, Alan K. Cobbage, stated that Lessem had now been separated from his post and had been denied access to the University of the North West campus.
According to Kabechi, “it is now a criminal case and the relevant authorities are investigating it, and the University of Northwestern is actively cooperating with the investigation”.
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
“We have been in contact with the British police and stand ready to assist U.S. investigative agencies as required”, a spokesman for the Summerville College at Oxford University, in an e-mail statement.
The statement added that all of Warren ' s colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped that he would be able to turn himself in.
Anthony Gulermi, Chief Liaison Officer of the Chicago Police Department, expressed strong encouragement to suspects to surrender to the authorities.
Gulermi said that “the police have a general idea of their whereabouts, and we are trying to locate possible locations”.
Gulermi indicated that local, regional and national authorities were fully assisting in the search of suspects.
Gulermi stated that the police had received a telephone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment, and that he had just received a secret reminder that something had happened in apartment No. 1008.
The police claimed that the situation was terrible.
Gulermi stated that it was still unclear whether the incident had also occurred on 27 July.
He stated that, according to the security cameras, it was confirmed that Lesem and Warren were in the building at the time.
“We believe that Professor Lessem has something to do with the victims,” Goodhrmi said.
The management team of Grand Plaza issued a statement to the residents that “the police are currently studying the victim's timeline and circumstances and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident”.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Muteko stated that “we will complete the road map for the world anti-doping agency in the near future”.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Muteko stated that it would not take too long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for restoring the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“The implementation of the road map standards has reached a certain stage, and RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA Road Map has been updated in this regard.” Muteko indicated on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Muteko made this statement in his comments on the second part of the compliance section of the road map of the World Anti-Doping Agency, which sets out the criteria for the restoration of RUSADA rights and was recently published on the organization ' s website.
According to Muteko, the criteria do not contain anything that could give rise to Russian concerns.
He added that “everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be submitted to IOC [IOC] and WADA in the near future.”
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency must publicly accept the findings of the investigation approved by Canadian lawyer Richard MacKaylen on WADA concerning Russian State support for the use of stimulants in national sports.
Turning to this, Muteco said: “We are investigating that our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind it, and we will not acknowledge what does not exist.”
The words of Muteko echoed the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian public anti-doping committee.
Smirnov acknowledged the past problems of the Russian anti-doping agency when he was interviewed by the media earlier that day, but added: “We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and provisions.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally.” Smirnov said.
Following the November 2015 stimulant scandal, WADA suspended the right of RUSADA to carry out stimulant screening in Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate tests this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
During his visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, the Director-General of WADA, Olivia Negri, stated that RUSADA was “going in the right direction” in an effort to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it be chess or national chess, defeating human beings was no longer a matter of decades ago.
In an interview, Croatian FIFA President Davo-Suk said that participation in the Chinese Cup was very interesting for Croatian football and that the number of prizes for the Chinese Cup was very high.
No more surrogates! There's zero duty on more than 8,000 products.
At a regular press conference organized by the Ministry of Commerce on 11 January, the Ministry of Commerce press spokesman indicated at the peak that, to date, there are 15 FTAs in force in our country, covering 23 countries and territories, covering more than 8,000 items of zero-tariff imports.
At the same time, imports of cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean wine, and tropical fruits from ASEAN... these products you want are no longer purchased at great cost.
At present, 16 free trade agreements have been signed with 24 countries and territories and 15 have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 products imported at zero tariffs.
In the case of agricultural products, with the implementation of the FTA, consumers are able to taste agricultural products of varying origin and of good quality and good value every quarter of the year.
For example, in ASEAN, tropical fruits such as durians, twigs and falcons, import tariffs are reduced from 15 to 30 per cent to zero.
Tariffs on Iceland ' s salmon imports were reduced from 10 to 12 per cent to zero;
(a) Red wine in Georgia and Chile, where import tariffs are reduced from 14 to 30 per cent to zero;
There are also significant tax cuts for special agricultural products such as beef and milk powder in New Zealand.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, part of the import of cosmetics in Switzerland has been reduced to zero;
(b) A 50 per cent reduction in duty duties on selected watch imports, which will be reduced to zero in a few years;
Korea ' s imports of products such as refrigerators, cooking pans, massage machines and beauty machines have been reduced by 40 per cent and will be reduced to zero in a few years ' time;
There are also significant tax reductions for consumer-type electronics, among others.
At the same time, tariff-free products under the FTA include intermediate products and raw materials for the manufacture of many domestic final consumer goods, which have contributed to some structural upgrading of domestically produced consumer goods.
The Ministry of Commerce ' s press spokesman has indicated at a peak that our imports of nearly one third of all products are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Goods, most of which are final consumer goods, with tangible benefits for consumers.
Further reduction of tariffs on imports of consumer goods
Since 1 December 2017, we have adjusted our tariffs on the import of some consumer goods, further reducing the tariffs on the import of consumer goods, covering a total of 187 consumer goods, including foodstuffs, health-care products, medicines, daily goods, shoe caps, household equipment, cultural entertainment, and groceries, for a total of 8 persons.
The average tax rate for this consumer product will drop from 17.3 per cent to 7.7 per cent, almost “stopping” it!
We have also partially adjusted our customs duties on other imports and exports since 1 January 2018.
(b) Tariffs on imports of cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shadow and perfume were reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent;
Lowering tariffs means that consumers do not have to purchase or go all the way abroad to buy their favorite foreign products.
2018 U.S. Imported Merries Festival: Imports of wine, snacks, fruits are cheap!
Exterior: At the end of the year, U.S. malls are very different.
China-New Network December 29th.
According to the United States Daily News, just after Christmas, there was a retreat.
According to the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), about half of the goods sold last Christmas were re-sold.
In addition, readers have been defrauded on a number of occasions to buy content, and consumers need to be careful when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but when buying gifts or electricity from small shops, care must be taken.
Ms. Huo of Rolandon bought a coat on 1 December local time at an online shop specializing in stamp jackets, at a cost of over 60 (US$, under the same) and has not yet arrived.
She sent an e-mail to the customer's service, and she didn't reply.
There were also reports of visits to the United States last year to buy a mobile phone from a third-party seller, which was sent and found to be a box of rubber mud.
After knowing that he had been deceived, he applied to the website for a refund, which was good enough to be paid in full.
However, there are customers who believe that the website refund service is not 100 per cent perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident in Northern California, said that he had purchased an emergency distribution service for a website twice and an emergency service for $4 a time, but had failed to deliver it twice on time.
No response was received to a subsequent application for a refund.
Large malls or shopping malls have a better return policy.
Most of Macy's commodities are fully refunded within 180 days.
Goods must, however, remain “old” and must have purchase vouchers such as receipts or bank purchase records.
In the absence of a certificate, the customer may also obtain a market score that can be used for the purchase of other commodities.
Target usually had a 90-day return period for general commodities, and electronics usually had 15 days.
However, the period for the return of electronic and recreational goods purchased between 1 November and 25 December 2017 was extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day period for refunds began to run on 25 December, i.e. before 25 January 2018.
A great shopping experience, a new era of shopping in the business world.
More than a decade ago, we were in the overall seller market with limited options and limited demand.
After 10 years of development, however, markets have long been transformed from seller to buyer markets, and consumer tastes have become worse today, and they are no longer satisfied with simple shopping practices of “one-hand delivery”.
Thus, how to give consumers an extreme shopping experience becomes the next competition for real estate developers.
Among the many factors affecting consumer shopping experiences, the impact of shopping centres in the business community is most significant.
It's about how local city builders focus on shopping experiences.
There are no identical leaves in the world, no identical shopping malls, and a famous shopping mall necessarily has its own characteristics.
For example, at the world-famous Kanyon shopping mall in Turkey, its unique wave-shaped architecture is inspired by Canyon, so Kanyon, named Concorde, walks 200 meters in the path of Minister Kanyon.
In addition to canyon-style designs, there is a large elliptical performance site in the centre of shopping malls, which is unique in shape and often features.
The open platform was designed to allow tourists to walk on each floor to look down at the activities carried out in the “cany” and have the effect of a change of scenery.
At home, the Nanjing Forest Moor Commercial Street, known as China ' s first forest-style stroll-and-collage, combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales.
7000 square metres Green Square, 3,000 square metres roof water platform. The project consists of nine monolithic buildings, which are connected to each other in the air, which are designed to sink the courtyard as a whole, take the French tree above the ground to be the surface of the building, the roof water ceiling, and create a forest-like feeling.
Walking into the forest moor is like falling into a rabbit hole in Alice's vagabonds, climbing the trunks surrounding the building, the grasses, the springs, and bringing people into a forest full of life and vitality.
Also in Chongqing, Long Lake built the Salvain Water Community to plan 100 different businesses and plans to introduce in the future more than 50 international top-selling flagships, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 national and international brands to become centres of business with a strong focus on the services industry.
In addition, the Reginan Water Business Circle integrates ecology into buildings, is guided by ToD public transport, is a combination of fashion shopping, living services, catering, recreation, education and sports, and provides consumers with a unique shopping experience while also leading them to enjoy the unique “waterfront culture” of Chongqing.
On the whole, it can be seen that some housing enterprises are now familiar with this new urban business trajectories, and industry sources suggest that this consumer model, centred on the consumer experience, and how to combine shopping with experience, will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
The business world today is not just a repository of goods, but also a complex of artistic and creative themes, which also carries with it responsibility for urban settlements.
Thus, while meeting the one-stop material needs of consumers to eat and play, maximizing the multilayered spiritual need for the transmission of cultural arts and the need for habitable housing is necessarily a high point for the future development of the business community.
In Chongqing, the north bank of the nation is located north of the river, close to the bridge, close to the sound bridge, the world's commercial excellence, the international conglomerates around the world, and first-class brands are congregated to connect to international fashion.
There's a lot of pace here, and there's a lot of beauty in the world.
Toyohara, for its part, has a better shopping environment. Toshihara, which is close to the South Lawn Business Circle, has an exclusive access to the four-storey, and even the country ' s leading, four-storey traffic system, which enhances the comfort of shopping.
In addition, the greening of the gardens and landscape floors on the two walking streets of the Leisure Work Road and Wanda Square have been upgraded by planting approximately 300 logs, renovating 40,000 square metres of land and raising the profile of the business community on the South Lawn;
Lake Dragon Lake One, near Chongqing's first low-density waterfront, surrounded by nine parks, low density and openness of commercial neighbourhoods, makes people more willing to stay, stay and enjoy the pleasure of shopping rather than being left behind.
Today's commercial competition will only grow stronger, and it will be worthwhile for all real estate developers to think seriously about how to kill a bloody path in a highly homogenous market and win the reputation of a “shopping shrine” in the hearts of future consumers.
Disparity strategies alone are far from sufficient, and only those developers who really put consumers in their minds, rush consumers, think consumers' minds, and offer consumers an excellent and easy shopping experience can laugh in the markets where storms come.
Of course, at the end of the day, I think it is the people of Chongqing who have such good shopping experience and business circles that no one could have imagined today's prosperity 10 years ago.
Festival: Consumerist carnivals to mask real environmental prices
16,82.2 billion dollars, which is the equivalent of 24 hours of the 11th Global Carnival of Skycats on 11 November 2017.
Specifically, three minutes after the launch of the “double 11” cat trades over $10 billion, over $20 billion in six minutes and five seconds, and 100 billion in nine hours.
On that day, the total number of payments made by consumers worldwide through the payment of treasures amounted to 1.48 billion, an increase of 41 per cent over the previous year.
Such consumption will result in 812 million logistics orders.
Whether Skycat buys platforms or pay-as-you-go platforms, they belong to the Ali Group in Maun.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that the monolithic subculture created by single youth on 11 November, out of self-scoffing, would be compiled by electric dealers as a “double 11” shopping carnival of today's phenomenon.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used the first marketing head of the "Long Stick Festival": no one was in love with you, so the "single dogs" came to buy it online.
Surprisingly, this day's trade in Treasure Stewardship (the front of Sky Cat) went up by $52 million, 10 times the amount of the day's day-to-day trade.
Since then, the "Boy 11" has been a shopping carnival built by Ali Baba, with domestic buyers enjoying themselves from the beginning to the current influx of global merchants. Nine years later, the "Boy 1.1 billion" trade was more than 3,200 times as much as the year before.
There are also a number of power suppliers, among them the most powerful.
“Kingdong” has its own shopping festival “6.18” but has no “double 11” impact, with a cumulative sales value of 12.7 billion yuan from 1 to 11 November this year.
After the “twilight 11”, it was followed by a similar “twilight 12” festivities and Christmas New Year shopping slots.
After the New Year, Chinese consumers were waiting for the pre-spring annual purchase slots, Valentine ' s Day shopping slots, and did not spend time off.
The environmental implications of instantaneous consumption have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua's daily telecommunications, at least 300,000 tons of garbage were generated this year during the “double 11” period, based on a conservative estimate of the normal standard of 0.2 kg per box in industry.
Liu Hua, Director of Pollution Prevention and Control Project, Greenpeace East Asia Division, told the Chinese-China dialogue that this year's “double 11” Skycat-only orders generated 160,000 tons of packaged garbage.
The National Postal Service issued a report in 2016, which indicated that in 2015 during the “double 11” period (11-16 November) there were approximately 780 million pieces of fastware, using more than 3 billion woven bags, 9,922 million boxes, 16,985 million metres of tape and length of tape
This year, the National Post Office expects the “double 11” fastware volume to exceed 1.5 billion.
The manager of a waste-burning centre in Beijing City, Wang, told Xinhua Society that more than 2,000 tons of garbage had been brought into the yard every day after “two 11”, and that it exceeded the capacity of the burning station.
Express delivery companies have become aware of the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry.
A number of power suppliers, including Suning, introduced recycled and reused plastic delivery boxes before “double 11”, recycling bags that could be reused as shopping bags and garbage bags, etc., but did not have high acceptance among troubled consumers.
Maun also called on the logistics industry to support “green packaging” and “green logistics” in Twitter.
This microblogging has yielded more than 68,000 “goods”.
What kind of mobile payments do the Germans want?
JANG Dongfeng: The mobile payment battle in Germany is not looking forward to it.
We don't pay and pay but to move the battlefield to Europe. The rivals have not changed, the position has not changed — the Chinese — and so is globalization?
And wherefore there shall be a payment of treasure, and there shall be a payment of a Weife.
Pursuant to an agreement with Wirecard, the German electronic payment service provider, the payment was formally made in November this year in Germany and is gradually being laid out by businesses in the European context.
The two “home towns” met this time in Europe.
The payment of treasures and the payment of micro-mails have been singing all along the path of globalization.
With regard to China ' s approach to the globalization of mobile payments, Irene ' s consultation on the China Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Study 2017 concluded that there were two types of measures: strategic investment, export of experience, equity and support for foreign home-grown mobile pay enterprises.
The second is the promotion of mobile payment services to foreign businesses through the consumption behaviour of Chinese tourists abroad, thereby changing the perception and acceptance of China ' s mobile payments by foreign natives.
It's true, the Chinese get the world.
China ' s rapid economic development, coupled with its large population base, is an attractive figure for Chinese tourists in Europe.
But it is also doomed that the Chinese mobile payment battle in Germany this time will not be expected.
Is it also globalization when we pay and pay the treasure to move the battlefield to Europe, where the rivals have not changed, where the positions seized — or the Chinese — have not changed?
What is more pioneering is the question of whether China ' s mobile payments can spread across Europe ' s interior?
Take Germany, for example.
"New Retail" enchanted.
Chen , Yang Kaihe: The Amazon announces military bookstores and grocery stores, regardless of timing or motivation, as it crowds into the world’s 10 largest retailers.
In November 2015, Amazon opened the first entity bookshop in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and Santiago.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened a shop in New York and plans to have at least eight by the end of the year.
At almost the same time, Amazon announced that no-man ' s supermarket (Amazon Go) was running on a trial basis, that customers did not have to wait in line to the store, nor did they have to close the accounts, that they could just go through the door and take away the goods they wanted, and that the purchase money would automatically be deducted from the customer ' s Amazon account.
As far as the Amazon is concerned, it is quite surprising that, in recent years, there has been a sudden movement on the physical stores.
Because as early as 2007, in an open letter to shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that the Amazon would not open a real shop easily unless the following four conditions were met at the same time:
1. We must be sure that this new opportunity will yield returns on shareholders ' investments;
2. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great importance to the company as a whole;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
We must be convinced that in this market we have sufficient resources to make customer-oriented differences.
Bookshops and grocery stores are the most shaky classification of retail sales in both entities and the first to fall in the wake of the rise of the Amazon.
The Amazon announced its entry into the markets of both entities, regardless of timing or motivation, as it crowds into the world ' s 10 largest retailers.
Was the Amazon practice contrary to the assurances contained in the shareholder's letter?
Similar voices were heard on the other side of the globe. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the Hangzhou Cloud Habitat Congress, President Ma Yun of the Board of Directors of Alibaba gave a keynote address.
He said, “From next year, Alibaba will no longer mention the term ‘electronic commerce’.
The era of pure power suppliers will soon come to an end and there will be no e-commerce in the next 10 or 20 years, to be replaced by “new retailing”.
New retailing takes place when there is a combination of on-line and logistics.”
At one point, the word “new retailing” appeared to have been enchanted and to have been spoken by the industry.
But what exactly does “new retail” mean?
If it's just a combination of fingers and lines, then the concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer, after tracking 180 of the largest electricity suppliers, estimated the total sales to be around $200 billion, of which the largest 25 accounted for more than $159 billion.
Of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers (e.g. Macy's Department, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.) that have only started operating on the line in the last five years.
The Alibaba Group is also well known for its $28.3 billion share in Sunning Clouds.
Globally, retailers and electricians are moving from a single channel to an all-channel retail system that covers real shops, power suppliers, mobile end-users and socialized media.
Is Maunti “new retailing” more a summing-up than a vision for the future?
If not, what is the difference between the whole channel concept and “new retailing”?
Perhaps the point is not whether or not to merge online with underline, but rather how to integrate.
Looking back at the past 20 years of retail trade, the rise of electricity suppliers, like the rise of early-year discounted retailers, focused on prices and convenience.
Depending on these two pains, the electrician moved the highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, from the bottom of the line to the line.
With the development of online consumption habits and the growing experience of clients, the electrician has extended its tentacles to other groups of goods and has begun to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO, “The use of Internet ideas and technologies to comprehensively reform and upgrade the existing stock of about 30 trillion social retailers makes it possible to effectively meet the rising consumer demand of Chinese consumers and makes the entire process of production, circulation and servicing of goods more efficient because of the extensive use of the Internet and big data”.
Thus, the road for the electrician is a path that is superficially light and actually heavy on assets.
“Light” means that the burden of fixed assets, staffing, management processes, etc. is not high in the traditional retail industry; “Light” means that significant inputs are required in logistics, warehousing, etc.
Changes in logistics modalities have ensured the efficiency of power suppliers.
According to the Chinese Government ' s online sources, Premier Li Keqiang of the State Council hosted the State Council ' s Standing Meeting on 28 April, which considered the expansion of domestic consumption demand to be an important step towards steady growth and structural adjustment.
It was determined that specific programmes would need to be developed by the relevant departments on the basis of scientific assessments as a matter of urgency.

On 18 January, in Chongqing, Ali Baba held a high-level dialogue on de-poverty among electricians, announcing the promotion of poverty eradication and rural revitalization through the exploration of a new “Internet+ anti-poverty” model.
This is a new “plus” for the fight against poverty, following the introduction of village strategies, the launch of rural treasure-hunting projects, the launch of online agricultural platforms to combat poverty and the establishment of the Ali Baba poverty alleviation fund.
The fight against poverty is one of China ' s most important national strategies of the present time.
Overall poverty eradication has never been achieved in China in the last few thousand years.
“The alleviation of poverty by electric power suppliers is an innovation in the new round of pro-poor development and is an important enabler in achieving the goal of poverty reduction and poverty eradication.
The Centre attaches great importance to, and notes, the role that the Internet can play in contributing to the fight against poverty by promoting the eradication of poverty through precision, precision and the release of agricultural products from the countryside through the Internet.”
As a result, as early as 2014, Ali proposed a village strategy, along with big data cloud computing and globalization, as three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Treasure (Village) Project to recruit “Village II” in the village, leading farmers out of poverty through electricity dealers.
In 2017, Ali, in partnership with the business sector, created the Agriculture for Poverty Channel, which now brings together 13 provinces, 120 poor counties at the national level.
Ali's platform has already generated 2,118 treasure-hunting villages.
Of these, close to 400 are found in poor districts in provinces and 33 in poor districts in 13 countries.
In 2017, at the Alibaba China retail platform, the country ' s treasure-hunting village sales amounted to 120 billion yuan.
Zhang Yong stated that, in the face of a national strategy to fight poverty, Ali had been thinking about how to use the technological, big data, cloud computing and other innovative capabilities of the Ali ' s economy to make a new way out of poverty.
Among them, the village is the main platform for Ali ' s electricity suppliers to lift themselves out of poverty, and a new link to the Internet to lift them out of poverty, which is directly available for sale.
In the planting chain, village-run and ant gold garments jointly support farming tools and micro-credits.
In 2017, 795 ants served in 832 poor counties at the national level, providing easy payment, credit, etc.
Greenbirds address storage and logistics, Skycats are responsible for marketing, and Aryan's big data counterfeasible guides agricultural production and further improves the standards of supply, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of electricity suppliers out of poverty requires not only products, marketing channels, industrial planning, but also human resources.
Ali has achieved a combination of “poverty-plus mind-raising” and sustainable poverty eradication through the introduction of electricity-business courses at the University of Boeing, which teach farmers standardized, quality-based and scale-based farming methods.
These courses have covered some 92 per cent of the poor counties at the national level.
The “public good mentality, business instruments” approach to poverty eradication also guarantees Ali's “real poverty reduction” when it comes to poverty reduction.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Alibaba, Maun, had stated that poverty eradication should be divided into three phases: poverty alleviation, poverty eradication and enrichment.
Poverty alleviation is for fish, for fish, and for fish, for fish, and for wealth is for farmers to build a “fish pond” and for farmers to have fish to feed.
The power-driven industries that are pro-poor are fish ponds.
In the area of industrial poverty alleviation, the model for poverty alleviation in the Los Angeles Apple industry, developed by Ali in cooperation with Shaan Shirokawa, has been replicated throughout the country as an example.
Anti-poverty efforts by Ali ' s electricity suppliers have also been recognized at the decision-making level.
Electric companies, represented by Alibaba, have been sent to ensure that farmers increase their yields through online and offline channels.
A number of village Xiaoji and ants in gold uniforms have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experiences in lifting electricity suppliers out of poverty.
Currently, the China office of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has been working with the village to reduce poverty in the electricity industry, including in Anhui.
On January 16, the Third Congress of the New Economic think tank, co-organized by the Ali Institute and the China Vision think tank, was attended by and addressed by Zhang Li, Director of the Institute of Electric Business of the Ministry of Commerce.
She believes that our globalization has actually ignored the most important issues, namely, the nature and use of globalization and the stages of globalization.
Many thus believe that globalization has stagnated and that many developed and developing countries have different attitudes and models towards globalization in the new phase.
The second is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what are the constraints of the medium-term phase of globalization?
The economic environment is constrained precisely by the changes in the economic base that have taken place as a result of globalization.
According to Zhang Lei, the global economic restructuring was largely over by the end of 2017, and a new round of growth would enter after 2018, the next round of growth must be a raw product.
The 7FRESH, the first birth market in Kyoto, has opened in recent days and plans to open more than 1,000 shops throughout the country over the next three to five years.
Together with Ali's box of horse fresh life, immortal super species, Sunin's fresh life, and the fish and fish of the United States, the “new retail store” has begun to pile up and to “squeak” each other on innovative models and even prices.
The race for fresh supermarkets has escalated and has become a phenomenonal issue in the new retail sector, where is the new retailing?
“In 2018, we will enter the country quickly, opening a lot of shops in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival.”
On the occasion of the Second New Retail Summit, the 10-year-old CEO revealed the "new game" of 2018.
“As of 2018, the boxhorse is not just a raw electrician, but a consumer's immediate-service consumer.
Underneath the core mode is the flow, the experience, and on the line is the real sale.”
Unlike traditional malls, supermarkets, boxes of horses are in the eyes of many consumers a fun and delicious “red shop”, and even intermediaries have developed the concept of “boxrooms”.
Both on-line power platforms and off-line retailers have advantages and disadvantages, while consumers appear through multiple channels, so both parties are trying the full-channel model.
The industry believes that, in the larger context of rising consumption, there will be an increase in the number of “cattlehorse” shops in 2018.
In the new year, there will be more innovation in the retail market.
"For example, a business model that combines online and underlines attracts the eyes of consumers, and the local supermarkets are called and called."
“These relationships talk too much, they don't work, and it turns out that you've brought a good experience to the consumer before I'm willing to pay.”
In the view of CEO Yuan Bin, a co-chair of the Big Rush Flying Bull Network, consumer habits have changed in the new retail environment and demand for purchases has changed.
Turns out the line was cut off, the line was broken, the line was beaten, the line was counter-attacked, and now the consumer is holding hands together, as there is no longer any distinction between the line and the line.
The competition for capital has made the new retail gunpowder, currently represented by fresh supermarkets, feel perfect.
The analysis found that the current pattern of new retail competition in first-line cities is far from reaching the Red Sea and that there are large areas of second-line cities yet to be excavated, and markets remain open and open.
Different types of industries bring the development of new retailing into a diversified state of development for new retailing.
In conjunction with the Institute of Financial and Economic Strategy of the China Institute of Social and Economic Sciences, China ' s Finance and Economics channel provides you with a dry product, which is the annual development report of China ' s electricity merchants, which is dwindled in the country.
What kind of report card has the Chinese electrician produced in the past year?
What are the trends in global electricity suppliers?
Let's do this for everyone.
Total sales are back on track at record speed again.
Since 2006, our online retail sales can be said to have been growing at a very high rate, and it's probably so cool to think that online purchases are fresh and can't be bought without a door.
However, starting in 2013, the increase in online retail sales began to fall below 50 per cent, with the first increase below 40 per cent in 2015 and 26.2 per cent in 2016.
This year, however, the situation is different, with retail sales on the Internet accelerating again, rising to 34.2 per cent in January-September this year.
The growth rate was significantly higher than in 2015 and 2016.
It may be that you're going around in circles and find it more pleasant to buy and buy.
Of this amount, the value of online retail sales of goods in kind is close to $5.08 trillion and the value of online retail sales of services is close to $1.49 trillion.
The share of total retail sales of social goods amounted to 13.6 per cent, an increase of almost 3 percentage points over the same period.
Class, don't fall asleep, focus. It's a great deal of retail sales on the Internet.
Second, French Internet users who love chopsticks, who buy $1925 per person, buy the most products on the Internet, which are clothing, worthy of being a fashionable country.
It's my favorite Internet purchase. Must be a young man?
To help you avoid the company becoming the next best starter.
Amy Erett used to want to investigate employee well-being at her e-commerce start-up company, but it didn't work.
Responses are often vague, unhelpful and even worse, deceptive.
Even though she was committed to anonymity, some employees still did not trust the process.
Eret was responsible for managing 75 people's San Francisco e-commerce and development company Madison Reed, who stated that “the responses received lacked consistency and objectivity”.
So she called outside to ask for help.
A new pool of start-ups in human resources has emerged in the wake of the rains, helping companies to understand how employees feel.
They build and empower software specifically designed to measure staff participation, thus allowing companies to conduct rapid polls for specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees and, in some cases, allow whistleblowers to report directly to the board of directors.
"Now, you can track your health by means of Strava and Fitbit, but where's the company Fitbit?" Jim Barnett, the co-founder and CEO of the Redwood Startup. Glint software analysis tool.
Eret said that in three years, she had gained more insight into the thinking and feelings of her employees using Glint.
In addition to rapid surveys and opinion polls by specific teams, Glint also provides company heat maps, which units have the highest number of complaints, which managers have low approval scores, and it is clear that this allows her to gain insight into the reasons.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must be skilled in taking control of the company’s workplace culture so that they do not become the next advantage.
For start-ups such as Glint, this corporate desire for supervision is an invaluable business opportunity.
The value of the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry is likely to exceed $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Financial Technology Analysis website Let's Talk Regulations.
Convercent, a start-up firm in Denver, Colorado, was committed to helping companies to prevent and detect bad behaviour, and saw an increase in interest and activity during the loss of the reputation of the elite earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Episode, Microsoft and Tesla.
Yuzuki has recently signed into a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized “diagnosis” surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view hot maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides anonymous SMS hotlines for staff to report misconduct.
If the chairman of the board is implicated, the complaint will go directly to the board of directors.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Convercent, stated: “The Court of Opinion usurps the powers of the regulatory body.
If a company is found to have treated its employees badly or to have behaved unethically against them, it may face the high consequences of consumer resistance, staff loss and involvement in litigation, as Quinlan indicates, even if the regulator is not involved.
Ruby Tuesday, a catering chain that spans more than 500 places and has more than 25,000 employees, has been in use for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of work norms and work protocols and provide easy access to company headquarters.
Prior to that, if an employee wishes to report a problem, he or she must find the company ' s head office telephone number or e-mail and lodge a formal complaint, which he or she hopes will be taken seriously.
This has often been a frightening and disturbing experience, as documented by James Witrano, the chief legal adviser to Ruby Tuesday, who believes that there is no good way to track complaints from employees.
But now that the company uses Convercent, it can more quickly identify and resolve problems that were previously unknown to a remote office, city or state, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage behaviour.
"I can get a full picture of my work experience closer, 360 degrees." Vitrano, who is responsible for Ruby Tuesday's risk management team, says.
“We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation.”
According to Quinlan, since 2002, companies have placed greater emphasis on ethics, values and staff professionalism in the wake of the closure of the Andorran firm of accountants for violating ethics through the Enron scandal.
But it was only after “social media went into their own world” that companies realized that they could not stop their blasts from spreading the virus online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, hope is seen as a strategy”, he said.
Both Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service and charge companies recurrent fees for the use of their products.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture investors who have already supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising its total capital to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million in funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, with a total of $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness of corporate, cultural and venture investments, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing number of studies show that today's employees have higher expectations of the workplace than before.
In a highly competitive market such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting items are mere bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued and that their time is spent on a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company, feel that their voices are heard, and what they do is useful, they're more committed to making the company succeed," says Nina McCartney, vice president of LinkedIn's global welfare and employee experience. LinkedIn uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio is performing well; companies are performing well in terms of employee loyalty and professionalism.
If the third-party analysis tool commits to increasing staff loyalty and professionalism, it is not surprising that they will seek financial support.
Experts on workplace culture said that it was important to have data on staff professionalism.
However, these data are useless unless corporate managers take action.
In fact, if a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be expected that the company is undergoing change.
If change is not moving fast enough, or if little progress is made, it may create disappointment and lead to the separation of staff from the company.
“If you want to look for 4000 proposals, then you need to be ready for 4000 conversations.” He has seen some mistakes in companies that rely too heavily on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow it all, the staff will think, "Do you really hear me?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I?"
Eret said that Madison Reed was now conducting a monthly staff survey and had been able to take action on the day that Glint reported the problem.
After collecting feedback from staff on their frustrations due to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by reorganizing her intra-company team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees and, in the long run, hopes to be able to make a shift in this industry, which is known for its high brain drain rate, to better retain its staff.
“If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you'll lose your talent.” Vitrano says.

NCAAA cancels twice a day and extends the daytime training of the Bears.
At approximately 11 p.m., members of the football team of the University of California, Los Angeles, wandered and chatted next to the team's new campus practice.
Some of the players have taken off their sweatshirts and exposed their bodies after hard training on the first day of the camp.
For a large part of the team, the few minutes are a break.
After three hours of practice, the participants in the summer course will return to the dormitory to prepare for the final exam and then return to the Wasserman Football Centre at 6.30 a.m. the following morning.
"The next three days are a choreographer for these guys," the bear coach Jim Mora said on Monday coming into Tuesday.
NCAA cancelled its practice twice a day (in order to ease the burden on the players), but actually extended their training time during the day - at least by Friday.
That's why the first three training sessions at UCLA are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to adjust to the crowding schedule.
From the cancellation of training twice a day to more training once a day, the Bears started training almost a week before the last season, and Moira first trained at the summer school during the six seasons in Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions from August 20 and then start preparing for the official race for Texas farmers in September.
Mora said that he supported the adjustment of the NCAA rules, although that would allow the players to have a busy trip to add another project.
“In three or four days, we will give them a huge amount of training, which is very challenging.” Mora said.
"They've just passed. They're grinding. They're great kids.
I think we'll have more time on Saturday. It's really great."
As soon as the camp is over, the University of California Los Angeles will be out of practice. Given the proximity of the parking lot and the clear view of Luskin Center, this is not an easy task. The Luskin Center High-Level Hotel has been thrown through the football net behind the goalposts.
Starting this weekend, members of the Bears will be staying at the hotel. But Mora admits that if these rooms are vacant during the season, there may be problems.
"We'll take security measures," Mora said.
“This is a real concern. The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in a room and record the training scene is not too far-fetched.
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good.
But we'll take security measures there, and we'll take security measures in parking lot 8.
We will make the best use of existing resources.
I wouldn't worry too much about it.
We've made plans.”
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) show that, in the second quarter of this year, the value of houses in Australia rose by an average of 1.5 to 2 per cent, an annual increase of 3.5 per cent, the lowest annual increase since March 2013.

House IT reported this morning that the Wall Street Journal reported that AT&T had cancelled its plans to sell China's new flagship smartphones in the United States.
China planned to announce this partnership on CES this week, and AT&T cancelled it at the last minute.
In response, on 9 January, Chinese journalists responded that on 9 January, local United States time, China would release new products and specific listing information to the United States market.
China has demonstrated its strength over the past five years through the introduction of high-end products in the global and United States markets.
According to earlier reports from IT House, China will launch a “best cell phone you've never heard of” at the CES exhibition in Las Vegas on the afternoon of 9 January, and will be able to sustain two days of use.
The industry is generally of the view that the Chinese flagship phone, which is about to be released, is Mate 10 Pro, on board the Android Oreo system.

Von Xiaogang called himself a virgin, learned how to make a round picture with the photographer, and even spent millions of dollars on a 10-minute audition for the photographer.
Facebook will launch a fact-checking feature to counter false news.
Facebook announced on Thursday that it would send more potential prank articles to third-party testing agencies and show the results under the original post. Facebook, the world’s largest online social network, is trying to crack so-called false news.
In a statement on its website, Facebook stated that Facebook would begin to use an updated machine to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to the fact-checker, and might show the results of the fact-finding under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main outlets of the so-called false news, and many believe that Facebook has influenced the 2016 presidential election in the United States.
This issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, with voters experiencing a proliferation of false stories before the May presidential elections in France, Germany taking the lead in adopting a scheme of fines before the September elections, and a fine if social media networks fail to remove hate posters in a timely manner.
In a separate statement in Germany on Thursday, Facebook indicated that a new fact-finding functional test was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing stories that are questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to help them make informed decisions about reading and sharing.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its “relevant articles” function and make other changes to its press summaries to reduce false news.
Create a drawing novel: The story of the Castle of England
Recently, the tiny Castle of Scottney played a leading role in a compressed version of the music film and was once a refuge for Mrs. Margaret Thatcher in the '70s and '80s.
But Scotney witnessed 700 years of turmoil in the comfort of the Baylor Gorge in Kent, and now it's built by Jamie Rhodes.
"I can see the ancient handwriting 300 years ago, and I find it so beautiful," he says.
“What kind of personality is this in order to leave this letter in my hands.”
Throughout the Middle Ages and through the Eduard era, a “Fortress of England” reads about the families living in Scottney, each story being by different artists from the future of England, such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Pecky Pecky.
This is not the first book by Rhodes that is based on archives: he also wrote " The Dead ' s Tooth and Other Story 2014 " , a book inspired by the British Library ' s literature, a work that he had done with uncontrollable creative passion.
He said, "I couldn't contain my writing impulse from the moment I saw the thumbprint left on the side of the letter, which was written by a double agent who worked for Jacobs in the 18th century."
"That's his fingerprints!
And the letter always smells like smoke, because then you need to light it up to light it up.
For us 300 years later, this smell makes us feel that they are also around us.
Oh, I love the archives!"
For those touched by the old paper, it seems wonderful to have been able to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust and Arts Council of England (“To be honest, I've been here a little too long”), and I can't believe it.
Rhodes spent several days visiting Victoria's “new” castle, looking at archives, studying many of the estate's treasures and ancient games, such as hyena heads hanging on walls and bottles that spent centuries in the moat.
He walks on the land and ruins of the old castles, chats with homeless people, gardeners and sometimes artistes who draw illustrations for his books.
And then at night, he'll "drink whiskey and write."
The hidden history of Scotney is not yet clear, because the British National Trust was fully entered only after the death of Elizabeth Hershey, the last heir in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff began processing the files, which he described as "the nobles of hundreds of years ago are leaving": "Oh, put them in the attic."
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps of national boundaries: “You'll think land disputes are boring” Rhodes says, “But two families will fight for a white birch tree.
Let go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the work began with castles, which led to a broader study of British history, including The Labor, which was traced to a man who left the new castle to participate in the peasant uprising of 1381.
The story of the book called Knights of Kent and Sussex recorded a riot in the castle in 1380, which Rhodes said.
“The peasants' uprising began in that area, and I think it was a good place to launch it.
Maybe there's a connection between these two?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of castles, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the reform of the British religion.
Or The Smuggler, who owned the story of an 18th century smuggler, Arthur Darrell, who was supposed to have his own funeral by filling his coffin with stones.
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Castle Scottney: “These gentlemen seem to be scoundrels, always borrowing money to buy things they can't afford.
Generations of Darrell men solve their debt by marrying rich old women, and I think they should be handsome young men who know how to pursue women.”
As his mission in the castle ended, Rhodes began to look for other peculiar writing experiences.
In the wilderness of Finland, he completed a drawing novel in two weeks, entitled “El?um?nm?ki”, which was a sanatorium in the early 20th century and which was slowly abandoned.
But Scotney has a special position for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"It's like, "Oh, I've got to go face-to-face in real life."
According to journalists, the Chinese intelligent car team is based in Pearlhai and the executive vice-president of communications in Central China, Tanjo.
Large energy companies are all “rich and enemy countries”, so who is the best of the many energy companies around the world?
Yesterday, the well-known PFC Energy Corporation announced its top 50 rankings of publicly listed energy companies in 2011, with the United States oil and gas producer Exxon Mobil championing at a market value of $406.3 billion, followed by Chinese oil and the Dutch Royal Shell.
In this list of PFCs, in 2007 and 2009, the top of the list was held by Exxon Mobil.
In 2011, out of the top 50 rankings, three companies from China and China entered, with Chinese petrochemicals number 9 and Chinese marine oil number 15, in addition to Chinese oil ranking 2.
According to the PFC, however, although the current price of oil is much higher than it was four years ago, PFC Energy Co. CEO notes that there are many reasons for the low overall market value, including mainly the decline in natural gas prices in North America and the low activity of the global stock market.
According to Xinhua, the heavy-polluted weather in and around Kyunjin has increased further since 16, with the emergence of a “blast watch” at the North Shojia, Sindang and AQI in the city of Xinjiang.
U.S. modification of green card regulations
The media quoted President Donald Trump's statement that the United States would launch a new immigration plan to amend the green card regulations.
The scheme is intended to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, and temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications are subject to stricter restrictions.
The new provisions were proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
The American media quoted Trump as saying that “this law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and achieve these benefits by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will replace the current programme and reduce chain migration.
This new application process is beneficial for applicants who speak English, have financial support and have skills that are beneficial to economic development.”
On 29 May, the first China Fireworks Safety and Environment Fair will be held in Xiaoyang.
The event will focus on the theme “Technology, safety, and environmental protection” for two days.
The Expo will invite a large number of experts, entrepreneurs and academic exchanges in the fireworks and fireworks industry to share the latest technology for the safe and environmentally sound use of fireworks and fireworks.
Of these, demonstration of fireworks mechanized production equipment and safe and environmentally friendly products will take place in the town of Oyster, with major exhibition projects including technologically mature, technically validated and safely justified fireworks for the production of drug-related machinery, low sensitivity, low explosive energy and other safe pyrotechnics, no sulphur, no trace
At the same time, the demonstration of the fireworks and fireworks safety and environmental products, organized by a group of 16 artillery companies in Yooyang, was divided into product selection and product demonstration phases, and the first-selected new and excellent products will be seen at the Gun Station and Golden Beach on the evening of May 29th in Yooyang City.

In order to optimize the landscape environment and build a beautiful South Yue, the “636” volunteer corps of the South Yue Tobacco Specialized Agency (branch) recently launched an environmental campaign entitled “Ramping the forest, caring for the home”.
The campaign was supported not only by the entire staff of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also by the involvement of retired senior staff members and their families in environmental practices.
The purpose of the volunteer campaign is to preserve the south's landscape resources and promote the concept of volunteerism “to care for others, to care for society, to care for nature”, as well as to enable the next generation to receive the potion of volunteer virtues from a young age.
Since its establishment at the beginning of April of this year, the “636” volunteer corps has been known to have 16 development members, with a series of volunteer activities, such as watching disabled retail customers, helping smoke farmers to care for tobacco leaves, and the Yaan earthquake love donation, becoming a volunteer force with a heart to deliver positive energy.

In recent years, the giants of the Silicon Valley such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook have been engaged in an arms race in the area of artificial intelligence (AI).
Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful.
Just when you didn't think it would be weirder in 2017, a new technology development report was released in the field of sex robots.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) published a report that looks forward to the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Shaggy, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking seriously the rise of sex robots.
Customers can choose the eye color, nipple shape and nail type of robot.
In the release of the new report, Shaggy said: “People laugh behind their backs, but corporations do have many sex robots, and we will see more.”
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflated dolls to robots with silicone skins, which are warm to touch, and which specifically use artificial intelligence to create human-like sexual reactions.
Users can also “self-defined” their robots to satisfy their preferences, ranging from eye colours, nipple shapes to fingernails or colours.
But even more disturbing is the fact that many robots with “personality” make the “reproducing wife” look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicon skins.
For example, RealBotix robots can come from definitions, such as shyness, depending on what the user considers attractive.
There are also Roxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Company, which can predetermine character characteristics, including a slightly shy “cold Fara” and a “breathy Wendy” of “at risk”.
“Roxxy Gold robots have personality that is as appropriate as possible to you.” True Company website is happy about this.
That's why she loves you and hates you.
She was just like a normal person in those days!
She can be lazy, she can talk, she can be `sexually strong'!"
The rise of sex robots has given rise to many uneases — not only to replace real human relationships — but also to the grotesque female character and the most worrying hint of rape in cold (read as resistance) Farah.
True Company compares Roxxy to a man's truncheon on its website.
The website says, "If a woman has a truncheon, why can't a man have Roxxy?"
But these sex robots aren't just lovers, and they're not just sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing maturity point to the darker and deeper part of our culture: fleeing from perfect gender equality to sex with submission as an additional option.
Of course, most men do not leave sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming more popular, they are still on the margins of the consumer culture.
But what has infiltrated us from the edges has made us see the course of the era in which we are living.
Many people were neither weird nor aggressive until the free market gave them the opportunity to become so.
It is no coincidence that these fine sex robots appear in an era where women ' s rights are threatened globally, and that a White House president boasts of sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the television drama The Tale of the Concubine is not about making the picture real, it is not about the body hanging, it is not about the eyes being dug out, it is about the imagination that is too real.
The Republic of Gillean is a leap, but it does not seem to be far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create, as technologically as possible, the body of the truest woman (although in proportion to the sex star).
The creators of these robots want them to have the human touch and imitate the real human movement.
But to put it bluntly, their “personality” does not represent a true woman.
They can't break up, they can't run away.
They have no recourse and no follow-up story, no independence at all, and no possibility of breaking complete slavery illusions.
In other words, they're fun slaves.
Or according to the general saying of 2017: make a girl.
The Great Wall tells the story of an ancient Chinese elite force that fought a deadly battle against monsters on the Great Wall, known as the Great Wall, in defence of humanity.
The last issue of the fourth season of Runaway Brothers has been recorded, and on May 30, the leader of the Runaway Boys Group, Deng, received a micro-letter interview from Shenyang Evening, a reporter from Shenyang Network, from the Runaway Boys to the Stinky Evil Angels.
Deng said, "I won't do the same thing in the show. I'll keep it up to date."
The great work of Trump?
Let Mitt Romney be the epiphany of common sense.
Political divisions have led to polarization among American voters, while, from a micro-view, they have undermined American family harmony. This is no surprise to the Trump era.
Before and after Christmas and Thanksgiving, major newspapers in the United States were rife with fears of how to respond to the election of Trump relatives.
It is generally believed that we are doing our best to pierce our “filtration bubble”.
It is Trump's power to bring his family together that makes less of a comment.
I mentioned this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, had a long history of discord with the Republicans in our family, and he was visiting me this week in New York.
She reminded me that united against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
As a result of working with Trump at the White House, all the people she knew, even relatives of Republicans who had been in political strife for decades, were suddenly and strangely on the same front.
It would certainly be a good thing if all of them were at the table. But I am shocked that, from a broader perspective, there are significant risks.
Although the leftist figure has always been encouraged by Trump, the heated effect of his presidency drives us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are talking about the possibility of fear that his odd behaviour might one day stop.
However, there is a more worrying and long-term scenario in which Trump would like to “normalize” his relationship with the right-wing Republicans, who had previously opposed Mr. President's standards and now suddenly appeared to be a symbol of reason.
I found myself recently missing a little bit about the madness of Mitt Romney: putting dogs on cars, 14% of the income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), and the crimes of these two moves do seem to be too minor compared to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate needed only rationally to qualify for incalculable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town, we took our kids to the carousel at New York Park, the biggest carousel managed by the central park administration in New York, and if you don't need coffee, these $3 tickets are the most valuable in the city.
The sounds of the wooden horses are as thunderous as they are, they are designed for fibreglass on the central cylinder, all the clowns and animals turn their heads, and look at their shoulders with horror and evil, while the jingle sounds strangely.
Too many mediocre cities are disappointing: the landscape overlooking high-rises has become old-fashioned, the skyline has become too familiar with the incentives that no longer provide, and the reality of cities does not sustain dreams.
35 years later, I haven't completely forgotten that day, and I found out that this "Swiss House" was not really a Swiss cabin, but a Swiss cabin in the theme bar "Ye Old Swiss Cottage," which I can't remember, but at a crossroads in northern London.
However, the carousel in Central Park is still a magical experience, and everyone has fun for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four 40-year-old girls.
If I could evaluate the carousel, I'd give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before I applied my credit card, I was asked to score one to five stars for my business experience.
And in my coffee shop in the corner of the street, it's the same thing, and it's the 15 percent tip option, which is for shopping on the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down the supposed neutral transaction, but also to put pressure on the waiter to add the personal element to the situation that is not needed.
The poor woman in the department store laughed, and I was tired, and the credit card business experience gave her five stars.
Oscar Pistolis moved from prison to hospital for chest pain.
It's the second time Pistolis left prison and moved to hospital.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of a wrist cut, which the prison official claimed was the result of his fall in the cell.
Pistolis was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutor against the initial manslaughter decision.
During the early hours of Valentine ' s Day in 2013, he shot Stimkamp several times at his home in Pretoria through the toilet door until his death.
Pistolis claimed that her girlfriend was mistaken for a break-in in the booth at night.
The Prosecutor has announced their intention to appeal again, this time for a six-year prison sentence against Pistolis, which they consider to be too lenient.
The National Public Prosecutor ' s Office indicated that an appeal would be lodged with the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard this year.
If the prosecutor wins, Pistolis will face an increase of 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

On 18 May, the Ministry of Finance published the Scheme for the Management of Rewarded Funds for the Restructuring of Industrial Enterprises, which will provide earmarked incentives for the elimination of excess capacity in the coal and steel sectors, amounting to 100 billion yuan.
Several local governments, such as Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang, have recently proposed reforms to address excess capacity.
Many of these provinces have even offered to actively seek the financial support of the Central Treasury for the productive capacity of their provinces.
In support of this, only eight provinces have published coal decapitulation targets that stand at 90 per cent of the national coal reduction plan.
In an interview with a journalist, Xiamen University's Director of the China Energy Policy Research Institute, Lim, argued that the iron and steel industry and coal industry's “degenerative capacity” on the basis of only $100 billion from the central government was far from sufficient, and that more funding needed to be addressed by local governments and businesses.
In Shanxi Province, the recently published regulations for the implementation of coal production capacity proposed the reorganization of the Shanxi Coal Group into a State-owned capital investment company, the reorganization of the assets and operations of the enterprise and the construction of a new business model.
The real funding gap may have been three times higher than before the subsidy, when the Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, Mr. Yoon Uymin, stated that the preliminary statistics for the “de-capacitation” of workers' coal systems were 1.3 million and the iron and steel system 500,000.
Reporters of the South Daily News (journalist / Xie Qingyu) were informed today by the Provincial Environmental Protection Agency that the results of the 2012 credit rating for environmental protection of key sources of pollution in Guangdong Province were being publicized.
It was assessed that 134 out of the 1,251 enterprises listed on the Environmentally Sound Credit Management List were not rated due to shutdowns, non-receipts, shutdowns, etc.
Among the companies to be evaluated for red medals, there are more heavily contaminated enterprises, mainly plating, dyeing, prevention, etc., and some sewage treatment plants are on the list.
According to the Department of Environmental Protection, the results of the ratings are now posted on the Department of Environmental Protection website in order to reflect the principles of openness, fairness and impartiality and subject to public scrutiny.
During the publicity period, the EPA receives public calls, letters, visits, etc., which will be investigated, verified and addressed by the EPA.
Climate change could irreversibly destroy a large number of species, including the resources and food on which humanity depended for its survival.
Waynes indicated that even if the heat did not kill the species directly, it could create a potential risk factor.
Research in Weins also shows that local extinction varies from region to region and that the incidence of local extinction of species in the tropics is one times higher than in temperate regions.

Does meat, dairy products and chocolate help to alleviate inflammational intestinal disease (IBD)?
The meat and chocolate may sound like your digestive system nightmare.
However, a new study shows the opposite: diets rich in meat protein and dairy products can help alleviate the associated symptoms of inflammated intestinal diseases.
The incurable disease affected the lives of some 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 British, causing stomach cramps and abdominal swelling, regular or haemorrhage, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington usually advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products in order to mitigate symptoms, but researchers find that key amino-colouric acids in proteins help to promote immune cell growth, which increases the intestine tolerance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, Chief Researcher, explained that immune cells patrol the intestinal tract to ensure that harmful microorganisms hidden in food do not sneak into the body.
A balance is maintained between the cells that cause inflammation and those that promote tolerance, protecting the body from all kinds of sensitive and fragile tissues.
Inflammation can occur when the equilibrium is too biased towards inflammation.
An immune-promoting cell was found in rats carrying specific bacteria.
Bacteria require cyanide (a component of protein) to form a cell ' s appearance.
Professor Colona said, “We have established a link between a bacterial population (which is a normal part of the intestinal microbes) and the development of cells that promote resilience.
The more cyanide is consumed in the diet, the more immune cells the mice have.
He suggested that if humans used the same method, i.e. a combination of Lactacetic Bacillus and a gluten-rich diet, a more resilient and less inflammatory intestinal environment could be created.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganewas, a postdoctor researcher, studied an immune cell that could increase resilience when she found out that a group of rats had such cells, but not when another group of the same strains were raised separately.
She suspected that the difference was related to the community of intestinal microorganisms in mice (beginning bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually living in the gastrointestinal tract).
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice revealed six bacterial species present in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
The mice were raised in a sterile environment and therefore lacked intestinal microorganisms and could not produce the immune cells, and the presence of Lactoccus produced immune cells.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers cultivate Lactium in liquids and then transfer small amounts of bacterium-free liquids to premature immune cells separated from young rats.
The immune cell developed into a resilient cell.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be demonstrated that the active ingredient is a by-product of glutenine amino acid, known as thallium-3-emulsifiable acid.
The number of cells increased by about 50 per cent when researchers doubled the number of chromosomes in mice' feed, but when the level of chromosomes was halved, the number of cells was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people, like rats, have the same resilient cells and that most of us have Lactus in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether humans can induce cell development from Lactus by-products in their bodies, as is the case with lab rats, but genetic defects associated with chlamydia have been detected among inflammated intestinal patients.
She said, “The growth of these cells is probably what we want because they control inflammation on the inside of the intestinal tract.
It may be inaccurate to say that the presence of high levels of cyanide in Lactium may lead to an increase in the number of species.
José Murinio thinks that Man United signed the Genius Nemania Matic.
On Wednesday night, following the first appearance of Nemania Matic in the Sampsolia contest, Muriño concluded that Mansion had signed a “genius” midfield player.
Martić came from Chelsea, with a contract of £40 million and won 2-1 in Dublin on Tuesday in the final pre-season match before the European Super Bowl in Royal Madrid, winning the favor of Paul Borgba and Andreas Perera.
However, during the pre-Brunesti Asian Tour, the Mattics were severely understated, with only 45 minutes to complete, and Muriño acknowledged that improvements were needed before the British super season began.
“He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and genius in the way he thinks — he thinks about football,” Murinio says.
"We will prepare him as soon as possible."
Muriño started setting up his headlines at the beginning of the season. Like Matic, the newly-contracted players Victor Linderlov and Romelu Lukacu also started playing at the Injehua Stadium.
This week, the independent newspaper reported that Muriño still wanted to bring in three more signed players, but he insisted that the club “worked well” and that he had four top-chosen players in his heart, three of whom had already been introduced to the club.
“The club brought in three of the contracted players, and I thank you very much.” He added.
“I would be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they have done a great deal for me.”
Will China be behind if it doesn't build a frigate?
With the recent announcement by the world ' s major naval powers of plans for the construction of new frigates, as if the frigates had been the focus of attention by the naval forces of the great Powers overnight, the first was the decision by Japan to purchase two new frigates in its 2018 defence budget, which led to the finalization of the Japanese frigate DEX plan.
With the entry of one of the most recent frigates, 054A, in late 2017, marks the construction of up to 29 frigates, approaching the sum of the 053H series of frigates, from the first 054A in 2006 to the present, 054
And the simple reason why so many 054As have been built is that they are profitable, useful and complement the many years of naval arrears.
The frigate 054A, which has been favoured by the Chinese Navy for many years with high value and good combat power, has been carrying about 4,000 tons of drainage, a 76-mm main gun, 32 units of a sea red flag-16 and a co-launching system of fish-8 anti-submarine missiles.
But, after all, this is a ship designed at the beginning of the twenty-first century, armed with a large gap in power systems and electronic radar equipment compared to the current world ' s mainstream frigates, such as the European frigates, which are equipped with full power propulsion, small multifunctional radars, large-sized helicopters.
So how China ' s new frigate should develop is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic approach of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will surely become the blue-water navy, and the future will be the ocean, with areas of vital interest to China for rapid deployment, a demonstration of the presence of force and, if necessary, a strong battle force to ensure that China ' s vital interests in the region are not compromised.
Looking at the location of the new frigate in the future Chinese naval sequence, the future Chinese navy should be similar to that of the United States Navy. In addition to the required offshore defence vessels, other major naval vessels will form carrier combat groups or amphibious attack ships as required.
And the role of the new frigate should serve as an anti-submersible main force and a neutral position in the immediate vicinity of the future carrier battles, and as a frigate class in the amphibious attack fleet, and on the basis of this demand, the new frigate must have a strong anti-submersible capability and a good one.
Based on the above positioning, a bold vision of the future of the frigate is possible.
First, there will be a significant increase in drainage compared to the current 054A frigates, estimated at about 5,000-6,000 tons for new frigates; the power system will use an integrated power propulsion system consisting of one QC280 modulated gas turbine and two diesel engines.
This would bring the overall level of the new frigates to the world ' s current best standards, even if compared to the FFG of the United States.
Of course, the above-mentioned concept is merely an assumption of the new frigate of national production, and in particular how we can only find out when the new frigate is in the water, so let us look forward to it.

In recent years, our city has encouraged enterprises to participate actively in the construction of national, industry and regional group standards, awarded 300,000 yuan to enterprises that are either primarily or involved in the development of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards, and 500,000 yuan to enterprises that manufacture brand certification through Zhejiang, which is the highest level of the award in the province and stimulates business participation in the subject matter.
Formerly, the head of the Wangqiang group production workshop, along with his staff, Gao Jian, was packing a security door block against theft as a sample for participation in the Zhejiang manufacturing group standard against the standards, to be sent to the Shao Hing Quality Monitoring Centre.
Just the previous two days, Wang Li had passed an on-site audit by the Zhejiang Manufacturing Accreditation Panel.
Quality indicated that a professional team of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations commended the group for its performance in core areas of excellence and autonomous innovation, agreeing that there was a perfect match, and that Wangqiang would be one of the first to adopt the standard as long as the product was tested.
The Wangqing Group is only a microcosm of the standard-motivated industrial transformation.
Our city has paralleled its Zhejiang manufacturing group standards and met the standards with yang and troupe groups.
Since the establishment last year of standards for Zhejiang manufacturing teams, developed by our city ' s security sector, companies such as Starzun and Shinzo have also actively applied for docking.

What's worse is that China's household debt rate is closer to the United States than it's going to be able to afford a home?
In recent times, there has been debate about recent changes in real estate policy, whether real estate policy will be untying again. Will the diversification of land policy providers lead to a decline in housing prices?
However, at a time when we were worried about real estate prices, about macroeconomic regulation and about the future of the real estate market, the People's Daily wrote again. The last time we devoted our comments to the regulation of real estate, the People's Daily writes about a comparison.
Today, let us talk about a bigger problem than buying a house: repayment of loans.
I. The growing housing debt crisis in China
According to data from the People ' s Daily Overseas edition, which published a review article, Awards and Loans. Fighting Youth ' s Joys and Concerns on 17 January, in November 2017, the China Third Quarterly Leveraging Process Report, published by the National Financial and Development Laboratory and the National Balance Sheet Research Centre of the Chinese Academy of Social Science and Technology, stated that
The share of debt of the resident sector in the overall real economy has increased, and the leverage rate has risen faster.
Studies indicate that China ' s households ' liabilities in financial institutions are dominated by consumer loans, accounting for about two thirds of the population ' s liabilities, which is about twice as high as their operating loans.
Among them, medium- and long-term loans, dominated by housing loans, account for about 80 per cent of consumer loans, but in terms of growth, short-term consumer loans are growing faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition, China ' s household debt rate merely accounts for the total amount of credit received by the family sector from financial institutions, while Chinese households have large amounts of private borrowing, including from relatives and friends, and have large hidden debts.
In view of the data, it is surprising to note that, according to statistics from the Suning Institute of Finance, the leverage rate for Chinese residents was only 3 per cent in 1996 and 18 per cent in 2008, but since 2008 it has begun to grow rapidly, doubling in just six years, reaching 36.4 per cent to 2017.
By way of comparison, in May last year, HSBC released a survey report covering nine countries and close to tens of thousands of respondents.
The report was addressed to the “Millennium Generation” of young people (born between 1980 and 2000) in nine countries.
The report states that China ' s housing ownership rate for young people after 80 and 90 years is as high as 70 per cent, leading the second largest country in Mexico (46 per cent) and double the United States target of 35 per cent.
The data tell us that one of the most likely problems is that China's largest potential “red rhinoceros” at this stage may not be able to pay their debts as compared to their inability to afford a home.
II. Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have previously analysed, although we have always said that China has higher housing prices, the housing ownership rate in China is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world.
Throughout the world ' s real estate markets, China ' s real estate market, due to its late start, has not experienced a major real estate crisis, except for what we said earlier about Hainan, but just 10 years ago, the financial tsunami of 2008 in the world began with the real estate crisis in the United States.
The real-estate crisis in the United States was attributed to two houses: Renaissance and Renaissance.
At the time of the golden age in the United States, real estate companies sold their houses to low-income people in the United States at a very low down payment in order to expand their sales. At a time when the United States economy was better, the real estate market also flourished.
The current situation in the United States, however, was one of financial assets and real estate assets that formed part of United States household assets, almost all of which were real estate in the United States low-income group, while most of the assets in the top 20 per cent of the high-income group were financial assets, and the higher the debt rate for real estate in the United States, the poorer.
It's a serious fact that these people buy their houses at a better time, so the money to pay their mortgages is also calculated in terms of their better income, and when income falls, the pressure on mortgages not only does not decrease, but even increases as some subprime loan schemes float, so that the real estate problems of these American families evolve over time.
This has led to a gradual decline in housing prices in the region, a process that has led to a further decline in housing prices and a vicious circle, when banks begin to recover their properties because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages because of low incomes and when they recover their properties at very low prices from buyers who default on loans.
As a result, a huge vicious circle emerged:
“The economic downturn — the decline in income — a segment of the population cannot afford to pay their mortgages — the low prices of banks selling unindebted houses — the price of houses falls — more people stop paying their mortgages — the banks sell them — and the prices fall ”
And the problem is more than that, because the price of the house continues to fall, you don't have a debt after people stop paying the bank for the house, and if the money you owe to the bank for the sale of the house is still outstanding, then you still have to pay it back.
As a result, under such a vicious circle, the United States economy gradually collapsed, culminating in the United States financial crisis of 2008.
Therefore, the high level of domestic debt in China at this stage, at 46.8 per cent, is a matter of great vigilance, and the data are still below the level of developed countries, but the problem has begun to emerge, and the country has repeatedly emphasized deleveraging since last year, a very priori judgement, the household debt rate.
As a result, houses have been located for housing purposes rather than for fumigation, and the State has accelerated the establishment of multi-purpose supply, multi-channel security, rental and merger measures to further mitigate potential risks.
For our individual families, it is important to move away from real-estate speculation, to do everything in their power to buy a home, and to avoid the burden placed on their own families. Only a reasonable assessment of their income and level of indebtedness is a healthy path to family wealth development.

White House props cost thousands of dollars.
According to the military records published in Time magazine, last month the White House decided to transport a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of the United States manufacturing industry, at a cost of up to $24,000.
Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine I when the president was on board, was an important exhibit in the White House on July 17, highlighting the construction project in the United States.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Burns and senior White House officials visited manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibits included helicopters made in Connecticut, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the records of the first unit of the Force Marine Helicopter (HMX-1), which operated the helicopter, the White House Military Office required the helicopter to appear on the daily order (FRAGO), i.e., only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn to participate in the “special” event.
The day before the event, Commander HMX-1, in an e-mail sent to the superior Deputy Commander of the Marine Corps, stated, “I just want to make sure that you know that this event is highly valued”.
The information indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on 17 July for an event at 3 p.m. and leave only at 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on the same day.
The information also indicates that, in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, a second crew would be required to return due to the time limit for duty.
The original crew was on standby alongside the helicopter during the operation, while the security forces were on standby nearby while the aircraft was on the ground.
The record in Time magazine does not clearly indicate the eventual need for a second crew.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
It was noted that HMX-1 had asked whether the event was in violation of the Act.
The commander wrote that “one of the questions we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hutch Act and was told that there had been no violation”.
"It sounds like you're locked up." Deputy Commander replied.
The White House defined this “United States-manufactured” activity as an official activity and is therefore not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even official activities are political.
At the event, the President pursued the topic of the then Senate: the reform of the medical system and gave a great deal of credit to the control of the laws and regulations of the Government.
The use of Marine I or Air Force I aircraft for political propaganda purposes is no longer new.
Successive presidents have been asked to travel by these aircraft.
However, it is not common for them to be requisitioned for the sole purpose of taking photographs.
Trump received attention in February, when the Presidential jet slipped through Melbourne, Florida, and ended up in the background of his first election rally, while his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the use of the Presidential jet by the former President.
The White House deputy news spokesman Lindsay Walters said that “the White House was excited about this “American Manufacturing” exhibition, which showcased products from all 50 states, all of which were made by American workers using American materials”.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn to practice the accurate placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
HMX-1 performed 58 landings at the White House during Trump ' s G-20 Summit in Germany in early July.
One official stated that the U.S. manufacturing flight was included in this month ' s crew training requirements.
The helicopter unit also flew an additional 11 hours of “non-presidential support mission” on the same day.
The White House claimed that the taxpayers did not bear the cost of any other props for the event.
The spokesman for Sikorsky stated that the company was not involved in arranging a South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 did not maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and it was therefore very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence ' s hourly costs recorded for the 2017 financial year, the reimbursable costs of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D were USD 24,380 per flight hour.
The force recorded 30 minutes of each flight from the base at Quantico Marine Airport, Virginia.
The White House, for its part, claimed that the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower than that cost.
Walters claims that “the cost of the taxpayer is very misleading in estimating it on the basis of reimbursable fees.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs, including in the annual appropriation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the reimbursable costs of the Ministry of Defence did not include personnel costs, but did include oil, maintenance and contractual costs.
At that time, a former White House news spokesman, Sean Speicher, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to show what the U.S. made this week.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, and they both have contributed to our national security, and I guess there are hundreds of people who work on it without thousands of people.
And I feel that, like most Americans, we are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the fruit of countless American efforts.
So it's certainly not out of the question.”
It is not clear to us whether Trump interacted with the helicopter during an active tour of the South Lawn, but he did take the driving seat of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky and joked about the company ' s aircraft, which he owned, with the media.
He said, "I know the Sikorsky plane. I have three."

According to the United Nations, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political status of women
On Wednesday, the Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said that only elections in which all members of society, including women, participated would be representative.
The Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, Nicholas Hayesom, stated that hundreds of women were participating in the provincial council elections, three women were participating in the vice-presidential elections and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters were women.
In his statement on Wednesday, he stated that “the status of women must not be diminished”.
Only when women are fully involved and included in all stages of the electoral process will truly be representative and credible elections.

13 developers competed for the price of a block of land in the Tianhai Red Chemical Plant or would break 10,000 yuan/m2
Sheng City evening news reporter Zhao Yanhua reported that no fewer than 13 developers will be fighting this afternoon to rob the red factory plot. Today's concession will be the red factory block on Yellow River Avenue in the Tianhai region, which is a type II residential area (R2) and covers 17304 square miles.
The plots contain small and medium-size housing requirements, with less than 90 square metres of housing constituting no less than 60 per cent of the total area of residential development.
Based on the maximum size of the small and medium-sized household, the plot will provide at least 303 small and medium-sized dwellings.
According to the information received, the plot is located east of Yellow Pilgrim, and across the road is the Tianye Building Design Institute. The perimeter is well equipped for the first residential area of the Tianye River that has been set up this year.
In addition, a second category of residential land (R2) will be available today for the White Cloud Zone along with the North Road of the East Pocketstone (R2), with an area of 32891 m2 (30,965 m2) for construction, 92,895 m2 for construction, with a starting price of $61,311,000.

This pleases the family of high aunts living in the residence of the Democratic Road Office of the City of Nanning.
Neighbors say it’s a rare thing to see. The residents of the neighborhood think it’s a good thing to come and watch.
The “Maraba Chest” is a tropical plant of Mexican origin, warm and humid, and flowering is possible only when many conditions, such as sunlight, moisture and nutrients, are appropriate.
Even in the wild, where tropical conditions are appropriate, it is rare for rich trees to bloom, with the expression “only one in a thousand” being used.
Yesterday morning, journalists came to the residence of the Democratic Road Office in Nanning City and, under the guidance of Aunt Gao, they saw the rich tree.
The rich trees are grown in a small garden about 5 metres high, the thickest branches about 30 centimetres long, and the leaves are green and thick.
At the top of the higher branch, the flower blooms more than 10 centimetres wide, the thin yellow silk spreads, and the green flower glitters split and curls on both sides, and the flowers are as fine as silver and the filamentary dots.
Aunt Gao told journalists that the rich tree had been planted for eight years and that it was about 1 metre taller and now more than 5 metres long.
This is the picture that her son bought from the flowerbird market, which she planted in the garden, and which she did not manage very much, sometimes only to cultivate soil.

According to the Market Star, between 2005 and 2011, my provincial GDP rose from the central side to the bottom.
For this reason, the Departmental Economic Information Centre’s latest edition of the Economic Blue Page proposes to improve the quality and effectiveness of economic growth.
It is based on a number of representative indicators of our provincial economy in 2005 and 2011 and is compared with the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic efficiency, in 2011, the energy-intensive industries in my province, which account for a significant proportion of industrial energy, raw materials, etc., were heavily affected by market fluctuations and “double pressure” on excess capacity. At the same time, the dominant industries, such as domestic electricity and automobiles, were under-innovated, resulting in low profits.
The lack of commensurate economic benefits from large investments is an important reason for the poor quality and efficiency of economic growth in our province.
In this regard, the experts recommended that effective measures be taken to encourage innovation in enterprises and that the scientific and technological achievements of universities and research institutes be “transferred” to enterprises in a timely manner.
With regard to the low efficiency of the industrial economy, experts said that industrial merger restructuring, optimal industrial layout and extension of the industrial chain should also be actively promoted.

The UK General Union (GMB) is concerned with investments in the McVitie plant in Glasgow.
The union hopes that the management of McVitata, the manufacturer of biscuits, will ensure a long-term commitment to production at the Lasco factory.
According to the Scottish branch of the United Kingdom Confederation of Trade Unions, the company has remained silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross factory.
The factory has more than 500 employees and produces products such as oatmeal biscuits (Hobnobs), tea biscuits (Rich tea).
Pladis, the owner of McVitat, indicated that the company had invested more than £5 million in the factory over the past few years.
He added that in the event of changes in the operation of the plant, employees and trade union representatives “will take the lead in knowing”.
In a letter addressed to the director of the company, the Scottish branch of the British General Union called on McVitat “to resolve the problem of money not being transferred to the modernization of the production line”.
The Senior Founder of the General Union of Britain, Drew Duffy, said: “We are deeply concerned that we do not have a clear idea of the future business needs and investment plans of Tollcross from the general manager of the plant.
Generations of families work here, and the high concentration of labour in the local community and in Grand Glasgow is an important pillar of high unemployment and social deprivation of decent employment in the region.
Thus, from the perspective of employment, pay and economic prosperity, the east of Glasgow is in dire need of an expanding McVitat production network against the backdrop of the rise in the cost of living and the long-term decline in manufacturing in the United Kingdom.”
“The director of Tollcross just yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of the British Confederation of Trade Unions, and the company will respond immediately because of the importance we attach to maintaining continuous contact with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the General Union of England in Tollcross to discuss a number of issues in public.
We had discussions with our employees and then, like all other companies operating in an environment of intense competition and economic uncertainty, we reviewed the continuing business model that we applied to enterprises and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in terms of production lines and operational improvements.
We are fully aware of the historical status of Tollcross as a production base, and if there is any change in our operations at the plant, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to know.”
On 11 May, the Deputy Director of Sports of the Tibet Autonomous Region of the China-China News Agency (journalist Chen Xingbin), Nima Tsien-in 10, said at the base camp of the north slope of Everest, that in the future, the clean-up of living garbage on the north slope of Everest would move from past actions of public interest led by the Chinese Government to the participation of the international community.
On 10 May, environmental volunteers loaded the collected garbage into the truck.
Over the past decade or so, the issue of environmental protection at the peak site has become more pronounced as the number of explorers and tourists on Everest has increased dramatically.
In the spring of 1997, the Tibetan Autonomous Region Mountain Climbing Association launched its first clean-up campaign on the north slopes of Everest, cleaning up a collection of living waste such as oxygen bottles left over from the 1960s and 1970s. The video was also shown at the Tokyo World Climate Conference, which attracted world attention.
According to Nima Tirin, after 1997, the public interest team has been cleaning the northern slopes of Everest, but most of the participants are non-professionals.
Three years ago in St. Germain, Paris, did you warn Barcelona to sign Nemal?
Nica may regret throwing an olive branch at Marco Valetti.
After an offer of £189 million to allow it to exercise its immunity clause, St. Germain, Paris, would not give up its entry into Nemal, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of launching an attack on the world record raider?
This sensational approach has opened the summer roundup window, and the Al-Facha Club is going to break the world round record at more than twice the last round. Paul Borgba returned to Mansion in the last quarter, amounting to £89 million.
Once the transition is completed, Nemal will jump to the highest-priced player in the world and will also be the world's highest-paid professional player — St. Germain, Paris, who provides after-tax payments of over £500,000 a week.
Barcelona was outraged by the manner in which Nemal was attacking and the way out, and sources of information on the Board of Directors of the Catalan team insisted that the club had been doing everything possible to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did President St. Germain of Paris make such predictions about the football world three years ago?
When Man City expressed interest in signing Bryce Matedi in 2014, Nasser Al-Hlaif gave a strong warning to any club that wanted to sign the best player in St. Germain in Paris.
“I'm not worried, because they know that if they touch any of our players, we'll be against them, and we'll contact their players,” Al-Hulafi says.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign on to our players, they will also suffer the consequences.”
Earlier this summer, the Spanish club seemed to have crossed the line and Barcelona threw an olive branch at Marco Valetti, the middle player of St. Germain in Paris.
St. Germain of Paris made it clear that they would not in any way allow the Italian foot to leave, and Barcelona would most likely be affected by the loss of Nemar, the genius of the battle.
Reporter Wang Qing: The International Seminar on New Energy Development and Technologies, co-sponsored by the National Electric Network Corporation and the International Electrotechnical Commission, was held in Frankfurt, Germany.
At present, accelerating the development of new sources of energy and promoting a clean low-carbon transformation of energy have become global trends.
The large-scale development and use of new sources of energy, together with problems of system security, problems of long-range transport, and problems of technological economy, are many challenges and challenges that need to be addressed and addressed.
The President of the National Electricity Network Corporation, Shu In Piao, revealed that the National Electricity Network Corporation was planning to expand the simultaneous grid to strengthen existing regional grid interconnections and to increase the trans-district transmission capacity to around 300 million kW by 2020.
In early August, the journalist was informed that during the first half of the year, it was known that the “three north” of the country was concentrated and that it was more common to leave the wind.
New sources of energy, such as saline wind power and photovoltaics, account for 70 per cent of Jiangsu. The development of new sources of energy along the coast and the local production of local consumption demonstrate great advantages and potential in saline cities.
3 January: The journalist was informed yesterday by the Guangzhou City Office that the spring flower market in 2008 would soon begin to call for tenders.
On 29 and 30 last month, tenders for orange and flowers were launched in the Handu district.
On 8 January 2008, an open exhibition was scheduled to take place at the Viet Su District Cultural and Art Centre, where the construction began at the end of January.
In addition, the Viet Xiu District Department of Culture will hold a flower market forum in which senior leaders of Guangzhou City, social folklore experts, social celebrities, the old neighborhoods of Beijing Road, among others, will be invited to discuss the history and future development of the Lusi Lake Land market in Beijing.
At that time, the flower market forum will reach out to the online media for live webcasting and simultaneous interaction with the public.
In addition, an online flower market has been opened, using a regional information network to send introductory text messages on the flower market to citizens entering the Beijing business circle and the West Lake flower market for shopping purposes, and mobile phones can be used to stream the “net flower market”.

Deterioration of fiscal subsidies for Sichuan-based new-energy vehicles, low coverage of charging facilities, suspension of three-dollar lithium batteries in new-energy passenger vehicles, and current upward pressure on the domestic market for new-energy vehicles
From 3 to 6 November, during the first phase of the 16th International Fair for Western China (hereinafter referred to as “Siborg”), the six municipal states of Chengdu, Nanchun and Jaan demonstrated their development gains in advanced manufacturing, with new energy vehicles emerging and new features.
Currently, there is temporary upward pressure on the domestic market for new energy vehicles as fiscal subsidies for new energy vehicles are reduced, recharge facilities are less widely available and lithium batteries are suspended for use in new energy buses.
However, the Sichuan-made new-energy vehicle is on the rise, and the market is broken down by large-scale vehicles and commercial vehicles.
The current situation of the newspaper journalist Zhao Zewoo: The recent news of the Sichuan New Energy Automobile Industry has continued, focusing on the development of “Spin Sons”.
Less than eight months after the acquisition of East Fung Nam Car Co. Ltd. was completed, on 26 October, the brand of the new commercial car under the Gili Holding Group (hereinafter referred to as “Gili Group”) was first launched in Chengdu, and the first under the flag was carried by a smart car network platform with a light power.

On 9 January, the British Sports Council of the Xinhua Society in London (journalist Prince Jiang) announced the goal of participating in the Korean Ping Chang Winter Olympics next month: to win at least five medals, the “most ambitious” goal in the history of the British delegation to the Winter Olympics.
The British Sports Council is responsible for allocating funds for each Olympic project and, of course, also for targeting projects.
It is assumed that British athletes have promising impact medals from single-board skiing, ice kettles, steel-coated snow trucks and short-way skiing.
During the past winter Olympic cycle, the British Sports Council allocated a total of Pound32 million (approximately RMB 280 million) for training for the Winter Olympics project, doubling the Pesi Winter Olympics cycle.
Most of this money comes from national lottery tickets and the rest from national finances.
Britain's hope for gold is primarily placed on two people: Alice Christy, last year's world short-track fast-sliding championship winner, and Liz Janod, the last female steel-coated snow-car champion.
In the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, the British delegation had achieved the best performance since the first Winter Olympics in 1924.
Wales AM worried about "like an idiot."
It was suggested that AM should change the title to MWP, which was a shock to a lot of AM.
The proposal was made because of the plan to change the name of Parliament to the Welsh Assembly.
The political community's AM is worried it'll make people laugh.
A Labour Party AM stated that the Labour Party members were concerned that “the name rhymed with Twp and Pwp”.
(Non-Wales readers know that, in Welsh, twp means "stupid" and pwp means "shit."
One JP AM indicated that the entire JP was “unsatisfactory” and suggested replacing it with another name.
One Welsh Conservative said that the Conservative Party was “open” to the change of name, but noted that MWP was easily pronunciated as Muppet.
In that context, the Welsh letter w is pronunciation similar to the Yorkshire English letter u.
The Assembly Commission is currently drafting a law on name changes, stating: “It is their own business for the members of the Commission to ultimately decide which name to choose.”
The Welsh Government Act 2017 provides the Welsh Assembly with the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals for these names and there was general support for the use of the term “Senate of Wales”.
With regard to the title of AM, the Committee had a favourable preference for WMP (Member of the Welsh Assembly), but the highest rate of support in the public consultation was MWP.
It is clear that AM has suggested alternative names, but the President of the Conference, Elin Jones, has the headache of the delay in reaching agreement, as he is expected to submit draft legislation on name changes within a few weeks.
Legislation on reform will also incorporate other changes in the way Parliament operates, including rules for the disqualification of AM and the design of the committee system.
AM will vote on the final name during the legislative debate.
A referendum on changing the name of the country was held in Macedonia.
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of the country to “North Macedonia”.
The direct vote was to settle the decades-long dispute between Macedonia and its neighbour, Greece, also known as Macedonia.
The Athens side has consistently maintained that the name of its northern neighbour means that Greece has a legitimate right over its territory and has repeatedly rejected the accession of Macedonia to the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, was the opponent of the changed-name referendum and said that he would not participate in the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the change of name was nothing more than the inevitable cost of joining the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
The church in Harlem is in danger and the bells in St. Martin's church are silent.
"The old people I've interviewed in history say there's a bar and a church in every corner," Adams says.
"Now, there are neither bars nor churches."
He said the bar's disappearance was reasonable.
“Now, people are starting to socialize in different ways”, Adams said.
"The bar is no longer the neighborhood living room people regularly visit."
As for the Church, he feared that the funds for the sale of assets would not last as long as the leaders expected and that “the funds would sooner or later be nil”.
He added that the church would be replaced by an apartment building, which would contain people who would not help to maintain the remaining shelter in the neighbourhood.
“The vast majority of the apartments purchased in these buildings will be white”, he said, “it will therefore accelerate the overall closure of the church, as most people who move into these apartments are unlikely to be members of the church”.
Ten years after the construction of the Church of St. Martin, the Harlem district was built by white congregations before it became a black city (1870 metropolitan community).
The original white Methodists moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation who was performing worship in the vicinity acquired ownership of the building.
Under the leadership of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, the Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but since the parish residents of Father Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also commissioned the construction of the bell gin.
Father Johnson's son, the heir to St. Martin's Church, David Johnson, the pastor arrogantly called the bell of the poor.
Professionals who played the bell in July referred to it as “cultural treasures” and “an irreplaceable historic instrument”.
This professional, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that this was the world's first bell played by a black musician named Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the Riverside church 18 years ago to play a bigger bell.
Merriweather claims that the Church of St. Martin did not find someone to take his place.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom are brought by secular church leaders and others by bishops.
The parish administration (the parish council, composed of secular leaders) wrote to the parish in July expressing concern that “the parish was attempting to transfer capital to the parish council”, despite the fact that the parish councillor would not be involved in hiring architects and contractors who had been handed over by the parish.
Some parish residents complained of a lack of transparency in the conduct of parishes.
A 13-year-old boy in California was bitten by a shark while diving for lobster.
Officially, on Saturday, the opening day of the California lobster season, a 13-year-old boy was bitten by a shark while diving for lobster.
The attack took place near the beach in Nsenitas Beacon by 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel, in an interview with KSWB TV in Santiago, stated that on Saturday morning, he dived with his friends and, about half an hour later, heard a boy shout out for help, and then the pedestrians took him out of the water.
Harmer said he thought the boy was too excited to catch lobster at first, but then he realized that the boy was yelling, 'I got bit!'
I've been bitten!
His entire clavicle was torn open”, while Hamel said he noticed as soon as he arrived with the boy.
“I cried out to get him out of the water: ‘Sharks in the water!’” Hamer said again.
The boy was flown to the Children's Hospital in Santiago (Rady Children's Hospital) and is in critical condition.
The species of sharks in the attacks are not yet clear.
Captain Larry Giles, the lifeguard, stated at a press conference that a shark had been found in the area a few weeks earlier but had been determined not to pose a danger to humanity.
Charles added that the victim was traumatized in the upper part of his body.
For investigative and security reasons, a 48-hour official closure of Casablad ' s Ponto Beach to Swami Beach in Ensientas took place.
Charles indicated that there were more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them did not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury's planning to march into the British beauty market.
The Sainsbury's department store is to operate a beauty corridor with professional assistants in the company style of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
As a large number of department stores march into the British beauty market, valued at £2.8 billion, and during the fall of fashion and household goods sales, the market continues to grow and will be tested for beauty lanes in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be extended to more stores next year.
As supermarket television sets, microwaves and home racks were once prosecuted, supermarkets decided to invest in beauty products and to use the shelf space.
Seensbury stated that it would double the size of its beauty products and roll out more than 3000 products, including brands such as Luvette (Revlon), Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'oreal, Maybeline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space to have brand areas similar to those of stores like Boots.
The supermarket has also relaunched its own series of fine cosmetics, so that most of its products are pure vegetarian products — a requirement for more and more young shoppers.
In addition, a perfume retailer, Fragrance Shop, will open two shops in Seinsbury. The first one opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and the other will be in Birmingham by the end of this year.
The current trend towards online shopping and the purchase of small quantities of food in local convenience stores every day means that supermarkets must take more measures to attract visitors.
Mike Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of Seansbury, said that the supermarket chain would provide more services and non-food to counter the discounts Aldi and Lidl, which would become more and more like a hundred.
Since the acquisition of these two chains two years ago, Sernsbury's department store has been operating Argos in hundreds of stores, and has introduced some Habitats. The company states that the acquisition boosts the sale of grocery and brings profits.
The supermarket also tried to transform beauty and pharmacy before, but failed.
At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Seinsbury and Botzi tried to run a joint venture, but their cooperation ended after a dispute over how to draw revenue from the dispensary at Botzi Supermarket.
Three years ago, Seansbury proposed a new strategy to sell 281 drugstories to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, Celesio, at £125 million.
The company stated that Lloyds Pharmacy would play an important role in the scheme by adding a series of luxury skin protection brands to the four shops, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the business director of Seinesbury, said, "We've changed the appearance and atmosphere of the beauty passage and improved the environment for our customers."
We have also invested in the introduction of specially trained colleagues who will provide advice on the ground.
A series of our brands are designed to meet every demand, and an attractive environment and convenient geographical location means that we are now an attractive destination for beauty and will be a major challenge for traditional shopping methods.
After Holly Willoughby withdrew from the £11 million deal, Peter Jones was "deeply angry."
The TV host, Holly Willoughby, withdrew from the £11 million lifestyle brand business, instead focusing on a new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV, which led to Dragons Den.
Willoughby didn't have time to invest in their home clothes and apparel brands, Truly.
This is like Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand for partners.
The 37-year-old presenter of Thesis Morning announced in Instagram his decision to quit.
At the last minute, Holly Willoughby withdrew from a lucrative lifestyle branding business and turned to a rich new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which was a source of great anger for Dracon star Peter Jones.
According to the source, at an intense meeting held on Tuesday at Malloy Commercial Empire headquarters in Buckingham County, she admitted that she had made a new deal worth £1.5 million, and when she heard that news, Jones was “breathing” because it meant that she would not have enough time to invest in her co-operative home.
This business, like Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, could have doubled Willoughby's estimate of Pound11 million.
When Willoughby, age 37, announced on Instagram that he was withdrawing from Truly, Jones was on his way from England to one of his resorts.
One source said, "Truly was Holly's top priority.
This will be her long-term future plan for decades to come.
Her decision to withdraw was a shock to all participants.
No one believes what happened on Tuesday because it looks like it's about to go to the market.
There's an entire warehouse at Malloy's headquarters waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the United Kingdom ' s most profitable facilitator, This Morning, could result in millions of dollars in losses to the company, as it invests heavily in products such as mats, candles, clothing and household goods, in addition to further delaying market delivery.
This may mean the end of a long friendship.
Dan Baldwin, who is now the mother of three children, and his husband, Jones and his wife Tara Capp, have been close friends for 10 years.
Willoughby and Capp founded the Trelly brand in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as a director in March.
The two couples were always on vacation together, and Jones owned 40% of his shares in a TV production company in Polvin.
Willoughby will be M&S' brand advocate and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's host for "I'm A Celebity."
A source close to Jones said last night, “We don't comment on his business business.”
After the solemn talks, "We're in love."
In response to critical press statements, he joked that it was perceived to be “de-presidential” and that the North Korean leadership was overrated.
Why would President Trump sacrifice so much?
Trump mimics the sound of the news anchor.
"I didn't sacrifice anything."
He noted that, in June, the first meeting of the leaders of the two countries had been held in Singapore, and Trump commended that initiative as an important step towards the denuclearization of Korea, and that Kim Jong-un now intended to meet again.
But the denuclearization negotiations are at an impasse.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's highest diplomat, Lee Yong-ho, addressed the world's leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, claiming that North Korea had not seen the United States “satisfactory response” to Korea's early disarmament actions.
He noted that the United States continued to press back and impose sanctions.
Trump showed optimism in his rallies.
He said, "We're getting along well with North Korea."
“If we start a war with North Korea,
I'm afraid millions of people have died.
Now, that's a good relationship."
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong-un had yielded positive results, rocket tests had been terminated, hostages had been saved and the remains of United States soldiers had been left behind.
Moreover, when he talked about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, he justified his particular approach by saying,
“It's easy to be president, but instead of bringing 10,000 people out there into this crowded space, we'd rather have 200 people standing here”, Trump said directly to the crowd in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroyed an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Longbe Island, agencies such as foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they did not need their help.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 per cent of the population of the island, the Government has not declared a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for the initiation of international assistance.
“It is regrettable that, in many cases, they are well aware that they will not request international assistance, and therefore this will be a great challenge for them”, Ms. Sumbung said.
Save the Children (Save the Children) organized a team to Baru, but it is not yet possible to determine whether foreign staff will have access to the site.
The spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, Sutopo, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Baru to determine whether international agencies were needed to participate in the relief effort.
Aware of the possibility that Indonesia might continue to experience earthquakes and face the wrath of nature, Indonesia was still not well prepared.
Although Aceh has built a tsunami shelter, other coastlines have not followed suit.
Despite the effectiveness of the tsunami warning, the apparent absence of a tsunami warning in Baru may have been the main cause of the loss of life and injury.
Even under the most favourable circumstances, communication between many islands in Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
A medical boat, which was supposed to be stationed on Longbe Island for the victims of the earthquake, is on its way to Baru, but it will take at least three days to reach the new relief site.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of poor infrastructure in Indonesia a central part of his campaign, and has spent a great deal of money on repairing roads and railways.
However, as the elections are to be re-elected next year, the shortage of funds has plagued the Government.
Zoko is also under constant pressure from Indonesian sectarian tensions, and the majority of Muslim members are more conservative in their beliefs.
Christian and Muslim gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other crude weapons against the streets, killing more than 1,000 people and displacing tens of thousands.
Watch: The Liverpool team Daniel Sturridge will score evenly in the battle against Chelsea.
Saturday, at Stanford Bridge Stadium, London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in his 89-minute goal.
Stuart received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri 30 yards from the Chelsea gate when his team was 1-0 behind.
He passed the ball lightly to the left and then opened the door to the long-distance pillar.
When the ball moves towards the upper right corner of the gate, it flies very high above the restricted area.
Eventually, they crossed the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Stuart said, “I just want to get into that position, hold the ball, then Shaq and others will move as far forward as possible, and I just try to create the possibility for myself as much as possible”.
"I saw Canter walk over, touch the ball, shoot without thinking too much."
The 25th minute after the goal of the Belgian ball star Eden Hazard, Chelsea temporarily took the lead at 1-0.
In that game, the blue fronter passed the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic and then dumped the defensive break-in half of Liverpool near the middle of the field.
Kovasić played a quick sensitisation in the middle of the field.
Then Azar was brought into the restricted area with a beautiful direct pass.
Azar went beyond defense and left foot shot across the Liverpool team, Alisson Becker, and entered the long-distance pillar.
On Wednesday afternoon, at 3 p.m., the Liverpool team will be at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, in the battle against the Naples team in the European League of Champions (Champions League).
The Chelsea team will meet with the Vidioton team on Thursday afternoon at 3 p.m. in the UEFA Europa League in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The Indonesian National Disaster Management Authority said in the early hours of Sunday that the death toll caused by the earthquake in Indonesia had risen to 832 people.
The Authority ' s spokesperson, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, reported at a press conference that a 7.5-scale earthquake on Friday had triggered waves of up to six metres (20 feet), which had caused buildings to collapse and many people to be trapped in ruins.
The city of Pale, with a population of more than 380,000, is full of ruins and fragments of the collapsed building.
32-year-old man arrested by the police on suspicion of murder of a woman leading to his death
This morning, a female body was found in Birkenhead, Mercesside County, and the police opened an investigation into the murder.
The victim, a 44-year-old woman, was found dead at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, with marks of stab wounds on her body and 32-year-old male, arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called on the population in the area to provide a good clue.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, “The investigation is still in its early stages, and I call upon the crowd around Birkenhead John Street to contact us if there is any leads.
At the same time, I call upon all people, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if any leads are captured in the CarLog, and the information you have is essential to our investigation”.
A police spokesman confirmed that the victim was a local Birkenhead whose body had been found in a house.
This afternoon, a friend who knew the lady arrived at the scene and asked where she was found this morning.
The investigation was ongoing and the police had indicated that the victim ' s relatives were being informed.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just wanted to return to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
Find out what happened to him and he won't say a word.
At present, residents are notified and will have to wait a few hours to enter.
One police officer stated to a man that the entire area had been marked as a crime scene.
A woman cried at the scene.
He kept saying, "It's too bad."
At 2 p.m., two police vehicles were parked inside the cordon and a van was parked outside the cordon.
Several police officers were standing inside the cordon to monitor the apartment building.
Any person with knowledge can send DM to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously (telephone 0800 555 111), citing the record of 30 September 247.
The Assembly's Cromwell statue became a monument to the last controversy over “rew history”
The Taliban-style destruction of British cultural and religious monuments by the fanatical pagan followers of Cromwell is a punishment for exile.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick’s proposal “extremely stupid” and “trying to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: “There is no doubt that, in the current controversy over the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell, located outside the Westminster Palace, will be targeted.
The destruction of idolatry in the British civil war was neither directed by Cromwell nor launched by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's biggest mistake was to be the victim of what his predecessor, Thomas, had done in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's high praise for Cromwell is a good testimony of the 19th century's ideas and part of the Cromwell History that many believe is still to be celebrated.
Kim Smith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Clenville is considered by many to be the champion of Congress against external pressure (in his case, the monarchy), and today it may be less so than in the late 19th century.
Whether this expression is fully accurate has been the subject of historical controversy.
But it is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has affected the subsequent development of our country, with Cromwell being recognized for representing the divided side.
His achievements as Protector of the Nation deserve to be celebrated and commemorated as well.”
The "killing pig" tore the Chinese farmhouse to death.
According to local media reports, a farmer was killed by a pig in a market in the south-west of China.
According to the South China Morning Post, on Saturday, a man named Yuan was found dead and his arteries were cut and covered in blood near a market in six bowls of water in Guizhou Province.
On 30 May 2005, pigs were being vaccinated in a pig farm in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China.
On Wednesday, the pig farmer and his cousin reportedly arrived in the local market from Yunnan, a neighbouring province, to sell 15 pigs.
The following morning, his cousin found out that the pighouse was dead and that the door close to the pighouse was open.
He reported that there was a larger male pig in that coil and that there was blood in his mouth.
According to reports, a forensic medical examination confirmed that a 550-pound fat pig had attacked and killed the farmer.
Citing the news of the evening news of Guiyang, “My cousin's legs are blurred and miserable”, cousin Wu said.
According to surveillance footage, Yuan's last name was fed to pigs at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday morning.
His body was found about an hour later.
But the fat pig who died did not belong to the Yuan family name nor to his cousin.
The market manager revealed to the Evening News that the fat pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others again, while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
It was reported that the family of Yuan and the market authorities were negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, attacks on human beings by pigs have been reported before.
In 2016, on a farm in Massachusetts, a pig attacked a woman and her husband, seriously injuring them.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound fat pig held a farmer in Wales on a tractor until his wife came to scare the animal away.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon was swallowed up by his own pigs, and a farmer in Lake Manitoba revealed to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation News Network (CBC News) that pigs were usually not offensive, but that the smell of blood could act as a “trigger”.
“They just like to play.
They're as curious as children and they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them proper respect”, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will continue to cause heavy rains in the southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa continued to move along the northern coast of Mexico and, as the forecast indicates, the wind has weakened since the arrival of the cool sea.
However, in the coming days Rosa is also expected to bring widespread torrential rains and flash floods to northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
On Sunday, at 5 a.m. Eastern Time, the centre of “Rosa” is located 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, with a wind speed of 85 miles/hour, falling within category 1 hurricane.
“Rosa” is expected to continue north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific began to form a low valley eastward to the west coast of the United States. Rosa will form a tropical storm on Monday, near the Baja California peninsula, when deep tropical moisture will advance northwards to the southwest of the United States.
Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rainfall to parts of Mexico.
Thereafter, tropical moisture interacts with the coming valley and will cause extensive heavy rainfall in the south-west region in the coming days.
On the ground, 1-4 inch rainfall causes flooding, mudslides and even landslides in deserts.
The effect of deep tropical moisture will bring rainfall to a height of 2 to 3 inches per hour, particularly in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to range from 2 to 4 inches in parts of the south-west, particularly in most of Arizona.
Owing to the dispersed nature of tropical rains and the rapid deterioration of conditions, flooding is likely to occur.
Desert risk-taking activities will be dangerous because of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can lead to the formation of steep rivers in the canyon, which can lead to localized winds and dust.
The imminent arrival of the Valley will result in partial heavy rains on parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total rainfall may exceed half an inch, which may lead to minor mud flows and road slides.
This will be the first rains in the region since it entered the rainy season.
Sunday night and Monday morning, Arizona will be showering with scattered tropical showers, followed by a wider range of rains on Monday night and Tuesday.
The rain will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
As the Arctic gets colder and tropical areas remain quite warm, temperatures will fluctuate sharply across the United States in October.
This sometimes leads to drastic changes in temperature within short distances.
On Sundays, there will be a huge temperature gap in the centre of the United States.
The temperature gap between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, will be close to 20 degrees.
In the next few days, there will be another wave of heat, and the scope will expand.
Most parts of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to begin to heat in October, from the southern plains to parts of the north-east, with a wide temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 27 degrees Fahrenheit).
The temperature in New York City may also reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 27 degrees Fahrenheit) on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Long-term climate projections indicate that, as of the first half of October, temperatures in the eastern part of the United States were above average.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
Thursday, the hearing of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh with the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, took place on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with the broadcasters disrupting the last regular Friday show: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona promised to ask the FBI to open a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Committee that he was 100 per cent certain that Cavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, touched her body and wanted to take off her clothes.
Cavanaugh responded generously, stating that he was 100 per cent certain that this had not happened.
Nelson reported last Friday that there might be over 204 million people watching this hearing.
The company is calculating the average ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks that broadcast the hearings at the same time are not yet available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nelson, Inc., often encounters some problems in terms of the number of people watching the programme in the Statistical Office.
Objectively, this figure compares to the size of the audience for the after-season football match or the Oscar.
Nelson said Fox News had a full day view of 56.9 million people on the day of the hearing, pressuring other online media. Fox News News was a strong supporter of the appointment of Cavanaugh.
The ABC came to the rear, with a rating of 3.26 million.
Nelson, the CBS audience is 3.1 million, the NBC is 2.94 million, the MSNBC is 2.89 million and the CNN is 2.52 million.
At the end of the hearings, the level of interest remained high.
Blake's been at the heart of Friday's show.
Previously, the moderate Republican had issued a statement in his office that he would vote in favour of Cavanaugh. On Friday morning, he was taken by CNN and CBS cameras as he boarded the elevator for a hearing before the Judicial Council, and protesters shouted at him.
CNN saw him standing silently for a few minutes while he was being condemned.
One woman said, "I'm right in front of you."
"Do you think what he said to the nation is true?"
"You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Before the elevator was shut down, Frack stated that his office had issued a statement that he would make more statements at the Committee ' s hearings.
Cable television and radio networks were webcasting the follow-up, and the Judicial Council had voted to send Cavanaugh ' s nomination to the Senate for a vote in plenary.
But Frack said that he would vote only if the FBI investigated further allegations of sexual abuse by the candidate next week. The minority Democrats have been urging further investigations.
After a dialogue with a friend, Senator Chris Coons, the Democratic Party, Flacq was to some extent convinced of this.
Following a dialogue with Kuen and several senators, Frak took a decision.
The choice of Flacco was strong, as it was clear that Republicans would not vote for Cavanaugh without an investigation.
Trump has issued an order to the FBI to conduct a supplementary investigation into Judge Cavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister, Teresa May, accused the critics of the Deloitte issue of “playing political games”
British Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with The Sunday Times, accused the critics of his de-European project of “playing political games” on Britain’s future to the detriment of national interests.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018 for a Conservative Party conference.
In another interview in the front page of the newspaper, the former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson strongly criticized his so-called deOcchines initiative and stated that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the European Union should impose tariffs on each other was “irrelevance”.
Wayde Sims Shot: Police arrested a suspect in a shooting at Louisiana State University.
The police have arrested a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University, Wayde Sims, a suspect in the shooting.
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder.
The police released a video of the fighting between Sims and Simpson, stating that during the fight Sims lost his glasses.
The CBS subsidiary WAFB reported that the police found the glasses at the scene, stating that Simpson ' s DNA had been found on it.
After questioning Simpson, the police stated that Simpson confessed to the shooting of Wayde.
Advocate reported that it was worth $350,000.
East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office (East Batonruj County Department of Coroner Examinations) released a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head.
The Police Department is grateful to the Fugitive Fugitive Unit of the Louisiana State Police, which assisted in the investigation leading to the successful arrest of the fugitive, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and regional citizens.
Joe Alleva, Sport Supervisor, Louisiana State University, expressed his gratitude to the regional law enforcement authorities and commended them for their “cerial work and justice”.
Sims is 20 years old.
Sims was 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 metres) tall, was a vanguard, grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne was a member of the basketball team at Louisiana State University.
Last season, he got 5.6 points, 2.6 baskets.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, the master coach of the basketball team at Louisiana State University, said that the team was “satisfied” to Wayde's demise, “unacceptable”.
Wade says, "This is the last thing we want to see."
Volcanic eruption in Mexico City
The eruption of the Bobocatate volcano spreads ash to neighbourhoods in the south of the Mexican capital.
The Mexican National Disaster Preparedness Centre recorded smokes 183 times within 24 hours on Saturday, followed by a warning to the Mexican people to stay away from the volcano after the eruption.
The Disaster Prevention Centre monitors the repeated rumours and minor earthquakes.
Pictures in the social media show that the windshield of the car was covered with ashes in Hodzimirko, near Mexico City.
Geophysicalists have observed an increase in volcanic activity of 45 miles (72 kilometres) south-east of the capital since the September 2017 earthquake in central Mexico.
The volcano, also known as the “fest”, has been in operation since 1994.
On the eve of the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum, the police clashed with separatists.
On Saturday, thousands joined the anti-demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the Catalan bipolar division referendum, during which pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and six were subsequently arrested in Barcelona.
A group of masked supporters of the separatists threw eggs and powder paint at the riot police, causing dust to cover the streets of previous days, which were crowded with tourists and then stopped by the riot police.
There was also mixed fighting later that day, and the police used batons to contain the unrest.
“Don't forget, never forgive” pro-independence factions, confronted for several hours with the pro-unity protesters who chanted “Long live Spain”.
According to local media reports, 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
Last year ' s October 1st referendum was considered illegal in Madrid, where, a year later, tensions remained high in a pro-independence region, while the Catalan separatists celebrated.
Despite the fact that the vast majority of voters opted for independence, the turnout remained low, as the majority of those opposed to division refused to vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, last year the police tried to prevent successive polls at polling stations in the area, which triggered violent clashes, injuring nearly 1,000 people.
On Friday night, support was given to groups of independents to camp, to stop demonstrations and to support the actions of the national police.
Demonstrations continued, but other avenues had to be pursued.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in this separatist protest, expressed no longer any hope for the independence of Catalonia.
“In the past year, we have had the best time in our lives.
My parents cried because they were able to vote, but now we are in trouble”, he said.
Despite the most important and dangerous successes in the regional elections of December last year, the Catalan pro-independence faction tried to maintain its momentum this year, with many of its most prominent leaders either in exile or in pre-trial detention due to appearances during the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, an older mechanic, recorded the protests on his cell phone in support of the police, saying that the conflict had been instigated by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is becoming increasingly tense”, he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders held in pre-trial prisons since late last year, announced his participation in next year ' s European parliamentary elections.
“As a candidate for the European Parliament elections, he publicly condemned the Government of Spain's regression in terms of democratic perceptions and repression, which would be the most advantageous way”, he said.
London, Delhi County: three men were arrested for car crashing houses
Three of the men who committed the crime (aged 33, 34 and 39, respectively) ran into a house in Delhi County, London, and were arrested by the police after the incident.
The incident took place around 19:30 on Thursday at the location of Balynagard Crescent.
Senior police officer Bob Blemmings reported that the impact had caused damage to the gate and to the building itself.
In some cases, car crossbots may have been intervened.
Munga's batting team Livinston to win 1-0 against the vagrants.
Dolly Menga's first ball was Livingston and won.
The promotion of the Livingston team shocked the Travellers, Steven Gerard, who lost the race for the second time in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal was the key goal, and Gary Holt's team got the Irish team in section II.
Gerard's team has still not won the season, and they will lead its eight-point runners next week.
Until then, the Rangers will be in the European league on Thursday, the Rupid Vienna.
At the same time, the Livingston team will continue its undefeated record in the sixth race of the region, and since replacing Kenny Miller last month, the lead coach Holt has not had the taste of failure.
The Livingstons miss the opportunity to fight the Enemy.
Holt's team showed signs of leading before it scored, and their attacks caused a variety of problems for the vagrants.
Scott Robinson kicks the ball to the other side of the door, and Alan Lithgow gets the head of Craig Halkett.
Hosts are very willing to compete with the Travellers, as they know that they can cause trouble for the guest team when they locate the ball.
That's how the key shot comes.
The Rangers lost an arbitrary ball, the Livingstons opened an empty space, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson formed Munga, who took a point from the centre of the restricted area. The Travellers lost an arbitrary ball, Livingston broke the door, Declan.
At this point, while the Travellers have control of the ball, they find it difficult to break through the main guard, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly has nothing to worry about.
This pattern lasted until the second half, despite Alfredo Morelos taking a ball from Kelly's foot.
Scott Pittman was taken out by the Travellers, Alan McGregor, and Lisgo kicked another Livinston.
Crosses continues to enter the restricted area of the Livingston team and to be released, while two dots — after Halcott offered to put Glenn Middleton on the field and a handball — were kicked back.
The Livingston team's "Excellent Performance" analysis.
BBC, a Scottish journalist, Alasdair Lamont, reporting at Tony Makaroni Arena.
The Livingston team performed superbly, with impressive results.
The performance of all the players was excellent and, once again, exceeded expectations.
Since Holt returned to the top leagues, there has been little change in the style and staffing of the team, but Holt's honour for the team is indeed commendable.
He brought out a lot of heroic players.
Captain Halcott did a great job by deploying a highly organized defensive posture, while Monga, throughout the process, Jean Connor Goldson and Joe Wallall never set aside their guard.
However, the Travellers are not sufficiently demoralized.
They have occasionally performed well under Gerard's leadership, but they are far from the standard.
Their last shot did not go in — and they entered the main team only once — and it was a wake-up call for the vagrants in the middle.
Erdoğan has mixed feelings in Cologne.
On Saturday (29 September), the last day of the Turkish President's State visit to Germany, there was a million miles of clear air, and the leaders of the two countries had a friendly breakfast in Berlin.
President Erdoğan's visit to Germany was controversial and aimed at restoring relations between the two NATO allies.
They were deadlocked on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey ' s accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, Erdoğan went to a large new mosque in Cologne.
The city of Cologne has a large Turkish population and is outside the Turkish State, with its largest population.
The police prevented 25,000 viewers from travelling to the mosque for security reasons, but there were a number of supporters in the vicinity who welcomed the President.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdoğan, many of whom belong to Kurds, have also voiced their voices, condemning Erdoğan’s policy and the fact that the German Government should not welcome Erdoğan to Germany.
The protests on both sides reflected differences over Erdoğan’s visit: some German Turks called him a hero, while others condemned him as a dictator.
Dettford road traffic accident: owner of a bicycle crashed into a car and died.
A list of car owners died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred around 10:15 a.m. at the border between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver stopped and checked, and the medical staff made the rescue, but the owner of the bicycle was killed on the spot.
Just a few months before the accident, another list owner was killed in a hit-and-run crash on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
According to the London Metropolitan Police, the police were in the process of identifying the man and would inform his immediate family.
The roads have been closed, buses have been rerouted and drivers have been advised to bypass the area.
Long Lartin prison: six prison guards injured by the riots
According to the prison office, six prison guards were injured in a riot in a high-security male prison.
At 9:30 a.m. on Sunday morning in the United Kingdom, riots broke out in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcester County, and the riots were still ongoing.
Special cyclone commando teams were sent to the scene to deal with the riots involving eight prisoners, all of whom are now in control of a building.
Prison guards sustained minor facial injuries and received on-site medical treatment.
A spokesperson for the Prison Administration introduced the following: “A staff member specializing in prison riots has been deployed to deal with the ongoing riots in HMP Long Lartin.
Six injured prison guards have been treated.
We will not tolerate any violence in prison, and we will hand over the perpetrators to the police, who may face longer imprisonment.”
HMP Long Lartin Prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the United Kingdom.
In June, the director of the prison was reportedly attacked by prisoners before being taken to hospital for treatment.
Last October, riot police were used to go to this prison to deal with major disturbances and were attacked with a billiard strike.
Hurricane Rosa poses a threat of flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (arid areas may benefit from this).
Tropical low-pressure attacks on Arizona are rare, but this is likely to happen earlier next week, as the residual forces of Hurricane Rosa will attack the desert areas of the south-west, thereby creating a risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has issued flood warnings on Mondays and Tuesdays to areas ranging from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah (including Phoenix, Fragstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City).
Rosa is expected to arrive with rain later on Monday and transit above Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix wrote on Twitter that “since 1950, only 10 tropical cyclones have remained tropical storms or low air pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that landed within 40 miles of the Arizona border.”
According to the latest national hurricane centre (National Hurricane Centre) model, rainfall will reach 2 to 4 inches, and local rainfall on the edge of Mogolon, Arizona, will reach 6 inches.
Other desert areas in the south-west, including the middle of the Rockies and the large basins, are likely to have rainfall levels of 1 to 2 inches, with total local rainfall likely to reach 4 inches.
For areas that do not pose a risk of flooding, the rainfall brought by Rosa may be fortunate due to the severity of the drought in those areas.
While floods have triggered high priority, appropriate rainfall may also be useful, as the south-western region is currently experiencing drought.
According to weather.com, the United States weekly Drought Monitor (U.S. Drought Monitor) shows that more than 40 per cent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought conditions (the second most severe category).
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will lead to its landing on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa remained in hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind strength of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Cape Eugenia, Mexico, moving northwards at 12 miles per hour.
The hurricane was exposed to cooler seawater at a flat level, which led to a weakening of wind power.
As a result, landings from Mexico are expected on Monday afternoon or at night at the strength of tropical storms.
In parts of Mexico, rainfall is likely to be high and there is a risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, “total rainfall from the Baja California peninsula to the north-west of Sonora is expected to reach 3 to 6 inches, possibly 10 inches”.
Rosa then crossed Mexico north in the form of a tropical storm, arrived at the Arizona border on Tuesday morning in the form of a tropical depression, and crossed the entire Arizona state late on Tuesday night into southern Utah.
The National Hurricane Centre states that “it is expected that Rosa or her residual forces will suffer mainly from heavy rainfall in the Baja California peninsula, the north-west of Sonora and the south-western desert areas of the United States”.
The rains are expected to cause life-threatening floods and mudslides in desert areas and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: arrest of four suspects of attempted murder
The suspect was three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man.
The murdered teenage boy was found injured at around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Norton.
He was then taken to hospital, where he is “stable”.
Avon and Sommerset Police said suspects had been arrested overnight in Radstock District (of whom 17-year-old men, two-year-old men, two-year-old men and one-year-old man)
The police called on witnesses who caught video footage of the scene on their cell phones to provide clues.
Trump called Cavanaugh "the bearer of the despicable rage of the Democratic Party."
Trump stated at a rally in Welling, West Virginia: “A vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's ruthless and shameless tactics”.
According to Trump, Cavanaugh was “suffering and angry by the Democratic Party” throughout the nomination process.
On Thursday, at the hearing in Congress, Cavanaugh was moved to strongly deny the charges brought against him by Christine Blasey Ford, claiming that he had not sexually abused Ford a few decades earlier.
Ford was also present at the hearing on his allegations.
On Saturday, the President stated that the day “the American people saw Cavanaugh's decency and courage”.
The President said to supporters of West Virginia that “voting in favour of Judge Cavanaugh is voting for the most successful legal thinker of our time, a jurist with a reputation for public service”.
Referring to the importance of the Republican vote in the medium-term elections, the President indirectly insinuated the nomination of Cavanaugh.
We are five weeks away from the most important election in our lives.
"I'm not running for office. I'm running around like this.
To allow you to select a good candidate”, he said.
According to Trump, the Democratic Party's mission is “resistance and obstruction”.
A senior Republican leadership assistant briefed CNN that it was expected that the first critical procedural vote on the Cavanaugh nomination would be held in the Senate on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of people died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, which is still on the rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities stated that a major earthquake and tsunami had struck Sulawesi, Indonesia, killing at least 384 people, and that a number of people had been swept away as a wave washed over the beach.
On Friday evening, hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Baru City for a party, when a wave of up to 6 metres (18 feet) washed up the coast, killing many people and leaving the entire area of the tsunami completely untouched.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
The spokesperson for the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency BNPB, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at a briefing in Jakarta: “When the tsunami struck yesterday, people were on the beach and were unable to flee in time, and they were unfortunately killed”.
“The tsunami came with cars, firewood, houses and everything on land”, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a rate of 800 kilometres per hour (497 miles per hour) before attacking the coastline.
Some climbed to the trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 evacuation centres in Baru.
The aerial photographs released by relief agencies showed that many buildings and shops had been destroyed, bridges had been distorted and collapsed, and a mosque had been surrounded by seawater.
On Saturday, aftershocks continued to pervade the coastal city.
This region, which has 2.4 million people, has a strong sense of shock.
In a statement, the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Applications (BPPT) stated that the power released by the massive earthquake on Friday was approximately 200 times that of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The statement also noted that the city was at the end of a narrow bay and that geographical location was therefore likely to increase the power of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “large-scale” and indicated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were crushed under the ruins of the collapsing building, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho indicated that casualties and damage along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Baru, an area closer to the epicentre of the earthquake, were likely to increase.
The communication in Dungara was “completely paralysed without any news”, as Nugroho said.
ICRC stated that more than 300,000 people lived in that area and added that ICRC staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“Although this is already a tragedy, the situation is likely to be worse”, said ICRC.
The Agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to inform the general public that the tsunami had hit Baru, despite officials claiming that the tsunami had occurred after the warning had been issued.
In a video shared on social media by amateurs, one could hear a man on the upper floor of the building shouting madly at the crowd in the streets below, warning them of the impending tsunami.
A few minutes later, the water wall washed up the coast and drove away the building and the vehicles.
Reuters is not in a position to immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage and cut off communications around Baru, preventing government authorities from coordinating relief efforts.
According to the Indonesian authorities, the military had begun sending rescue transport aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees were still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport in Baru is currently open only for relief work and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centre in Baru on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia rose to over 800.
It's really, really bad.
Although CIVICUS staff have arrived safely in the city of Baru and its employees have been temporarily placed in a temporary tarpaulin shelter in the company ' s yard, the images they saw on their way are tragic, as Doseba said.
“They said they saw a number of houses damaged”, he said.
It's really, really bad.
While relief organizations began this brutal campaign to activate relief equipment, some complained that foreign relief workers with deep expertise were prevented from travelling to Baru.
According to Indonesian law, the movement of funds, goods and staff abroad is permitted only if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
However, it has not yet been announced.
“This is still a provincial disaster”, said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the Government says `this is a national disaster', we will be able to release international relief, but the current situation does not permit.”
On Friday, the night following the earthquake and tsunami, in Baru, relatives and friends of missing persons still hold a glimmer of hope that their loved ones will be able to create miracles and add to this tragic natural disaster.
On Saturday, the rescue crew recovered a little boy from the sewers.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been crushed under rubble for two days while her mother ' s body was next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national parachute, trained two missing parachutes to prepare for the Asian Games to be held in Indonesia earlier this month.
Other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, are his students.
“As a senior sportsman in the field of parachute, I bear a personal emotional burden”, he said.
Gendon stated that in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the parachute community, he tried to send word about whatsApp to the Baru competitor at the beach party.
However, his message always showed only a grey pair, not a blue pair.
"I think that means the message didn't work out," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while adding money to ATM on Newport on the Levee.
According to news reports released by the Newport Police Department, a staff member of Brink stole $26,750 from Newport on Friday morning while he was putting money in ATM on the Levee.
Dennis McCarthy of the police department reported that the driver of the car had emptied ATM from the entertainment restaurant and was preparing to add money to it.
While he was busy, a man “runs out behind this Brink employee” and steals a bag of money that should have been added to ATM.
Witnesses reportedly found multiple suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the case.
Anyone who can provide information about the identity of the thief should contact the Newport Police by calling 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to "Ye."
Kanye West changed his name to "Ye".
On Saturday, he announced a name change on Twitter. It reads, "The Kanye West, known to you before."
Forty-one-year-old West has been called "Ye" for some time now, and he used it as the title of the eighth album released in June 2018.
The change of name was announced prior to his participation in the Saturday Night Live programme, in which he is expected to introduce his new album, Yandhi.
The producer of the programme said that he had replaced Ariane Grande, the singer who had cancelled the programme for “emotional reasons”.
With the exception of the acronym as the current professional name of West, he had previously said that the term had religious significance for him.
West, in discussing the title of his album with the radio anchor Big Boy early this year, said: "I believe that 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, meaning 'you' in the Bible.
"So, I'm you, we're you.
Before, I used the name "Kanye", which means "One" and now "Ye", which reflects our good, evil, lost, everything.
This album is more of a reflection of who we are."
A lot of famous rappers have changed their names.
Sean Combs has used many names, most often "Puff Daddy" and "Lov" this year.
JAY-Z, which had worked with West before, had also changed its name by hyphenation or non-hyphenation and capital letters.
Mexico AMLO solemnly declares that there will be no use of force against civilians.
The President-elect of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Ofradore, solemnly declared that there would be no use of force against civilians on the occasion of the upcoming 50-year anniversary of the persecution of students in the country.
On Saturday, Lopez Ofradore made a promise at Tratelolco Plaza that “no force would ever be used to suppress the Mexican people”.
On 2 October 1968, as the leftist student movement took root throughout Latin America, Mexican forces fired during a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing as many as 300 people.
López Ofradore pledged to support the development of the younger generation of Mexico by subsidizing learners and opening more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities could lead young people to a criminal path.
United States should double A.I. Funds
As China becomes more active in the area of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research spending in this area, with investors and AI practitioners Kai-Fu Lee reporting. Lee used to work for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
This statement is directed at the AI Proclamation issued by various parts of the United States Government, which generally lacks a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
Last year, China launched a plan to become the leader of artificial intelligence innovation in 2030.
“In this area, all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for new breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, so doubling the budgets for artificial intelligence research will be a good start”, Lee explained.
Lee, in an interview with CNBC this week, described the possibility that doubling funding might double the likelihood that the United States would once again be a breaker of artificial intelligence.
Lee’s book, The Artificial Intelligent Super Power: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published last month by Harcourt Publishing House. Lee is the CEO of SinovationVentures, who invests in a Chinese-known company, AIS Face++.
In the '80s, he created an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, defeating Othello, the highest American contestant, and then became Microsoft.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government science and technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and then asked,
Researchers in the United States often pay a lot of money to get government subsidies, as Lee says.
"It's not China that's robbing our academic leaders, it's the business," Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent university personnel for AI jobs.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its work on artificial intelligence.
“I think it's time to offer a green card to Dr. A.I.”, he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China launched the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
According to Lee, in the United States, United States researchers receive funds from the National Science Foundation and other government organizations. Similarly, in China, the National Foundation for Natural Sciences funds researchers from academic institutions, but the quality of academic work in China is relatively poor.
At the beginning of this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre to attract industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of the Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion for a project called AI Next.
Currently, the National Science Foundation of the United States invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In contrast, the United States legislature, which for several months called for the establishment of the National Security Commission on Artificial Security, has not taken action.
Macedonia will hold a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The referendum held on Macedonian People's Week to vote on changing the name of the country to the “North Republic of Macedonia” would resolve the decades-long dispute between Macedonia and Greece, which had prevented its accession to the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
One of Greece ' s provinces, also known as Macedonia, retained the name of its northern neighbour, which meant that Greece had a legitimate right over its territory and had rejected its accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU).
The two Governments agreed in June on the name of the proposed new State, but nationalist opponents believe that changing the name would jeopardize the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slav population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not participate in the referendum and that the boycott raised doubts as to whether the results would meet the 50 per cent threshold for the referendum to take effect.
The question concerning the referendum was as follows: “Are you accepting the agreement with Greece for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU)?”
Proponents, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that Macedonia was one of the countries deriving from the dissolution of Yugoslavia and that seeking to join institutions such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) deserved a price.
“I come to vote today for the future of the country, for the younger generation of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means that we can all have a safer life”, Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, said Skopje.
Although not legally bound, there were enough members of Parliament who indicated that they would comply decisively with the results of the vote.
However, a two-thirds majority vote is required for a change of name.
The State Electoral Commission indicated that no reports of wrongdoing had been received by 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my child, and we live in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, age 62, in Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, and his wife, Zorica, and his son, Dushko, cast their votes in a referendum to change the name of the country.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and moving the chair to a tent built by the boycotters.
“Although it's for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU), we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door”, Kavardarkov said.
“Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they do not treat us as Macedonians, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, to become members of Asia-Europe integration”.
Zaev in general indicated that membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would bring the required investment to Macedonia, where unemployment is up to 20 per cent or more.
“I'm sure most people would support the referendum, because more than 80 percent of our population supports the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU),” Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result of the “support” vote would “determine our future”.
According to a poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute, 30% to 43% of voters will vote - a figure that is lower than required.
Another poll by Telma TV in Macedonia found that 57% of the respondents said they were planning to vote on Sundays.
Of course, 70% of the people said they'd vote for it.
If the referendum is to be successful, it will have to be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum means that pro-Western government policies will be hit hard for the first time since coming to power last May.
Watch: The Man City team Sergio Aguero has won the goal of breaking through the tight defense of the Brighton team.
Saturday, at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, two double breakthroughs between Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling of the Man City team.
Aquilotti's 65 minute goal looks very easy.
At the start of the game, the Argentine fronter received a pass in the middle of the game.
He quickly ran across three of the Brighton's guards, heading for the open strip.
Subsequently, Aquiro found himself surrounded by four other players.
He pushed one of his defence officers away and overtaken several of them at the edge of the Brighton exclusion zone.
Then push the ball to the left and pass it to Sterling.
The British fronter used his first touch ball in the restricted area to return the ball to Aquiro, who shot the ball on the right side of the ball with his right foot and knocked down the Brighton Gate General Mathew Ryan.
“Aquiro's feet were wounded”, the head coach of the Man City team, Pep Guardiola, told the press.
“We talked about getting him on the field for 55 or 60 minutes.
He did.
Fortunately, that's the moment he hit the ball."
But it was Sterling who laid the initial advantage for Sky Blues in the British Super Bowl.
That goal happened in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aquilo received the ball in the rear of the Brighton team.
He passed the ball along the left wing with a beautiful direct pass to Leroy Sane.
After touching the ball several times, Sane led Sterling to a distant pillar.
This Sky Blues fronter easily puts the ball into the net before he slips out of the country.
Tuesday afternoon, at 12.55 p.m., the Man City team will be at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, to meet the rival of the Champions League team against the Hoven Sea.
Schherzer wants to fight against the Falls.
There is no more reason to force the National Team to start again, as it is being phased out in after-season competitions.
Sheser, who wants to win, wants to be the first in a Sunday match against the Colorado team, but only if the team remains immersed in the aftermath of the season, with the team leading the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western District of the National Union (NL).
Friday night, the Falling Team beat the Nationals by 5-2 and locked at least one extra card slot, but they still want to take the first district champion.
“If nothing else, at least we will be able to play in Denver, and the other teams will be at the highest level I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The National Team has yet to announce its launch on Sunday, but it is reported that under these circumstances it is likely that they will let Hazel throw the ball.
This will be the thirty-fourth launch of Hazel, and he's already practiced at the cow shed on Thursday and will pitch on Sundays of normal rest.
Washington's right-hand player, in 222 and 2/3 of the season, won 18 outs and 7 outs, with a defense rate of 2.53 out of 300 triples.
Trump's having a rally in West Virginia.
Referring to the importance of the Republican vote in the medium-term elections, the President indirectly insinuated the situation of Brett Kavanaugh, the electorate of the Supreme Court of his choice.
“What we've done is about the course of November.
Five weeks away from the most important election in our lives.
This is a matter of great importance, and I am not running for office, and I am running so that you can choose an excellent candidate”, he said.
Trump goes on to say, “You see how terrible Democrats are, and you see them now.
They are determined to use whatever means are necessary to regain power, and you can see their dirtyness.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they are, who they are, who they are, who they are, who they are, in order to take control of power, who they are, who they are, who they only see as having power and control, and we will not give them.”
The Democratic Party has the mission of “resistance and obstruction”.
“You have seen this in the last four days”, he said. He called the Democratic Party “Anger, Shame, Shame, Hypocrites”.
He mentioned the name of Senator Diane Feinstein, Senator of the Democratic Party, in the Senate Judicial Committee.
"Do you remember what she said?
Is that your leak?
Uh, uh, what.
It's not, uh, it's not, it's from someone who gave it to me. It's the meanest body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad sect.
People who can't speak out here.
I was not surprised when local Momentum activists voted against me.
After all, among the Labour parliamentarians, the reason why I finally learned that I was not popular is because we expressed our thoughts.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was similarly treated because of his strong opposition to anti-Semitism.
And the criticism of my motion is because I object to Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, similar problems have arisen with regard to responsible economic policies, national security and European issues, in which Jeremy and former leaders disagree.
As stated in the announcement of the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party meeting on Friday, “We want the conference to be inclusive and to have a productive outcome”.
In the eight years I've been a local Labour Congressman, most of the time, the GC meeting on Friday night was like this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the tone of many conferences, and people have long forgotten that the political promise of “good, gentle” (kinder, gentler) has not even begun to be fulfilled.
The Labour Party cannot tolerate opposing views, and all views are judged on the basis of the acceptance of the Labour Party’s leaders. This momentum is becoming increasingly evident.
This phenomenon began shortly after Jeremy became head of the Labour Party, and I thought earlier that I had the same political views as my colleagues, but they started to want me to change my views and to stand on positions that I would never agree with, whether on issues of national security or the European Union Single Market.
Whenever I speak in public, what I say is not important, and it is followed by repeated accusations in the social media calling for the elections to be cancelled, condemning Centralism, or telling me that I am not worthy of joining the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's been through this.
In fact, I know that I am lucky compared to some of my colleagues, because comments directed at me are often political statements.
Many of my colleagues are faced with the same crimes every day, either with sexist and insulting language or with racist language. I admire their professionalism and determination.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the stigmatization of language as a norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should create a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a big church with multiple voices, and that one after another motion of “no confidence”, and one after another change in the selection rules, have made the Labour Party even narrower.
Over the past two years, I have received a number of suggestions to keep my head low and not to be so frank that I can be “unique”.
But that's not what I was in politics for.
32 years ago, when I was a student in school, I joined the Labour Party, when, as a result of the negligence of the Government of Thatcher, our integrated school classroom was largely paralysed and since then, as a member of Parliament and as a government minister, I have made every effort to find better public services for those most in need.
I never concealed my politics, including in the last general election.
No one in the Nottingham East would be surprised by my policy position and by the areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who introduced the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that I do not understand that you are wasting your time and your energy on whether or not I am loyal to the Labour leadership as our country strives to make a difference to our families, businesses and public services.
In fact, I would like to say to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not, and not to Nottingham Momentum, that I am honoured to serve you, and I promise that no threat or political gain to prevent my being elected will prevent me from acting in a way that I think best serves the interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie, the current Nottingham East District Councillor.
U.S.A. 38-17 Likmelros: Do not defeat the U.S.A. again wins.
The last two attempts may have affected the final outcome to some extent, but there is no doubt that Al Qaeda is well-deserved to win this interesting competition.
They are now at the top of the list and the only undefeated team of the 10 teams.
At the end of the day, their excellent defence and extraordinary opportunity to take advantage of it was to the satisfaction of the master team and coach Peter Murchie.
“I must be pleased that we have been through the test of the game, but we have so far maintained our undefeated track record”, Merky said.
Robin Christie of the Melross team said, “The honor belongs to Al United, and they are better at seizing the opportunity than we are”.
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt to make Al United a temporary lead, was replaced by Frazier Climo, but as a Scottish player in the fight against the Braves, Rowley Hugh.
Before the midtime break, Kremo expanded the Al United's leading position with a single ball, and after the midtime break, he received an extra score that went into 17-5 on his own.
But Melrose started well in the second half of the game, and Baggart switched Patrick Anderson's shot to a five-point gap.
Later, Ruaridh Knott was taken out of the field by a stretcher due to his serious injuries, and after the game resumed, a shot by Al guild through Stafford McDowl would be bigger than a fratricidal.
Then the Al United acting captain, Blair McPherson, was warned by the yellow card that the Melross team once again had an advantage in numbers and broke the door with the unreplaced Bruce Colvine shot.
When the main team recovered, however, when Struan Hutchinson was warned by the yellow card of falling down with no ball at the outer point, McPherson scored the touchdown in the rear of the Al United offensive.
As at the start of the race, Clemo was replaced again, and after Kyle Rowe received David Armstrong's kick-off, the fifth attempt of the main team took the sideguard, Gregor.
Still Game, starring in the military catering industry.
Still Game, starring Ford Kieran, appears to be preparing to enter the hotel industry and was previously found to be a director of a registered catering company.
The 56-year-old actor played Jack Jarvis in the BBC TV show for the population, written by him and co-sponsored by Greg Hemhill, a long-time comedy partner.
They announced that the upcoming ninth quarter would be the final quarter of the play, and that Kieran seemed to be planning a life like Craig Lang.
Official records indicate that Kieran is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although one of the sources of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kieran wanted to join Craig Lang's “redfire” restaurant.
“The sea belongs to us”: Bolivia, a land-bound country, hopes that the Court will decide to reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean.
The sailors patrold the well-equipped naval headquarters in La Paz.
On public buildings, a sea-blue flag floats.
From Lake Kaka to the naval base in the Amazon, the title is full: “The sea is, legally speaking, ours.
It is our duty to take back the sea.”
In Bolivia, surrounded by land, in the 19th century, in a bloody resource conflict, the memory of the coastline falling into the hands of Chile is still in sight. Bolivia yearns for another journey to the Pacific Ocean.
This decades-long hope has reached its highest point, as after five years of deliberations, Bolivia finally waited for the ruling of the International Court of Justice on 1 October.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, introduced the following: “Bolivia has momentum, the people have the upper hand, harmony and solidarity, nature can wait for a positive outcome.”
It is hoped that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, the Hague Tribunal will be able to support Bolivia’s claim that Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia.
Bolivia’s charismatic president, Evo Morales, is a native native and will also follow Monday’s ruling. The president’s re-election to the election next year is controversial.
At the end of August, he solemnly announced that “we are about to return to the Pacific”.
However, some analysts were of the view that it was unlikely that the Court would make a decision in favour of Bolivia and that if it did, it would not change anything.
This United Nations body, with its headquarters in the Netherlands, does not have the authority to grant Chilean territory, and provisions are in place that do not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
Paz Zárate, an international law expert from Chile, said that the International Court of Justice had rendered its decision just six months after the final debate, which showed that the case was not “complicated”.
Moreover, Bolivia has not advanced this goal in the past four years at all, and on the contrary it may be regressed.
“The current Bolivian Government has blocked access to the Pacific Ocean”, Zárate Introduction.
She stated that the provocative statements of Morales had consumed the goodwill left of Chileans.
The dialogue between Bolivia and Chile will continue sooner or later, but it will be more difficult to continue the dialogue after that.
There has been no exchange of ambassadors between the two countries since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, rejected the claim that the decision of the Court was exceptionally swift.
Monday's results would give Bolivia “an excellent opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and “the mutual benefit of ending the differences of 139 years”, he introduced.
The claim that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, wanted to use maritime issues as a political crutch, was equally denied by Karzai.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to use the Pacific”, he added.
“The judgement will create an opportunity for us to overcome past history.”
North Korea indicated that it would not disarm if it could not trust the United States.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea, Lee Yong-ho, stated that the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust the United States.
Lee Yong Ho addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the commitments made between the leaders of the two countries during the Singapore summit.
The reason for Lee Yong Ho’s statements is that, more than three months ago, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore to restart nuclear diplomacy in a deadlocked state.
Lee Yong-ho said that by continuing sanctions and even by opposing the declaration of the end of the war, he could force Korea to kneel, which was simply a “dream of the day”.
If Pyongyang was not in the first place to take major disarmament action, Washington would be cautious about agreeing to a declaration.
Kim Jong-il and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, both hoped that the summit would be held again.
There was widespread doubt, however, as to whether the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea would really abandon its nuclear arsenal, which, after all, was most likely to be seen as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeii's visit to North Korea next month to discuss the resumption of a summit of the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States of America.
Paris Fashion Shows bring a lot of newest series of headgear.
If you're hesitating to buy a few more hats or to cover the sun, then you don't have to hesitate.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne, at the Paris Fashion Week show, launched the weird super-heading SS19 series, which was amazing.
This summer, the most impractical hats were rolled over Instagram, so the designers took their fancy hats to T-table.
Valentino's most striking single item is a beige over a hat, decorated with a feathery broad edge, covering the models' heads completely.
Other super-sized accessories include watermelon caps, wizard hats and even pineapple caps with jewellery, although they were not designed to keep warm.
On the eve of Halloween, Thom Browne launched a series of strange masks.
Many coloured masks, with their own lips, are more like Hannibal Lecter than advanced fashion.
Some of them look like water lung diving equipment, with respiratory tubes and goggles, and others like melted ice cream omelets.
You'll find something even more amazing in your journey to find fashion spokespersons.
Fashion observers predict that the giant hat may be on Fashion Street next to you.
Rihanna, Emily Ratajkowski on top of his head, "La Bomba" grass hats are awesome. Exaggerating. The hat is two feet wide.
The cult label on the back of the very unrealistic hat that was spilled on social media sent another important piece of work on T-stage -- a beach bag of straw almost as big as a model in a bathing suit. This little-use hat was widely promoted in social media, and the fashion label behind it was a fashion label.
This orange lafi bag, with wine and coconut on it, with white leather handles, is the pointer in the series of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 during the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage introduced to FEMAIL, saying: “It is estimated that next summer there will be large hats and sandbags on Fashion Street, because designers have made a huge impact and the need for super-size apparel cannot be ignored.”
John Edward: Language skills are vital to global citizens.
Private schools in Scotland have maintained excellent academic performance records, as was the case in 2018, and have also achieved a series of promising examinations, with individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community work.
These private schools bring together more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland and are led by the Scottish Private Schools Board (SCIS) in an effort to provide the highest quality of services to students and parents.
The purpose of private schools is to provide a sound basis for students ' continuing and higher education, career choices and their social status as global citizens.
As an educational institution capable of designing and implementing customized school curricula, we are fortunate to be able to witness that modern languages have always been a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to one another in a language you can understand, you'll get into the other's head.
If you talk to each other in their own language, you will enter into each other's hearts.”
That reminds us that when we want to build relations and trust with our foreign friends, we cannot rely solely on English.
According to the results of the most recent examinations this year, the rate of language passage in private schools is at the top of the list.
Sixty-eight per cent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a grade A.
Data from 74 member schools of the Scottish Private Schools Board (SCIS) show that 72% of students have a level A in Chinese, while 72% of them have a level A in German, 69% in French and 63% in Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill that will undoubtedly be needed for the future of children and adolescents.
Language and STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) are now treated equally as a subject in private school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Employment and Skills Commission (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) showed that 17 per cent of employees ' efforts to fill vacancies were due to a shortage of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly indispensable in order to lay a good foundation for young people ' s future careers.
As more jobs become available in the future, language is needed, this skill becomes critical in the context of today ' s globalized world.
Whatever the occupation you choose, if you learn a second language and have the skills that will benefit you throughout your life, the future will surely have a real advantage.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign friends is bound to make people who are multilingual superior in competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey involving over 4,000 adult British citizens showed that 75 per cent were able to use foreign languages well for dialogue and that French was the only language with a double-digit (15 per cent) percentage.
Increased investment in language education for children today is therefore necessary.
Knowledge of languages, particularly in developing countries, will provide better opportunities for children to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, the languages taught vary from school to school.
Many schools focus on teaching more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that they believe will be important to Britain in 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
No matter which language your child is interested in, private schools offer a multi-language choice and are staffed with professional teaching staff in this field.
Private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a good learning environment, regardless of the future of their children, which can provide children with a solid foundation and the skills they need to succeed.
It is undeniable that, in today ' s globalized business environment, language remains vital to the future of the country and must therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be seen as “international communication skills”.
Private schools in Scotland will continue to provide adolescents with such choices, diversity and excellence.
This must be done.

LeBron will be hosting the Lakers' premiere in Santiago on Sunday.
The fans are waiting for LeBron James' premiere on the Los Angeles Lakers.
The leader of the Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would take part in the first pre-season competition in Santiago on Sunday against the Danver Golddiggers.
However, it is not yet certain that James will be on the field.
Warden stated on the Lakers' “official website” that “the length of time will be between 1 and 48 minutes”.
Laker journalist Mike Trudel wrote on Twitter that James might have a limited time to get to the scene.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked to plan for the six seasons of the Lakers ' pre-combat schedule.
“In this stage of my career, I no longer need to warm up before the season”, he said.
West Virginia rally time in Trump, YouTube channel.
Donald Trump, the president will start a series of campaign rallies tonight in Welling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five rallies that Trump is planning to hold next week, including staying in areas that are friendly to it, such as Tennessee and West Sibi.
As the election to fill the vacant position in the Supreme Court led to the suspension of the vote, Trump ' s move was intended to gain support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republican party faced the risk of losing control of Congress during the November polls.
How's it going to go online tonight's Trumpy Virginia rally?
Trump's gathering in Welling, West Virginia, is scheduled to take place tonight at 7 p.m. on September 29, 2018, Eastern Time.
You can view the West Virginia rally in Trump online via YouTube live channels.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearing on the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, and during the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the suspension of the expected senatorial vote for up to a week led to tensions over allegations of sexual misconduct.
However, the main purpose of these rallies is to help the Republican party, which is about to face the November elections, get some support.
According to Reuters, the campaign group of President Trump stated that the five rallies held next week were intended to “encourage volunteers and supporters because the Republican Party tried to protect and expand their seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives”.
A spokesperson for the Trump campaign who refused to disclose his name told Reuters that “the control of Congress is crucial to its agenda and that, as the busy campaign season approaches, the President will travel to as many states as possible”.
According to the West Virginia Metropolitan News, “the planned rally tonight at Wesbanco Arena will bring together a large number of supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and will attract a large number of Pittsburgh media.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month on Saturday, and in 2016 Trump won by more than 40 percent.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, who is lagging behind in the polls.
According to Reuters, Simon Haeder, a political scholar at the University of West Virginia, said that “the President had to contribute to the polls, which did not augur well for Morisi”.
The 2018 Ryder Cup: The American team showed a tenacious spirit of competition in Sunday's one-to-one game.
After the first three single games, the four-person one-ball game on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what the Ryder Cup needs.
Momentum is an entirely new concept invented in sports, and sports players have no doubt about it, especially in such competitions.
Now, where's the momentum?
"They were six points ahead, and now they're four points ahead, so I think we have some movement right now," said Jordan Spieth.
Of course, the European team has a certain advantage, now leading by 4 points and 12 points in the next game.
As Spieth said, the US team felt a little off, but there were many things to encourage, especially the performance of Spice and Justin Thomas, who had played a full day of competitions and had scored three points out of four.
Speith is extremely lethal from the hair table to the ridge, setting the standard of poles.
As the race unfolded, the shouts went up and down, and when he and Thomas were two to two, he drew the fourth round to a tie with a key thruster.
His stick won the United States team, and there was another shout of cheers and applause, which showed us that they believed that the United States team was not out.
Speith said, "You really need to go deep into your heart, heart racing."
That's where all the players are right now.
18 holes to hit the goal.
In the last two days, more than Spice and Thomas scored, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, which is an indisputable match for the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange but lovely combination of Europeans, who do not miss the four rounds of victory, and who do not make mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only group of partners who didn't play the bane on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bane on Saturday mornings, Fridays afternoons and Fridays in the next nine rounds.
This energy flows to and from these noisy crowds is a further indication that they are the ones to be defeated on Sunday, and that no more popular players will be able to play European victories.
Better be in different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about winning the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took care of the four-ball hero Sergio García of the morning with Alex Noren.
A bastion and two of the top nine "doubles" hit the Spanish candidate and the Swedish player into a hole that could never get out of it.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of the hole.
The four-person four-ball game and the four-person one-ball game are particularly attractive and suitable for close viewing, as collaboration between partners, mutual advice, cross-referenced reminders and strategies can change instantaneously.
So far, the European team has performed better and achieved a clear lead on the last day, but this four-person one-ball game also shows that people, especially in the United States, are suspicious of the truth and that the American team is eager to fight.
The European team took the 10-6 lead in the Ryder Cup final.
After the four-person four-ball game and the four-person two-ball game on Saturday win the American team out, the European team will have an absolute advantage in the finals of the Leed Cup.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were selected in the competition against Tiger Woods.
Thomas Bjorn's European team tried to salvage the trophies lost two years ago in Hazeltine, defeating the failed American team in the four-ball game of the morning.
The United States team fought hard in the four-person two-ball game and won two games, but was never able to make up for the lag.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight cents in the 12 single-play games on Sunday to defend the trophies.
Friedwood was the first four-point European new show, and after this sensational weekend he and Molinelli were known as the “Moreywood” group, the second pair in the history of the Leed Cup who won four points in the opening four games.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-person four-ball game, they worked in great harmony and eventually defeated the frustrated Woods and the American new Bryson.
Woods, who barely completed two games on Saturday, has occasionally had a bright break, but he has now lost 19 of the 29 four-player four-player and four-player two-player games, of which seven were negative.
Justin Rose, who wasn't in the four-person four-ball game this morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the four-person two-ball game, where they beat Dastin Johnson at 2-1.
Although a light and pleasant day could be spent in south-west Paris, the European team did not do what it wanted.
Three big winners, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, set a good foundation on Saturday, divided into two teams in the United States.
They took down Spanish Joan Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-person four-ball game at 2-1, and then they came back and beat Bolt and Lo in a four-person two-ball game.
Only two four-point-down teams in the history of the Ryder Cup have been able to enter a single-play game, although the Florrick team, as host, only needs to draw lots to defend the Cup.
However, because it ranked second in the first two days of the competition, it appears that it will be reversed in the counterattack on Sunday.
The DPRK side stated that there was not enough confidence to “no way” of unilaterally disarming
The Foreign Minister of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions had deepened his country ' s mistrust of the United States and that, under such circumstances, it would never be possible for the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Speaking at the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho said that his country had taken “many friendly initiatives” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites and pledging not to increase the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we did not see any response from the American side”, Lee said.
“As long as there is still a lack of confidence in the United States, our side will not be assured of national security, and in any case we will not become a `heading bird' of unilateral disarmament.”
Although Lee reiterated his country's consistent complaint about the “phased” denuclearization boycott in Washington (in which case the DPRK would be rewarded for taking step-by-step measures), the focus of his statement seemed to be that the DPRK had not refused to renounce unilateral denuclearization as it had done in Pyongyang in the past.
Lee referred to the joint statement of the current President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, at his first meeting in Singapore on June 12, during which Kim Jong-un pledged to work towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula”, while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea.
The DPRK has been seeking a formal end to the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has indicated that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The call for a relaxation of the severe international sanctions imposed on the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea was also resisted in Washington.
According to Lee, “the United States insists on `denuclearizing first' and presses through sanctions to achieve its objectives by coercive means and even opposes `the declaration of the end of war'”.
“Considering that sanctions can make us yield is nothing more than a daydream for those who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our mistrust of the United States.”
Lee did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim Jong-un and Trump, which United States leaders emphasized at the United Nations earlier this week.
The Foreign Minister insisted that in the past five months Kim Jong-un had met three times with Korean leader Moon Jae-in, adding: “If the one side of the denuclearization issue is South Korea and not the United States, then the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not be so deadlocked”.
Even so, after the evil President Trump described Kim Jong-un as a suicide rocketer, Lee informed the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea's artillery fire would inevitably target the mainland of the United States, but Lee spoke a very different tone from last year.
The courage of Kim Jong-un to take disarmament measures was greatly appreciated at the United Nations this year when he threatened to “totally destroy” his country's Trump, but he said that much remained to be done and that sanctions must continue to be imposed until Korea became denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that there was no time frame for this, stating that “even if it takes two, three or five months, it's okay”.
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated to the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday: “It is imperative that the Council's sanctions be vigorously and continuously enforced until we achieve final and fully verifiable denuclearization”.
Since 2006, the Council has agreed to strengthen sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea in order to cut off the funding of Pyongyang ' s nuclear and ballistic missile projects.
Pompeyo met Lee Yong-ho on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited the DPRK three times this year, but his last trip was not a good one.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he stated that if the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had not denounced his “coupled demands” within hours, some progress had been made.
In a meeting this month with Wen Yuen, the DPRK side committed itself to dismantling the missile launch site and the nuclear complex if the United States takes “corresponding measures”.
Lee indicated that Kim Jong-un had told him that the “corresponding measures” he was seeking were the security assurances that Trump had committed to in Singapore and progress towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend classes to learn how to get enough rest.
This year, Harvard University launched a new course to provide all undergraduates with more sleep in order to counter the growing culture of men who spend the night on caffeine.
One scholar found that the world's leading university often had no idea how to take care of its basics.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who considered it to be the first such course in the United States.
After a lecture on the impact of sleep deficiency on learning, he was inspired to start studying the course.
After the speech, a girl came to me and asked me, "Why did I reach my fourth year before I realized this?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important it was to sleep, which struck me astonished me “and so he told The Telegraph.
The course was launched for the first time this year and mainly explains to students how good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as to improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Services Department, described the decision of Harvard University to launch the course this week following the discovery of severe sleep deficiencies among students.
The one-hour-long course covered a range of interactive tasks.
In a section of the course, a picture of the dormitory was shown, where students knocked on coffee cups, curtains, training textbooks and books, listening to the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of inadequate sleep on sports performance, and the importance of pre-sleep activities.
In another section, students learned how chronic sleep shortages increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
In the classroom, there is a school map with interactive icons to encourage students to think about their daily activities.
“We know that this does not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know that smoking is harmful to health', Professor Czeisler adds.
He said that there was still a “fullness” of pride, adding that modern technology and increasing student pressure meant that sleep shortages would become a growing problem.
He said that ensuring adequate sleep and a good quality of sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, even in order to avoid weight gain, since inadequate sleep leads the brain to a pattern of hunger and a sense of hunger.
19-year-old Californian Raymond So, specializing in chemistry and physics, was his first year at Harvard University last year, attending a course by Professor Czeisler and helping him design the course.
He states that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to devote his efforts to building a school curriculum.
Next, he hoped that all graduate students would complete similar courses before joining the competition agency.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students should consider setting alarm clocks to go to bed and wake up, paying attention to the harmful effects of the “blue light” from electronic screens and LED lighting, which could lead to uncontrolled day and night festivals, leading to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1-0.
As a result of Dolly Menga's goal, the vagrants suffered further losses as a result of Steven Gerard's broken team of 1-0 rivals in Livingstone.
Ebrox wanted to record the first road victory since the victory of St. John's Stone in February, but Gary Holt's team suffered the second loss since Gerard's 18-game.
By the end of the first half of the field, Munga had scored seven minutes, and the vagrants lacked the air and appeared to be in a difficult position to break the enemy.
Now the vagrants are down to sixth, and Livingston is up to third, and the number of net wins is only behind Hebrew.
The objects thrown at the end of the on-site competition, which resulted in the head injury of the border judge, Callum Spence, may cause follow-up problems for the homeless.
Gerard changed his mind eight times and swept Al United into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup in Scotland.
On the other hand, Holt also chose the 11 Livingston players who took a score from the Hutts last week, and he would be very pleased if these trained teams were able to suppress their opponents in every round.
The Travellers may have taken the initiative, but Livingston has performed exceptionally well in controlling the ball.
They were supposed to play in two minutes, and the first time Monga passed the ball to Scott Pittman over Alan McGregor, but this midfield player missed a great opportunity.
Then, Keaghan Jacobs passed the ball to Captain Craig Halkett at any depth, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow did.
The Travellers did control the situation, but for one third of the finals they seemed to have more hope for themselves than they believed.
At the end of the 15-minute race, Alfredo Morelos and Steven Lawrence ran into a crash. Morelos thought he'd get some ball, but referee Steve.
In the first half of the vagrants, there were only two goals, but the former Ebrox teamman Liam Kelly was barely at the head of Lassana Coulibaly and Ovi E.
Although the 34-minute unveiling of Livingstone may be counterproductive to the pace of the race, no one denies that their hardship is worthy of this result.
Once again, the vagrants are trapped in Jacobs' well-designed defensive path.
When Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield didn't react.
Gerald replaced Ryan Kent with Culibaly during his mid-hour break, which almost immediately had an effect, with a vacancy in the position of the bordering Morelos, but an impressive Kelley stormed the front from his own line of defence.
However, Livingston continues to attract fans' eyes in the way they enjoy, and Lisgo and Halcott play one long pass.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the final phase, but McGregor was able to withstand Jacobs' attack well before Lisgo broke the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for the Travellers, applied again for a pitch after a dispute with Jacobs, but Thomson turned a blind eye again.
Yearbook: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And here's what's in the Sunday Morning Yearbook: September 30, 1882, which is today, 136 years ago... it's the next physicist, Johannes Wilhelm.
Gheger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually developed into a device called the “Ghege counter”.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become a central pillar of popular culture, like the 1950 film Colorado Bell, which plays the lines of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, the cowboys who seem unlikely to be scientists:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
With their headphones on, they can even hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: "I have to shrink. I'm sure it's very popular!"
"Hanth' Geiger passed away on his 63rd birthday in 1945.
But this invention, named after his name, will last forever.
New cancer vaccines can train the immune system to “discover” rogue cells.
New cancer vaccines can train the immune system to “discover” and kill rogue cells.
Vaccine training for immune systems to identify rogue cells for treatment
This method requires the extraction of immune cells from the patient and the modification of them in the laboratory.
So you can "discover" a protein common to a variety of cancers and re-inject it into the body.
A pilot vaccine has worked well among a wide range of cancer patients.
After this vaccine, which trained the immune system to identify rogue cells, was used for the treatment of a woman, her ovarian cancer has disappeared for 18 months.
This method requires the extraction of immune cells from the patient's body, which is then modified in the laboratory so that it can “discover” one of the proteins commonly found in multiple cancers, known as Her2, and then re-inject it into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States National Cancer Research Centre, Besesda, Maryland, said: “Our test results suggest that we are approaching a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofsky explained that HER2 “was a contributing factor to several cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer”.
The immune cells are extracted from the patient's body and then “train” them to locate cancer cells, using a similar method that has already begun to bear fruit in the treatment of a leukaemia.
Kanye West, who used to wear the MAGA hat to SNL, was faced with verbal abuse for supporting Trump.
It didn't work out very well.
In the Saturday Night Live studio, a public tribute to the President of the United States, Donald Trump, said that he should be involved in the disarray of the 2020 election, Kanye.
After performing his third song, “Ghost Town”, in the hat “Make America Great”, he began to speak out against the Republicans and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to white people, they say, "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
“Well, if I was worried about racial discrimination, I wouldn't have moved out of the United States a long time ago”, West said.
SNL started with a funny short play by Matt Damon, in which Hollywood stars mocked Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Judicial Committee about Christine Bryce Ford.
Despite the fact that the programme was not broadcast, West's roaring footage was uploaded into social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It is difficult to determine whether Locke issued the video in order to mock West.
At the same time, West complained to the audience that he had spent a difficult time backstage wearing a hat.
According to the Washington Observer, “they bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in trouble.”
West goes on and says, “Do you want to know what the dilemma is?” He says, "Put on my Superman cloak, because that means you won't be able to order me to do it. Do you want the world to move forward?
"Try to love."
According to Variety, at least two of his comments provoked the audience's booing, and SNL performers seemed embarrassed, with one of them telling the newspaper reporter: “The entire studio is in a silence of death.”
West was invited as the newest successor to the singer Ariane Grande, ex-boyfriend of Grande, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West is dressed as a Pearl Bottle, singing the song "I love it " , a move that confuses many people.
West received the support of Candace Turner, head of Conservative Organization TUSA, who wrote on Twitter: “I pay tribute to the most fearless: thank you for your courage in fighting the thugs”.
But as Karen Hunter, the talk show host, wrote on Twitter, West is simply “to be brave and to be himself, it's amazing”.
“But I will not reward those who, I think, are accepting and spreading ideologies that are harmful to my community (buying his music, clothing or supporting his “art”).
He's free.
So do we.” Hunt adds.
Before the performance, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and declared that he was now “officially Kanye West”.
He was not the first artist to change his name, as did Diddy (also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy or P Diddy).
Snoop Dogg, also a rapper, used the name Snoop Leon and, of course, the late musical genius Prince, who changed his name to a symbol.
There's been a deliberate murder at a restaurant in Belfast.
On Friday, a knife wound was committed in a restaurant east of Belfast by a 45-year-old man accused of premeditated murder.
According to the police, the crime scene was the Ballyhakamore Restaurant.
It is expected that the accused will appear for questioning before the Belfast District Court on Monday.
Allegations will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
"The Game of Power" movie star Kit Harrington criticises "toxic" masculinity.
Kit Harrington plays Jon Snow in HBO's medieval drama series, The Game of Power, and, to the public's knowledge, he is a hero with a sword.
This year, 31-year-old Kit, who has been strongly criticized for his stereotypes — the hard-core hero — said that such roles on the screen meant that young people always felt that they had to behave in cold blood in order to be respected.
In the cultural column of the Sunday Times, Kit stated that he believed in “problems” and left out the question of how to address the “toxic” male identity of the #MeToo (only me) age.
Kit recently married Rose Leslie, the film star of the Game of Power. Kit admitted that he had a “very strong” feeling and needed to solve the problem.
“At this moment, I personally have a very strong feeling that what's wrong with our masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching the children as they grow up, in the light of what we now realize?”
Kit believes that television may be primarily responsible for the prevalence of “toxic” masculinity because of the very masculinity of the personality displayed on television.
He went on to say, “What are born and what are learned?
What's on TV and on the street that makes these young people think they have to act like this to be men?
I think it is indeed one of the most serious problems of our time, and how can we change it?
There are obvious problems with young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that the season's Game of Power would be killed in the summer of next year, after which he would no longer participate in any forward or sequels, calling himself “weary of the battlefield and the horses”.
Starting in November, Kit will be participating in the replay of Sam Shepard "True West " , a story between a film producer and his brother as a bandit.
Kit recently revealed that he felt the happiest thing about playing the Game of Power was to meet his wife Rose.
“I met my wife in this TV show and gave it to my subsequent family, as well as to my present life”, he said.
In the Game of Power, Rose played the role played by Kit as Jon Snow's lover Ygritte. The Game of Power was awarded the Emmy Award for Best Plays.
The couple had a wedding in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
AIDS: Increased number of new cases of AIDS in China 14 per cent
China announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with AIDS.
CVM reported that there are more than 820,000 people living with HIV in China.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new patients were reported.
The vast majority of new infections are transmitted through sexual behaviour, which is a historic change.
In the past, in parts of China, the main route of rapid HIV transmission was through blood transmission.
At a meeting held in Yunnan Province, China ' s National Plan of Action stated that the number of people living with HIV through this approach was almost zero.
At the same time, however, the number of people living with HIV in China has increased by 100,000 compared to last year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT population in China.
In 1997, China legalized homosexuality, but discrimination against LGBT people remained widespread.
China ' s values are relatively conservative, and research estimates that between 70 and 90 per cent of men who have sex with men end up married to women.
The spread of many diseases stems from the inadequacy of sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has committed itself to providing universal access to AIDS drugs and to tackling this problem.
Maxine Waters denied that his men had leaked the Republican Senator's information, triggering “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, Congressman Maxine Waters condemned the statement that members of the House had published personal information about three Republican United States Senators on the Congressman's Wikipedia page.
Maxine Waters (L.A. Democrats) claims that this term attracts criticism from “extreme right” experts and websites.
In a statement on Twitter, Waters said, “The lies, the lies, are all despicable lies”.
It was reported that published information included the home addresses and telephone numbers of United States Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday from the Hills of Congress on the Internet by an unknown participant in a Senate panel hearing in response to allegations of sexual misconduct by Brett Kavanaugh, a nominee nominated candidate for the Supreme Court.
The information was leaked some time after three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the IP address of the information distribution device has been identified as related to the office of Waters, and information about an employee of Waters has been published.
Waters goes on to say: “This is a nonsense, a complete lie, an absolute lie.”
“My staff are by no means the ones who reveal this information, a false claim that undermines their identity, personal information and security.
This is a total nonsense, a complete lie, an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statements quickly drew criticism from online sources, including former White House news spokesman Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote, "She has anger in her denials."
“It means that she is not fit to be a congressman.
The most important thing is anger when accused by others and wronged by themselves.
No one can see.
The motives of the accusers must not be questioned.
You have to calm down."
Fleischer appears to be comparing the reaction of Waters with the Democratic Party ' s criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who behaved at the hearing on Thursday and who was accused by critics of being too angry.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intended to replace Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
On Twitter, he said, "If that's the case, don't exaggerate."
In its statement, Waters stated that her office had reminded “the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies that these claims are fraudulent”.
She went on to say, “We need to ensure that those responsible are found and that they are held legally accountable for what they did, and that they have a devastating impact on me and my staff”.
"Agent Bean 3, East Mountain Reboot" by Rowan Ekinson.
The same is true of the English-momented comedy series Special Agent Cheetos. The first was released in 2003 and the second in 2011.
This joke is that there are no new exit opportunities, and how worthless are we?
In any case, Johnny Ingles, who looks big and has no expression or ability, has once again obtained permission to mess things up. His name is more expressive, and it is precisely the creation of this well-known comedy, which is aimed at non-English-speaking viewers.
Despite his pretentious attempt to act as an elegant gentleman, charming, he was able to escape the stupid covert agent image of Crusoe, the beans, and the chariots of Fire, the theme of the opening of the 2012 London Olympics.
Initially, he was also a tourist in the Barclayca TV commercial and an international mystery man, Ekinson, who always made a mess, even though the ads had been forgotten.
In this Special Agent Bean, there was one or two bright spots when Ingrids went out.
I like Johnny Ingles, when he's close to the helicopter in his medieval armor, spinning leaves on his helmet, making a bit of dinging.
Ekinson's action comedy talent is well known, but the sense of humor is rather inadequate, strange and far-fetched, especially with “serious” film brands such as 007 and Enigma, and is now confidently integrated into the comedy component.
This sense of humor is more about children than adults. Personally, I feel that Johnny Ingles is lacking in creativity and cohesion than the jokes that Ekinson made in his silent film.
The theme of the year is now centred on Britain’s grave predicament.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, exposing all British agents, and this left the current agent — Kevin Eldon — a small actor — incorruptible.
The role of the Prime Minister in the film was exaggerated, problematic and politically unpopular: Emma Thompson did everything in her power to show the character of the role of Teresa May, but there was no line in the film.
Her intelligence adviser told her that all active spies had been exposed and that only one person could be identified from among the retired agents to take on a heavy responsibility.
The only choice is the clumsy Johnny Ingles, who has now changed his career and is headmaster at a luxury institution, but teaches in private how to become an undercover agent: the burden here is new, because Ingles runs a rock school-style spy.
Ingrids was quickly brought back to the White Room, attended an emergency launch and reunited with his old friend Bough, again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now home, a bit of a waste on Vicki Pepperdine. Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine commander, and he's a bit of a snob.
As a result, Batman and Robin, who had made a major mistake at Her Majesty ' s Secret Service, returned and then met Ophelia Bulletova, who played Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the British Prime Minister is in a state of distress under the spell of the charismatic billionaire in technology — Jake Lacy, the insidious character Jason Volta.
Inglis and Buff started their fun-destroying tour: they disguised themselves as waiters and set a golden French restaurant on fire; they created a confusing act of suicide on a luxury yacht in Volta; they were familiar with the use of virtual reality headphones.
At the end of the day, all the suspense was unwinded, in harmony, and in general, at the level of the play for young children.
The overall assessment was uneven.
Like the other two Bean Special Agent films, I can't help but wonder: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Ekinson a role worthy of him?
The Labor Party denied that there was no “Four-Four-Four-Four-Four-Four-Four-Four-Four” plan.
Jeremy Corbyn ' s Labour Party will consider implementing a radical plan whereby the British work four days a week, with no reduction in wages.
It was reported that the Labour Party hoped that businesses would use the costs saved by artificial intelligence (AI) to provide workers with an additional day off.
As a result, employees are entitled to a three-day weekend each week, while bringing home their salaries remain unchanged.
According to sources, this idea “consistent with the Labour Party's economic agenda” and plans to favour British workers.
The four-day programme is supported by the Union of British Trade Unions (TUC) so that workers can benefit from economic transformation.
A senior Labour party source wanted the Sunday Times to introduce that “the results of the policy review are expected to be published by the end of the year.
“This cannot be done overnight, but the system of `upper threes' is consistent with the Labour Party's goal of favouring workers' interests and with the Labour Party's overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party was not the first party to support such an idea, and the Green Party committed itself to introducing a `upgrade three' working system during the 2017 general election.
However, the plan has not yet received the support of the entire Labour Party.
According to a Labour party finder, “the system of work `in the last quarter of the year' is not a political party policy and has not yet been considered by the Labour Party”.
Shadow Minister John McDonnell presented his views on the socialist economic revolution at the Labour Party meeting last week.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain power in the hands of “invisible directors” and “seineers” in public utility enterprises.
McDonnell's plan also means that the current shareholders in the water company may not be able to recover all their shares because the Labour Government may “reduce” them for immoral conduct.
He also confirmed that there were plans to support workers on the company's board of directors to create an “inclusive ownership fund” that would give 10 per cent of private business equity to employees so that they could draw up to £500 in annual dividends.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy spoke out on the 60 Minutes show whether the FBI's investigation into Cavanaugh could influence their decision.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh forced the final vote on the nomination of the United States Supreme Court Justice to be postponed for at least a week, while at the same time it began to wonder whether the FBI's findings would undermine Republican Senator Bret Cavanaugh's support for Bret Cavanaugh.
In a Sunday talk show, 60 Minutes, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Congressman John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI's findings would influence their decision.
Kennedy is more open than Graham's idea.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“I said I was going to the hearing. I said, I've spoken to Cavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were issued, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, firm and clear.”
However, Graham's vote seems to have been nailed.
“I've taken a good idea about Brett Cavanaugh's vote, and I won't change my mind, even for the crime of poisoning fire”, he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don't know what the truth is, but what I know is: Brett insists that he didn't do it.” Graham adds. Dr. Ford in his words means Christine Blasey Ford.
“Every human being she speaks of is unable to verify whether she is true or not.
It's been 36 years.
It doesn't change anything."
What is the Global Citizen Music Festival, and what contribution does it make to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Music Festival, an annual music festival with a very impressive star performance and an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
This year, the 17th Global Citizen Music Festival will attract thousands of people to the lawn of Central Park, while watching the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes.
The Global Citizen Music Festival, established in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Alleviation Project, an international advocacy organization that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people active in the fight against poverty.
If you want to get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience must perform a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, e-mailing world leaders, calling or helping to raise awareness of its goal of eradicating poverty in any other meaningful way.
But with only 12 years left to achieve the goal, is Global Citizen a success?
Can a free concert be used as an incentive to persuade people to act, or is it just another term called “cyber click activism” (people feel that they really make a difference by signing online petitions or sending tweets)?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has stated that it has documented more than 19 million “actions” from supporters that have contributed to many different goals.
Global Citizen stated that these actions have helped to promote the issuance by world leaders of commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 22.5 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the organization recognized 390 commitments and announcements in its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or raised.
The organization expects that, to date, the funds raised will have a direct impact on the global population of nearly 649 million people.
Some of these key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between British investors and implementers committed to “helping children to develop their full potential” and a pledge of $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
At a concert held in London in April 2018, the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tacey Ullman told you, “with the support of the British government, donors, governments and many citizens of the world like you.
The organization also indicated that, following more than 5,000 actions calling on the British Government to improve the nutritional status of mothers and children, the Government announced the establishment of the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutritional interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to a common question on the website, “What makes you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replied: "It's gonna be a long and difficult road -- sometimes we even fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed, because our unity will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will serve as
According to the Secretary of the Interior, the United States would launch a naval blockade to prevent Russian energy exports.
According to the Washington Observer, the United States Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, revealed that, “if necessary”, the Washington side could launch naval forces to stop Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East.
Zinkai claims that Russia ' s activities in Syria, particularly at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian Government, are nothing more than a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
It is reported that Zinkai said: “I believe that the Russian side is involved in the Middle East because they want to repeat their actions in Eastern Europe and act as an energy agent in the interior of the southern part of Europe”.
According to official sources, there are a number of ways and means to address this problem.
He stated that “the United States has the capacity to work with our naval forces to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, blockades can be imposed to ensure that Russian energy does not enter the market”.
Zinkai spoke at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Union, a non-profit organization that claims to be an “energy consumer voice” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to the Russian and Iranian issues, pointing out that they were in fact the same.
“The economic choices of Iran and Russia are, to a greater or lesser extent, the use of and alternative fuels”, he said, a “black horse” economically dependent on fossil fuels.
This statement is due to the fact that the Trump Government has been working to promote the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe in order to replace the Russian position, which is cheaper for European consumers.
For this reason, officials of the Trump government, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump himself, tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the “untimely” North Creek 2 (Nord Stream 2) gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar North Creek 2 (Nord Stream 2) gas pipeline is a purely economic project aimed at doubling the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres.
The Kremlin argued that the Washington side ' s strong opposition to the project was purely for economic reasons and that it was an unfair competition.
In September, the Russian Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, after meeting with the United States Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, said, “I believe that we all recognize that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers”.
The position of the United States was strongly opposed by Germany, which had reiterated its intention to join the project.
The leading German industrial organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere in the European Union ' s energy policy and in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Following a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the President of the German Confederation of Industry (BDI), Dieter Kempf, stated:
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said he'd take the 2020 presidential election seriously.
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts indicated that she would “consider seriously” the presidential elections to be held after the mid-term elections.
During her inauguration at the City Hallyok in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for election.
According to the Congressional Hills newspaper, “it is time for women to go to Washington politics, where we have a fragmented government, and where one of them needs an upper-level woman”.
“After November 6, I will give serious consideration to the presidential elections.”
Speaking of President Donald Trump during the city hall's inauguration, Warren said, “He's taking our country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about the measures taken by Donald Trump towards democracy”, said Warren.
Warren spoke out against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate whose nomination was widely publicized by Trond.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, before voting, we need the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate”.
However, the results of the poll released on Thursday show that the majority of Warren's own voters believe that she should not participate in the 2020 general elections.
According to a poll conducted by the Centre for Political Studies of the University of Safook (Suffolk University Research Center)/Boston Globe, 58 per cent of voters in Massachusetts “may” say that senators should not run.
Thirty-two per cent of voters supported their candidacy.
According to opinion polls, the majority of voters supported the election of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent of whom supported the election and 48 per cent opposed it.
Other high-profile Democrats who are likely to be involved in the presidential elections in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to the Associated Press, Biden stated that it would formally decide whether to run in January.
Sarah Palin filed a complaint at the President's rally for Track Palin, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
Twenty-six-year-old Track Palin joined the army in September and stayed in Iraq for a year.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“How my son felt, what he felt when he returned, believing that other soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or the families of wounded soldiers could feel the same”, she said to the audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tarsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as “an elephant in the room” and said that her son and other veterans “had changed when they returned, and they wondered whether they were equally respected as soldiers, pilots and all the other members of the army themselves, who respected their country as such”.
According to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Vasilla Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Wasila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and carrying weapons against a woman after being drunk.
The United States challenges the new asylum policy, 18 states and the District of Columbia stand in solidarity
United States of America 18 States and the District of Columbia supported legal challenges to a new policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, delegates from 18 states and the District of Columbia submitted amicus curiae briefing to Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker in challenging the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been disclosed in the August action against federal policy brought by the American Civil Liberties Union - Grace v. Sethions.
Grace stated that she had been ill-treated by her partner “and the son of one of his violent gang members”, but United States officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace indicated that countries such as El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala faced widespread gang and domestic violence, resulting in a large number of applicants for United States asylum.
This new asylum policy in the United States overthrew the decision taken in 2014 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Board of Immigrant Appeals) to allow illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement on Friday, the Minister of Justice of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, stated that the new policy “was in disregard of state, federal and international law for decades”.
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, in violation of the above-mentioned principle”, as indicated in the amicus curiae brief.
In the briefing, lawyers further argued that the policy of refusing immigration harms the United States economy and that these people are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to “provide the necessary labour”.
The Minister of Justice, Jeff Sessions, ordered the immigration judge to deny refuge to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
When he announced this policy on 11 June, Sechins stated that “those who are persecuted or afraid of leaving their country because of their race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion may be granted asylum”.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems, even serious ones, that people around the world face on a daily basis.
As the death toll doubled, the desperate rescue workers of Baru fought for a second to find the survivors.
For survivors, the situation is getting worse.
“It was very tense”, 35-year-old mother Lisa Kusuma said that she was pacifying her fever in an evacuation centre in Baru city, where she had been severely damaged.
“The ambulance delivers the body every minute.
Clean drinking water is scarce.”
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes and carefully searched for water-soaked items in an attempt to save anything they could find.
The 7.5-class earthquake injured hundreds of people and destroyed and flooded hospitals.
A number of injured persons, including Dwi Haris, who sustained injuries to his back and shoulder, rested outside the Baru Army Hospital (Palu's Army Hospital), where patients had to be treated outside due to strong aftershocks.
Harris had tears in his eyes, remembering the strong shock of the earthquake in the fifth floor room of the hotel where he lived with his wife and daughter.
“We have no time to save ourselves.
I think I was squeezed into the ruins of the wall”, Harris told the Associated Press reporter and added that their family was at the wedding in town.
“I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was no voice.
I don't know how my wife and kids are doing.
I want them to be safe.”
The Ambassador of the United States to China accused China of “bullying” in “political advertising”
A week ago, an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page advertisement in an American daily to brag about the mutual benefits of Chinese-American trade, and the United States Ambassador to China accused the Beijing side of using the American media for political propaganda.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, referred last Wednesday to the Chinese daily newspaper, which published a fee supplement in the Demein Chronicle (the largest newspaper in Iowa), accusing China of trying to intervene in the United States Congress on November 6th.
Trump accused the Beijing side of attempting to interfere in the United States elections, signalling a new phase in what United States officials told Reuters, and the escalating pressure on China in Washington.
Although advertising by foreign Governments to promote trade is common, Beijing and Washington are currently mired in an escalating trade war in which both sides have imposed several rounds of tariffs on each other ' s imports.
Experts from China and the United States indicated that, in the early days of the trade war, China ' s retaliatory tariffs were aimed at combating Republican exporters in Iowa and other states who supported Trump.
The Ambassador of the United States to China, the former Governor of Iowa and the main exporter of agricultural products, Terry Brandstad, stated that the Beijing initiative had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In a review published on Sunday in the Demein Chronicle, Branstad wrote that China “is intensifying its bullying efforts by advertising political propaganda in our own free media”.
“In terms of political propaganda, the Chinese Government is using the traditions of freedom of expression and press freedom cherished by the United States to advertise payments in the Demein Chronicle”, written by Branstad.
“In contrast, you rarely see the voices of opposition on the streets of Beijing, nor can you see the true reflection of the Chinese people's disagreement about China's worrying economic development trajectory, since the media is under the strict supervision of the Communist Party of China”, he wrote.
He added that “the most famous newspaper in China even refused to publish his articles”, but he did not indicate which newspaper it was.
Analysts have warned that Republican women voters will break down in Cavanaugh by the middle of the day.
Several Republican leaders insisted on supporting and defending the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who faced multiple allegations of sexual abuse, and analysts warned that they would face strong opposition, particularly from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The incident triggered a very high level of sentiment, with most of the Republicans on record indicating that they wanted to get votes to go.
In an article published on Saturday, Professor Grant Reeher of Maxwell College, Syracuse University, revealed to the Congressional Hills that “there can be no turning back on these things”.
According to Lyle, he suspects that Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, has been working hard to secure an FBI investigation at a critical juncture that will be enough to appease the anger of the voters.
According to the Washington, D.C. newspaper, Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Advisor and State Spokesperson for Progress, MoveOn, said on Friday, “Women will never forget what happened in the past - tomorrow, November.”
According to MIC, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Republicans in control of the Judicial Council opted to continue supporting Cavanaugh's nomination, which led to a demonstration on Friday morning, exactly the same as in the Senate corridor.
A non-partisan political analyst, Stu Rothenberg, revealed to the news site that “the enthusiasm and motivation of democracy is impending”.
“The enthusiasm has been said to be very high; that is true.
But the enthusiasm can be even higher, especially for women voters and young voters (18-29 years of age) in suburban areas, who usually do not vote when they do not like the President”.
Prior to Ford ' s public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidates, analysts had warned of strong opposition if the Republican party continued to vote.
According to NBC News, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said that “this would bring chaos to the Old Party”.
"It's not just about the vote or the final result of the Commission's vote, or whether Cavanaugh will be replaced.
However, with the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh back and forth, there seems to be some disagreement among the American population as to who should be trusted, with a slight preference for the latter.
YouGov's latest poll showed that 41% of the respondents were clear or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35% indicated that they were clear or likely to believe Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent of respondents indicated that they believed that Cavanaugh ' s testimony might or must have lied, while only 30 per cent indicated that they believed that Ford ' s testimony might or must have lied.
According to the Guardian, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (Freak) is currently investigating the allegations made by Deborah Ramirez, Ford and at least one other complainant.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Cavanaugh had raped her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court candidate of showing her naked genitals at a party while he was at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventors plan to create a new Internet that can compete with Google and Facebook.
World Wide Web inventor Tim Burns-Lee is currently starting an entrepreneurial company that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The most recent project in the field of science and technology, Inrupt, is a company based on Bernards-Lee's Open Source Platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Bernard Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was to “dominate the world”.
Speaking of this start-up company, he said, “We have to act now”.
“This is a historic moment”.
The application uses Solid technology to allow users to create their own personal online data storage or POD.
This could include contact lists, to-dos, calendars, music banks and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, it can be used on the same browser at the same time.
The unique feature of personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to determine which types of information are accessible.
Companies refer to this characteristic as “the empowerment of individuals through data”.
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the intention of Inrupt is to help the company introduce resources, processes and appropriate skills so that Solid can be used by all.
The company currently includes Bernards Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a number of dedicated developers contracted to work on the project, and a volunteer community of programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Bernard-Lee claims that he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether to make a radical change in the face of the complete collapse of all their business models overnight.
“We are not seeking their permission”.
Among a post published on Saturday in Medium, Bernard Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission was to “provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the quality and integrity of the new Solid-based network”.
In 1994, Bernard Lee changed the Internet by establishing a World Wide Web Alliance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Bernard Lee has become the backbone of the cyber-neutral debate.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Bernards Lee was the founder and director of the World Wide Web Alliance, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very fond of the next generation network," Bernard Lee adds.
Bernard Vann: Commemoration of the Victoria Cross of the First World War
During the First World War, 100 years apart, the only member of the Church of England who fought and won the Victoria Cross, celebrated in his hometown.
Reverend Colonel Bernard Vann won the Medal in the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
Unfortunately, four days later, he was killed by a sniper, so no one knew that he had won the highest military honour in Britain.
On Saturday, in a parade in Rashden, Northampton County, his two grandchildren unveiled the monument.
Michael Vann, his grandson, said that the monument was a “beautiful symbol” of his grandfather's honour for 100 years.
According to the London Communiqué, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led the army across the San Quentin Canal (Canal de Saint-Quintin) “at the risk of heavy fog, in the presence of field guns and machine guns”.
He then headed towards the front line, where he led the front-line fighters “in a heroic manner” and then fired a single-handed field gun, repelling three sub-units.
On October 4, 1918, more than a month before the end of the war, Colt Vann was shot dead by a German sniper.
72-year-old Michael Vann evaluates grandfather's behavior as, “I know, grandfather's bravery, I can never compare, but it will keep me humble”.
The parade was led by the Brentwood Empire Youth Band. After the parade, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, gave the wreath.
Michael Vann said that he “was very honoured to take part in the march” and then added that “the true hero can see what might be heroic from the support of the people”.
MMA. Bellator 206 became Piggy.
Imagine you were up all night, waiting to see the Bellator 206, but at the end of the day you were told you couldn't watch the main event.
San Jose has 13 competitions, of which the main event is 6 competitions. British Channel 5 is live from night to night.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, the channel was changed to Piggy Page, and the British audience was shocked.
Some people stayed up all night and waited until early in the morning to see the boxing match, but fell into their glasses.
On Twitter, one of the fans said that turning the programme into animated films was a “damn joke”.
The Senior Marketing and Communication Vice-President of Bellator, Dave Schwartz, asked the question of the broadcast, said that “the government had made it inappropriate to broadcast such programmes at 6 a.m., so television stations were forced to switch to children's programmes”.
"Piggy Paige," "Yes."
The President of Bellator Corporation, Scott Coker, said that in future arrangements, British audiences would be included as much as possible.
"I think this can be solved when thinking about replaying," said Coker.
“But it was at 6 a.m. on Sundays in England, but we had to wait until Sundays on our side, and then it was Monday in England.
But we're still working on it.
Believe me, when the show changed, I received a lot of information, and it was unfriendly.
We did the same thing. We thought it was a technical failure.
It is not, however, a matter of government regulation.
I can assure you that this will not happen again.
We're in control of five races, not six. We usually play five games, and we're too long for fans to enjoy it.
It's a little awkward."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's low on his own because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daley, an Olympic diver, said that he had been humbled since he was a child because of his sexual orientation, but that had also been the driving force behind his success.
The 24-year-old boy said that it was after secondary school that he found out that “not everyone is like me”.
In "Desert Island Discs", radio channel 4 hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said that he was talking about gay rights in order to give others hope.
He also described the fact that when he had children, he was less relevant to the issue of winning the Olympic championship.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this youth show, has been sick for several months.
As a guest of Laverne's inaugural show, Daley said that in his own growth he felt “one less” than others, because “the society does not accept the interaction between boys and girls of the same sex”.
He said, “To this day, I will feel truly inferior and different, but it also gives me the strength to succeed”.
He said that he wanted to prove that he was “making a difference” so that people would not be disappointed when they knew their sexual orientation.
Daley has won two Olympic bronze medals and is now a high-profile LGBT activist, and was present at this year ' s Australian Commonwealth Games calling for more countries to legalize homosexuality.
He said that he had the courage to speak because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences, and he wanted to give others hope.
The three world champions said they met the American film producer Dustin Lance Black in 2013, and when he found out he was in love with this man, "I'm scared myself."
Last year, Daley married his 20-year-old Oscar winner, who said age differentials were never a problem.
Daley first attended the Olympics at the age of 14, and three years later, his father died of cancer. He said, "As a young man, he went through so much, it's hard to find people of similar ages who have an ups and downs."
The couple had their son in June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley. After that, Daley's whole view changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd say 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there's something bigger than the Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold."
He gave his son the same name as his father, Robert, to commemorate his father ' s death in 2011 due to brain cancer (age 40).
Daley said his father did not believe he would die, and his last question was whether there were tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't say to him, "Dad, you can't sit in the front row," he said.
“When he stopped breathing, I was holding his hand, and in fact until he stopped breathing and was dead, I did not admit that he would never fall forever”, he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life and that there was no better feeling than diving in front of the main audience during the Olympics”, he said.
And that's why Proud by Heather Small became his favorite song, and he fell in love with it in the run-up to the Olympics, and now he hears it and he's one of them.
Desert Island Discs is aired on Sunday 11.15 (BST) and broadcast channels are BBC Radio 4 channels.
Michaelson, who's not feeling so good, got replaced on the Leeds on Saturday.
The American player Phil Mickelson will make a record in his 47th competition on Sunday, but he has to adjust to avoid negative milestones.
Michaelson, for the 12th time in this biennial event, was replaced by Captain Jim Furyk in a four-player and a four-player two-ball game on Saturday.
Instead of becoming the backbone of the game as it was in the United States, this five-thousand winner spent a day on cheerleaders and training grounds in the hope that his problems would be corrected as soon as possible.
Even at the height of his career, with the most straight golf clubs, the tense French national golf course is not suitable for this 48-year-old player, whose high and uneven route increases the number of shootings out of orbit.
If the field itself is not strong enough, Michaelson will be the British champion of the 9th game of the week's finest golf competition, Francesco Molinari, and Francisco Molinari has already joined the newest Tommy Free.
If the U.S. team starts with a four-point lag of 12 single-play games, the Michaelson game will be crucial to a good start.
Florrick expressed confidence in his team, but he had nothing else to say.
“He fully understood his role today, shot me in the back, put his arms around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow”, Florrick said.
“He has great confidence in himself.
He's a member of Hall of Famer, and he's made a great contribution to the team in the past, and this week too.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I want him to play more games, but that's what it turns out to be, and I have to accept it.
Like the rest of us, he wants to play a great game."
On Sunday, Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record of the highest number of races in the Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of the Ryder Cup's career, but his personal record has never reached such a high level.
Michaelson made 18 out of 20 negative 7 flat grades, although Florrick said that his appearance had brought some invisible force to the team.
"He's funny, he's sour, he's so cozy, he likes to make fun of people, he's a good man on the team," he explains.
"I think young players like to tease him, and this week, it'll be fun.
In addition to the competition, he brought us a lot”.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn is aware that the big score is about to break.
Team leader Thomas Bjorn from Europe, judging from experience, is likely to create a negative situation in a single-run final in the Leeds.
Diane first appeared in the 1997 race of Valderrama, when Seve Ballesteros, the leader of the team, was a five-point leader over the United States team, but in the end it was only 141.
After watching two of the 2018 games held on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National in France (winning by 5-3 and eventually leading by 10-6 points), Bjørn describes, "
History will tell me and every member of the team that it's not over.
You have to do everything you can before tomorrow comes.
Go out and do the right thing.
It didn't end until the score was on the scoreboard.
Our goal is to try to win the trophies, which is also our focus.
I've been saying that I'm concerned about the 12 players on our team, but we know very well what we're facing -- the most powerful player in the world”.
Bjørn was satisfied with the difficult confrontation of the players on the golf course, adding: “In this respect, I will never be able to overcome myself.
Tomorrow's another war.
Tomorrow is a private show of self-sponsiveness, a little different from usual.
It would be great if the game went well and fought side by side with a partner, but if it was left alone, as a golf player, it would be your overall ability to test it.
That's the message you need to make the players understand.
Now, you have to leave your partner, and your partner has to leave you, each of you, to the fullest of your abilities.”
Unlike Bjørn, their Jim Furyk expects their personal performance to go beyond partner performance to three points in four for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas.
As the European team worked to achieve the “Miracle at Medinah” and failed, and as a member of Brooklyn’s winning team, Florrick was on both ends of the finals, with the possibility of winning or losing.
When asked how Ben Crenshaw (the then captain of 1999) inspired the team to meet the finals, he said, "I remember every damn word."
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but you may want to be as pre-emptive as in Valderrama and Bruclain.
If everyone pushes in the same direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle game.
“So our formations have been adjusted accordingly to come out in a way that will benefit us, and we are all aware that we are striving for tomorrow's miracle.”
Thomas will lead the team back. He will fight Rory McIlroy in the finals, Paul Casey in the semi-finals, Justin Rose, Jon Ram.
Speaking of a single game, Bjørn stated that “I deployed the players in such an order, which was the result of full consideration”.
The German new warship has been postponed again.
According to local media reports, the latest frigate of the German navy was supposed to be deactivated in 2014 to replace the old warship of the cold war, but because of system failures and the cost-rolling snowball growth, we will not be able to see its appearance until next year.
According to the Die Zeit newspaper, the military spokesman stated that the commissioning of the Reinland-Pfalts, the main frigate of the All-New Baden-Württemberg-class frigate, was currently postponed until the first half of 2019.
The frigate was supposed to have served in the Navy in 2014, but the painful post-production problems have plagued the fate of this vast project.
The four Baden-Württemberg frigates recalled by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Baden-Württemberg frigates.
It is understood that the frigate will have powerful firepower, a large number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include the longer maintenance cycle, which allows for the deployment of the latest frigates for up to two years away from the port.
However, successive extensions mean that the state-of-the-art warships, which are said to allow Germany to deploy its forces abroad, will be obsolete when they become operational.
As early as last year, when the German navy officially refused to decommission the frigate and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, the frigate's fate of F125 became the focus of news.
This was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilding plant after delivery.
While little was known about the reasons for the return, the German media cited some of the key “software and hardware deficiencies” that would render warships useless in carrying out their combat missions.
Software defects will be particularly deadly as the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates will be operated by 120 crew members and will require only half of the capacity of the old Baden-Württemberg-class frigates.
Similarly, it was revealed that the frigate was seriously overweight, which would reduce its performance and limit the Navy ' s ability to add future upgrades.
The weight of the 7,000-ton “Rhineland-Pfalts” is said to be twice that of the German frigate of the same class used during World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the project as a whole, including the training of crews, has also become a headache.
It is said that the cost has reached an alarming 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), compared to an initial budget of 2.2 billion euros.
In the light of recent warnings that German naval forces are shrinking, the problem with the latest frigate has become even more acute.
At the beginning of this year, the Chairman of the National Defence Committee of the German Parliament, Hans-Peter Bartels, admitted that the German navy was in fact “no more ships available for deployment”.
The official stated that, over time, the problem had become more acute and that old ships were being decommissioned without new alternatives.
He lamented that no frigate of the Baden-Württemberg class could serve in the Navy.
The National Trust's secret life of bugging bats.
A new study is being carried out on a estate in the highlands of Scotland to reveal how bats use the land for food.
It is hoped that this finding will unlock the behavioural veil of this unique flying mammal and help guide future conservation activities.
This study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will track common voltage and high-sounding wings, as well as brown long-eared bats and D in the Inverewe Gardens Garden of Wester Ross.
They will install special tape recorders at key locations around the garden to track bat activity throughout the year.
NHS staff and volunteers will use hand-held detectors to conduct mobile surveys.
A professional sound analysis of all the recordings was then performed to determine the frequency of bat barking and what bat was doing.
Habitat maps and reports are then produced to generate detailed scene pictures of bat behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NHS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat is vital for bats and how each bat uses it.
This information will help to judge the benefits of habitat management, such as the laying of grasslands and how best to preserve the forested lands of bats and other relevant species.
However, the number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the past century.
Construction and development work poses a great threat to bats, affecting their habitat and even causing them to lose their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting, chemical handling of fly-fishing paper and some building materials, as well as pet cat attacks, pose risks to bats.
Bats are actually visible.
However, due to night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they catch their prey.
They are able to accurately locate small bugs and barriers in flight paths using complex echo positioning techniques.
The NTS, which maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in Scotland, treats bats very seriously.
NTS has 10 combat specialists who conduct regular surveys, shelter tests and, in some cases, rescues.
The organization even established the first and only special bat reserve in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, the home of eight bats (10 species) in Scotland.
David Thompson, the manor's manager, said the manor was the ideal fertile ground for bats.
"In Threave Manor, we built an area for bats," Thompson says.
“There are old buildings, old trees and all the perfect habitats.
But there is much unknown knowledge about bats, so the work we do here and in other estates will help us learn more about how bats can thrive.
Thompson stressed that it was important to check the situation of bats before carrying out manor maintenance, because the unwitting destruction of a female bat habitat could result in the death of up to 400 female bats and bat cubs, leading to the total extinction of the local population.
Bats are protected and it is an offence to catch, attack, harass or destroy their habitat.
The Scottish official Elizabeth Ferrell of Bat Conservation Trust encourages the public to contribute.
She said, “We have much to learn about bats and many other species for which we do not know the specifics of their populations.”
Ronaldo denied the rape charges, and the lawyer was going to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo, who is known for having been charged with rape by “false news”, has expressed the desire to use him as a “false self”.
His lawyer was prepared to prosecute the alleged German news magazine, Mirror Weekly, which had been published.
The leader of the Portuguese and Uventus Brigades was accused of raping the American woman Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the weekly Sunglasses, Ronaldo was alleged to have subsequently paid $375,000 to the woman, keeping her silent about the incident.
A few hours after the charges were brought to light, Ronaldo, 33, released a live video on Instagram to 142 million followers, accusing them of “false news”.
"No, no, no, no, no, no,
What they're saying today is false news, and the winner of the five goldballs says it in front of the camera.
“They're just trying to use my name to make themselves.
That's normal.
They wanted to take advantage of me, but that was part of their work.
I'm a happy man. I'm fine in every way. Ronaldo smiled to add.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyer intends to sue the Sunglasses Weekly for this charge, stating that its “unauthorized reports are suspected of violating personal privacy”.
According to counsel Christian Schertz, Ronaldo would seek compensation for “an amount of moral damages corresponding to the gravity of the violation, which could be the most serious human rights violation in recent years”.
Allegedly, the incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents of the Clark County District Court in Nevada, it was reported that, following a meeting between Ronaldo and Mayolga at a nightclub, the two returned to the player ' s room, where the rape had taken place.
Majolga stated that Ronaldo had kneeled to her after the alleged incident, saying that she was “99 per cent a gentleman” and was being dragged into the water by that “1 per cent”.
The paper noted that Ronaldo recognized the sexual relations between the two persons, but that both parties had volunteered.
Majolga also stated that she went to the police station and took pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “for fear of reprisals” and was “for public humiliation”.
Mayolga, age, stated that she was currently seeking to overturn the out-of-court settlement, as she continued to be traumatized by the effects of the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged incident, Ronaldo was about to join the Union of Mansions (UCC) royal horse, and this summer Ronaldo joined the Italian Haumen Yuventus with a membership fee of 100 million euros.
Leo: The United Kingdom lost its car manufacturer "to be its eternal regret."
The British Secretary of Commerce, Greg Clark, stated that the loss of his position as global leader in the automobile industry in the United Kingdom would “be its eternal regret”.
He added that the British Toyota plant had informed BBC that if the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU without an agreement, Toyota would suspend production at the Bernaston plant near Derby.
“We need an agreement”, Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the problem of border delays could lead to a reduction in employment opportunities in the United Kingdom without agreement.
Toyota's Auris and Avensis, the factory of Bernaston, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to other EU countries.
“My point is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, our plant will cease production.” Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota’s Bernaston Plant, introduced.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jeopardus Lugger, have similarly expressed concerns about problems in the absence of agreement on the operation of cross-border trade after Europe.
The BMW, for example, said that the mini factory in Oxford would be closed down for a month after the British de-Ou.
The main concern of automobile manufacturers is that there may be supply chain risks in the absence of an agreement.
The Toyota production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, and orders for cars from British and EU suppliers are received every 37 minutes.
If, on March 29, the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU without an agreement, there could be a disruption at the British border, which, according to industry sources, could lead to delays and shortages of components.
The company stated that the Toyota factory in Derby County could not hold stocks for more than one day and production would therefore cease.
Mr. Clark stated that the Chequers Plan proposed by Theresa May for the future relationship with the European Union was “exactly checked to avoid border checks”.
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the most successful agreement, both to achieve the present success and to seize this opportunity.” He told BBC Radio's 4's Today program as such.
“The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers suggests that we need absolute capacity to continue to drive a range of highly effective supply chains.”
Toyota did not indicate how long it would be cut off, but in the long run cost increases would weaken the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately affect job opportunities.
Peter Bouvallaris, who had been working at the Bernaston factory for 24 years and was currently a convenor of the factory, said that his members were increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesperson introduced the following: “We have a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU”.
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein might be postponed again.
On Sunday, the White House stated that the high-level meeting between Donald Trump and the Deputy Minister of Justice, Rod Rosenstein, might be “postponed by one week” because the winds of the Supreme Court candidate, Bretkavano, had not yet subsided.
Rosenstein oversees the work of the Special Adviser, Robert Mueller, while the Robert Mulletrump campaign team is accused of proselytizing Russia and the President may obstruct a fair and impartial investigation.
There has been much debate in Washington for several months as to whether Trump would dismiss the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby jeopardizing Muller ' s independence.
Early this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed conversations with Trump with wiretaps and the possibility of removing the President through 25 amendments.
Rosenstein denied this report.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in a covert report that he was resigning.
On Thursday, it was announced that he had met with Trump at the United Nations in New York.
Trump stated that he was “unwilling” to dismiss Rosenstein, but subsequently postponed the meeting in order to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judicial Committee hearing, in which Dr. Cavanaugh and a woman accused of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Brassy Ford, would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Cavanaugh and postponed the full Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, news secretary of Trump, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: “In view of all the other things that are being done in the Supreme Court, a week may be postponed, and the exact date has not yet been set, I think it may be this week”.
But we will see this day, and I will keep the media informed of developments.”
Some journalists will refute this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Saunders said that the fact that a press conference had not been held was not because she hated the “crowding” of television journalists, although she said, “I will not object to their “crowding” stories”.
She then indicated that direct contacts between Trump and the media would be increased.
She said, “President Trump had more questions and answers than any previous president.” She did not, however, invoke any evidence. “We studied these figures.”
Saunders said that a press conference would still be held, but “if the media had an opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would be much better than talking to me”.
We have organized such questions and answers as much as we can, and indeed many times in the past few weeks, when you can talk directly to the President of the United States, the press conference will be cancelled.
Trump often has question-and-answer sessions when leaving the White House or when attending public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the President may have explained to us the reasons behind this, showing up in the face of a gathering of journalists without fear and sometimes acting strangely.
The Minister of Health sent a letter to the EU staff of the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) regarding the concerns of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
The Minister of Health sent a letter to the EU staff of the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) expressing the country ' s gratitude to them and the hope that they would remain in Scotland after Britain ' s departure.
Jeane Freeman of the Medical Services Plan (MSP) sent a letter within six months before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has committed itself to paying the cost of settlement status applications for EU citizens working in the public services that it has transferred.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on Europe have continued throughout the summer and it is hoped that a decision will be taken this fall.
However, the British Government is also stepping up preparations for a possible non-agreement situation.
I know this time must have been very uncomfortable for you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of every staff member, regardless of your nationality.
The valuable experience and skills provided by colleagues within and outside the EU will strengthen and improve our medical services for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland will always be your home, and we very much hope that you will stay here.”
Christy Abercrombie, emergency surgery after a head injury.
Mike Organ, Tennessee, reported that the Tennessee State Tigers beat Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday at 31-27.
Rod Reed, director of the Tiger Team at Tennessee State University, informed journalists that Abercrombie had been injured shortly before the end of the half-time.
“He ran to the edge and suddenly fell”, Reed introduced.
Trainers and medical staff lost oxygen to Abercrombie by the side of the line and then carried him on the stretcher and brought him back for further assessment.
An official from the Tiger Team of Tennessee State University revealed to Chris Harris of WSMV News in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “the type/level of damage has not yet been determined”, while the TMVP of Tennessee State University was working to understand the exact time of the injury.
Abercrombie is a second-grader red shirt player, the first season he's been at Tennessee State University since he moved here from Illinois.
In Saturday's game, before he quits the game, he completed a total of five shovels, raising the total number of his season shovels to 18.
A higher stamp tax on foreign buyers who buy houses in England.
Under the newly introduced Conservative Plan, the United Kingdom will collect a stamped tax on foreign buyers of properties purchased in the United Kingdom, and the resulting taxes will be used to help cope with homelessness.
This will reverse Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The stamp tax is for people in England who don't pay taxes.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise Pound120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when buying property in the United Kingdom, and an additional income tax will be used to help the homeless.
The move was also seen as an attempt to offset Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters.
The stamp duties were imposed on non-taxed individuals and companies in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds obtained would be used to improve the Government ' s solution to the problem of sleeping in the open.
In addition to the current stamp tax, which includes an increase of 3 per cent for the second house and rental of a house introduced two years ago.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise Pound120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the buyers of new London properties are non-British residents, which raises prices and makes the road to first-time buyers more difficult.
Many of Britain's rich regions, particularly London, have become “ghost towns” because a large number of foreign home buyers are not in the United Kingdom for much of the time.
Just before this new policy was launched, Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp tax to allow more young people to buy the first set of properties.
He accused large construction companies of buying land instead of using it to maintain high housing prices, and urged Ms. May to abandon the quota of affordable housing and address the “housing stigma” in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of housing reform proposals with a wide range of eyes, including rent control and an end to “no fault” evictions.
He also hoped that Parliament would be empowered to build new houses.
Ms. May said: “As I said last year, during my tenure as Prime Minister, I will restore the British dream and make life better for every new generation.
This means the rehabilitation of the fragmented housing market.
Britain will always welcome those who want to live, work and build families here.
However, for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies, it would be wrong to differ from hard-working British residents in the difficulty of purchasing a home.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house is too remote, and the humiliation of living on the ground is still very real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate dream is to be a Scottish coach."
Jack Ross, the head coach of the Sandland team, said that his "final ideal" was to one day become the head coach of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is trying to rejuvenate the Northeast team, which currently ranks third in the league, three points behind the first.
When St. Mirren returned to Scotland last season, he moved to Stadium of Light this summer.
“I want to serve my country as a player.
I got a B cap, that's it." Ross wants the BBC's Sport Voice (SportSound) program introduction.
"I grew up watching Scotland Team games. I used to watch games with my dad in Hampton when I was a kid. I always remember that time.
But that's the only chance I've got until I've brought the team very well."
Prior to Ross, the leaders of the Sandland team included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The owner of the former Alloa Athletic team said that he had so many famous people in a club of this size that he didn't feel scared, that he had rejected Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"My success now depends on "Can I lead the team back to England?"
Because of the team's structure and facilities, it would certainly be able to reach the English team”, he said.
"This isn't an easy task, but only if I take the team back to England, may I think I've succeeded."
Counting that, he's only been a bishop for three years. Ross was an assistant coach in Denbaton for a while and worked in the coach group of the hearts for 15 months.
After that, he led Aro from the demotion to the third team, and during the following season, he led the St. Millen team from the edge of the demotion to the general champion.
Ross says that compared to previous careers in the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Millen and Hamilton Academy, it feels like
Recalling his experience with the Aro team, he said: “This could be a real crossroads.
I really think I'm better suited to be a coach and better to play football.
That sounds strange, because I'm doing well, and living on this is fine, and I do have a lot of fun.
But playing football can be tough sometimes.
There's a lot to do every week.
I still feel the pressure to play ball, but I'm the coach, it feels good.
"I've always wanted to be a coach, and now I've done it. This is the most comfortable day of my life."
You can listen to a full interview with the Voice of Sport on Radio Scottland on September 30, UK Summer Day, 12 - 13, Sunday.
The investigation found that Saturday at 5:30 p.m., it's perfect for a fresh drink.
During the summer heat, British bars struggling to generate income are under stress in the chain of restaurants.
According to the data, bar sales increased by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 per cent.
The business consulting firm Peter Martin of CGA says, "The heat of the day and the longer than expected of the England World Cup made it possible to repeat the June mistake in July (2.8 per cent of bar revenues during the month of June) and the restaurant was hit.
The volume of transactions at the restaurant declined by 1.8 per cent in June, while the decline was even greater in July.
The drinking and water-based bars performed the best, and the volume of transactions at the restaurant continued to decline in comparison with the previous year.
Restaurant-based bars are also affected by the heat, although the impact is relatively small compared to that of restaurant operators.
People just seem to want to go outside and have a drink.
This month, the entire bar industry saw a 6.6 per cent increase in sales of alcohol and water and a 3 per cent decline in sales of food.”
Paul Newman, an analyst for the leisure and hotel industry, said: “The trend has been continuing since the end of April.
Among the main factors affecting sales in the out-of-country consumer market are weather and important social events or sporting events.
Unsurprisingly, the continuing struggle of the catering industry, with a decline of 4.8 per cent compared to the corresponding sales, is compounded by rising cost pressures.
For food-based operators, the impact of long hot summers is a clear-fire shock, and time will tell us if the weather in August is going to bring the necessary breathing time.
The entire bar and restaurant industry (including newly opened bars and restaurants) saw a 2.7 per cent increase in total sales in July, showing a slowdown in branding.
The British Bar and Restaurant Industry Monitoring Agency, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyses data on the performance of 47 business groups with a total turnover of more than Pound9 billion, establishing a benchmark for the industry.
One in five minors uses social media in secret from their parents.
According to the survey, one in five minors (up to 11 years of age) use social media in secret from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in the use of the “false Insta” page
This news has raised concerns about the publication of pornographic material.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to deal with their parents.
One in five minors (aged as young as 11 years) uses social media to hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in the use of “false Insta” accounts, which refer to the photo sharing site Instagram.
The news raised concerns about the publication of pornographic material.
Twenty per cent of students indicated that they had a “purified” primary account number for their parents, as well as other secret accounts.
A mother accidentally discovered the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, who found a teenager encouraging others to “rape me”.
The survey, which was co-sponsored by the British Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' Associations' Conference, HMC, found that 40 per cent of minors aged 11-18 were minors.
The director of HMC, Mike Buchanan, stated: “It is disturbing that so many young people create cyberspace, hide in it, and neither parents nor teachers know it”.
Eilidh Doyle will join the Scottish Athletics Commission as "the voice of the athletes."
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Commission at the annual plenary meeting of government agencies.
Doyle is Scotland's most prestigious tracker, and the Chairman of the Commission, Ian Beattie, described it as a great opportunity for track and track coaches to learn from the wealth of experience at the international level.
“Erid has a great reputation in Scotland, Britain and the world's sports world, and we believe that if he joins the Committee, the track and track movement in Scotland will benefit greatly”, said Betty.
Doyle said, “I am willing to be a voice for athletes, and I hope to make a real contribution to sports in Scotland and to help guide it”.
The American athlete won four Olympic gold medals, 200 metres and 400 metres in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympics, and is currently a British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) invitee commentator in a brief haemorrhage.
He wrote on Twitter: Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
Can't walk.
Doctors say that the extent to which I can recover and can recover depends entirely on time.
Full recovery and re-learning is a difficult task, but I am now able to complete agility training!
Thank you for your encouragement!"
It's a milk-smoking commercial that compares mothers to cows.
An advertisement issued by a milking company comparing nursing mothers to milking cows provoked disagreement among online users.
In launching a new product, “The World's First No-Wise-to-Wise Breasts”, the consumer technology company Elvie published a symmetrical music video inspiration ad, which shows the freedom that this new milking device brings to mothers.
Four real mothers danced with the music in a cow shed full of dry grass, and a part of the music said, "Yes, I feed myself, but you can't see the tail" and, "Did you not find my big milk, but my breasts?"
And the next line is, "Smoking it out, sucking it out, feeding my baby, sucking it out, pulling it out, Grandma's little princess."
But when the ad was posted on the company's Facebook page, it was controversial online.
The video was viewed at 77,000 times, with hundreds of comments and different reactions, and many felt that there was a suspicion of contempt for the “terror” of the dairy industry.
“The decision to advertise this product with cows was a mistake.
Cows, like us, need to be pregnant to have milk, but the difference is that their babies are stolen a few days after delivery”, a friend of the Internet wrote.
Elvie milks can be placed in an Elvie/ Mother's breast.
Another commenter commented: “This is undoubtedly a trauma for mothers and babies.
Why do we compare mothers to urban cows in milk-smoking commercials, when mothers don't want their children to leave themselves?"
Another blogger added: “This ad is too unrealistic.”
Others thought the ad was good, and a lady admitted that she found the song “circumcised”.
“I think this idea is particularly novel.
If I'm still breastfeeding, I'll buy one.
The milking process makes me feel like a cow.
Advertisements are a little too much, but I think it's okay.
It's a novel product." One of the web users wrote.
Another commenter: The funny ad is about mothers who need to smoke milk (usually in companies or bathrooms) and feel like “cows”.
It is not the intention to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the mothers showed themselves dancing and actually wearing milk absorbers in their breasts.
This post-advertisement idea stems from the fact that many women call themselves cows when they are milking them.
However, the Elvie suckler is completely silent, free from electrical wires or tubes, and can be placed perfectly in the breast of the breast so that the woman can free her hands, hold the baby, and even continue to milk when she is out.
"Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold attempt.
By comparing nursing mothers and cows, we want to place the milking process and its problems under the spotlight, while demonstrating, in an interesting and relevant way, that this new milking machine can give people an unparalleled sense of freedom.
It's not Elvie's first headline on the milking machine.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of the two children boarded the T-shirt designed by the designer Marta Jakubowski, while she was wearing the product.
Hundreds of mobile children were secretly transferred to a camp on the Texas border
Although the policy at the border crossings has remained relatively unchanged every month, the number of mobile children held in detention has increased significantly, partly as a result of the harsh rhetoric and policy of the Trump Government, which has made the placement of children more difficult for sponsors.
Legend has it that most sponsors are themselves illegal immigrants who fear that coming forward to adopt a child would jeopardize their chances of remaining in the United States.
In June, the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and their other adult family members had to submit fingerprints and that the authorities would share their fingerprints with the immigration authorities, which led to a significant increase in risk.
Last week, the senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, Matthew Albert, confirmed before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the sponsorship of unaccompanied children.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Real 80 per cent of individuals who are family members of sponsors or sponsors have entered the country illegally, most of them transnational criminals.
That's why we're chasing these people all the time”, Albert said.
According to shelter staff, in order to resolve the problem of these children as soon as possible, officials introduced new regulations requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention (rather than 60 days after the previous provision).
Many children do not appear in person but instead appear in the form of video teleconferences to defend their legal status before immigration judges.
Children who are considered ineligible for relief are promptly deported.
According to shelter workers and reports from the system in recent months, the longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, leading to violence or escape attempts.
Defence counsel states that this concern is even greater in large facilities such as Tornillo, where the size of the area is too large to ignore signs of resistance by children.
They added that the transfer of children to tent cities without sufficient time for children to be emotionally prepared and to say goodbye to their friends could aggravate the trauma already suffered by many children.
Syrian order the immediate withdrawal of the “occupied forces” of the United States, France and Turkey
The statement made by Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem at the United Nations General Assembly (UN General Assembly) also called for the return of Syrian refugees as soon as possible, despite the fact that the war in Syria had lasted eight years.
Mualim, also Deputy Prime Minister of Syria, stated that the illegal entry of foreign troops into Syrian territory under the pretext of combating terrorism “will be dealt with accordingly”.
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally”, Muallim stated to the United Nations General Assembly.
Mualim insisted that Syria's “war on terror is coming to an end”, which has resulted in more than 360,000 deaths and the displacement of millions of people since 2011.
He stated that the Damascus side would continue “to confront this war of sacrifice until we clear Syrian territory” of all terrorist organizations and “all illegal foreign forces”.
The United States, with more than 2,000 soldiers stationed in Syria, is primarily responsible for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers stationed in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Mualim stated that conditions allowed them to return home and condemned “the spreading of irrational fear” by “some Western countries” as forcing them to leave their homes.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate the return of refugees”, he said.
“They are politicizing purely humanitarian issues”.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction assistance will be provided to Syria until Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement to end the war.
United Nations (UN) diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib had created an opportunity to move the political negotiations forward.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale attack by the Russian-backed Syrian army on a province inhabited by three million people.
Muallim stressed, however, that the agreement had a “clear deadline” and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including Al-Qaida-related Nusrah militants “to be eradicated”.
The United Nations Special Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that the new committee, composed of members of the Government and the opposition, will convene as soon as possible for the first time to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, paving the way for elections.
Mualim listed the conditions under which the Syrian Government would join the Commission, stating that the Commission's work should be limited to “the review of the provisions of the current Constitution” and warning against interference.
Why would Trump win a second term?
According to this logic, Trump will win a second term in 2020 unless, as many free viewers wish, impeachment and scandal pre-empt his presidency.
There is no doubt that “this will be the most dramatic outcome of the presidency in history!”
To date, however, there seems to be no sign of aesthetic fatigue.
Since 2014, the coverage of CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million, while that of Microsoft National Radio and Television (MSNBC) has tripled to 1.6 million.

A lot of cash goes to the toughest mid-term parliamentary election for the House of Representatives.
It is not surprising that the reclassification of parliamentary constituencies has led to a contest between two current members of Parliament for the same seat in the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania, and that a significant flow of cash continues to flow.
The recently redrawd suburb of Pittsburgh was the target of a run-off by Democratic Congressman Conor Lamb, who won another constituency in a special election last spring.
Ram faced competition from the current Republican, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the original Pennsylvania 12th constituency, which overlaps with the new 17th constituency.
In January, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the old map of the Congress constituency was unconstitutional and unconstitutional in its favour for Republicans, thereby redefining the constituency.
The contest for new seats in the 17th electoral district raised the issue of campaign finance between the main party finance sector, the Democratic National Assembly Election Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Congress Committee (NRCC).
In March, in the special election for the 18th electoral district of Pennsylvania, which was of great interest, Rams won with a slight advantage, after which he became a well-known name in Pennsylvania.
Previously, the seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won this constituency by 20 percentage points.
Political experts have created a certain advantage for the Democratic Party.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but eventually chose to abandon it.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had endorsed Beijing and had been virtually stopped by Washington.
In June 2017, Trump met with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and then remained in Panama until partners expelled the Trump administration.
In a statement earlier this month, State Department spokesman Heather Nauert stated that State Department officials had decided to call back the heads of United States diplomatic missions in Insalwa, the Dominican Republic and Panama on “no longer recognizing Taiwan's recent decision”.
However, sanctions were only envisaged for El Salvador, which in 2017 had received assistance from the United States in the areas of narcotics control, development and economic support of approximately $140 million.
The proposed punitive measures, including the reduction of economic assistance and targeted visa restrictions, will have a severe impact on the Central American countries and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings proceeded, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar gathering held last year, which was seen as a major step forward in preventing migrants from going to the United States.
However, as of mid-September, senior government officials had made it clear that they wanted the meeting to continue, which effectively ended the idea of penalizing El Salvador.
The Vice-President, Mike Pence, is currently planning to address the meeting scheduled for mid-October, which, according to diplomats, was a signal of the importance that the authorities attached to the meeting.
Three United States envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without being deterred or punished by the latest hard-line information from Washington.
A White House spokesman at Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three United States officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal review on the condition of anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the Government and reluctant to reveal his name, confirmed their allegations.
Study history
The next issue to be addressed may be the report of the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, which is now well documented in the public record.
It is reported that Miller turned the investigation to whether Trump collaborated with Russia in the campaign against our general election.
If Congress were easy to take over, Trump would face parliamentary accountability, and when he was ready to run again, he might end up with a jury composed of colleagues.
There are many hypotheses, and I mean it doesn't mean that Trump's failure is the inevitable result -- it doesn't mean that his failure in Europe is the inevitable result.
The choices available to all on both sides of the Atlantic will determine the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to launch a coup against Hitler (Hitler), provided that the Western world resisted Hitler in Munich and supported Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the best chance to avoid the decades-long massacre that followed.
The process of history has always been centred on these turning points, and the unstoppable pace of democracy has either accelerated or slowed.
Today, the Americans face several such turning points.
What are we going to do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Miller's investigation into his fate?
Rosenstein has become an ant on a hot pot since last year, when the newspaper reported that Rosenstein had proposed a covert recording of the President and suspected that Trump was not suitable for that position.
Rosenstein stated that the Times were inaccurate.
“What will we do if the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) that has just been asked to investigate Brett Kavanaug is not comprehensive or fair - or if the Supreme Court does not heed credible allegations of sexual abuse and fraudulent testimony and believes that it is true?
First of all, will we vote in the medium-term elections for a Congress for which Trump will be responsible?
If the attempt fails, the Democrats will enter a long winter.
But I am confident that we will not fail, because I have learned the lessons of Prague.

Graham Dorrans of the Travellers is optimistic about their confrontation with the Vienna Rapids.
On Thursday, the vagrants met with the Vienna Rapids in their main field and, after pacifying the Spanish Villar earlier this month, they knew that the victory was waving to the Austrians, which would create a favourable position for them in the European league G.
The knee injury prevented midfield player Graham Dorrans from attending the first sighting of the season before the 2-2 Pingvilaire team, but he believed that the Travellers could use it as a springboard to achieve better results.
“This is a good opportunity for us, because the Villariel team is strong, 31-year-old Graham Dorrans says.
“Before the game begins, we believe that we will not come back in vain, and that in the end we will win a point.
Maybe we shouldn't have stopped there, but, finally, it's a draw.
They did better in the first half and we did better in the second half.
Thursday will be another important European night.
I hope that we will get three points, but that will be a tough game because they made good results in the last race, but with so many people supporting us, I am sure that we can move forward and achieve good results.
Last year was undoubtedly a very difficult one, and a lot of things happened after I was injured and things changed for the club itself, but now we feel good.
The team was great. The players enjoyed the game and the training went well.
Let us hope that we can move forward beyond the last season and succeed.
Women's insomnia for fear of retirement savings.
Although survey participants are aware of what kind of care they wish to receive, very few have spoken to their families about this issue.
In this National study, about half of the population indicated that they had spoken to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they'd talked to their children about it.
“People want to have a family to look after themselves, but they have not tried to communicate with their family.” Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Life Insurance Business, said.
How to start, see below.
Communication with spouses and children: The family cannot be prepared to take care of you unless it is informed of its wishes in advance.
Consult with your consultants and family on the details of where care is to be provided and how it is to be provided, as these choices are important factors in determining costs.
Involving financial advisers: Your advisers can also help you figure out how to pay for these costs.
Your financial options for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, a combination of life insurance with cash value, which can be used to cover these costs or self-insurance for your own wealth (if you have money).
Development of legal documents: avoidance of legal disputes at gates.
You can arrange for a health-care agent so that you can appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that a professional nurse is able to comply with your wishes when you cannot communicate with him or her.
In addition, a financial authorization has been prepared.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that you are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the little detail: imagine that the elderly parents are on their way to the hospital with emergency medical problems.
Can you answer the questions about drugs and allergies?
These details are detailed in the written plan so that you can be prepared.
“Not only does it affect financial matters, but who is the doctor?” Martin asked.
“What drugs?
Who's going to take care of the patient?
Develop these plans.”
The man was shot several times with an air rifle in Irverkom.
On his way home at night, a man was repeatedly shot with an air rifle.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was shot in the chest, abdomen and hands in an attack in the Oxford Grove area of Irflekm, Devon County.
The case of a gunshot wound occurred around 0230 hours during the British summer and was described by the police as “absorption”.
The male victim did not see the face of the attackers.
At present, there is no risk to the life of the male, and the police have called on witnesses to provide clues.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
According to Indonesian officials, at least 384 people had died as a result of the intense earthquake and tsunami that had occurred on Friday in the city of Baru, Indonesia, and the death toll was still on the rise.
As a result of the disruption of communications, relief officials were unable to obtain any information from the Dungara district, which is located north of Baru, closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Baru, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
The following are some of the key facts about Baru and Dungara, Sulawesi Island:
Baru, the capital of Central Sulawesi, is at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
At the time of the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dungara is a district spread along the coastline of more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) north-west of Sulawesi.
The district is a sub-provincial administrative area with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic pillars of Central Sulawesi Province, particularly the coastal region of Dungara.
The nickel industry also plays an important role in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morovally County, across Sulawesi.
According to IDNDR, in the last 100 years, Baru and Dungara have been hit by tsunamis on several occasions.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Mangala.
In 1996, another tsunami hit the western part of Dungara, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Rim Volcano belt, where earthquakes are frequent, and is therefore subject to frequent seismic attacks.
The following are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province, northern Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries/areas, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom were in Aceh Province.
2005: In late March and early April, there were several strong earthquakes on the west coast of Sumatra Island.
Hundreds of people died in Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
In 2006, an earthquake of 6.8 magnitude struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia ' s most populated island, and the tsunami caused an earthquake that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: 7.6 magnitude earthquake near Baton City, the capital of West Sumatra province.
As a result, more than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude struck one of the Meteorway Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres and destroying dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Bidijaya district in Aceh, causing severe damage and reminiscent of the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami, which also caused extreme panic among the population.
The earthquake did not trigger a tsunami, but the collapsed buildings also caused more than 100 deaths.
2018: The Great Earthquake struck Longbe Island, a tourist-like island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake damaged thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily in detention.
Sarah Palin was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin, former Governor of Alaska and vice-presidential candidate, Track Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report on domestic violence and resisting arrest issued by the Alaskan Police on Saturday, Palin, 29 years old, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence in Wasila, Alaska.
According to police reports, Palin took a mobile phone from a familiar woman who tried to report her alleged crime to the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is currently detained at the Mat-Su pre-trial facility and holds an unsecured bond worth $500.
According to the Internet, on Saturday, when he appeared before the court, the court asked him to defend himself, claiming that he was “not guilty”.
Palin faces charges of three A-grade misdemeanours, which means that he may be imprisoned for one year and fined $250,000.
At the same time, he was charged with a minor B offence and could be sentenced to one day ' s imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
However, this is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a criminal offence.
In December 2017, he was charged with beating his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, reported her alleged attack to the police.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans' Court (Alaska's Veteran's Court).
In January 2016, a report on the crime of domestic violence alleged that Palin was suspected of domestic violence and that he was carrying a gun in connection with the incident.
Palin ' s girlfriend claimed that she had been punched in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was condemned by veterans ' organizations for claiming that his son ' s violence was related to his post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during his service in Iraq.
Earthquake tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
A Friday earthquake in Sulawesi, Indonesia, has killed at least 384 people.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been paralysed, and the number of deaths is expected to continue to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred in central Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, images of disaster situations are covered up.
At the time of the tsunami, hundreds of people were celebrating festivals on a beach in Palu city.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for suspects of terrorist attacks in New York City.
The U.S. federal prosecutor in New York wants to impose a death sentence on the New York suspect Sayfulo Saipov. The terrorist attack resulted in the death of eight people, a rare case in New York City since 1953.
It was alleged that in October, 30-year-old Sepov was driving a Home Depot-leased truck on a highway on the west side of the lower city of Manhattan, entering a bicycle lane, crushing pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
According to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York, in order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutor must prove that Sepov had “intentionally” killed eight victims and had “intentionally” injured others.
According to this court document, the death penalty can be imposed on both counts.
A few weeks after the attack, a United States federal grand jury announced that the suspect, Sepov, had been charged with 22 counts, including 8 counts of murder, support for extortion (used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases) and violent destruction of motor vehicles.
The Prosecutor stated that the attack required “a great deal of planning and premeditation” and described the manner in which the Sépov attack was described as “offensive, cruel and despicable”.
The letter of intent described the victims of Saifuro Saipov as Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernán
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been 10 years since the last capital case was filed in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last execution in the New York Federal Court was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of murder. The couple were executed two years ago during the cold war for Soviet espionage.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenberg couple were executed in an electric chair.
The court documents show that Sepov was Uzbek and that he did not show any self-restraint in the days or months following the attack.
According to the police, he indicated to the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Sepov stated to the authorities that he had been inspired to launch the attack after watching the ISIS video via his cell phone.
According to the police, he also requested that ISIS flags be placed in his ward.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
The federal public defender, David Patton, representing Saipov, stated that they were “particularly disappointed” with the prosecution's decision.
Barton said: “We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty without accepting a guilty plea of life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned.”
The Sepov defence team had previously asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
The Conservative Congressman says it's up to Nigel Farage to negotiate the Great Britain's Trans-European negotiations.
In a protest at the Conservative Party meeting, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the current Popular Army”.
The former leader of the Independence Party said that politicians must feel “the warmness of the voices of the `suspicious Euros'” and, as one of Teresa May's parliamentarians said, he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
In a march in Birmingham, Congressman Peter Bone, the back seat of the Conservative Party, said that if Mr. Farage were to be Secretary (Brexit Secretary), then the United Kingdom would have been “a long time ago”.
However, Ms. May ' s challenge in reconciling her deeply divided ranks was further highlighted by the fact that the León-Patoli party joined a separate protest against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
The Prime Minister is trying to adjust the Cheques Plan to put it on the right track, under the cover of de-Eurasia, Re-Eurasia and the European Union.
Ally insisted that, despite the strong opposition, she would continue her efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels and force suspected Europeans and labour parties to choose between her plan and “disorder”.
Mr. Bone stated to Leave Mens Leave of Solihull that he wanted to “discard the Cricks Project”.
He said that Mr. Farage should accompany himself and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
He said, "If he were responsible, we'd be out of it by now."
The councilman from Fort Welling added: “I will be strong against England, but we need to abandon the Cix plan.”
Expressing his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We do not need world wars to make them obey.
We want to make our own laws in our own countries.”
It was suggested that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote, and Mr. Bone rejected the proposal: “This idea that the British had changed their mind and wanted to stay is not true at all”.
Andrea Jenkyns, a Conservative demagogue, also took part in the march, and she introduced to the press, saying, “I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
“The people do not welcome the Cix plan, nor will opposition parties vote for it, nor do our parties and our activists welcome it, and you will remember that it was these people who cheered us on the street and who were the first to choose us to be on the stage.
Please give up Cricks and listen to people's voices."
In a message to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Minister can only keep his position if he honours his commitments”.
Mr. Farage introduced the gathering politicians to the fact that if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, then they must feel “the heat of their voices”.
He said, “Now, this is a matter of trust between us, the people and the political class.”
"They're trying to betray the Trio, and we're here today to say to them, "We won't let you."
In his address to a passionate audience, he added: “I hope you can make the political class that is trying to betray the Deutsche feel how much the cry is.
“We will mobilize the British People's Army, which has contributed to our victory in Europe, and we will never rest until British independence and self-government is achieved.”
Meanwhile, Leopold marched in Birmingham, followed by a two-hour rally in the centre of the city.
Following the formation of this team this weekend, several activists waved the banner of “The Conservative Party Against Despouy”.
At the opening of the meeting, labour colleague Lord Adonis mocked party applications of Conservatives for security problems.
He added: “It is these people who tell us that they have the IT system and all the technology to achieve free trade without borders in Ireland.
“This is a complete farce.
There was no such good thing as Teo”, he added.
Warren's plan is to give serious consideration to running for president.
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that he would “consider carefully” his candidacy for the presidency after the November elections.
According to the Boston Globe, the senator of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about his intentions for the future in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren regularly criticizes President Donald Trump, who is currently running for election in November, in opposition to Republican Congressman Geoff Diehl, who was President Trump in 2016.
She has been the focus of speculation about the possible replacement of Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holi York City was her 36th meeting in the form of town hall meetings since Trump took office.
One participant asked her whether she intended to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time “to march women into Washington to restore the shattered government, and one of them was a woman at the top”.
Arrest of the suspect who shot him at Louisiana State University (LSU) Sims.
Saturday, the Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced that the suspect who shot a basketball player, Wayde Sims, at the University of Louisiana (LSU), had been arrested on Friday.
At a press conference held at 11 a.m. Eastern Time, Baton Rouge Police announced that a 20-year-old suspect, Dyteon Simpson, had been arrested.
On Friday, the police station released a video of the shooting, requesting help from the public in identifying the men who appeared on the video.
Sims, aged 20, was shot dead on Friday morning near the University of the South.
According to 247Sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul revealed to the media on Saturday that “Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died”.
Wade defended his friend and was shot by Simpson.
In the face of interrogation, Simpson admitted to being on the scene and possessing weapons, and also to having shot and killed Wayde Sims.
Unsurprisingly, Simpson was arrested and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
A young boy growing up in Baton Rouge, Sims, 6 feet 6 inches tall, participated in 32 games in the last season, received 10 openings, an average of 17.4 minutes each, scored 5.6 points, 2.9.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton won Sebastian Vitel with the help of the convoy's command.
From the moment Valtteri Bottas defeated Lewis Hamilton last Saturday and became eligible, it became clear that Mercedes “will play a great role in the race”.
From the point of embarkation, Potas led the way, pitting Hamilton almost during the first two rounds of defence, and enticing Vitel to attack his teammates.
Vitel first entered the maintenance station and Hamilton ran to the end of the convoy, which was supposed to determine the outcome.
After a round, Mercedes entered the station, went back to the runway behind Vitel, and, after a fight, in order to avoid staying silent after the double defense of the third curve, this Ferrari driver was reluctant to give up the tunnel, Han.
Max Verstappen, on his 21st birthday, took off in the back of the track and, at the end of the first circle, ran to the 7th position.
During most of the race, he moved at full speed and tried to finish it quickly. More than Kimi Raikkonen, he ran to position 4.
He finally entered the maintenance station in the 44th circle, failed to bring up the speed in the remaining 8 circles, and finally Leconin got fourth.
Hamilton said, “It is a difficult day, because Watley has performed quite well throughout the weekend, and he has given me his place with a gentle hand.
The first and second achievements of the convoy were excellent.”
That's not a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday because she insisted she didn't reveal anything about Christine Bryce Ford.
In a speech at a rally in West Virginia, President Trump did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee. Instead, he commented that what was happening in the Senate was a good proof of how “defiled, dirty, hypocritical” people were.
Trump said, “When you see anger, when you see angry, mean, dirty, hypocritical people, one thing can happen, and good things have happened in the Senate over the past few days”.
"When you learned of the release and the leak, they said, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it”.
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you leak the news?
Remember her answer... did you leak the file-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak”.
Well, please wait.
Is that what we leaked? No, it's not us. He added, Senator remembered.
In July, Vanstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Cavanaugh, which was leaked in early September, but Vanstan denied that her office had led to the leak.
According to the Congressional Hill newspaper, Vanstein disclosed to the Committee that “I did not conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, nor did I reveal what happened to her”.
“She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I kept it confidential as she requested”.
Her denial, however, did not seem to have been accepted by the President, who commented at a meeting held on Saturday night: “Listen, the body language is not very good.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate who had been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, claiming that the Democratic Party was using the accusation for their own ends.
According to Mediaite, “they will take back power by whatever means necessary.
Look at these despicable and dirty methods, who do not care who harms or who gets power and control”.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Victory Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer wins the competition, Dundee. Two goals, wins for Giants.
Saturday, Dundee Stars won a 5-3 match in the second round to make up for the defeat of Belfast Giants in Friday's elite league.
Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauviller scored for the Giants to get a two-ball lead at the start of the game.
Before Dwyer took the lead for Giants, Mike Sullivan and Jordan Downie got home level.
Before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won the goal, François Bouchard set the score for Dundee.
This is the third time Adam Keefe's team lost in this season's elite league, and they beat Dundee at 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth meeting of two teams this season, and in the previous three games, Giants won the game.
Dwyer started the unveiling battle with the help of Kendall McFaulll in 3 minutes and 35 seconds in the fourth minute, while David Rutherford, with the help of Beauviller, doubled the lead in four minutes.
During the intense unveiling campaign, Sullivan won the home-place advantage at 13:10, after which Matt Marquardt set the score for Downie at 15:16.
Dwyer, at the end of the first game, scored the second goal of the night, and Giants took the lead in the first.
The main team regrouped and Bouchard launched a powerful attack in 27 minutes and 37 seconds, which will again be equal to the score.
Downie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the second half of the second half of the game and win the fifth ball of the team at the end of the last round, thus ensuring victory.
Giants lost four of the last five games, and they'll be in front of Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers used their lives to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board managed to escape the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia, who lost his life to ensure the safe departure of an aircraft carrying hundreds of people, was later recognized as a hero.
On Friday, a major earthquake in Sulawesi triggered a tsunami that killed more than 800 people and left many missing.
Strong aftershocks continued to engulf the area, and many people were trapped in ruins in the city of Baru.
However, despite the fact that colleagues are running for their lives, 21-year-old Agon (Anthonius Gunawan Agung) has not left his post and remains at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in a rocky control tower.
He insisted on remaining in place to ensure the safe take-off of the Balze flight 6321, which was already on the runway at the time.
When he realized that the control tower had begun to collapse, he jumped off the tower.
He died in the hospital.
According to ABC News in Australia, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that Agon's decision saved hundreds.
We have a helicopter ready to take off from Bali, Kalimantan, to take Agon to a major hospital in other cities for treatment.
Unfortunately, however, Agon left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Baru.
“We're very sad to hear this news”, Sirait added.
At the same time, the Indonesian National Agency for Disaster Reduction indicated that roads to towns such as Dungara, Sigi and Boutong were blocked and that government authorities were concerned that the death toll might reach thousands.
The institutional spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, stated that “we believe that the death toll is still rising, as many bodies are still buried under the rubble and many have not yet been found”.
A wave of up to six metres destroyed Baru, who was due to hold a mass funeral on Saturday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to deliver relief supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Lisa Kusuma, told Sky News reporter, "The ambulance delivers the body every minute.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
A small nearby market was looted.”
Jan Gelfand, President of the Indonesian International Committee of the Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything in its power to help survivors, but we don't know what search and rescuers will find.
Although this is already a tragedy, the situation is likely to be worse”.
According to CNN, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Baru on Sunday to address the Indonesian army: “I command you to complete all evacuation-related tasks, day and night.
Are you ready?
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake early in the year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini claims that a man disappeared after the plane crashed into the lagoon.
A New Guinea Airlines flight crashed into the atoll lake of Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean, where the airline had previously indicated that 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated safely from the plane that sunk to the bottom of the lake and that a man had now been reported missing.
At a launch on Saturday afternoon, New Guinea Airlines stated that it was not possible to explain the disappearance of male passengers.
The airline indicated that it was working with local governments, hospitals and investigators to locate the missing men.
The airline did not immediately disclose the identity of the passenger, including his age, nationality, etc.
When the aircraft landed at Chuuk Island airport, it hit the lake, and then the local boat was involved in the rescue and the other passengers and crew were rescued.
On Friday, official reports indicated that seven people had been taken to hospital.
On Saturday, the airline indicated that six passengers were still receiving treatment at the hospital and that all passengers were in a stable state.
The causes of the accident and the sequence in which it took place are not clear.
Both the airline and the United States Navy indicated that the aircraft had departed from the runway and landed in the lagoon.
According to some witnesses, it was an aircraft that ran out of the runway.
According to the American passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane was flying very low.
Jaynes said, "It's nice to fly low."
Jaynes reported that, after the plane sank, the water inside the aircraft was already deep and the water reached the emergency exit.
He explained that the crew members were all frightened and shouted and suffered minor injuries to their heads.
According to the United States Navy, the sailors in the vicinity who were renovating the dock were involved in the rescue, driving the inflatable boat and bringing the water-fallers to the shore, after which the aircraft sank about 30 metres (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have lost their lives in a plane crash registered by Papua New Guinea National Airlines in the last two decades, but there are no passenger deaths recorded by New Guinea Airlines.
Analysts set out a schedule for women to be burned alive in the evening.
The prosecution resumed its trial on Saturday on charges of burning female suspects in Mississippi in 2014.
The United States Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett, an expert expert in intelligence analysis, gave several hours of testimony.
He explained to the jury how he used his cell phone records to put the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis together with the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
According to Clarion Ledger, Loret reported that he had received data on the location of several mobile phones, which showed that Tris was with him the night he died, contrary to what Tris had said before.
Tris stated that he was with his friend Michael Sanford and that the data showed that Tris' cell phone was in the same position as Chambers' phone, so the police went to Sanford to find out.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
The prosecutor asked Sanford whether Tris was right on the truck that he said he was in Sanford the night of the crime. Sanford said Tris was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction is that Tris claimed that they had known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of their death.
And cell phone records show that they've only known each other for a week.
Lorett stated that, at some point after the death of Chambers, Tris removed text messages, telephone calls and contact information from Chambers in his cell phone.
Hale stated that “he erased her from her life and wiped her clean”.
The closing arguments of the accused are scheduled to commence on Sunday.
The judge stated that it was hoped that the trial would be sent to the jury later that day.
High Breed: What's consciousness hip-hop?
The three hip-hop groups want to inject positive messages into their songs and change negative perceptions of hip-hop music.
The High Breed hip-hop group comes from Bristol. They say that hip-hop music, which initially sang political content in songs to solve social problems, is now out of this form.
They want to go back and make the mind hip-hop again popular.
The Fugees and Common have recently re-emerged in the UK with the performance of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
A black man again?
Dismissed after receiving a racist text message, a nanny in New York took the employer and his wife to court.
In New York, a nanny was fired after mistaking a text message sent to her mother, complaining that she was “a black man”, and in one case, the couple was brought to court and called it “clan discrimination”.
The couple refused to recognize racial discrimination and described the case as “extortion”.
In 2016, the mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, expressed disappointment after the child care provider Giselle Maurice had been found black before taking up his post.
"No, he's black again," in a text message to his husband, Vlaxman.
However, text messages were sent to Maurice by mistake on two occasions.
According to the New York Post, after becoming aware of the state of disillusionment, Mrs. Vlaxman was dismissed on the grounds that the outgoing African American nanny was not doing well and that she was waiting for a Filipino.
Mrs. Vlaxman paid Maurice a day's salary and then called for an ecstatic car to take her home.
Earlier, Morris was prosecuting the couple, asking them to pay compensation up to US$ 350 per day for the six-month temporary work promised to the employer ' s parents at the time of the initial employment, even though there was no contract to rely on.
On Friday, Maurice told the New York Post reporter, “I want to tell them that you will not” and added, “I know this is racial discrimination”.
The couple rebutted the complaint that they were not racially discriminated against, stating that the termination of Maurice ' s employment was a fully justified act and that they feared that they would not be able to believe her if offended.
“My wife had no intention of sending her some information.
She's not racist.
We didn't have racial discrimination, and the husband, Joel Plasco, told the New York Post reporter.
“But will you trust yourself to give the child to someone you've offended, even by accident?
You just had a baby?
Come on, probably nobody."
Plasco referred to the case as “extortion”, indicating that her wife had given birth two months ago and was currently “in a very difficult situation”.
"Are you going to hire someone like that?
That's not wise, this investment banker adds.
Although the case is still pending, the Court of Public Opinion has quickly begun to denounce the couple ' s conduct and logic in the social media.
According to the latest letter, the publisher of the Paddington Bear fears that the reader will not accept a talking bear.
In a letter from Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the readers, it was revealed: “Before the book was published, it was hard to imagine in person how the first reader would feel.
Now the Paddington bear has made a great success. It's really funny."
Speaking of her father, she said that she had been a photographer at the BBC, that she had been inspired by a toy bear to write this child's book, that he had always been hopeful about his repeatedly rejected work, adding that her father had died last year, and that this book was published on the 60th anniversary of its publication.
Speaking of the Paddington bear, she said that it was “a very important member of our family” and that her father was proud of his ultimate success.
"Father is a very quiet man, never bragging himself," she said.
“But because the Paddington bears were too real for him, just as your children did: you were proud of them, even though they didn't belong to you.
I think that's how he sees Paddington Bear's success.
Although it was the result of his creativity and imagination, he always attributed success to the Paddington bear itself.
My daughter is dying. I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was urgently taken to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors ultimately failed to restore her life.
“Nad called as usual, said it was bad, and she didn't think it would happen”, said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying my daughter had a few minutes left and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
I did.
I said, "Dear Jessie, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll always be with you.
The heart-maintenance medication that was administered to her by the doctor gradually lapsed.
She died early, and it's over.
Knowing that all this has happened, I can only sit there and wait.
I can't growl, scream or cry because my family and friends are around me.
I must remain calm."
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was eventually immersed in the pain of her widow, boarded the plane with other passengers and seemed calmly to forget the ordeal she was going through.
"Nobody can see it," she said.
“I bow my head and my tears flow downward.
I know it's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I had a strong sympathy for Nad.
He needs my understanding and love.
I know how much he loves his daughter."
Sad women post cards to persuade those who have light thoughts to change their minds.
The two women who lost their loved ones tried to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on the Welsh Bridge with incentive text and telephone numbers to facilitate support for those in need.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old, depressed and killed herself when she was 18.
“I don't want another parent to experience the pain I suffer every day”, she said.
Mrs. Davis lives in Lydney's home, 45 this year, and her son is a promising cook with an impenetrable smile on her face.
“We all know he's a laugher.
People always say that his smile makes everyone happy.”
However, he gave up his job and soon died, and went to “a particularly dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler's brother was just 11 years old, and he discovered that Tyler had ended his life.
Davis said, “I've been worried that his suicide will have a side effect.”
So Davis made a card, "I want people to know that someone is willing to help you and listen to you, even if we're friends.
Don't be silent. You need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys was a friend of Mrs. Davies's for many years, and shortly after her mother's death, her husband had left herself, and now it has been 15 years.
She introduced it, “He never told us that he felt depressed or depressed or anything.
Just a few days before Christmas, we noticed that he was in a bad mood.
On Christmas Day, the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact or anything, and his emotions had fallen to the bottom.”
She said that the death of her husband had inflicted enormous trauma on them, but that they had to continue to live: “When he died, the sky had collapsed in his family.
We all mourn.
But we still have to live and fight."

FBI investigation, Brett Kavanaugh.
“I think if we can really get what he wants -- an investigation that is limited in time and scope -- then maybe we can get back a little bit of unity.” Frank said on Saturday that he added that he feared that the Commission would take the opportunity to “start breaking” deep-seated party deadlocks.
Why does Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is entirely due to timing.
With only five weeks left to the mid-term elections on November 6, their efforts to try to put forward candidates for the United States Supreme Court would be seriously undermined if, as we expected, the Republicans performed poorly.
George W. Bush kept calling the senators, trying to lobby them to support Cavanaugh, because Cavanaugh worked for the Bush administration at the White House and met his wife, Bush's private secretary Ashley, through Bush.
What happens when the FBI reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republican and 49 Democratic seats.
It is not clear whether Cavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate to break the tie with Vice-President Mike Pence, thereby confirming the nomination of a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Democratic People's Republic of Korea defections under Kim Jong-un's regime “declining”
According to a Korean legislator, since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, the number of Koreans who defected to Korea has declined.
Park Byyong-seug quoted data from the Ministry of National Unity of Korea that a total of 1,127 Koreans defected to Korea last year, compared to a total of 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that a key reason for the decrease in the number of defectors was the strengthening of border controls between the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea and China and the increase in fees charged by human smuggling groups.
The DPRK did not make public comments.
The vast majority of Koreans who defected to South Korea were eventually able to acquire Korean citizenship.
Korea indicated that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 Koreans have illegally crossed the border to South Korea.
Most defectors fled to North Korea via China, as the country has the longest border with China and is easier to cross than the heavily defended demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two countries.
China considered defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and therefore often forcibly repatriated them.
Relations between the DPRK and the Republic of Korea have improved significantly in recent months, although technically they are still in a state of war.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to initiate a dialogue on the stalled denuclearization negotiations.
The improvement in relations between the two countries benefited from the historic meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, held in Singapore in June, during which both sides generally agreed to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea, Mr. Lee Yong Ho, complained that no progress had been made since the end of the meeting, as the United States was still imposing sanctions.
“If the United States is not trustworthy, then we will not be able to ensure that our national security is guaranteed, and therefore we will never be able to unilaterally disarm nuclear weapons”, as Lee Yong-ho described in his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi claims that Brett Kavanaugh is “hysteria” and is not suitable for the position of a Supreme Court judge.
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the minority party in the House of Representatives, stated that the nominee of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was “hysteria” and was not fit to serve as a Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi was interviewed on Saturday at the Texas Forum (Texas Tribune Festival) in Austin, Texas.
“I can't help but think that if a woman behaves like this, they'll use 'hysteria' to describe it,” said Pelosi, in response to the testimony given by Cavanaugh in the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh has lost control of the charges brought against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who claims that he did not sexually abuse him when he was young.
In his opening statement, Cavanaugh lost consciousness and, on several occasions, almost shouted and even couldn't speak when discussing his family and high school life.
He also unequivocally condemned the Partido Democrático who had participated in the meeting, stating that the allegation had been the result of an “eccentric attack on the person” organized by the Liberal Party, which was angry at the defeat of Hilary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Perosi claims that she believes that the testimony of Cavanaugh attests to his inability to qualify for the Supreme Court because it shows that he was biased against the Democrats.
She said, “I think that his testimony and his attitude towards Clinton and the Democrats suggest that he is not qualified enough”.
When asked whether Cavanaugh would be impeached if he was finally found guilty and if the Democratic Party obtained a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, Perosi objected.
Pelosi said, “Well, if what he said to Congress or the FBI is not true, then he is not only unfit to serve in the Supreme Court, but also not in the court that he is now in office”.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge at the DC Circuit Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he feared that Cavanaugh might take a negative decision on the “Affordable Care Act” or “Roe v. Wade” because he was a conservative magistrate.
In confirming the hearing, Cavanaugh avoided the question whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“Now, it is not appropriate for a hysteria and prejudiced person to come to the Court, and I would like us to say, ‘Isn't that good?’”, said Pelosi.
Women need to exercise their power.
It was a slanderous act of justice, with months and even years of rage spreading and she would not be able to escape unless she cried out.
Forty-five years later, Steinem said to me, "We cry when we're angry."
"I think it's normal. What do you think?"
She went on to say, “A lady has given me great help, and she is the head of a company, and she says she cries when she's angry, but she finds the trick, which is that when she starts crying, she talks to her interlocutors”, and you will know that I'm upset because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she goes on to.
I think it's amazing."
We express our anger with tears in part because we fundamentally misunderstand them.
One of the most impressive things was that in one of my early years ' work, which was a male-dominated company, once I cried out of indescribable anger, and then I was caught in the back by an old woman (a cold manager who I had been afraid of for her) and she dragged me into the staircase.
She warned me that “Never let them see you cry”.
“They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad and happy because they beat you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a female member of the National Assembly of the Colorado Democratic Party, joined Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart withdrew from the campaign for involvement in an affair on board a ship called “Monkey Business Dinner Boat”, Schröder was frustrated that he should personally practice the idea of running for the presidency.
"It wasn't a deliberate decision," 30 years later, she laughed and said to me,
“There were already seven other candidates standing for election, and they were less likely to need another candidate.
Some call it "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since Schroeder was lagging behind in raising funds since she was in the late stages of the campaign, she vowed not to stand for election unless $2 million was raised.
There is no doubt that this is a battle to be defeated.
She found that some supporters had donated $1,000 to male campaigners, but only $250 to her.
"Do they think I need a discount?" Schroeder suspects.
When she made an announcement that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was beset by complex emotions - gratitude to her supporters; disappointment at the system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates; and anger at gender discrimination - she began to choke.
Schroeder recalled the media reaction to her and said, “You should think I'm having a breakdown”.
"You might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they carve on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
What benefits will the Chinese-American trade war bring to Beijing?
Professionals have said that the fire from the United States-China trade war is intense and that, despite the fact that the war has only just begun, the differences between the two countries may in the long run be more favourable for Beijing.
Early this year, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, warned for the first time that taxes would be imposed on China ' s major export products, including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
This week, there has been a serious escalation in the trade war, with new tariffs taxing half of China ' s imports into the United States, affecting goods valued at $200 billion (Euro150 billion).
In each case, the Beijing side retaliated in the same way, most recently increasing tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion by 5 to 10 per cent.
China has committed itself to fighting the United States to the end, and the second largest economy in the world will never retreat in the short term.
To allow Washington to make concessions means that their demands need to be met, but an open submission to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, professionals have said that if the Beijing side were to play this hand, the pressure of the United States trade war could reduce the interdependence of the two economies and generate long-term positive support for China.
A fellow researcher in the Asian field, Abigail Grace, from the think tank Center for New American Security, said, “If there is a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing, it could lead to a two-country trigger.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs said Syria was “ready” to welcome the refugees back.
Syria stated that it was ready to repatriate refugees voluntarily and appealed to all sectors to help them rebuild their homes, which had suffered more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated at the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in Syria were improving.
“As a result of the progress made in the fight against terrorism, it is now more stable and safer on the ground”, he said.
The Syrian Government will continue to repair the areas destroyed by the terrorists and bring them back to normal.
Currently, all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees are in place. Refugees who have fled are forced to leave their homes because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures against their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people remaining in Syria are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance from other countries to rebuild its devastated homes.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance in support of countries in which the insurgency was operating.
The Europeans won the Paris Ryder Cup.
In the 2018 Le Golf National, outside Paris, the European team defeated the American team with 16.5 to 10.5.
The United States has now lost six consecutive profits on European soil and has not won the Leed Cup in Europe since 1993.
The Danish team leader, Thomas Bjorn, was the first to win the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States, and Europe regained the title.
Phil Mickelson, the American football star, struggled in most of the games, and he gave up directly to Francesco Molinari after he hit the third ball in the 16th hole.
The Italian golfer Molinari was one of the four players who scored 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979 in its current form.
The American player Jordan Spieth was defeated by the lowest European player in Denmark, Thorbjorn Olesen, by five to four.
The world's number one player, Dustin Johnson, with 2 to 1 behind England's Ian Poulter, is expected to participate in his last round of the Ryder Cup.
Sergio García of Spain, who participated in the eight Leed cups, was an old general who was the most successful European in history, with 25.5 points.
“I don't usually cry, but I really can't help it today.
This year has been too hard.
Thank you so much for choosing me, believe me.
I'm glad to have the trophies back.
This is the honor of our entire team, and I am glad to be able to do my part” García's emotional introduction after winning the European race.
He passed the torch on to his compatriot, John Ram, who beat the American Tiger Woods with his two-to-one score in Sunday's solo game.
"I've been watching Tiger Woods since I was a kid, and I'm proud to beat him." Ram, 23 years old, said.
Woods lost four competitions in France, with 13-21-3 performances, the lowest ever in the Leeds Cup.
It's a bit strange for the greatest player in history, because he won 14 major competitions after Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality balls throughout the game, the United States team was less optimistic throughout the week.
Captain Jim Furyk, after his team's disappointment, said, "I'm proud of you, and they're all fighting.
For some time this morning, we have put a lot of pressure on Europe.
We're done.
Tribute to Thomas.
He's pretty good as a captain.
12 players were very good.
We'll regroup, I'll join the United States PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love this 12 people, and I'm honored to be their captain.
They must be saluted.
We've been defeated.”
Red tide update: reduced red tide density in Pineras County (Pinellas), Manatee County and Sarasota County
The most recent report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) shows a general decline in red-tide density in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, there are more places in Pineras County (Pinellas), Manatee County, Sarasota, Charlotte County and Collier County.
From the northern part of Pineras County to the southern part of Lee County, the coastline stretching about 130 miles (210 kilometres) is a phenomenon of red dynasty.
Within 10 miles (16 km) of the coast of Hillsborough County, the scattered phenomenon of red tide is visible, a decrease in size compared to last week.
Pasco County also has a red tide.
Over the past week, reports indicate that the density of the red tide: medium in Pineras County or along the coast, low and high on the coast of Hillsboro County, low to high in Manati County, low to medium in Sarasota County or along the coast.
Reports from Pineras, Manati, Sarasota, Lei and Collier districts indicate that respiratory irritation still exists.
In the past week, north-west Florida reported no respiratory irritation.

According to the British media, the United States Vice-Minister of Naval Operations, General William Moran, said that the United States continued to focus on the Asia-Pacific region — the Pentagon — to extend the area to include the Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific — even as the United States Navy was re-energized to deal with increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic.
According to the United Kingdom ' s Jane ' s Defense Weekly website, on 24 September, the United States listed Russia and China as strategic competitors in its new defence strategy, which was announced at the beginning of the year.
Since then, the United States Navy has resumed its second fleet in order to confront Russian activities more directly.
Reports suggest that these moves raise some questions and concerns among allies and analysts who fear that the United States Navy may be far away from the “Asia-Pacific rebalancing” strategy that marks the Obama administration.
However, General Moran said that the focus of the United States Navy remained the Western Pacific Ocean.
On 24 January 2018, at a round-table discussion entitled “Addressing the challenges of the high seas”, hosted by the National Asian Research Office in Washington, D.C., he said: “There has been no major change for us.”
Milan said, “The focus remains rebalancing, shifting focus or whatever you want to describe it.”
He acknowledged, however, that the United States was close to Europe.
He said, “We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do.”
Although Moran states that the overall policy regarding Russia falls within the purview of the United States Secretary of Defense, he warns that “Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has shown that if we clash with them, they will be very tough.”
Admiral Moran said that, as part of the renewed United States campaign against Russia, China and other competitors, the United States Navy was dynamically deploying its forces into a “new mode of operation”, which would help to surprise opponents as to where American carriers or other assets would be deployed at any given time or place.
He said, "We, the Navy and the Marines, support it -- -- the concept of unpredictability of operations, not to appear in the same place again and again, almost like a hairline -- -- that's how we do it."
It was reported that this new approach was first attempted by the Harry Truman carrier combat group, whose early deployment included working visits to ports and patrolling areas that were usually only passing through.
Moran said that the United States Navy was currently working to ensure that allies were aware that these warships would continue to patrol the traditional areas and were also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment procedures.
Lieutenant General Michael Nunan, Commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also addressed the event, stating that the Australian army could work seamlessly with United States carriers.
He said that the situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy planned to procure an additional nine frigates equipped with the Zeus Shield operational system.
A few airlines have raised or restored fuel surcharges since October 5.
Yesterday, airlines such as Xiang Poon Air and Okai Air announced that, as of 5 October 2018 (the date of the tickets), each passenger would be charged a fuel surcharge of $20 per passenger on the domestic route below 800 km, and a fuel surcharge of $30 per passenger on the more than 800 km route.
The company Xiang Poon Air, Okai Aviation and others announced that, starting at 0 o'clock on 5 October 2018 (the date of the ticket), the rate for surcharges for fuel on domestic routes below 800 km was raised from $10 per person to $20 per person, with surcharges for fuel on domestic routes over 800 km
Children and members of the military/police have been disabled for 10 yuan per person; infants continue to be exempted.
According to the person in charge of the airfares, the airline had indicated in the notification that the fuel surcharge was charged on the date of the original ticket and that the fuel surcharge was not refunded when the tickets were exchanged.
This means that domestic airline tickets issued prior to 5 October will not be subject to the new fuel surcharge if they are to be changed after 5 October.
Since 5 June 2018, a number of airlines, such as Air State, East China, Naval Navigation, Shanghai Aviation, Spring and Fall Aviation, Shenzhen Aviation, Western Aviation and Okai Aviation, have resumed charging fuel surcharges on domestic routes, which have been cancelled for three years, to the standard of $10 per person.
This time, the first increases in fuel surcharges were announced by Xiang Poon Aviation and Okai Aviation, and as far as journalists are concerned, no information has been received from the four major airlines in the country to follow up on the adjustments.
It is also understood that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department provides that airlines will be free to decide whether to charge a surcharge for fuel in November.
At the earliest, on 27 September, it was announced that the fuel surcharge would be recharged as of 2 November.
According to the Thai-Thai air website, all air tickets issued or reissued on or after 2 November will include fuel surcharges, long-distance flights to Hong Kong and the South-West Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, and to Africa, with fuel surcharges of 652
Costs apply to all types of tickets, are based on each segment and include quotations for air tickets from all direct distribution channels in Thailand.

On Friday, Ito Ito, Japan, recognized $1.3 billion in impairment losses on investment in China ' s Sino-Kin shares, and its largest business investment transaction was written off because of the effects of trade restrictions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man walked through the HQ.
According to Maru Hong, the United States grain sector, under the banner of the trade war, has suspended its financial transactions in agriculture.
Earlier, some Japanese manufacturers of heavy equipment, telecommunications companies, etc., had issued warnings about the impact of trade friction between the United States and China, and now these Japanese traders have joined the ranks.
The United States and China imposed customs duties on each other ' s hundreds of billions of dollars of commodities, and United States President Trump threatened to extend the tax to more than $500 billion in total Chinese-American merchandise if the dispute could not be resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Director of Commercial Finance of Ito, said that the impact of the trade dispute on the Chinese economy might be even greater next year.
Ito Trung and the Thai Bing Group invested $10 billion in Nakashin in 2015 to gain 20 per cent of their equity.
Hachimura alleges that Ito ' s shareholding stock was awarded a loss of 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) because it was assumed that the Chinese share price would not return in the near future.
Itokawa Commercial maintained a projection of profits for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2019 at 500 billion yen.
In July, China imposed a 25 per cent import tariff on soybeans from the United States to counter China's trade friction initiatives.
"Our grain business has been hit by trade friction between the US and China," says Maru Hung Finance Minister Yao Hiro.
He stated that he had stopped financial transactions in his own account since September.
In his statement on Friday, Gaeong spokesman Pat Burke stated that the company’s move was “in accordance with internal policy constraints and due to a lack of market opportunities”.
He also indicated that the suspension of financial transactions would not lead to a reduction in employment.
The estimated annual profitability of the two hundred and thirty billion yen remains unchanged and is supported by pulp and paper and power generation operations.
Friends Business announced a 16% increase in profits between April and September, emphasizing that “trade problems between the United States and China have led to uncertain prospects.”
On Friday, Mitsubishi Commercial moved the annual profit forecast up to record levels owing to increased coal coke production and higher prices for commodities such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Commercial has also announced a new business plan to increase the profitability of the fiscal year up to 31 March 2022 from the 640 billion yen estimated this year to 900 billion yen ($7.98 billion).
On November 5th, China-News Network reported that the mid-term election poll in the United States is in the countdown.
On 4 November, President Trump and his Democratic rivals actively “circumstanced” to their core constituents.
Both parties stated that voter turnout would be the key to shaping the election.
It was reported that in the 48 hours prior to the popular vote in the United States, Trump was busy with the Republican campaign, while former President Obama went to Indiana to stand for the impending Democratic Federal Senate candidate, Joe Donnelly, and shouted out the vote to the crowd.
On 4 November, Trump went to Megang, Georgia, to stand for Republican governorship candidate Brian Kemp, and said, “Tuesday you must be at the polling station, you must vote.”
“The contrast between this election cannot be made clearer.”
Voter political enthusiasm has risen to a rare peak, and early voting in some states has gone far beyond normal.
Successive Presidents of the United States faced the first midterm elections, and the number of parliamentary seats in his party tended to decrease.
According to a new poll published by the Washington Post and the American Broadcasting Corporation News Network (ABC News) on 4 September, while the Democratic Party's federal House of Representatives continues to have an advantage, Republicans can benefit from economic assessment and from Trump's strict interest in border security.
According to the polls, registered voters prefer the Democratic House of Representatives to Republicans, with a ratio of 50 per cent to 43 per cent, but there is still a decline from the 14 percentage points ahead in August.
Another poll by the National Broadcasting Corporation of the United States (NBC) and the Wall Street Journal also shows that Democrats still outnumber Republicans by 7 percentage points.
It is known that Obama, on the occasion of Senator Donnelly's campaign, said to the public: “When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, they will have bad consequences.
Democracy cannot work when people can only lie to themselves."
“The only way to stop these Republicans now is you and your vote.”
The Democratic Party faces the most difficult elections in the Senate for decades, and the Republican Party now holds more than half of the 51 seats.
However, the House of Representatives was more favourable, and the Democratic Party needed to win 23 more seats to take control of the House of Representatives, which had 435 seats.
According to the analysts of FiveThirtyEight.com, the Democratic Party’s chances of winning the House of Representatives are as high as 85%.

In the light of the current wave of “public entrepreneurship, innovation for all” on November 5th, People's Network Beijing, more and more science and technology companies are focusing on patent R & D and its associated protection, digging deep into the potential value of patents and gaining market dominance.
Similarly, there are a number of technology enterprises that have experienced significant abuses in the areas of proprietary technology licensing and the use of patented technology.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, Ho Changhong and Rabin from Guangdong Province, developer of the APP, Beijing Little Orange Technology Ltd. (hereinafter " Little Orange Technology " ), operator drop-and-drop Technology Ltd. (hereinafter " drop-and-drop " ) on the grounds of patent infringement
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately cease the manufacture, sale, promise and use of the plaintiff ' s patent.
On October 30, 2018, the Chinese Network of Judicial Documents published “Civil decisions of first instance in disputes over patent infringement of inventions, such as Tan Wei, Ho Changhong and Beijing Little Orange Technology Ltd.”, revealing the details of some of the cases in which APP was prosecuted for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs argued that the patent owner and inventor of the “mobile terminal-based carpooling services system and methods” patent, and that the entire operation of the “roll-by-roll” APP application corresponded to the technical programme of patent protection in question, constituting a patent infringement.
However, at the time of the Court's decision, OrangeTech concluded that the Guangdong Pacific was not a proper defendant, that it had provided on the Internet only free downloads of the APP “drop-outs” involved, that the patent method in question had not been applied, that there was no direct or indirect violation and that it should not be classified as the defendant in the present case.
Secondly, the violations in this case were not committed in Guangdong.
In accordance with the law, the infringement of the patent in question was the place where the patent method was applied in its entirety, and the jurisdiction of the court was challenged, requesting that the case be referred to the court of the defendant ' s domicile, the Beijing Court of Intellectual Property.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, had supplied on its web platform an APP product charged with tort, and that it was not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, as the defendant.
The defendant, Guangdong Pacific, also resides in Guangzhou City and is under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant, Orange Technology, argued that the case should be referred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, on insufficient grounds, dismissing the defendant, Orange Technology Ltd. ' s objection to the jurisdiction of the case and bearing the costs of the jurisdiction challenge.
Other proceedings in the case have not yet been made public, and journalists will follow closely the details of the patent infringement case.
Visit to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research: significant results of scientific and technical cooperation in Australia
“China’s science and technology has grown rapidly over the past decades, and the two countries of Australia and China, working together in the field of science, can achieve fruitful results.”
Larry Marshall, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research, in a recent interview with a Chinese News Agency journalist in Beijing, stated that cooperation in the field of science and technology in Australia has shown dynamism from climate change to SkyEye cooperation.
As the largest national scientific research agency in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has produced numerous innovative research findings of world interest in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
“This is a lasting friendship, a friendship that embraces trust in partners and a long tradition of cooperation.” Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-metre spherical radio telescope, China SkyEye, installed the first international 19-beam L-band receiver.
The 19-beam feed receiver, which is currently the most advanced in the world, has been developed jointly by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall indicated that the successful development of the receivers was based on the accumulation of technology by CSIRO over the years and that the speed of the FEST cruises would increase by five to six times as soon as it became operational, and that more scientific observation objectives would be expanded.
"This is a contribution of CSIRO to FAST."
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO is working closely with Chinese scientific institutions in the construction of square kilometres array radio telescopes, in the development of new fuel technologies and in the reduction of energy savings.
“In the past, scientific research has tended to focus on hundreds of years later, and now more scientific research is needed to solve the problems that lie ahead.”
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the area of scientific development, while both countries face a range of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather events are frequent worldwide, droughts and floods have led to reduced food production and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, problems such as population explosion, ageing and chronic diseases are also serious challenges.
“The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused primarily on solving these immediate difficulties.”
Marshall explained that the International Centre for the Study of the Southern Hemisphere, established by CSIRO in cooperation with the Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, focused on observing the El Niño phenomenon and the La Niña phenomenon, studying their relationship to extreme weather events and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather events; CSIRO and China School of Science and Technology developed by CSIRO together
“In the current environment, where science, technology and innovation are difficult to accomplish on their own, very costly, and the number of issues to be addressed, cooperation is particularly important today.”
Marshall stated that the closer the cooperation, the greater the likelihood of ground-breaking progress, was also important in the context of the “one-way” cooperation between Australia and China.
“Strengthening bilateral cooperation, mainly in science and technology, for us.”
For example, Marshall, CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide, and many countries hope to find a method of pure gold that is less polluting to the environment because of the environmental hazards of traditional cyanide gold purification.
“We are willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results of our participation in the ‘way-by-way’ cooperation.”
On 29th, in the city of Urumqi, Xinjiang, where Bony Chicken Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Collaboration was held, guests were able to appreciate the development of the Bony and also to appreciate the local cuisine and the weight of the local historical culture.
During the first month of the event, a series of tourism promotions were carried out in eight cities along the Silk Roads of Tian Shui, Cool, Lanzhou, Silverkawa, Siening, Zhang Jing, Hami and others.
The mayor of the town of Bao-Chung in Shanxi Province introduced Huixin, who has a long history and a strong industrial base, as the second-largest city in Shaanxi Province and the sub-centre of the Guan Tian-Tian economic zone and the city complex of Guan-Puan, as well as an important node along the “One Way” initiative.
In recent years, the city has continued to upgrade its industrial clusters, logistics hubs, integrated services, open highlands and human cohesion to accelerate catch-up and high-quality development.
At the meeting, the Pony City Tourism Development Council and the Urumqi Tourism Authority signed two agreements on strategic cooperation in tourism.
At the same time, a number of Xinjiang travel agencies have signed agreements for cooperation in tourism with the Bo-Yuan River tourist area, the Famen Temple Buddhist cultural site, the Tai White Mountain tourist area and the Guan Shan savannah site.
Chenxun, Chief of the Market Promotion Section of the BMW, said: “The Great American Xinjiang, where some tourist resources are complementary to the BMW, we travel all the way to Xinjiang, where we introduce human chickens, fine chickens, natural wind, etc., to more than 500.
The event focused on tourism resources, tourism projects, tourism routes, etc., and provided comprehensive publicity on the whole of the tourism industry through the broadcast of tourism promotional films, the promotion of cultural tourism resources and projects, the organization of exhibitions of tourism photography, the production of promotional brochures, the distribution of promotional materials and the exchange of peer-to-peer tourism cooperation.
“In this event, various departments in the city, districts and development districts actively engaged in discussions and coordinated the implementation of a large number of good projects and major projects.
To date, 41 contracted projects have been implemented, involving a total of 26.43 billion yuan. "
In recent years, the Pony has continued to upgrade industrial clusters, logistics hubs, integrated services, open highlands, human cohesion, and accelerated catch-up around the goal of building internationalized cities along the “one-way” initiative, equipping manufacturing cities, historical and cultural names, and beautiful and happy cities with decent housing.
In 2017, total regional production amounted to RMB 218 billion, an increase of 8.7 per cent.
More than 20 national-level honours were awarded to civilized cities throughout the country, the National Ecoforestry City and the China Human Settlements Environment Award.
The Urumqi City Council Standing Committee and Deputy Mayor Yan Namin introduced Urumqi's special geographical advantage as a major town on the Silk Road in New North Province, connecting Tianshan North and South, communicating between Xinjiang and the Mainland, and connecting China with Central Asia, West Asia and South Asia.
The event, which focused on the manufacturing of equipment, logistics and commerce, and the tourism industry, was characterized by a great deal of complicity in the development of good opportunities and a great deal of mutual cooperation.
During the discussion, local customers from Xinjiang signed six projects for a total amount of RMB 3.250 billion with the Pony Districts.
On that day, foreign guests, such as representatives of the Kyrgyz visa service in Urumqi, the Russian neo-Siberian Law Company Limited, the Tajik Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Urumqi and the Russian Chamber of Commerce of Tatarstan, attended the discussion.
Some 500 members of the Urumqi Municipal Bureau of Recruitment, Commerce, Agriculture, Tourism, etc. and of enterprises and the media participated in the discussion.
The revitalization of the north-east is a matter of national development.
Industrial enterprises in the north-east are more important and better based, and in the north-east, catching innovation is about catching up and finding the future.
Will it be possible to re-energize the old industrial base, free it and hold the Secretary-General's heart?
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea, Lee Yong Ho, stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued imposition of sanctions was deepening North Korea ' s mistrust of the United States and that it was unlikely that the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea would unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
According to Lee Yong Ho at the United Nations General Assembly, the DPRK has adopted a “very friendly approach” over the past year, including the cessation of missile and nuclear tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and a commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we didn't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
“There is no confidence in our national security if we do not trust the United States, in which case we cannot give up weapons unilaterally.”
Although Lee Yong-ho echoed North Korea's complaints about the United States' opposition to “phased” denuclearization, his statement was of great significance because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization altogether, as it had done in the past.
Lee Yong-ho referred to Kim Jong-un and Trump's joint statement of 12 June, when Kim Jong-un agreed to work towards “denuclearizing the Korean peninsula” and Trump pledged to protect North Korea's security.
The Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has stated that the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States also refused to relax its demand for international sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearizing first’ and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its objectives in a high-pressure manner, even refusing to issue the ‘Declaration on the End of War’,” Lee Yong-ho.
“The idea that sanctions can make us beg for forgiveness on our knees is that those who do not understand us are dreaming.
But the problem is that this continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Lee Yong-ho made no mention of the second Special Council plan referred to by the President of the United States earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he highlighted the three meetings between Kim Jong-un and Korean President Wang during the last five months, saying: “If the other side of denuclearization is Korea, not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not become so frozen.”
China announced a reduction in import duties for 1,585 tax purposes as of 1 November 2018.
Since the beginning of the year, China has taken successive initiatives to reduce import tariffs.
On 1 May of this year, there was a general tax reduction on medicines, with a total of 28 tariff items, including all generic and carcinogen anti-cancer drugs, as well as a total of 28 tax items, such as those containing effectively imported Chinese medicines, adjusted to zero.
At the same time, there has been a significant reduction in the value-added tax on the production and import of anti-cancer medicines.
On 1 July, there was a tax deduction for 218 tax purposes on automobiles and their parts and components.
As a result of the tax reduction, China ' s whole-car rate is below the average in developing countries and is in line with the real situation in the Chinese automobile industry.
This tax reduction will drive industrial restructuring and optimal resource allocation, accelerate success and underachievement, improve the quality of products and services, and are expected to contribute to some extent to the adjustment of automobile prices and increase the benefits to consumers.
On 1 July, there was a daily tax reduction on consumer goods for 1,449 tax purposes.
Tax deductions on consumer goods are closely linked to the needs of the people for a better life.
This tax reduction is not only large but also substantial, with an average of 56 per cent.
Tax cuts in consumer goods are directly benefiting consumers and contributing to the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On 1 November, a tax reduction will be imposed on industrial items such as mechanical and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials for 1585 tax purposes.
Appropriately reducing tariffs on imports of much-needed industrial goods in some parts of the country can attract more foreign investment, contribute to more efficient domestic supply and industrial upgrading, while helping enterprises to allocate resources on a global scale and reduce production costs, as well as reducing domestic pressure on the environment.
The relevant head of the Office of the Customs and Excise Commission of the State Council of China stated that the four above-mentioned autonomous tax reductions, as well as the third step, implemented on 1 July this year as a result of negotiations to expand the scope of the information technology agreement, would reduce China ' s total tariff level from 9.8 per cent in the previous year to 7.5 per cent.
The overall adjusted tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU and is lower than that of most developing countries and is at a moderate low level, largely in line with China ' s developing country status and stage of development.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that the overall level of tariffs, as one of the key indicators of China ' s openness in the area of trade in goods, should be adapted to the stage of China ' s economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China ' s trade in goods is the largest in the world and already has an open economic base for further expansion, but the quality and efficiency of trade development are not as good as that of developed economies, and therefore the overall level of tariffs should be reduced as appropriate.
Tariffs are a means of compliance protection, and they should be commensurate with industrial competitiveness, encourage benign competition, and overprotect against industrial development and quality improvement.
Tariff rate adjustments need to be balanced between production needs and consumption needs.
The focus is on reducing the tax rates on commodities that contribute to the upgrading of the industrial transformation, increasing the import of niche products where the needs of the population are more concentrated, increasing the sense of business and public access and meeting the upgrading needs of industrial and consumer structures.
Tax cuts need to balance fiscal revenues with the affordability of industrial development.
The choice of specific tax-reducing commodities and tax-reducing margins should be based on the harmonization of domestic and foreign markets, both upstream and downstream, and production and consumption, in order to maintain the momentum of China ' s steady and moderate economic growth.
The Officer-in-Charge stressed that this year marks the fortieth anniversary of the reform and opening of the country, and that China has taken the initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs in accordance with the major measures that China needs to achieve its own high-quality development. This is conducive to the integrated use of both international and foreign resources, promoting the improvement of the quality of the domestic supply system and meeting the needs of the population in terms of rising consumption.
These actions and initiatives demonstrate China ' s firm commitment to pursuing a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, its firm support for economic globalization, its commitment to the principles of free trade and the multilateral trading system, with the WTO as its core, and its continued efforts to draw momentum from openness to the world and to make its development more beneficial to the world.
The President of Serbia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo.
It quoted information from the Office of the President of Serbia that President Vučić of Serbia had ordered the maximum operational readiness of the country ' s armed forces in view of the occupation by the Kosovo Special Forces of the access to the water storage lake at the Gazivoda hydroelectric power station in northern Kosovo, which was controlled by Belgrade.
On 29 September, the Minister of Defence of Serbia, Wulin, declared that the Serbian army was in full operational readiness.
It was stressed that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as the orders issued by Vucic remained in force, and that the Army would respond regardless of the course of events.
According to TAS, on 29 September, Vucic stated in an interview that he had briefed the parties, including the United States and the European Union, on the current situation and would travel to Moscow on 2 October to meet with Russian President Putin and seek Putin ' s support on Kosovo.
When asked whether Serbia needed Russian military support like Syria, Vucic replied in the negative: “I do not want a major military conflict on our soil.”
Vucić also stated that the full operational readiness of the RSLA was intended to serve as a deterrent to prevent a conflict, but it was also a clear warning that no violence would be tolerated in Kosovo.
The increased operational readiness of the RSLA is linked to two major Kosovo-based initiatives.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days the ethnic Albanians in the northern part of Kosovo are engaged in mass arrests of Serbs who have been living there for generations and who have not violated any law.
Vucić claims that, since the beating and detention of Marko Juridge, head of the Serbian Government's office in Kosovo and Metohija, on 26 March this year, the Albanian community has escalated the situation in the region, carrying out inhuman arrests and expulsions of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the previously self-proclaimed ROSU Special Forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, armed police and snipers, occupied positions near the water storage lake at the Gazivoda hydroelectric station, entered the ecological and sports centre near the dam in the northern part of Kosovo and blocked all nearby roads, which were originally from the Serbian side
Vucić stated that this military adventure in Kosovo had been instigated by Western countries and that the actions of the Kosovo army had not been notified to the Serbian side in advance, in violation of chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, as well as Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the military-technical agreement between Serbia and Montenegro.
Vucic has already spoken to NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg, criticizing the hypocritical statements of Western countries on the question of Kosovo.
The root cause of the current conflict remains the centuries-old historical feud between the two communities in Kosovo.
With regard to Kosovo's attribution, the Serbian and Albanian communities differ.
Serbia views Kosovo as a national birthplace and a cradle of culture, as it established its most powerful State here in the 12th century, while ethnic Albanians moved in massively only after the Ottoman Empire invasion and the defeat of the Serbian army in the north.
The Albanians, for their part, maintained that the original tribe of Ilya, which lived in Kosovo in the fourth and fifth centuries B.C., was the ancestors of the Albanians and that Kosovo had been an Albanian territory since time immemorial.
Subjective political divisions have led to violent clashes among different ethnic, religious and cultural groups and have created a violent confrontation between the Serb and Albanian communities in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
In the wake of the First World War, a large number of ethnic Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, with a relative increase in the proportion of Serbs, who, in the view of the Serbs, “only take back their own land”, were perceived by the ethnic Albanians as plundered by “Greater Serbianism” and fuelled by bi-communal contradictions.
Kosovo became a “powder bucket” in the Balkans.
In 1999, an armed conflict between the Albanian separatists of the KLA and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro by NATO forces and the outbreak of the war in Kosovo.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its secession from Serbia.
Since then, despite reports that Serbia will normalize its relations with Kosovo and sign global and legally binding agreements, agreements that have been held hostage to various forces, such as the United States and the Russian Federation, have not been concluded owing to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints.
And just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he was advocating the separation of Serbs from Albanians in Kosovo and that he was once again open to contradictions between the two communities.
Electricity is still out of order.
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early hours of 30 September, a strong earthquake and tsunami in Dungara district, Central Sulawesi Province, in the country, resulted in 420 deaths.
According to the head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, Wilem Rampangilei, this figure is only a preliminary estimate of the city of Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi, about 80 km from the epicentre of the earthquake, owing to the lack of large search and rescue machines and the destruction of many hotels, shops, warehouses, etc. in the city as a result of the collapse of the earthquake.
On 29 September 2018, local time, in Balo, Indonesia, a bridge damaged by an earthquake and tsunami collapsed in several sections.
As a result of the severe damage to electricity and communications facilities, the earthquake in Dungara district and the adjacent Sigi region remain unconnected “islands”, unable to account for the number of victims.
In this media report, Vice-President Kara of Indonesia reported the death toll of thousands of people.
Power cuts, communications disruptions, road blockages, airport damage...
As a result of the power cuts, some hospitals and rescue settlements in the city of Palu are dependent on fuel for electricity generation.
Roads into and out of the city were blocked by the landslides and the lack of access for large transport vehicles, including tanker trucks, straining the supply of fuel.
According to the Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs, Agus, emergency relief supplies, such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothing, food and household kits from South Sulawesi and Columbus provinces adjacent to the earthquake zone, have not yet arrived in the affected areas due to road damage.
Disaster relief materials transferred from the capital, Jakarta, are being transported to the affected areas by air transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to the Palu airport command tower and runway during the earthquake, and in order to ensure safety and security of relief, all commercial flights have been suspended for the purpose of landing and landing only military aircraft transporting relief supplies and personnel.
The Indonesian Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs in charge of relief in the earthquake zone, Wiranto, called for the prompt resumption of electricity supply and airport commercial flight services in order to ensure the functioning of relief agencies such as hospitals and to enable more relief workers and volunteers and aid supplies to reach the affected areas.
A series of strong earthquakes in Dungara district, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, triggered by a tsunami at 1702 hours, triggered by a 7.07-scale earthquake, caused major disasters in the cities of Palu, Dungara and Sigi.
In the recent past, Beijing has continued to open its most beautiful blue sky pattern, which has led thousands of people in the city to show their pictures on social platforms.
Since August, Beijing has welcomed the "Blueest Sky".
Within the city, people can be seen and photographed at any time or place with a smart phone or a single anti-camera.
On social platforms like Weibo, Weibo Group of Friends, the palaces, Tiananmen, the nests, the alleys in the webcams are everywhere and the buildings display different beautys under the blue sky.
Some online people say that this is the best city film in Beijing; others argue that if this blue sky were brushed for a long time, people with cervical vertebrae could be cured; and even more so, they want to be "The blue is the spring of the winter and the spring of the city."
Why does the people of the capital love the sky?
Only because people who lived in this city in the past suffered from the fog, and so they were eager for the blue sky, and after Beijing, when the Blue Sky Defense War was launched, the air quality continued to improve, the fog became less, the sky became more blue, and the people looked at their hearts and their happiness.
On the Fourth of July, the weather was clear in Beijing.
At 8 a.m., the vast majority of the 35 air quality monitoring stations throughout the city were shown to be “first-class” green.
The "Blueest Sky" thematic photography competition on social networking platforms is still going on.
Why is it so blue in Beijing these days?
According to the Officer-in-Charge of the Beijing City Environmental Protection Agency, the average concentration of fine particles (PM2.5) in Beijing in August of this year was 35 ug/m3, the best ever recorded for the last five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 in September was even more frequent in places.
A major factor in the emergence of the “Blueest Sky” is the overall favourable weather conditions in recent times and, more importantly, the persistence of air pollution control in Beijing, the vigorous promotion of clean air action plans over the past five years and the continued release of environmental benefits, which have led to a reduction in the total discharge of pollutants in the region, have laid the foundation for a sustained improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially launched and implemented the Beijing City Action Plan on Clean Air 2013-2017 in 2013.
Under the plan, official efforts are continuously directed at defunctionalizing non-capital functions and promoting energy clean-up and pollution reduction, with a total of 4923 coal-fired boilers phased out.
As a result, Beijing has become the first large city in China to become a net gas-free city.
The data show that between 2013 and 2017 the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased cumulatively by 35.6 per cent; the number of air quality days was increased by 50 days; the number of first-class good days was increased by 25 days; and the number of days of heavy contamination was reduced by 35 days and the incidence of heavy contamination was significantly reduced.
As air quality continues to improve, the Beijing Government released in September this year the Beijing Three-Year Plan of Action to Win the Blue Sky Defense, based on a new round of PM2.5 sources, focusing on diesel trucks, dust and volatile organic matter management for the current governance phase and pollution characteristics.
During the Golden Week of the National Day, the relevant departments, such as the Municipal Tourism Board, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the City Administration and the Public Security Department, will intensify their law enforcement checks on the “one-day” market, focusing on the “six-black” tourism scene, and, once found to be in violation of the law, will be subject to severe and cumulative penalties in accordance with the law.
Yesterday morning, the municipality held a special session on the subject of the illegal one-day tour and deployed a special operation to further the illegal one-day tour.
During the meeting, it was revealed that the focus on black votes, black guides, gangsters, black cars, black shops, black Internet interests were interwoven with “six blacks”, and that since 28 July the city had launched a special campaign against illegal “one-day trips”.
A total of 39 “one-day” complaints have been processed throughout the city, a decrease of 63 per cent over the same period; 270 “one-day” complaints have been processed throughout the city since this year, a decrease of 62 per cent over the same period.
Over the past two months, 248 black cars have been seized throughout the city, 158 illegal tourist passenger operations have been investigated, 29 shopping “black shops” and performing venues have been closed, 13 “black clubs” and 27 “black guides” have been seized, and illegal advertising 2.6 have been confiscated
As a result of the correction, the illegal “one-day” chaos was largely contained, and the “one-day” market order was stable and positive.
In recent years, it has been reported that the city has been increasing its efforts to deal with illegal “one day” trips.
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Board received 1612 and 897 complaints of “one day” — 79 per cent and 44 per cent less, respectively — but the illegal “one day” continued to bounce and formed black ticketing and blacking.
Specifically, illegal street tourists are “black votes”, illegal websites that publish false tourism information are “black nets”, travel agencies engaged in illegal “one-day trips” or agencies or individuals not qualified to operate travel agencies are “mafia”, “mafia”
During this special operation, the city has continued to increase regular checks and mobile patrols on illegal “one-day” trips. In response to the illegal “one-day” high-frequency and high-impact tourism route locations, the relevant authorities have carried out daily unannounced visits in their cars, and have found evidence of violations of the law.
Of these, “black cars” and “black shops” have been the focus of two campaigns.
It was reported that, without black cars, illegal “one-day trips” could not take place, and that black cars were easy to detect, remember and trace, as well as high-value fixed assets.
The authorities use road traffic monitors to increase the supervision of buses that travel on the “one-day” route, which is a priority, so as to detect “black cars” in a timely manner, using technological and intellectual means such as physical defence.
The “black shop” for tourist shopping has also become a strong focus owing to its small number and location.
In order to reinforce the deterrence and suppression of illegal “one-day” trips, any special operation that is found to be in violation of the law is subject to severe penalties imposed by the competent authorities in accordance with the law.
In August of this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues relating to the fight against illegal “one-day trips” to discuss measures to combine administrative sanctions with convictions.
The Municipal Tourism Council has indicated that more regular travel agencies will be encouraged in the future to carry out a “one-day tour” of Beijing and to increase the supply of a formal “one-day” to further crowd out the illegal “one-day” living space, and that specific programmes are currently under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Council has continued to refine the electronic travel order information system for tour missions to ensure that each team is included in the regulation of the electronic travel list platform.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economic symbol, what has U-town been through all these years?
As the permanent venue of the World Internet Congress, the town of Uttar Pradesh is receiving attention as to how to deliver the Summit dividend.
In the five years since the first World Internet Congress, changes have been visible in the town of Utun.
In 2014, there were only 12 businesses associated with the digital economy and the Internet throughout the town, and by the third quarter of this year there were more than 500 businesses.
This is a microcosm of the development of the digital economy in Utun.
The holding of the Internet Congress allowed local firms to accept the inspiration of the digital economy, the wave of digitization, the desire for business transformation and upgrading, and the investment and research and development of traditional manufacturing firms in machine-changers, smart management and so on.
The Secretary of the U Township Party, Kang Yong, said that U Town would build a new economic empowerment centre in the future.
The digital economy cannot be developed without the support of infrastructure.
This year, Uyghur launched a 5G pilot on the basis of full coverage of the 4G communications network and free WiFi.
At the same time, the city of Kiryu, where the town is located, has become a hot ground for the development of the Internet industry as the country ' s first county-level city to build dedicated access to international Internet data.
Since the first World Internet Congress, 565 digital economy projects have been introduced, with a total planned investment of 37.725 billion yuan, bringing the total value of the core manufacturing sector of the digital economy to 8.73 billion yuan in the first three quarters of the year, representing a 13 per cent increase in value added.
"Ou Town was a tourist symbol, followed by theatre and cultural symbols. Because of the Internet Congress, it has now become an Internet and a digital economic symbol."
In the view of the Secretary of the Qing City Council, the dividends of the World Internet Congress have accumulated over time, making it all the more necessary to set up a platform for bringing together the various elements of talent, projects, technology, etc.
Shen Yi has worked outside the country for 20 years and has returned home to start a business as a result of her association with the Internet Congress.
On 2 December last year, with his high-capacity anti-digital modification technology solution, he entered the fourth Internet Light Fair and was favoured by a number of clients.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in U-town not only because of her home country, but "In U-town, it's easier to attract people than I thought, and our applications are fast-tracked, and we have applications in U-jin's smart parking program."
The spill-over effect of the Internet Congress is reflected in a town hall road.
This road to the north and the south of the city is not only a series of tourist attractions but also an industrial road.
It was built upon and brought into being a conglomerate on the U.S. Boulevard.
Journalists have learned that, in the future, Uyghur Road will be the leading position in the development of the industrial sector in the city, leading the way in the extensive application of the fruits of smart medicine, intelligent old age, intelligent government and so on, bringing together industries and a large number of high-level talent, which account for 80 per cent of the city ' s GDP.
The tsunami caused by the earthquake in Indonesia has killed at least 410 people.
According to the head of the Public Information Bureau of the Indonesian police in Jakarta on the evening of 29, the current earthquake in Central Sulawesi has killed 410 people, 97 of whom have been identified.
A further 29 persons were missing and 540 injured.
Palu airport is still closed.
Active treatment, with 98% of premature births in China for 29 weeks or more, has reached the level of developed countries.
The National Children's Medical Center and the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Gangan revealed on 30 September that it had introduced advanced Canadian methods in the title “China NiCU pre-natal quality improvement project”.
The results of the project show that, after active treatment, 98 per cent of premature births have occurred in China over 29 weeks of age, reaching the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in early delivery without complications.
For almost 20 years, the Chinese Government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborn children.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has fallen to 3.71 per 1,000, significantly below the national average and at advanced levels in developed countries.
The “China NIOC Project for Pre-natal Quality Improvement of Pre-born Children in Hospital” has significantly improved the quality of survival of pre-born children through four years of tireless efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, Director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the Paediatric Hospital at the University of Mudan, told journalists that while increasing the survival rate of premature births, attention was paid to reducing the quality of survival of premature births, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the overall outcome of the development of the nervous system and improving premature births.
Through four years of sustained efforts to include tens of thousands of premature births of 33 weeks or less in the country, the “China NiCU pre-natal quality improvement project” has resulted in a one-third reduction in the mortality rate of small births and premature births of small birth weight in the country, and a significant reduction in the incidence of serious complications in premature births.
Through the establishment of the National Neonatal Quality Improvement Collaboration Network and the introduction of the concept of collaborative Quality Improvement, 25 collaborating hospitals across China have been irradiated, and a comprehensive, systematic and effective collaborative Quality Improvement methodology adapted to the national context has been established to improve pre-natal care and to improve the quality of care for newborn children.
The Paediatric Hospital, affiliated to the University, is working with the National Newborn Unit to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections, based on the project ' s experience, and to provide information and guidance for the regular diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in the “China Project for Prenatal Quality Improvement of Pregnancies of Pregnancies”, the Paediatric Hospital introduced the EPIQ methodology into 25 large NNICUs in 19 provinces of the country and is committed to resolving the problem of premature child infections in China's neonatal care units.
After more than a decade of continuous improvement, the survival rate of premature births in Canada has increased by about a third, and Canada is now one of the best countries in the world to expect premature births.
The EPIQ methodology has now been applied to all NIOCs across Canada and has been adopted in six countries.
According to the paediatric hospital, two years after EPIQ intervention, premature child infections fell by 35 per cent, while antibiotics were used by 20 per cent.
In the future, the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University will continue to promote and implement this approach throughout the country, with a view to reducing the incidence of all complications in premature births in general and improving the quality of care for newborns throughout the country.
At this time, it is true that there are differences and inequities in the level of care available in all regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important unit of the National Children ' s Medical Centre, the Paediatric Hospital will play a radiological role. The study will cover the western provinces of Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal care throughout the country.
It is understood that the Paediatric Hospital, affiliated with the University of Gangan, is working with the National Newborn Unit to develop guidelines for the treatment of neonatal infections based on the project ' s experience and to provide reference and guidance for the regular diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
In 2019, it was revealed that the focal point, the China Neonatal Collaboration Network, located at the Paediatric Hospital attached to the University of Gangan, would join 63 hospitals throughout the country in the next phase of national quality improvement, with a view to promoting the equalization of levels of neonatal care in China.
The Director of the Shanghai City Health and Planning Commission expressed alarm that Shanghai could become a central city in the centre of Asia, not only in terms of research, but also in terms of the development of the entire service system, and that the quality and results of services should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China ' s level of health care.
Episode: Build the “hero monument” in mind — written on the fifth anniversary of the martyr.
On 30 September, on the eve of the birth of the Republic ' s 69th birthday, the fifth Martyrs ' Day was celebrated, and Xi ' s Equality Party and national leadership came to Tiananmen Square to attend a ceremony to honour the people ' s heroes.
At this very moment, wherever you are, please pay a warm tribute.
It's a day of rejuvenation, and it's a wake-up call.
The name of every martyr is a living life behind a long history.
They also have hot youth, true love, and family.
However, because of their conviction that “the doctrine of our faith is the truth of the universe”, they are willing to sacrifice everything they have in order to “freeze the suffering of the next generation”.
"I live one day and cry for China one day."
Through time and space, the British raised a spiritual sign and guided the way forward.
"Where to come from, where to go," "Do what kind of person," read English, and it's easy to come up with an answer.
It is important to remember the spirit and to build a “hero monument” in our hearts.
According to incomplete statistics, since the beginning of the revolutionary war, some 20 million martyrs have lost their lives to national independence, the liberation of the people and the country ' s prosperity.
For a variety of reasons, many of the pioneers did not even leave their names.
Countless blood pours on the ideals, lives on faith, remembers their names, and passes on their spirits to protect the roots and spirits of the nation.
This "hero monument" is not subject to any degradation or destruction.
For some time now, historical nihilism, general entertainment, etc., have flourished.
Practices that distort history, demean and challenge a just conscience, distort value judgements and provoke public outrage and alarm across society.
Strength cannot be desecrated, and heroes must not forget.
It cannot be allowed to touch the bottom line, but it must be dared to shine a sword and defend the high dignity with justice based on the rule of law.
On 1 May this year, the Heroed Martyrs Protection Act was officially implemented.
In terms of judicial practice, the verdicts in some cases have been very encouraging, both in the effective defence of the bright and bright image in accordance with the law and in the release of the positive energy of heroism and respect for the vanguard.
A people with aspirations cannot have heroes, a country with ideals cannot without vanguards.
The memory of the vanguard and the call for heroes has become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are millions of memorial facilities throughout the country and more than 100 million visits to Martyrs' Gardens each year.
The hearts and minds are the strongest cornerstones.
A “heroic monument” will stand between the heavens and the earth, deep in hearts and minds.
Reuters, 28 September – The EU took a non-confrontational position against Italy on Friday, following Italy’s surprise with its massive budget deficit plan, in defiance of the EU’s demands, but perhaps a more radical stance would have been taken if Italy had maintained too ambitious a goal.
The Italian skeptical government’s target of a budget deficit of 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) for the next three years suggests that debt has not been cut only in the face of demand for a reduction.
On Friday, the ECEC Executive Committee for Economic Affairs, Moscovisi, said, “We have no interest in the crisis between the EC and Italy,” and he responded cautiously because the EU’s recommendations and sanctions could have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will be able to convince Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy formally submits it to the EC in mid-October.
After the Government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in almost two weeks on Friday, while the rate of return on Italian bonds reached its highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remained unchanged by the October deadline, the ECEC might veto Italy ' s draft budget, something it had never done to any country.
At a later meeting in Riga, the capital of Latvia, on Friday, the EU EC Vice-President, said that Italy's current financial plan “does not appear to be in line with the Stability and Growth Pact”, referring to the EU financial regulations.
But he did not say how this would trigger a reaction from the EU.
Bidders may submit their applications to participate in this open tender by 26 October of this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture had identified China as one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
In May, the Russian Agricultural Supervisory Authority announced that, for the first time in the current agricultural year, Russian food exports to China exceeded 1 million tons, a record of innovation.
The Agency predicts that China may enter the top 10 Russian food-importing countries.
After Sapporo, on 30 September, after the first battle against Cuba at 3:0, the Chinese women ' s platoon won the Turkish team at 3:0 again on 30 September, winning two consecutive World Cups in 2018.
However, Chinese women are more vulnerable than they were during the first war.
A total of 24 teams participated in the 2018 VCs, and Chinese VCs were in Group B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
From the world ranking and overall strength of Team B, the Turkish and Italian teams are the main opponents of the Chinese team.
As soon as the game began, the Chinese team took the lead at the beginning of the game, maintaining the advantage throughout the process, placing considerable pressure on the opponent to take the first round at 25:18.
In the second round, the Turkish team, which was in a tough position, took the lead by 6:2 and the Chinese team requested a pause to adjust the formation, gradually chasing the score to 7 even, and then repeatedly stopped the net and scored the score at 7:0; and at the end of the game, Turkey.
In the third round, the situation was very tenuous, with the two sides rising from one to the other, at a time having reached a level of 19 parity.
At a critical time, when the Turkish team made a mistake, the Chinese team took the lead at 21:19 and obtained the point at 24:21 with Ju Ting's heavy arrest and Zhang Changning's attack; then the Turkish team ran the score to 23:24, and the Chinese team requested a pause, and Zhang Chang Yongning scored.
After Pingsai, China's female platoon leader, told the truth, the whole game was not easy.
“We are better prepared, we are better off, the Turkish team is more sophisticated, and we must reduce our mistakes and strive to win through our own initiative.”
In the face of her familiar teammates, Jo Ting, who worked for the Turkish Vakivo Bank team, was subjected to a lot of restrictions in the first round of the competition that day, and she continued her aggressive offensive after her initiative to change.
“The enemy is familiar with each other, and it is normal for them to be watched, but the Chinese team is extremely active, blocking the net and attacking in a bad way.”
The Chinese women ' s platoon will then hold a truce for physical and technical training on World War I; on 2 October, they will meet the third rival Canadian team.
On the 30th of September, the China-China Network Water Balance (Cui Zhiping Wang Peng) held a ceremony to focus on projects during the second half of 2018 in the Hebei High Water Zone.
On that day, six projects were concentrated, with a total investment of RMB 4.29 billion.
On that day, the Deputy Mayor, Yang Shikun, the Standing Committee of the Water and Sanitation Committee, announced the commencement of work.
According to Mr. Yao, Director of the Hebei Committee for the Management of the New District of Hebei, the six projects that had been launched today, with a total investment of $4.29 billion, were industrial projects, ranging from the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries to the introduction of new and emerging industries, covering civil-military integration, cloud plants, food, medicine, chemicals, etc.
It is believed that the construction and commissioning of these projects will give a strong impetus to the early achievement of the goal of “building hundreds of billions of industrial parks and creating national high-rises”.
The project began with the announcement of the Deputy Mayor, Yang Shikun, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Water and Sanitation Committee.
According to Hsien Yao, the region has successfully launched a series of major events, such as the China-Shang Shui International Life Science Summit and the Great Health Industry Development Forum, the Chinese Academy of Sciences High-end Equipment Industry Summit, and the 2018 Shui Jinjin “Synchronous” Innovation Forum, to develop new materials and energy.
The Central American stem cell project will be officially operational by the end of the year.
The mid-level pilot base of the entire Chinese science-based project began construction on the country ' s premier, the world ' s largest megawatt supercritical carbon dioxide compressor experimental platform.
The state-of-the-art super-counting centres, which are among the top 10 in the world, have been re-established in the provinces and cities.
At the end of the year, Yao Happiness indicated that the region would complete Phase 2 of the Science and Technology Valley Project, which is 240,000 square metres of digital information, new energy materials, three research and development bases and a demonstration centre.
The “upgrade” of the Chinese Academy+ innovation model will be actively developed, and a “one platform for the two chambers” will be built to facilitate the integration of scientific and technological innovations through multidisciplinary, multi-unit collaboration and multi-industry integration.
Nearly a thousand state-owned areas have reduced the price of tickets by more than half by more than 20 per cent.
[Summary] As of 28 September, free opening or price reduction measures (74 free of charge and 907) had been introduced or issued to the community in 981 landscape areas, Yunnan Stone Forest, Dalya Santa, Yulong Snow Mountain, Guangxi
In follow-up to the Central Economic Work Meeting and the deployment of the Report on the Work of the Government, the National Development Reform Commission issued, on 28 June, the Guidance for Improving the Price-Forming Mechanism for State-owned Places (hereinafter referred to as the Guidance) for Reducing Prices for Key Country Places, which requires the pricing of tickets from a reasonable definition.
Active efforts have been made to meet deployment requirements, resulting in successive reductions in the price of tickets for key State-owned sites.
As of 28 September, 981 sites (74 free of charge and 907 reduced) had been declared free of charge or price reduction measures in place or issued to the public, of which 5A, 159, 4A, 534 combined 69
Of the 907 landscape areas with reduced prices, 491, or 54.3 per cent, fell by more than 20 per cent and 214, or 23.6 per cent, fell by more than 30 per cent.
The provinces of Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi and Shaanxi have a higher number of price zones, of which Yunnan has more than 100, with an overall decrease of more than 30 per cent.
The Government of the eight provinces (districts, municipalities) has set a total price reduction of 5A-class sites, including Anhui, Chongqing and others.
The high level of social interest in Yunnan Shishi Lam, Dalian Santa and Yulong Snow Mountain, the Guangxi Guiling River, Fujian Wumai Mountain, Hunanji Zhangji border, Tsangxi Maasai, Jiangxi Sanshan, Xinjiang Kanas, etc., have introduced price reductions.
The gradual return of key State-owned ticket prices to reasonable areas contributes to an accelerated shift in tourism from a ticket economy to an industrial economy, small-scale tourism to mass tourism, destination tourism to an all-round tourism upgrade, and to a virtuous cycle of optimal tourism supply structure and steady expansion of tourism consumption demand, which promotes the landscape.
At the same time, the National Development Reform Commission has emphasized the need to strengthen price-order norms in the landscape areas, to guide them in upgrading their services and to ensure that they do not fall.
In addition, the National Development Reform Commission has carried out special inspections of recent media reports on the low and apparent decline in the prices of tickets in individual areas, requiring serious local responses to social concerns in a timely manner and the effective implementation of price reductions.
The Trade and Development Board has an orderly approach to short-, medium- and long-term optimization
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Agency has submitted short-, medium- and long-term optimization reports on “Major Investment Migrants” and “Technology Migrants” and has been continuously listening to society and optimizing the content and related work, in addition to stepping up and implementing the work in the report.
The Trade and Development Bureau will brief all sectors of society as soon as possible on relevant optimization efforts.
Of these, five were short-term measures undertaken during the year; five were medium-term measures implemented in 2019; and one was long-term.
In addition, the Trade Promotion Bureau has been instructed by the Director of the Department of Economics and Finance, Liang Witt, to undertake a comprehensive review of the internal management system.
The five short-term measures undertaken during the year include:
1. Carry out a review process. Priority is given to cases that are due to expire at the end of the seven-year period, to those referred to in the ICAC report, and to those that have been renewed. If there are indications of irregularities or violations of the law, they will be referred to the relevant judicial authorities on their own initiative for follow-up;

From 27 to 28 September, a national on-site observation and discussion exchange on filmless cotton was held in Xinjiang Shaya district.
During the videoconference, journalists learned that the immeasurable cotton technology system, which is dominated by the “Chinese cotton 619” and its accompanying cultivation measures, has initially achieved the goal of defilmification of cotton fields, has reduced the contamination of the ecological environment and the raw cotton from the cotton film in Xinjiang, and has made significant progress in research and demonstration on the integrated technology of the membrane cotton.
The Chinese Academy of Engineering, the famous cotton genetic breeder and the chief scientist of the cotton system of the National System of Modern Agro-Industrial Industries (SINTAM) have given a presentation on the development of membrane cotton to the Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Agro-Lin University School Party, Zhou National Model.
“The combination of membrane cotton technologies that we have developed can fully achieve non-dural cotton cultivation, and can completely solve the problem of membrane contamination and achieve green cotton planting.”
The Chinese Academy of Engineering has a quick introduction.
Xinjiang, the most important cotton-producing area in China, accounted for 61 per cent of the country ' s cotton area in 2017, according to the National Statistics Office.
Since the introduction of the membrane in China in 1982, Xinjiang has had over 50 million acres of crop cover of all types and approximately 300,000 tons of membrane use annually.
Of these, cotton membrane coverage reached 100 per cent, and cotton-field membrane accounted for about 60 per cent of the use of the membrane in Xinjiang.
Membrane cotton is measured and can produce 320 to 350 kg acre.
As the amount of Xinjiang membrane inputs increases, the residual membrane recovery rate is low, the amount of film residues in the soil is gradually increasing, and a range of problems, such as the structural destruction of the soil caused by the membranes, seriously affect sustainable agricultural development.
The membranes not only cause significant contamination of the soil but also have a significant impact on the quality of cotton fibres.
Currently, more than a third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang are mechanized.
In 2017, Xinjiang had an area of approximately 14 million acres of cotton.
During the mechanical cotton harvesting process, a large amount of membrane on the surface and on cotton strains was collected, which was mixed in the original cotton and difficult to remove during the processing of the original cotton, as well as during subsequent textile processing, which severely affected the quality of textile products.
On 28 September, a national on-site observation and discussion exchange on filmless cotton was held in Xinjiang Shaya district.
In an effort to address the problem of cotton land contamination, simplify cotton-planting techniques and improve cotton-field efficiency, Hispanic led his team over a period of eight years to implement the “Chinese cotton 619” membrane-free cotton cultivation, “building the wings” for green agricultural development in Xinjiang.
A metaphoric introduction to the development of new ideas through innovative breeding has led to the development of a very early, salt-resistant, low-temperature, high-yielding system of cotton on land, known as the “Medium 619”.
“The ‘Chinese cotton 619’ achieved a series of accompanying measures, such as mechanical support for membrane seeding, improved depth of seeding, shallow burial of drip tubes under membrane conditions, suitable screening of seed density, and sound chemical regulation, in the southern part of Xinjiang under filmless conditions.”
Demonstration bases for membrane cotton have been established in Aksu, Kurle and Alar, among others, at a production rate of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Cropping cotton without membrane achieved high yields, savings, environmental protection and combined efficiency gains.
Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinjiang Xinghai Agronomy) stated that through nearly six years of research and demonstration on the technique of membrane cotton cultivation, an acre production of between 320 and 350 kg could be fully achieved, possibly even higher.
“There are great prospects for the diffusion of membrane cotton cultivation techniques.”
Zhang Jinghai believes that the current technology of membrane cotton cultivation can solve the problem of soil permeable membrane contamination once and for all, but that there is still a gap between the economic benefits of membrane cultivation and those of membrane cultivation.
“Affirmation of the purchase price of cotton will be conducive to future diffusion.”
He and his team will continue to carry out in-depth studies and wide-scale extension applications of the membrane cotton industry as the next step in addressing the soil pollution caused by the membrane.
Guangdong Sea, Land and Air is actively responding to the Golden Week shipment - China New Network
On 29 September, the seventh day of official traffic in the Hong Kong section of Gao, and the first weekend following the opening, the insiders of the West Kowloon Station were hoisted.
The holiday of the Golden Week (1-7 October) will be observed around the clock, and journalists have learned from the relevant authorities that the various transport sectors, such as the Guangdong Railway, Air, Naval and Road, are actively planning to increase their capacity to deliver and put in place safeguards to ensure the safety of passengers in the country during the Golden Week.
According to China Railways Guangzhou Bureau Group Limited (hereinafter referred to as “Huang Iron Group”) during the Golden Week of the National Day this year, Guangqiang is expected to transport 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 155,000 compared to the previous year, an increase of 9.2 per cent.
In order to meet the travel needs of passengers, the Guangqun Group plans to drive 104 additional high-speed trains and 85 additional high-speed trains, mainly on hot-gate lines such as Kinguang, Jiakun, Guangdong and Hang High-rises.
Guangzhou Bai Yun Airport, which will be the busiest airport in the interior during the Golden Week of the National Day this year, is expected to receive more than 1.4 million passengers and to fly more than 9,200 flights.
With the increasing number of international routes, the airport is expected to see a significant increase in international passengers compared to the past, which will be a significant feature of the Golden Week holiday this year.
Singapore, Bangkok, Phuket, Jakarta, Colombo, Maldives, Manila, etc., are known to be the hottest cities for this year's national holiday, while the hot spots of Kathmandu, Kuala Lumpur, Bali, etc., have also continued to explode, with some flights “on short notice”.
Some airlines have increased their operations in particular, for example: Shenzhen Air has added one more flight per day from Guangzhou to Hanoi; Iran Mahan Air has added one flight per week from Guangzhou to Tehran; Viet Nam Air has added one flight per week from Guangzhou to Hanoi on Tuesday and four additional flights per week.
In order to ensure leave security, White Cloud Airport has increased priority job security such as “space allocation” “bag security” “on-call service” “passenger security” and is prepared for extensive delays in the disposal of flights.
According to China’s Southern Airlines, this year’s golden week’s flight to the areas of Ausimaa, North America and Japan is very hot, while flights to tourist destinations in China’s interior such as Hainan, Chengdu, Chenzhou, Xiaohua Mountains, Rim Mountain and Yellow Mountain are also relatively tight.
During the Golden Week of the South China Shipping Plan, there were 50 additional flights, including 10 on the Guangzhou to Chiang Mai route.
According to the Guangdong Maritime Agency, prior to the festival, serious security risk checks were carried out on priority vessels such as the water cruise ship, the June Strait passenger ferry, the Pearl River Express high-speed passenger ship and the ferry ferry, in order to ensure the stability of the safety of the water traffic during the extended vacation period.
During the Golden Week, traffic in Guangdong Province is expected to be at the top of the Chinese list.
The Guangdong Transport Group recently issued a guide to the holiday highway, which is expected to increase by about 12 per cent.
In a recent circular issued by the Directorate-General of Market Supervision on the strengthening of market price regulation during the Mid-Autumn Day of 2018, it was requested that price regulation in the area of housing rental and real estate be strengthened and that rent collusiveness be severely regulated, rental sources hoarded, false information forged to raise rents, and that
The circular made it clear that early warning of price monitoring should be strengthened and market price developments closely monitored.
There is a need to pay close attention to basic necessities such as meat and meat consumption, egg cream and milk, as well as to market and price changes for special commodities consumed by the local population on holiday, and to strengthen price monitoring and early warning analysis.
Measures to address market volatility effectively and in a timely manner will be taken once the tendentious and predisposing nature of market volatility is identified.
There is a need to strengthen the monitoring and inspection of the wholesale and retail distribution of essential goods, to increase the frequency and supervision of places that are closely linked to the daily consumption of the population, such as supermarkets and agro-trade markets, and to urge operators to operate in good faith in compliance with the law.
The circular stated that there was a need to strengthen the focus area inspections and create a favourable consumer environment; to strengthen the regulation of the price of State-owned market tickets; and to focus on the non-implementation of government-mandated price levels or fluctuations in State-owned areas, the unauthorized addition of fee lines, the improvement of the market through irregularities in the installation of “campus” tickets, etc.
The circular requires enhanced regulation of the price of essential goods, particularly agricultural products.
The prices of essential agricultural products, such as vegetables and pork, have fluctuated in some regions in the recent past, as a result of seasonal variations, natural disasters and outbreaks.
Locally, the regulation of the prices of agricultural by-products markets needs to be strengthened in a manner that takes into account local realities, while the relevant sectors take on the task of stabilizing production and market supply, and organize efforts to carry out market-focused and random inspections.
Increased scrutiny of commodities such as pig meat, which is in short supply and has higher prices, and serious investigation of offences such as the hoarding of quirks, price hikes and collusive price hikes.
The circular noted the need to strengthen price regulation in the areas of housing rental and real estate.
In the middle of the autumn and the national holiday, which coincides with the season of rental housing and sale of goods, close attention should be paid to the price behaviour of real estate enterprises, intermediaries and housing rental-related enterprises, with strict regulation of rental price collusiveness, hoarding of rental sources, fabrication of false information to raise rents and random charging of fees in the form of tied services.
The circular referred to the need to ensure effective price regulation in other parts of the tourism industry, to regulate the price order in catering, accommodation, shopping, sightseeing, entertainment and parking, to guide operators in their biding and billing efforts, and to seriously investigate price violations of all kinds.
The circular stated that the inspection of transport prices, such as roads, railways, civil aviation and water transport, should be intensified and that violations such as price increases, extra-price charges and non-fixed pricing should be seriously investigated.
Implementation of a “green corridor” for the transport of fresh agricultural products and a policy of free toll-free minibuses on major holidays.
Innovative regulatory instruments and methods of work are needed to strengthen the dissemination of price laws and regulations for off-line retail businesses and e-commerce platforms, to urge operators to improve their price promotion programmes and to investigate, in accordance with the law, offences such as false original prices, misleading price indications and non-compliance with price commitments.
On 1 January, the journalist was informed that, on the fifteenth anniversary of the full passage of the Hong Kong train, three lifts had taken place and that the flow of passengers had so far been increasing; the cumulative total number of passengers travelling to and from the port had reached 1.7 million.
At the same time, Hong Kong and Australasia passenger clearances do not exceed 15 seconds.
On 1 October 2003, the State Council approved the establishment of a temporary crossing between Shanghai and Kowloon direct train, the first direct long-distance rail passenger crossing to Hong Kong in China, marking the opening of a “three-wing” overland port in Shanghai.
To date, the Hong Kong train has been in operation for 15 years.
On the 1st day of the Shanghai Railway Border Inspection, which was tasked with the border check of the port's entry and exit, it was revealed that since the beginning of the operation, there have been three lifts in the port's train, which had been reduced from almost 30 hours to 19 hours one-way; and that the annual average number of incoming and outgoing passengers was less than 8 per year.
Over the past 15 years, it has been reported that police coordination mechanisms have been established between the Shanghai Railway border crossing point and the station along the nine trains, and police officers have been assigned on-the-road supervision, providing full coverage of 1991 km of services and control.
Over the past 15 years, the Shanghai Railway Border Post has detected nearly a thousand cases of violations of the law, and has succeeded in detecting cases of illegal entry of foreigners with false permits and the use of other persons ' documents as a substitute for departures.
The station has also established mechanisms such as working exchanges with the Joint Inspection Unit, conducted regular training exercises for the Integrated Counter-Terrorism Service at railway ports, and worked with the joint defence unit to construct a third-tier protection belt at the roundabout rail crossings.
Over the past 15 years, it is known that the Shanghai Railway Border Department has continued to innovate in its services and that the pace of customs clearance has increased significantly.
The border post has also set up a volunteer service group called “Tyran” to provide loving assistance to the elderly, pregnant women and travellers with babies.
On 30 June, journalists learned from the Ministry of Finance that four departments of the Ministry of Finance, the State Tax Administration, the National Development Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce had issued a joint circular in recent days to further encourage foreign investors to invest in China, to allocate profits from residential enterprises in China to foreign investors, and to suspend the application of the income tax policy for direct domestic investment.
This policy has been in effect since 1 January 2018.
The circular makes it clear that direct investment by offshore investors with a share of profits, including recapitalization by offshore investors with a share of profits, new construction, equity acquisition, etc., does not include additions to eligible strategic investments, conversions, acquisitions of shares in listed companies.
Expatriate investors who are provided with a policy of withholding income tax but are not actually entitled to it may apply for reimbursement of the policy within three years from the date of actual payment of the relevant tax.
Moreover, foreign investors who, after enjoying a prescribed policy of withholding income tax payments, are subject to special reorganization requirements in the event of a reorganization of an investment enterprise and are actually taxed in accordance with a special policy of restructuring, may continue to enjoy a policy of withholding income taxes.
In order to ensure that profits earned by offshore investors are actually used for direct investment, the circular provides that the profits of offshore investors for direct investment are paid in cash and that the money in question is transferred directly from the account of the profit-allocation enterprise to the account of the invested enterprise or of the transferring equity, and that no other account, inside or outside the country, is allowed to swing before the direct investment is made;
The circular also requires the tax authorities to strengthen their follow-up management in accordance with the law.
Expatriate investors who have been granted a policy of withholding advance income tax are deemed to have failed to file corporate income tax as required, except in the case of corporate liability for profit distribution, as verified by the follow-up management of the tax administration, and will be liable for delay in tax collection in accordance with the law from the date of payment of the relevant profit.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States stated on Friday that it would no longer allow the import of raw materials produced by the Chinese Chinese pharmaceutical industry and the formulations made from the company ' s raw materials.
A drug previously produced by the Chinese pharmaceutical industry was recalled for containing possible carcinogens.
The European Medical Authority (the European Medicines Agency) indicated that further action was under consideration with regard to the other components of the plant ' s production.
FDA states that major production process problems were identified during FDA ' s inspection of the pharmaceutical plant in the China Sea Pharmacy industry and that imports were subsequently stopped.
FDA also states that imports will be banned until the Chinese pharmaceutical industry discovers how these impurities are produced and improves its quality control system.
On September 29, the Chinese pharmaceutical industry published a statement on its website stating: “The company is taking positive and vigorous steps to correct the problems of this official inspection in Europe and the United States, and it is very surprised and sorry for the way in which the official United States and Europe handled it and for the results.
This is a concern of companies in the current complex market environment.
At present, companies are organizing teams, including professional lawyers, to communicate and file complaints in accordance with the relevant procedures and with United States and European Union officials in order to resume production as soon as possible.”
Reuters September 29, Shanghai - The CSRC announced on Friday evening that the CSRC had approved the initial application (IPO) of China People ' s Insurance Group Inc. on that day, in accordance with the procedure established by law.

Ex-Foreign Aid charged with playing a fake ball, North Control responding "No Need" - New Network in Central.
Yesterday afternoon, the Beijing Holdings Football Club (hereinafter referred to as North) responded officially to the team's former foreign aider Anechbe's allegation that the team had been suspected of playing false football. The North Controls issued a statement that there was absolutely no such thing as playing false football in the club, which was entirely the case of Anechbe himself in the arbitration process.
At the same time, the North Control said that it would reserve the right to be held accountable by all means.
According to the Daily Post in the United Kingdom, Nigerian player Ani Chebe accused FIFA of being suspected of playing false football by the Beijing North control team that he had been in force last year, including Beijing Deby in the 21st round of the 2017 season.
It was the critical stage of Beijing and the rush, and the game of North control ended with a zero-to-two negative on the Beijingers and the first stage of Anitcheby.
There was an official response from the North Control Club yesterday to the Nigerian player's account.
The statement stated that, following an internal investigation prior to the club, there had been no false play in the games in which the team had participated.
Anichebe joined Beijing North in June 2017, and in December of the same year, Anichebe refused to join the team for winter training without any justification and refused to do so despite numerous reminders from the club.
The dispute between the parties has now been referred to FIFA and arbitration is ongoing.
It was also mentioned that the high-profile “false ball charge” was in fact a fabrication made by Anichebe in the course of the arbitration in order to cover up the fact that he was in flagrant violation of the contractual agreement and for his personal and unjust economic purposes.
Its sole purpose of defaming clubs and Chinese football is to obtain unjust economic benefits.
Clubs are less open to any organization or any individual who, for the sake of their economic interests and personal grievance, engages in baseless accusations, slanders, slanders and slanders against clubs.
The Northern Controls therefore indicated that they would reserve the right to hold the parties to account by all means.
The Bank for Agricultural Development of China will invest 20 billion yuan to support the Chilin Qiu food acquisition.
Since September, crop harvests have continued to peak in various parts of Jilin province.
Journalists have learned from the Jilin provincial branch of the China Agricultural Development Bank that agricultural loans are now fully available in the amount of $20 billion to ensure that sufficient funds are available for food purchases in Jilin.
This year, it is known that the food production situation in Jilin has been generally stable, with some food processing enterprises increasing their capacity and the start-up rate and increasing demand for food markets.
In order to ensure the availability of funds for food policy acquisition, agricultural issuances have actively engaged the Autumn Food Acquisitions Bank meeting through visits to various buyers such as farmers, processing enterprises, trading enterprises, etc.
At present, 5.2 billion yuan has been invested in agricultural distribution to support the acquisition of 1.58 billion pounds of autumn grain by various food buyers.
One hundred and twenty major food buyers have set up nearly 300 acquisition networks in Jilin province to ensure “full coverage” in the main food-producing districts, without leaving the acquisition funds available as “blank points”.
According to the head of the farm issuer, in accordance with the progress of the acquisition and the demand for money from the enterprise, in the event of a shortage of funds for the acquisition, the farm issue will apply for an additional $20 billion in credit funds to ensure that the funds are available in full and on time, to preserve the stability of the food market and to protect the interests of farmers.
Chinese journalists will be taken away by the police in the year of the British Conservative Party. China asks for an apology.
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, the spokesman for the Embassy in the United Kingdom answered the questions of a Chinese journalist who had been taken away by the police during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party on the first day.
He called on the Human Rights Committee of the Conservative Party to cease its interference in China ' s internal affairs, to cease its involvement in Hong Kong and to ask the organizers of the Conference to apologize to Chinese journalists.
A journalist asked that on 30 September, during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party, the party ' s Human Rights Committee held a side event on Hong Kong and invited the Hong Kong opposition to take the floor.
During the meeting, a Chinese journalist was taken away by the police.
Do you have any comments?
In response, he said that in the 21 years since Hong Kong had returned to its homeland, the practice of “one country, two systems” had achieved great success, and Hong Kong's development achievements had been universally recognized.
Hong Kong is Hong Kong, China, and Hong Kong affairs are purely internal to China.
The Human Rights Committee of the Conservative Party used the party ' s annual meeting to organize a side event to raise awareness of the anti-China separatist forces, and China expressed serious concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We firmly reject any interference by any organization in Hong Kong affairs in any way.
Any attempt or action to promote “the independence of Hong Kong” is futile.
It was totally unacceptable, according to the speaker, that freedom of expression had always been cited in the United Kingdom, but that Chinese journalists, when asking questions at the side meeting to express their views, had been subjected to widespread obstruction and even physical abuse.
We demand that the Human Rights Committee of the Conservative Party cease its interference in the internal affairs of China, cease its involvement in Hong Kong, and that the organizers of the Conference apologize to Chinese journalists.
The fifth World Internet Congress will be held from 7 to 9 November in the town of Zhejiang, and the world Internet will soon be re-entering “U-City Time”.
As a global Internet community event, the World Internet Congress has received high attention and broad recognition in the global Internet arena.
Over the past five years, the World Internet Congress had set up a grand stage for the exchange of cutting-edge technologies on the Internet, and the wide application of technology at the Congress had given new impetus to global economic development.
The results were published to bring together the world's Internet front-line technology
In the area of the Internet, which are the most advanced and visible achievements of the world today?
The leading scientific and technological results released by the World Internet Congress can provide answers.
For the first time, the third World Internet Congress released 15 leading scientific and technological outcomes.
The results demonstrated were dynamic, widely applied and radiation-driven, reflecting the latest and most important breakthroughs in science and technology in the area of the Internet at that time, reflecting the pace of developments and future prospects in the area of web-based information.
The results of the Fourth World Conference on the Internet were even more spectacular in light quantum computers, 5Gs, artificial intelligence capable of calculating emotions, and so forth.
The Convening Committee of the General Assembly, which has set up a world committee to recommend world Internet leading science and technology results, composed of 44 eminent experts from 10 countries, including China and the United States of America, has gathered nearly 1,000 innovations in the Internet field from around the world, resulting in the evaluation of 18 representative outcomes, including “Woe is a 3GP 5G pre-commercial system”
Currently, the Beidou satellite navigation system applications cover more than 50 countries and territories and involve more than 3 billion people.
The Great Lakes Light supercomputer completed more than 2 million operations and supported more than 100 applications.
Starting from China, Microsoft Little Ice, pioneered by Microsoft China’s research and development team, has now landed in China, Japan, the United States, India, Indonesia, and has been a television anchor, radio anchor, singer, and so on. China’s Internet science and technology development has often stunned the world’s science and technology frontier.
New platform for technology exchange at the Internet Light Expo
As one of the key elements of the World Internet Congress, the Internet Light Expo, which drives the interactive exchange of global Internet science, technology and innovation outcomes, provides an important platform for Internet enterprises to demonstrate the latest results.
The Internet Light exposition showcases new Internet outcomes, new technologies, new applications worldwide, with different thematic display areas and functional panels that select globally recognized Internet enterprises and innovative enterprises according to different technology classifications, bringing together cutting-edge results, displaying innovative technologies that reflect the civilizational light of Internet exchange, the future.
Take the example of the Fourth World Internet Congress “The Light of the Internet”, which attracted 411 well-known firms from across the globe, both domestic and foreign, with products covering recent achievements in global Internet technology and applied innovations, such as cloud computing, physical networking, artificial intelligence, and digital economic development, highlighting global perspectives, innovation drivers and digital economic development.
More than 110 new technology launches for new products and 10 thematic interfaces for Internet project cooperation were organized during the Conference, providing a broad arena for global digital economic cooperation.
A paper-based test paper, scanned by a mobile phone or a tablet computer, will immediately identify the contents and be ready for distribution; a half-metre high unmanned vehicle carrying cargo can independently complete a quick delivery; and a smart home will be able to perform voice shopping, cellular charging, barking with master's voice command alone.
Developments in Internet science and technology for the benefit of all peoples
Innovative developments driven by Internet technology are ultimately aimed at creating a better future for the peoples of the world and a more equitable, open and inclusive environment for human well-being, economic development and social well-being.
In a large Internet country such as China, which has a large user base, Internet technology has a stronger amplification effect on specific applications.
For example, Beidou, China, provides high-precision, reliable positioning, speed measurement and timing services to users, as well as a unique short message and communication capability; the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has a reshaping function for traditional industries, promoting progress in industries, in finance, transport, health, safety, etc.
According to the forty-second Statistical Report on the Development of the Internet in China, published by the China Internet Information Centre, China, as the largest Internet market in the world, is promoting social development progress through a digital process.
The dividends of the technological development of the Internet were by no means limited to China, and its results had provided a powerful driving force for the development of the Internet throughout the world and for the development of the economy and society.
For example, China ' s cross-border power suppliers and shared economies are moving abroad and increasingly supporting world economic growth; China ' s development of new generations of information technology, such as cloud computing, big data, physical networking, mobile Internet, has accelerated the deepening of the global division of labour and economic restructuring, and has reshaped the pattern of global economic competition.
As outlined in the Omega Initiative, launched by the Second World Internet Congress, the sharing of web-based development results, leading to the early formation of a global network market and the creation of more jobs, will provide a strong support for the sustained healthy development of the global economy, with more countries and people on the fast track of the information age.

The Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking on Friday in the United States Foreign Relations Committee, stated that China-United States relations are now once again at a crossroads, and that if both sides look at each other positively, deepen positive cooperation and manage differences properly, they can open up better prospects.
“Chinese-American relations are our common asset and need our solidarity.”
He expressed the hope that all sectors of the two countries would be well informed in order to maintain the healthy and stable development of relations between China and the United States and to work together to move forward in the right direction.
Wang Ying also stressed once again that China must move out of a path of development that is different from that of the traditional Powers.
This Chinese-characteristic path determines that China will not and will not be in the same position as the United States. It also determines that China will not become the United States, will not challenge the United States, and will not replace the United States.
In his speech entitled " Opportunities or Challenges, Partners or Counteractors " , Wang Yi said that the deep problem at hand was that some American friends believed that China would be strong and powerful and would even challenge and replace the United States as a leader in the world.
“This is clearly a major strategic miscalculation.”
He claimed, however, that this perceived suspicion was spreading, magnifying existing contradictions, creating new doubts and making it more difficult and resistant to solving specific problems between China and the United States.
Wang Yi noted that China is following a path of peaceful development.
Chinese have never had the genes for external expansion.
We believe that nations can live together in harmony and mutual understanding.
In the past, the present and the future, China would neither replicate the foreign model nor ask others to replicate its practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with former United States Secretary of State Kissinger in New York, he said that US-China cooperation would win, and confrontation would lose both.
China has always been committed to the development of long-term healthy and stable relations between China and the United States and to achieving non-conflict, non-confrontational, respectful and cooperative win-win relations.

It was reported that the town of Donggala (Donggala), near Pulu in the aftermath of the earthquake, was hit by two waves of tsunamis and that the authorities believed that the number of people killed would continue to rise as the “72 hours of gold” of relief passed.
On 30 September 2018, local time, in Palu, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, relief workers carried a survivor of the earthquake who had been rescued from the ruins of the restaurant.

In a visit to the affected areas on 30 September, Indonesian President Zorko stated that he had sent troops to assist in the search and rescue and called for the patientness of the victims.
According to Zorko, rescue operations were difficult owing to the shortage of heavy machinery and personnel.
He was informed of the lack of water, food and fuel supplies in many of the affected areas, as well as the closure of a number of businesses after the earthquake and the dispatch of aircraft.
He called on the victims to be patient and to remain in their original positions pending relief.
Search and rescue personnel in the city of Palou said they heard a call for help from a fallen hotel in the city, but they were helpless because no heavy machine had moved the rubble and some needed to do so with their own hands.
According to Vice-President Kara of Indonesia, electricity and communications were cut off in some areas, resulting in poor access to information, and the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami could eventually rise to thousands.

“Where can I take a taxi?
We want to go to Golden Purple Square to watch the flag-raising ceremony of the Fourth of July!"
On the morning of 1 October, Mr. and Mrs. Song, who took a flight from Ningxia to Shenzhen and took the first train on the high-speed railway train in Hong Kong, visited a Chinese news agency reporter at Kowloon West station in Hong Kong.
On the morning of 1 October, in celebration of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region held a ceremony to raise the flag of the People ' s Republic of China.
According to immigration control statistics, as of 30 September, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via Kowloon Kowloon Station in Gao Tie had exceeded 300,000.
On the occasion of the 69th anniversary of the birth of the motherland, the West Kowloon Border Post is expected to see a peak in visitor arrivals on 1 and 2 October.
At 7 a.m., the press arrived in Hong Kong in the morning, and many Mainland passengers took advantage of the Golden Week on the occasion of the National Day to take a trip to Hong Kong.
Mrs. Song, who took a short step, told the press that the holidays for the National Day were a rare and long holiday of the year, and that she was particularly pleased and excited to be able to meet her wish to raise the flag at Golden Purple Square in Hong Kong.
However, at the moment, Ningxia's flights to and from Hong Kong were not easy, so that he could travel through the Hong Kong section of High Steel. Mr. Song, after checking the schedule of the train, found that the first bus would arrive at 7.03 a.m. to connect the city's transportation to Golden Purple Square, just in time.
He lamented with the reporter: "It's so convenient, it's fast and it's on time!"
The daily 70-hour short-haul train to and from Guangzhou, Shenzhen North and Fukuda and West Kowloon has greatly facilitated the arrival of residents of the Austa Bay region in Hong Kong.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, is on his way to Hong Kong to meet his friends at the top of the Central Ribbon.
Mr. Liu said, “The Mainland and Hong Kong are off on the Fourth of July, and we're going to challenge ourselves to see if we can make the 50-km Hong Kong route!”
He explained that they would not have been able to easily try such long-distance mountain movements if they had not been open, easily accessible and with sufficient time.
Mrs. Yang, from Dong-jung, took her 10-year-old son to Hong Kong on a piano race, and proudly told journalists that his son had spent three years on the National Day in this way.
She had been on a bus in Hong Kong before, but she was time-consuming and worried about affecting her son's condition. She was also impressed by Shenzhen's trip to Hong Kong, which was reduced by half in speed and speed. She said to reporters: “It's like she's on a subway, especially fast.
On 23 September, at 6.44 p.m., the G5711 "Harm" high train left from Shenzhen North Station for a fast journey. A few minutes later, the train entered the Hong Kong section of the Hong Kong high-speed train, the first such train to be officially operated in Hong Kong.
The high-iron Hong Kong section, which is integrated into the country ' s 25,000-km high-iron network and extends to 38 long-distance stations throughout the country, also welcomes passengers from the interior of different provinces in the north-south of the country.
Mr. Gao, who came to visit his family from Changsha, told the reporter that he could only take a train to Shenzhenbei, take the subway to Hong Kong and then turn on the city's transportation, and now go straight to the Kowloon Center, where he can eat his children.
He said that the “two-by-one” customs clearance process was exceedingly convenient, “in less than 10 minutes, both have passed.”
The West Kowloon station, which is close to the airport fast line and links land and air traffic, has also become the preferred location for a large number of transit passengers.
Miss Wu from Fujian is going to visit the Philippines from Hong Kong to spend a golden week with her friends, pushing her luggage out of the gate at the West Kowloon, saying to reporters: “I didn't expect to catch the plane so soon.
According to the TTA subsidiary arrangements announced on Monday, the new US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain the ability of United States President Trump to implement a 25 per cent tariff escalation threat on imported cars, while at the same time providing for a general exemption from customs duties on passenger vehicles, pickups and car parts imported from Canada and Mexico.
If Trump imposes so-called “chapter 232” tariffs on cars for reasons of national security, Mexico and Canada will have a vehicle quota of 2.6 million tax-exempt vehicles per year exported to the United States.
Piccards produced in both countries would be fully exempt from customs duties under subsidiary arrangements.
If the Trumpuga tariff were imposed, Mexico would receive an exemption from the tax on car parts of $108 billion per year, and Canada would receive a quota of $32.4 billion.
Both quotas are well above the current levels of production in both countries and provide room for growth in exports from both countries.
According to Reuters/Mexico, 28 September - Friday, Mexico, after several days of controversy, the Government of United States President Trump and Canada are making real efforts to resolve trade policy differences, giving the hope that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will be maintained in the form of a tripartite agreement.
Despite the lack of detail, the above evident progress is sufficient to prompt the Governments of Mexico and the United States to abruptly suspend their plans to publish the text of the trade agreement between the two sides and to give Canada more time to accede to the agreement.
Mexico's President-designate, Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador, stated to journalists in Mexico that the United States Government had made new counter-proposals to the Government of Canada and that he would continue to press for the participation of all three countries in NAFTA.
The Minister of Economy of Mexico, Ildefonso Guajardo, stated that the submission of the text of the inter-American and inter-American trade agreement to Mexican and United States legislation had been delayed because of “very serious” attempts by the Governments of Canada and the United States to reach an agreement.
Guaharto says, “In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a text of a tripartite agreement or whether we have to publish it.”
Guahardo stated that his United States and Canadian counterparts had “specially requested” that the text be postponed.
The spokesperson for the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the US-Medical Trade Agreement and the consultations between the United States and Canada.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada did not respond to requests for comments on counter-proposals.
According to external sources, in a care centre on the outskirts of Pretoria, South Africa ' s capital, two small lions play together, and it is difficult to see any anomalies, but they are nothing else.
The University of Pretoria declared: “This is the first young lion ever born by artificial insemination - the first pair of lions in the world.”
School scientists are working on the reproductive system of female African lions.
The Director of the Mammal Institute of the University of Pretoria, Gans Winter, stated that the two young lions, one male and one female, born on 25 August, were healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally reached that breakthrough.
When Ganswint was interviewed by the media, he said: “We collect sperm from a healthy lion.”
The researchers then perform artificial insemination when the hormone content of the female is appropriate.
Ganswinter said: "Lucky, the result was successful."
He said that the researchers “had several attempts, but unexpectedly did not spend much effort”.
He said that the above-mentioned research breakthroughs could be replicated and that scientists wanted to use the technology to save large and endangered cats.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), lions are extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of wild lions that survive has fallen sharply by 43 per cent in the last 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
The African lion is classified by this organization as a vulnerable animal.
Gans Winter said, "If we don't do something for these animals, they'll be extinct."
He stated that the new technology did not have to allow lions to be raised, but simply injected sperm into a pregnant female lion, as had been done in North America and Europe for elephants.
South Korea ' s exports declined the most in September in the past two years, but analysts attributed the decline to fewer working days and stated that global demand for Korean commodities remained strong despite rising trade tensions in the United States and Central America.
Indeed, South Korea's average exports increased on a daily basis last month.
In addition, the earlier published opening data showed double-digit growth in exports in the first weeks of September prior to extended leave.
South Korea ' s exports in September fell by the largest on a year-on-year basis since July 2016, a decline greater than the 5.7 per cent projected by 11 Reuters analysts.
The opening values released on Monday showed exports of $50.6 billion in September, down from $51.2 billion in August.
South Korea’s exports to China grew by 7.8 per cent in September, expanding for the first 23 months in a row, despite fears that a growing trade dispute between the United States and China could cause other export-dependent China’s neighbours to suffer as well.
South Korean exports to the United States declined by 11.8 per cent, owing to a decline in sales of petroleum products.
The overseas sales of Korean memory chips and petroleum products grew by 28.3 and 13.5 per cent, respectively, despite market concerns that the so-called “supercycle” of chips might have peaked.
“The effects of the trade conflict will, however, be difficult to avoid, as Korean exports depend heavily on the markets of the United States and China.”
Imports declined by between 2.1 per cent and $40.8 billion, compared with the 3.1 per cent increase projected by the Reuters Survey.
The trade surplus in September began at $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
According to the Ministry of Industry, thanks to the United States and the European Union countries, the global manufacturing industry will continue to flourish, which is a favourable factor for Korean exports.
The statement states that “Increased export prices resulting from higher oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year.”
“However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with increased market volatility following the rise in interest rates in the United States, is a negative pressure on exports.”
Exports increased from an average of $2.6 billion per working day in September to $2.1 billion in August.
Korea's mid-autumn season fell from 24 to 26 September this year, leaving 19.5 working days in September, four days less than in the same period last year.
Korea ' s exports grew 4.7 per cent in January-September compared to the same period last year.
According to the Japanese menstruation/Market purchasing manager index, manufacturing activity in Korea rebounded in September, but was supported by domestic orders because of the decline in orders from China and Japan, which threatened to cast a shadow over export prospects.
North Korean media criticizes the US for not relaxing sanctions against the DPRK.
The DPRK Labour News published an op-ed article in its 30 September Journal criticizing the United States for seeking dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea while not relaxing sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, calling it a “compromise” approach.
The article stated that United States Secretary of State Pompeyo 14 had stated that “the key to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is the implementation of sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea”, stressing that the United States position remains unchanged in its continued implementation of United Nations sanctions resolutions.
In the Singapore-United States joint statement, the two sides committed themselves to a new relationship between the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea and the United States, commensurate with the aspirations of the two peoples to peace and prosperity.
There is no doubt that it is contradictory for the United States to increase the pressure on sanctions and to call for dialogue.
The article says that if new relations between the DPRK and the United States are to be established, a peaceful regime permanently consolidated on the Korean peninsula is to be constructed and a complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is to be achieved, confidence-building should be at the forefront, starting with what can be done, with a phased solution, one by one.
The article also stated that the United States should understand that the sanctions would not work for the DPRK.
The article says that even the "North Devinsk" before the "Kasan" makes the U.S. military admire it.
The National Interest magazine quotes the American Navy: “We will meet a powerful potential opponent. Just look at the North Devinsk submarine.”
The current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, Fogo, also praised the "North Devinsk" submarine.
He said, “This submarine is impressive. Looking at the development of the Russian navy and how its resources are used, the main effort in research and development is to strengthen the submarine fleet.”
However, the National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this area.
Forgo said, “I believe that Western countries still have asymmetrical advantages.”
Previously, there had been reports that the Russian Navy would be loading the Kazan submarine in 2019.
The multi-purpose submarines Kazan, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk and Arhangarsk are all “white wax tree-M” modified, with 13,800 tons of drainage and deep depth 5
On 29 September, the General Directorate of Radio and Telecommunications issued a circular on the introduction of a special programme for radio and television advertising, which has been under way since that date until the end of the year.
The reform included advertisements for low content, style and taste, and medical feeding programmes that were broadcast without a record management.
According to the circular, the focus of this special programme is on nine areas.
These include: advertisements with orientation problems; advertisements with low content, tone and taste; advertisements with excessive and non-standard broadcasting problems; medical treatment, medicines, medical devices, health care with exaggerated and false propaganda, misleading audiences, or the appearance of programmes.
This process will cover all parts of the country, and will ensure that the requirements of regulation and regulation are fully implemented at all levels of the wide media, frequency of channels, programme columns and time slots, “no blind areas, no dead spots, no exceptions”.
The circular requires that the various types of unlawful advertising found in the supervision and inspection be dealt with by the public authorities at all levels of the radio and television broadcasting service, in strict accordance with the General Directorate ' s Code on the Treatment of Infringements by Radio and Television Broadcasters.
Serious violations are dealt with seriously by means of exhortation, notification of criticism, suspension of the broadcast of advertisements until the broadcast of the frequency channel and, where appropriate, public exposure to society.
In recent years, the General Directorate of Electricity and Electricity has repeatedly called for the closure of illegal advertisements.
This year, the Directorate-General of National Radio and Television issued a circular publicly calling for the closure of advertisements for serious irregularities such as “0 bubbles of fruit milk”, “Sava cocktails” and “Bonret plant prophylactic disclosure”, and exaggerating propaganda and misleading audiences.
The General Directorate of Radio and Telecommunications has developed a number of regulations and circulars to regulate advertising on radio and television.
The Circular on the Further Enhancement of the Administration of Advertising of Television Shopping Video Channels stipulates that television Shopping Shorts are not permitted to be aired from 1800 to 2400 hours per day.
Advertisements of television shopping spots on other occasions should not be advertised by the moderator, “sale-style” exaggerations, tone, movement, etc., or “orthopaedic”, “plastic”, “permeable resin” and “rolling resin”
The Circular on Further Strengthening the Management of Broadcasting of Radio and Television Advertising stipulates that television spots in cinemas must strictly comply with the General Directorate ' s Order No. 61: 2 commercial spots per episode of non-gold time (45 minutes) of less than 1 minute and 30 seconds each; and gold time (1 minute)
The circular also stipulates that radio and television broadcasters must strictly examine the qualifications, certifications, etc. of health information advertisements, such as medical, pharmaceutical, medical devices and health-care foods, and firmly prohibit the broadcasting of sex-related advertisements.
In order to regulate the advertising of health information, it is not possible to advertise in a different form as a health information feature.
Health information features should focus on scientific knowledge of disease prevention, control and treatment. They should not contain advertising on medical treatment, medicines, medical devices, health-care foods, or evidence on behalf of patients and doctors, pharmacists, specialists, etc.
Mantourov said, “We have adjusted the format of the MAKS International aerospace salon for the first time. We suggest that China be the host country. China’s peers have agreed and accepted our invitation.”
Not long ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the fourth Eastern Economic Forum at the invitation of Russian President Putin.
This was his first time attending the Forum.
Disregard the American threat!
EU or Iran to enter into a crude oil procurement agreement
The United States Government had recently announced that a new round of sanctions against Iran would resume in November and had even urged other countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil.
However, the allies of the United States do not seem to listen.
According to the United States New York Times, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed during his visit on 29 September that Tehran was approaching an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil, despite the United States threat to impose sanctions on any country doing business with Iran.
The central purpose of the agreement was to attempt to create a new payment mechanism that would replace transactions in the United States dollar by bartering or denominated in local currency.
The purpose of this approach is to hope to bypass the United States and to prevent the United States from blocking financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is committed to the promotion of the agreement, some French and British officials are concerned that, if it were to materialize, it would be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States against the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement.
According to the media, Zarif's words sound more optimistic during an hour of interviews than in recent months.
Because of its ability to “severe” the traditional allies of the United States, the agreement effectively breaks down attempts by the United States to cut Iranian revenues.
“This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit from it”, Zarif argues that countries have a legitimate right to trade with Iran, as agreed in 2015.
The European Union’s foreign policy head, Federica Mogherini, also said before, “No sovereign state or organization can accept anyone else to decide who it can trade with.”
However, she also predicted that, before the next sanctions were imposed by the United States Government in November, United States leaders might resort to a range of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries with which they had business dealings in Tehran.
In May this year, the United States Government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement on the grounds that the agreement was flawed and stated that the agreement could not permanently prohibit the production of nuclear fuel by Iran.
The United States subsequently threatened to prohibit companies buying Iranian oil and other commodities from operating in the United States.
This threat led to the withdrawal of some companies from Tehran and a sharp fall in the Iranian currency.
Companies such as Airbus and the French oil giant Dadal have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have stated that the United States Government may “take the upper hand”.
If not, according to a recent Turkish media report, the sanctions imposed by the United States do not appear to have had a significant impact on Iran ' s oil exports.
The Iranian oil minister, Xangane, had recently revealed that no country other than South Korea had stopped purchasing Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani believe that a series of United States actions are intended to “entice” Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also concerned about a series of verbal attacks on the American side, and when asked whether the US would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing fiscal pressure, Zarif even laughed, “It is a strategy of regime change, and that is the real purpose of the US.”
The launch of the Cultural Tourism Market of the Xiamen Hurley Artillery Artillery Station.
In that year, the first broadcaster to broadcast Mandarin on Fujian front radio station, Chen Fei, came to the gun station to remember the history of the gun.
The well-known tourist attraction area, the Xiamen Huri Artillery Battery Zone, which is separate from the Golden Gate, was once the home of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for the establishment of a “front-line radio station”.
On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the opening of the Front Line Radio station, on 30th of the day, the scenery organized a “Swat Radio Memorial” event in which several historical witnesses from the Front Line were invited to speak about the historical evolution of the station and to witness the evolution of cross-Straits relations.
Testimony of the history of the frontline radio station in that year told the history of the cannons.
This is one of the activities of the second series of “Market of Cultural Tourism at the Xiamen Huri Artillery Artillery” , which was built with great vigour in the Houri Mountain View Area.
This was preceded by a successful first event to create a unique cultural tourism brand that combines cultural tourism IPs, creative market fairs and traditional folk culture experiences.
On the same day, the second edition of the Cultural Tourism Fair, “The Ancient Artillery of the New Era”, hosted by the Xiamen Hill Artillery Zone, was officially inaugurated under the direction of the Xiamen City Brigade Development Committee, and during the six-day event, it will focus on the Mid-Autumn and the National Days “Friends”
The “Hearing the Voice of the Sea” concert has become a major feature of the Artillery Cultural Tourism Fair.
Wang Yong, Director of the Huri Artillery Artillery Authority, introduced the event “Retirement of heavy-tunnel cannons” in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the launch of the front radio station of the Huri Mount Artillery Artillery of the Liberation Army. Several old radio operators were invited to tell the history of the cannons and to remind people of the past.
In addition to this series of events, the 40th Anniversary of the Reform of the Opening of the Tourism Markets concerts, the old photo screenings, and the Grand Monument of Monopoly Devices on both sides of the Straits of 2018.
Among them, the “Hearing the Voice of the Sea” concert, a major feature of the Gun Platform Cultural Tourism Fair, was the exclusive cultural branding of the scenery, which invited the Phoenix Girls' Choir in Xiamen City to contribute to the battle at the ancient cannon station in the Sea of Ishan.
A large public service exhibition of single-body artistic devices on both sides of the coast was held during the National Day in the Battery View Area, focusing on creating an eye-to-eye effect, attracting a large number of tourists, citizens to visit, photographing, transmitting the circle of friends, filming the tremors and letting the Xiamen live here.
And "The Xiamen 40 years of you and me" -- the old photo selection, the award-winning exhibition in the scenery, through a temperature picture, digs deep into those moments of happiness and movement.
The Regulations for the Promotion of Ecocivilization in Fujian province were adopted by a vote of the thirteenth session of the Standing Committee of the Fujian People ' s Party on 30 September, on electricity (journalist Longmin) in the State of Fujian.
For the first time, the “Green Water Mountain is Silver Mountain” was incorporated into the legislation of Fujian Province, throughout which the regulations were made operational and enforceable.
Fujian is the first country in China to test eco-civilization.

With a view to further encouraging offshore investors to invest in China, the Chinese Ministry of Finance and four other ministries have jointly informed that, as of 1 January 2018, profits allocated to offshore investors from residential enterprises in China have been used to suspend the application of the pre-tax policy for domestic direct investment, extending the foreign investment incentive category to all non-profits.
The Ministry of Finance website published a circular stating that foreign investors must meet several conditions at the same time, including direct investment by offshore investors with a profit share, including equity investment by offshore investors with a profit share, new construction, equity acquisition, etc., but excluding additions, transfers, acquisitions, etc.
It also includes the share of profits earned by offshore investors that represents an equity investment gain such as dividends, dividends, etc. resulting from the actual distribution of realized retained earnings by resident enterprises in China to investors.
and the profits of offshore investors for direct investment are paid in cash, and the money in question is transferred directly from the account of the profit distribution enterprise to the account of the invested enterprise or equity transferer, and is not allowed to swing in other accounts within or outside the country before the direct investment is made; the profits of offshore investors for direct investment are in kind, in non-cash form, such as marketable securities, etc.
The circular also states that offshore investors actually recover direct investments that are covered by the withholding of income tax policy through equity transfers, buy-backs, liquidations, etc., and file with the tax authorities, within seven days of the actual collection of the corresponding amount, in accordance with the prescribed procedure, the payment of deferred taxes.
In an effort to encourage foreign investors to continue their investment operations in China, four ministries, including the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce of China, issued a joint circular at the end of 2017, whereby, with effect from 1 January 2017, profits distributed by offshore investors from residential enterprises in China were directly invested in investment-incentive investment projects and deferred taxes were applied whenever the required conditions were met.
At the Standing Meeting of the State Council of China, weekly decisions were taken to extend the scope of application of the non-admission of foreign reinvestment tax from encouraging foreign-type foreign investment projects to all non-prohibited projects and areas, and to further strengthen intellectual property protection.
Journalists have learned from the National Commission on Health and Hygiene that the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in our country has decreased compared to a few decades ago, while the incidence of overweight obesity has increased significantly.
In this regard, experts pointed out that the most important idea of maintaining healthy weight is to “repair the disease” and to promote scientific fitness and a reasonable diet.
According to the Chinese Youth Health Education Core Information and Interpretations (2018 edition), published recently by the National Health Commission, the key to maintaining healthy weight is reasonable diet and science campaigns.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight reduction are detrimental to health.
The health risks behind the little fatty cannot be ignored.
The Director-General of the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Ding Jing Jianxiang, stated that overweight obesity jeopardizes the normal growth and development of young people, adversely affects their psychological, behavioural, cognitive and intellectual well-being and can even lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood resin among children.
At the same time, overweight obesity among adolescents can easily continue into adulthood, increasing the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes among adolescents as adults.
According to Jing Jing, the nutritional and health tests conducted by Chinese residents in 2010-2012 showed that the rate of overweight among children aged 6-17 was 9.6 per cent in China and 6.4 per cent in obesity, which together stood at 16 per cent.
At the same time, overweight obesity among children and adolescents is characterized by a higher incidence of boys than girls and urban than rural areas, and the overweight obesity rate has increased significantly in recent decades.
How do adolescents cope with overweight obesity?
According to Zhang, Deputy Director of the Centre for Scientific Physics and Health Promotion of the National Directorate of Sports, the main causes of obesity among young people are excessive heat intake and inadequate physical activity.
For this simple obesity, the emphasis should be on scientific sport plus reasonable dietary control.
According to Zhang, the most important concept of maintaining healthy body weight is that of “the cure of the disease”, which is important as part of the comprehensive general education of schools, parents and students, the spread of the dangers of overweight and obesity, and the promotion of prevention among adolescents.
Adolescents should undergo regular medical examinations to monitor growth and development indicators such as body weight and early detection, scientific judgement and obesity for timely intervention.
For adolescents who are already overweight, Jingjiang recommends that, in addition to the active scientific organization of meals and sports, adolescents are in a special physiological stage and that they should avoid using hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and reduce their weight, and that they should not blindly take diet drugs.
Reuters 28 September - Friday, Facebook (FB.O) stated that hackers stole digital landing codes, giving them access to nearly 50 million user accounts, which were unprecedented and represented the most serious security gap in their history.
More than 2.2 billion monthly Facebook users stated that it had not yet been determined whether the attackers had abused any accounts or stole personal information.
The company also did not find the location of the hackers, nor was it certain that the hackers targeted specific victims.
Its preliminary analysis shows that it was a wide-ranging attack.
Executive Director Zuckerberg called the incident “really serious” at a media conference.
A spokesperson for the company stated that his account number, as well as that of the operator, Sheryl Sandberg, had also been affected.
Facebook stock prices fell by 2.6% on Friday, dragging Wall Street's main share finger.
According to U.S. parliamentarians on Friday, the attack is likely to increase external calls for data privacy legislation.
“This is yet another sad evidence of the need for Congress to act to protect the privacy and security of social media users,” said Democratic Senator Mark Warner in a statement.
Rohit Chopra, a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), said on Twitter that I would like an answer to Reuters's account of this security gap.
On September 30th, China’s fifth martyr’s anniversary was celebrated by China’s new Internet chief, Sha (Jung Binqing Tan) on September 30th.
On such a special day, members of society, such as the families of the war veterans, the representatives of the DR and the Hunan Veterans House, came to Changsha City's “Tang Man's Day Garden, the theme park for the fight against the war” for the anniversary of the 2018 martyrdom.
“The veterans of the resistance are witnesses to the Chinese resistance and are genuine, vivid and visible teachings of patriotism.”
Liu Xiao, former Vice-President of the Political Consultative Council of Hunan Province, said that the courage of the veterans of the war, who had forgotten my patriotism, was a valuable spiritual asset to the present generation.
In his address, the Vice-President of the Changsha City Association and Chu Jianjun, the Main Committee of the Chang Sha City Council, noted that in recent years, the Care for War Veterans project, which provides care services to war Veterans in the form of living allowances, free old-age pensions and free burials, has become a social service for Changsha.
In his view, the spirit of resistance can be inherited only if history is engraved in his heart.
At 11 a.m., in a solemn and heavy sound of music, participants were standing up.
The members of the Chinese troupe were dressed in tuxedos, with flowers and a fine pace, to send 10 other war veterans and 4 other war veterans to their companions in a well-structured formation.
The participants in the event paid tribute to the veterans of the war and to the many children in the crowd who, along with their parents, paid tribute to the heroes of the war.
The “Tong Man's Mankind Gardens: The theme park for the fight against war” was established in 2014 as the country's first mausoleum on the theme of fighting against war, created by the Changsha City Council of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in conjunction with Hunan Tang People's Mankind Gardens Limited.
The first phase of the mausoleum, which covers more than 2,000 square metres of land, consists of components such as the Heroes' Indeterminate Monument, the Victory Square, and the War Resisting Heroes.
“Heroes of the Fighter” provides the tombs behind the battle heroes, free of charge, and is praised as “the last barracks of the veterans of the fight”.
Each year, at the end of the anniversary, the mausoleum is marked by large rituals of public sacrifice and burial.
Since 2015, there have been seven collective funeral ceremonies for war veterans, in which 102 war veterans and their companions have fallen asleep.
The newly revised Three Gorges-Gega Dam Water Hub Movement Control Protocol (hereinafter referred to as " Movement Control Protocol " ) was officially implemented on 1 October with the three gorge lifts being tested.
On the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, the waters of the Gorge-Geco Dam were in good order.
On 30 September, at 2100 hours, the Yangtze Three Gorge Shipping Authority issued its first security plan and carried out security checks on 160 vessels, for a total of 124 vessels.
On 1 October, at 1400 hours, the Department arranged the first pass plan following the implementation of the new regulations.
Following the implementation of the new regulations, the security plan is issued once a day at 9 p.m. and at 21 p.m., and the dam plan is issued once a day at 14 p.m. and at 20 p.m., allowing ships the flexibility to arrange the dam plan.
The Movement Control Protocol adds the “classified control” principle for the movement of ships through dams, specifying the priorities of the vessels according to the anchor and the function of the lifter, and adjusting the short-line passenger ships through the locks to the same level of priority as the model and good-faith vessels.
It was also two weeks after the pilot operation of the lift, the movement of the ship was formally harmonized with that of the lock.
For the first time, the river and the tri-fon reservoir areas have also been given priority in large-scale demonstration boats and new energy-powered ships.
At the same time, the Movement Control Directive adjusts “the waters of navigational control” from the previous 180-km peri-dam water to 541.8 km from the Yunyang River Bridge to the Ishi River Head Bridge, and divides “the core waters, the peri-dam waters, the controlled waters, and the controlled waters”.
This would facilitate the selection of suitable waters for locking and reduce the backlog of ships waiting in dam areas.
The Movement Control Order also provides for good faith restrictions such as the cancellation of the declaration of a vessel in violation of the regulations and the 24-hour delay in crossing a dam, based on the current ship ' s dyke and locking characteristics.
As a result of water harvesting in the tri-gorges, the conditions of navigation in the reservoirs have improved, contributing to the rapid development of navigation in the Yangtze.
According to the data, the annual cargo throughput of the three gorges and the Gorge dam has increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons in 2017 and 140 million tons in 2017, respectively.
For the past two years, the Tri-Gorder has been on board 5767 ships, carrying 16.22 million passengers and carrying 1.7128 million tons of cargo.
According to Chen Dongwon, Deputy Director of the Three Gorges Navigation Authority, the Movement Control Directive has a positive effect on promoting integrity in the management of the gates, maintaining traffic order in the two dam hubs, defusing pressure from vessels in the dam area and increasing navigation capacity.
China’s weather network “Eleven” has begun to take a long vacation, and it is expected that during today’s day there will still be a storm of about six or seven in the city and that it is still in the wind and blue warning.
During the holiday period, the weather is beautiful, Beijing is clear, and autumn rains during the night of only five days are suitable for outdoor activities as a whole.
But the difference in temperature is greater than 10°C by day and night, and must be warmer in the morning or later, and beware of the cold.
The temperature in the capital fell further in the morning, when the southern suburb was down to 7.6°C, breaking the 10°C line, reaching 20.2°C during the day, which was very different day and night, and the northern wind blowing, although the weather blew.
This morning, the sky in Beijing was clear and colder.
The eleventh holiday has already begun, and the Beijing Meteorological Station estimates that today's day is cloudy, the north wind is about four, the north wind is about six and seven, the highest temperature is 25°C; the night is clear, the north wind is two and three, the lowest temperature is 12°C.
There is still a great wind-blue warning that the public needs to guard against high-altitude crashes outside the house; the temperature difference is above 10°C, the body is cold in the morning and evening, and the clothing needs to be properly added to the outside.
During the “Eleven” period, the weather in the city was less sunny, cool and comfortable, the whole of which was suitable for outdoor activity, with only five nights of autumn rain arriving in the country, and the public's attention to the proximate forecasts.
Temperatures fell after the rains, especially at night, where the lowest temperature was around 9°C.
The Beijing Meteorological Service Centre released data yesterday, and the autumn in Beijing averaged only 51 days.
The longest autumn in Beijing since 2001 was 67 days in 2003; the shortest fall was in 2017 and only 36 days.
Meteorological experts remind Beijing today that the north wind is larger, the winds are six and seven, and the air is safe.
In the case of dry wind, care should be taken to rehydrate the water and to keep it wet, and to be safe from fire while going out for fun.
Morning and evening travels are chilled and proper clothing needs to be added.
With the approval of Prime Minister Li Keqiang, the State Council recently issued the Decision on the Regulation of the List of Licences for the Production of Industrial Products for Further Depression and Simplified Approval Procedures.
The Decision proposes to further depress the catalogue of industrial production licences, to eliminate 14 categories of industrial production licences, and to delegate the authority for the management of four categories of industrial production licences to the Quality Technical Supervision Department of the People ' s Government at the provincial level.
As a result of this reform, products subject to industrial production licensing will be reduced from last year ' s 38-type pressure to the current 24-category.
The Decision makes it clear that simplified approval procedures are applied to products in the catalogue.
The first is to change the pre-licensing product test from the pre-licensing product test organized by the licensing authority to a product-testing qualification report issued by a qualified inspection body submitted by the enterprise at the time of application.
Second, in addition to hazardous chemicals, there is a back-to-back inspection of licensed products by the Quality Technical Supervision Department of the Provincial People ' s Government (the Market Supervisory Authority). Once an enterprise has submitted an application and a product-testing qualification report with a commitment to ensure the quality of the product, it is able to obtain a production licence after a formal review and then subject to an on-site review within a specified period of time.
Third, when an enterprise produces different categories of products in its catalogue, a licence is reviewed and issued in accordance with the “one-size-fits-all” principle when applying for a new licence or applying for a change of licence.
The Decision requires that the regions and the relevant departments firmly advance the work on the depressive catalogue and the simplification of the approval process.
Increased disclosure of commitments and follow-up of on-site reviews by enterprises, enhanced credit monitoring and restraint instruments, enforcement of corporate responsibility for quality, and revocation of production licences in cases of false promises and non-compliance.
For products that are subject to the removal of industrial production licences, the actual strengthening of ex post regulation involves public health and safety, environmental protection, etc., which can be converted to mandatory certification, positive listings and social publicity, uniform certification standards, reasonable reduction and certification of testing projects, and mandatory certification costs are, in principle, institutionally borne by all levels of finance.
Support measures to encourage voluntary certification by enterprises and to promote branding and market expansion.
International standards are advanced to promote the quality of industrial products.
Full use of the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality safety of industrial products.
For products that are subject to the maintenance of industrial production licences, the standard system should be improved, industry regulatory advantages should be exercised, responsibility for “who approves and who supervises” should be strengthened, product quality safety risks should be assessed in a dynamic manner, catalogues should be reduced at the appropriate time, approval authority should be delegated or converted to certification management.
In September, China's combined PMI ring upgrades and manufacturing PMI rings fall back.
According to data released by the National Statistical Office of China on 30 September, China ' s combined PMI output index was 54.1 per cent in September, higher than the previous month ' s and annual averages of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that China ' s enterprises ' productive activities remained generally stable.
The manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which constituted the composite PMI output index, were 53.0 per cent and 54.9 per cent, respectively, a one-litre drop in the ring.
Of this, China’s manufacturing PMI is 50.8%, and the ring is 0.5 percentage points down.
According to Zhao Qinghe, the manufacturing industry PMI was characterized in five ways this month:
The first is that the basics of manufacturing are generally stable.
Of the 21 industries surveyed, 14 are located in expansionary areas, with manufacturing PMIs, such as pharmaceuticals, specialized equipment and electrical and mechanical equipment, at higher operating levels of 53.5 per cent or more, increasing faster.
The second is the small volatility of supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0 per cent and 52.0 per cent, respectively, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, and supply and demand continued to be stable, but expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and the import index were 48.0 per cent and 48.5 per cent, respectively, lower than 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points in the previous month, and the climate was at its lowest point in the year.
The fourth is the increased cost of purchasing raw materials from enterprises.
The primary raw material acquisition price index was 59.8 per cent, an increase of 1.1 percentage points over the previous month, and the exit price index was 54.3 per cent, which was the same as the previous month, all of which was higher during the year.
The fifth is the robust operation of large enterprises and the continued improvement of small-scale enterprise operations.
The PMI for large enterprises is 52.1 per cent, which is the same as last month. The index has remained at an expansion rate of 52.0 per cent or more since this year, and the production index and the new order index ratio have increased this month, which is the main driving force behind the expansion of the manufacturing sector; the PMI for medium-sized enterprises is 48.7 per cent.
In that month, China ' s non-manufacturing business activity index was 54.9 per cent, an increase of 0.7 percentage points over the previous month and a two-month recovery.
According to Zhao Qinghe, the overall development of non-manufacturing industries continues to be steady and positive.
The index of business activity in sectors such as road transport, securities, real estate, etc. continues to be below the critical point, with a decrease in total business volume.
On November 5th, Reuters Nagoya - The Governor of the Central Bank of Japan, Kuroda, said on Monday that the Central Bank was aware that the long-term implementation of ultra-lax monetary policy could squeeze financial institutions’ profit margins and could destabilize the country’s banking system.
However, he said that given the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Central Bank of Japan needed to maintain its large-scale stimulus plan while paying close attention to the advantages and disadvantages of its policies.
“The Central Bank of Japan fully recognizes that, under continued monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected,” said Toyoshi Kuroda in his speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He argued that the banking system could be volatile in the event of serious negative shocks if financial institutions were more proactive in taking on the risks to compensate for the shrinking profit margins caused by low interest rates over the years.
“Although these risks are not so great at present, the central bank will follow the situation closely and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures,” he said.
The minutes of the meeting of the Central Bank of Japan, which were published earlier on Monday, showed that the cost of long-term easing policies was rising during the September summit, which was discussed by the Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Japan.
According to the minutes of the meeting, one member argued that “the central bank of Japan will have more policy flexibility in the future if the economy continues to expand.”
The minutes of the meeting showed that another member argued that the Committee should discuss how long the central bank of Japan could sustain the stimulus policy, given its limits on the duration of the policy.
According to Tohiko Kuroda, the Central Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks associated with easing policies, taking into account the uncertainty surrounding Japan’s economic prospects, which could affect global demand as a result of trade frictions and growing protectionism in the US and China.
“The impact of such problems on Japan’s economy is limited for the time being,” said Toyoko Kuroda.
“How problems persist, however, the impact on the Japanese economy may become greater,” he added.
“There is a need to sustain strong monetary easing policies while considering both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner,” said Dong-il Kuroda.
Despite the increase in the ills of radical stimulus schemes, such as long-term low interest rates, which erode the profitability of financial institutions, low inflation has forced the Central Bank of Japan to maintain the scheme.
The Central Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the war dispute over global trade, the possibility of an increase in interest rates in the near future was ruled out.
Business ID for Tesla electric vehicle, Cardiff, United States, 1 June 2018.
Under a settlement agreement, the United States Tesla car and its executive director, Mask, had agreed to pay a fine of $20 million to the financial regulatory agency, and Mask would resign from his position as Chairman of the company but would remain in the CEO position.
The settlement agreement will end two months of turmoil in Tesla.
This settlement agreement for alleged securities fraud, disclosed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday, would reassure investors.
Investors feared that protracted legal disputes would only further damage the still-deficit electric car company.
The SEC sued Mask for fraud on Thursday, alleging that its tweets of 7 August were misleading to investors.
According to the tweets, he was considering privatizing Tesla at $420 per share and obtaining financing.
According to SEC, the tweets were virtually unfounded and the resulting market turmoil harmed investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts argued that the agreement could reinforce Tesla, which had been hit hard by the recent behaviour of Mask.
Steven Heim, the head of Boston Common's asset management, stated that the settlement agreement should have made Mask more supervised, without taking “destructive” measures to remove him from Tesla.
The asset management company held the stock of Panasonic, a battery manufacturer in Tesla.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla had to appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop controls over Mask ' s external communications.
“It is in the best interests of our markets and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, to resolve the matter quickly on agreed terms,” Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
The charges on Thursday resulted in the evaporation of a market value of approximately $7 billion for Tesla, which was $45.2 billion on Friday, down from $47.5 billion for general purpose vehicles.
In the settlement agreement, the SEC withdrew its demand to remove Mask from the post of head of the company.
Many investors claimed that the penalty would be disastrous.
“I think it's the best possible outcome for all concerned,” Ivan Finnseth of Tigress Financial Partners said, Feinseth gave Tesla a “neutral” rating and said that the SEC sanction was “from” to Mask.
“He's still a CEO for Tesla.”
Neither Mask nor Tesla recognized or denied the EC ' s allegations in the settlement agreement, nor did they respond immediately to the request for assessment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the courts.
A reporter from Beijing Morning News (Reporter Wang Ping) learned a day ago from the Beijing Builders Group that one of the core buildings of the Beijing World Park Park complex - the Beijing World Park Show Square project will for the first time use a multi-colored ETFE puzzle structure with 5440 m2 of film
According to Liu Jiabao, Project Manager, Construction Construction Group Five, Beijing, 4,500 m2 of construction area, with a total of 1,182 tons of steel installed, the steel-structured housing is supported by an amplifier with a 26-story umbrella, which is presented under the Lasso steel strangulation line.

Previously, the monocolour ETFE membrane structure had been widely applied to bird nests, water cubes, etc., but the multi-coloured ETFE membrane structure was the first in the country.
Journalists learned that since there are very few suppliers with multiple coloured structures worldwide, each inch of the structure material is “precious”.
Liu Changbao said that, in order to avoid overlaps in the position of the headlines and “fights”, the “two fork” header structure would also be innovative, ensuring that the “fight” headlines were placed in the right place through a specially designed fixed plug.
The construction of the World Park Park complex in Beijing is currently under way.
Of these, the international pavilion project has completed all the “carrying umbrellas”.
It is planned that the conditions for the display will be in place by the end of October.

Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Monday that China ' s opening of doors would not be closed, but would only be wider, and that the move towards a higher level of openness would not stop.
The expansion of imports is not an equity measure, but a long-term consideration for the future, and China ' s imports of goods and services are expected to exceed $30 trillion and $10 trillion, respectively, over the next 15 years.
Xi Jinping delivered a keynote address at the first China International Import Fair. China will further reduce tariffs, accelerate the development of new industries such as cross-border power suppliers, continuously liberalize market access, promote the opening of services, and ease foreign equity restrictions in areas such as education and health, where there is a large gap in the domestic market.
China will protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors.

After countless storms, the sea is still there!
After 5,000 years of hard work, China is still there!
For the future, China will always be here."
He pointed out that economic globalization had suffered a great deal, that multilateralism and the free trade regime had been shaken, that instability remained numerous and that risk challenges had increased; that open cooperation was an important engine for enhancing international economic and trade cooperation, and that countries should maintain openness, expand space for mutually beneficial development and enhance macroeconomic coordination.

The Secretary-General of Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private enterprise symposium, instilling firm confidence in the transition of the private economy to a wider arena.
The Secretary-General of Xi Yingping stressed that “let entrepreneurs take off the burden of thinking and move on lightly” created a strong resonance among a wide range of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market dynamism comes from people, especially entrepreneurs, and from entrepreneurship.
In the 40 years of reform and opening-up, there have been millions of stories of entrepreneurial innovation, and the growth of the entrepreneurial community has constantly driven China ' s economy forward.
For some time now, people in society have made some negative and skeptical statements about the private economy.
Misperceptions such as the so-called “private economy abstinence” and the “new public-private partnership” have raised doubts and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
Recently, a number of private enterprises have encountered difficulties and problems in their development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some exporting firms; rapid adjustment of demand structures has put pressure on transformation and upgrading; some policies have been uncoordinated, policy effects have overlapped, or the working methods have been simple, leading to the opposite effect of some initially well-intentioned policies.
There is a combination of factors, difficulties in the private economy, difficulties in the operation of some private enterprises, and considerable anxiety on the part of entrepreneurs.
In this context, it is particularly relevant to correct the misperceptions of perceptions, to remove the burden of entrepreneurship, to allow enterprises to pursue development with one mind, and for the Government to promote development with one heart, with regard to market confidence and development expectations.
The symposium once again highlighted the important assertion that “three have not changed”: “The status and role of the non-public economy in the country's economic and social development have not changed!”
From further decentralization, the establishment of a power inventory system to the creation of a rule of law environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, the creation of a level playing field and a society-wide climate of respect for entrepreneurs, in recent years there has been unprecedented attention to entrepreneurship and institutional safeguards at the party central level.
The symposium was a clear demonstration of policy initiatives that strongly supported the six dimensions of private enterprise development and launched a series of practical actions aimed at “light-loading forwards” for private enterprises.
All this is a source of great encouragement for the entrepreneurial community and greater expectations for all sectors of society.
The fog spreads, the guidelines are set, and the key is implementation.
It is important to constantly create a better environment for the development of the private economy, to help private enterprises to solve the difficulties of development and to help to upgrade China ' s economic transformation; and to make entrepreneurs feel fair in competing in the market, safe in their legitimate operations, respectful in their social life, dynamic innovation and creative potential.
The Chinese economy had entered the process of moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to pursue their ambitions and providing greater space and arena for entrepreneurs to play their creative role.
We have reason to believe that, as reforms are further deepened and obstacles removed, the private economy will usher in better development prospects and opportunities, leading to a wider arena.
All 46 regulatory certificates of the Inner Mongolia import/export chain are verified online - new in-line
According to Sino-newshu and Hoat's 5 November call (journalist Lee Aiping) and Hut customs news, all 46 regulatory certificates from the local import and export chain have been verified online since that date, except for exceptional circumstances such as the need for confidentiality.
Inner Mongolia enterprises can declare relevant documents to customs in a paperless manner, avoiding problems such as past field runs, paper applications, repeated submissions, etc.
It is understood that the timing of document preparation, which refers to the preparation time for the various types of documents required for the import and export chain prior to the declaration, is a major factor affecting the overall time of customs clearance, which must be reduced if customs clearance time is to be reduced and customs clearance costs reduced.
Previously, 86 types of control documents had been required for customs clearance at the import and export levels, involving 19 departments.
This time, according to the principle of “cancan be cancelled, can be merged, can be withdrawn from check-out at ports”, the international trade “single window” platform, where customs interfaces with 16 other licensing agency systems and data interconnections have resulted in data multi-routing and less business-legged.
Customs stated that in the past, businesses had had to submit paper applications to and from the field halls of the departments concerned, and that the process was lengthy and did not allow for real-time follow-up of the audit status.
Business users now have direct access to the “Single Window” portal for online applications.
Once approved by the licensing authority, electronic certificate data are transmitted to Customs and automatically compared to customs clearance data, smart verifications are carried out at the customs clearance point. The results are sent to enterprises through a single window in a uniform manner, which enables the full-process web-based processing of regulatory document declarations, clearances, customs clearances and feedbacks.
The export of Han Xin chicken soup to China has increased 20 times in four years or has been associated with an increase in the number of young people in empty nests - the China-New Network.
The export of Chinese chicken soup to China has increased 20 times in four years.
KLA reported on 5 that last year Korean chicken soup exports to China totalled more than $100,000, a sharp increase of about 20 times over the year 2013 four years ago.
According to the analysis, this increase is related to the increase in the number of young people in empty nests in China, which has facilitated the sale of food, as well as to the increased interest of young people in feeding.
This data was published on 5th day by the Korea Agricultural and Aquatic Food Circulation Society (AT).
Last year, exports of Chinese chicken soup to China amounted to $1003.39 million, weighing 21.859 million kg, a sharp increase of 2094 per cent and 3668.8 per cent, respectively, compared to 2013.
The analysis found that the increase in sales of Chinese chicken soup in China is linked to an increase in the number of young people in empty nests, which is responsible for facilitating the sale of food, as well as an increase in young people ' s interest in nutritious food.
As of this year, one-person households in China have broken the 200 million mark and are expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020, and local food companies have been targeting the “single” community for a variety of convenient food items.
In addition, the analysis indicates that avian influenza is the single biggest impediment to the mainland Chinese market for chicken soup.
According to aT, the avian influenza epidemic in Korea between November 2016 and April of last year resulted in a drastic reduction in exports due to a total ban on exports of chicken soup to China.
Exports of chicken soup to China in 2016 amounted to $840,000, and exports fell sharply to $100,000 last year as a result of avian flu.
The publication of the report of the First Forum on Quality Development of Embassied Companies and the Report of Ensign's Public Company was held in Hoon Fat City.
The Permanent Committee and Permanent Vice-President of the Anhui Provincial Council, Deng, stated to Yang that the forum was designed to create an integrated communication platform for cross-border integration and integration, and that it was of great relevance to promoting healthy growth of companies listed on the Anhui market, building capital markets and building up an innovative and modern industrial system.

Shang stated that there was an urgent need to promote the upgrading of the Ensign economy to achieve high-quality development, and that there was a need for efficiency gains at the company level to play a leading role in the geese.
It is hoped that this forum will serve as a starting point for the creation of a co-building, sharing and sharing platform for the integration of `property research institutes' to form strategic alliances around listed companies and the `investment + investment' capital biosphere.
The provincial capital composts an absolute lead in the number of 45 listed companies over other municipalities in the province.
In terms of industry distribution, the number of companies listed in Anhui covers 13 sectors, with nearly 70 per cent concentrated in manufacturing, with a low percentage of companies listed in strategic and emerging industries and in high-technology industries.
The largest Mandarin Festival of South America was held in Lima, the capital of Peru.
The event, which was organized by local fans in Peru for a period of four days, is expected to reach 100,000 visitors.

U.S. battleships are once again approaching China's South China Sea reef.
United States officials revealed on Sunday (30 September 2018) that the United States Navy destroyer USS Decatur was on the eve of China ' s eleventh national holiday in the sea near the island of the South China Sea, which was declared sovereign by Beijing.
According to a 30-day CIA comprehensive outcry report, the United States destroyer USS Decatur was asked to reveal that it was within 12 nautical miles of Gaven Reef and Johnson Reef in the South Sha Islands.
The official stated that the United States would continue to do so in the future, as it had done in the past, on a routine and regular mission of free navigation.
It was also reported that United States President Trump accused Beijing of attempting to interfere in the United States Congress elections and of putting pressure on Beijing on behalf of Washington into a new phase.
This followed in May this year the entry of two United States naval vessels into the sea near the islands of the South China Sea, over which China claims sovereignty.
A comment from Washington suggested that this could provoke China at a time of tension between China and the United States.
Reuters Washington, 5 November - The United States renewed sanctions on Iran ' s oil and financial industry on Monday and increased pressure on Iran to limit Iran ' s missile and nuclear programmes and to curb Iran ' s growing military and political influence in the Middle East region.
This initiative would restore the sanctions lifted by the United States under the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement and add 300 new targets for Iranian oil, shipping, insurance and banking.
Details of the sanctions will be published at the 1330 GMT press conference by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Financial Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
The United States indicated that it would temporarily allow eight importing sites to continue to purchase Iranian oil, including major buyers of Iranian oil such as China, India, Korea, Japan and Turkey, in order to ensure that crude oil prices remained stable.
United States officials indicated that those countries would place funds paid to Iran in a trust account.

In the light of the almost complete impact of Typhoon 24 of this year on the coastal and marine areas of Fujian, as reported by the Fujian Ministry Anti-Trait Response Office, the typhoon response was terminated on 30 September at 1000 hours.
The typhoon “Pang-mi” began its shift at noon on 29th, moving in the north-east direction and gradually moving away from Fujian province, and at 0800 hours on 30th it was located at the heart of the typhoon some 140 km from south easteast of Kagoshima, Japan.
As a result, at 0800 hours on 30 September at the Fujian Meteorological Station, the “Marine Wind Warning Level III” was lifted.
Previously, as of 1100 hours on 28 September, in order to guard against typhoons, Fujian had evacuated 268 fishing boats and transferred 2,282 vulnerable women, children and elderly persons from fishing rows.
On the occasion of the celebration of the National Day, a flag-raising ceremony was held at the mouth of the Central Viet Nam border.
“I can’t imagine such a spectacular flag-raising ceremony at the border is more shocking than watching the flag-raising in the interior.”
In the morning of 1 January, Mr. Zhang, who had travelled from Sichuan to the Yunnan River Port on the border between China and China, joined more than 500 troops, residents and tourists from China to observe the flag-raising ceremony to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China.
The estuary is the largest port in the Yunnan sector of the Central Viet Nam border and is located in Yunnan Province, the county of the Red River State. It is situated in the same country as the old street city of Viet Nam.
As the country's “one-way” construction deepens, and as one of the most convenient routes for China to connect to South-East Asia, the flow of border crossings from and to the estuary has steadily increased.
At 7.30 a.m. on the same day, when the sun had just opened, the local population of the estuary and visitors from both the centre and the south had gathered early in the restricted area of the estuary to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 0745 hours, the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the members of the National Tribute Brigade at the border checkpoint at the estuary swollen their spirits, escorting the flag to the flag-raising table at a robust pace.
Following the commanding officer's instructions to raise the flag, raise the flag and wave out an arc, and the bright five-star red flag stretches its flag like the eagle's wings, accompanied by a slow rise in the high rhythm of the national anthem.
“The celebration of the National Day flag ceremony at every significant time of New Year’s Day, Spring Day, and National Day not only shows China’s image, but also inspires the love of the nation’s peoples.”
The soldiers and soldiers who took part in this flag-raising ceremony said so.
According to the information received, the National Tribute Brigade, which is responsible for the flag-raising ceremony at the estuary, consists of more than 40 troops from various positions at the border posts at the estuary, from the 3-person flag-raising team to the size of the Tribune, which has gone through more than 60 years since its establishment and has carried out State-level foreign affairs ceremonies since its inception.
The newly amended personal income tax law adjusts the criteria for determining the income tax of residents of China from one full year to 183 days.
In order to maintain policy stability, China ' s Ministry of Finance and the relevant head of the State Tax Administration stated on 30th that the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing preferential arrangements for persons outside China, including Hong Kong and Macao.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that the implementing regulations of the current personal income tax law provide for special benefits for the taxation of persons outside China. Individuals who do not have residence in China but who have resided for more than one year or more than five years may pay personal income tax only in respect of part of the unit or individual paid in China.
The portion paid outside China is not subject to personal income tax in China.
The Chinese Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxes, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce have also issued circulars extending the scope of application of the policy of withholding income tax from foreign investors in order to distribute profit direct investment.
The allocation of profits to foreign investors from residential enterprises in China for direct domestic investment is suspended from the application of the pre-tax policy and is extended from the foreign investment incentive category to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and areas.
During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, some positive messages were released on the Korean peninsula.
The Korean President recapitulated the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's “irreversible” determination to abandon nuclear weapons and stated that United States President Trump and North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un might meet before the end of this year.
The United States Department of State subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompeyo would visit the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea in October to facilitate the implementation of the commitments made by the leader of the United States and the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea, Singapore, to meet.
From the beginning of this year to the present, inter-Korean efforts to break the ice have opened the way for dialogue, with meetings between the leaders of the two Koreas and the United States of America, the general trend towards de-escalation of the situation on the peninsula has continued and the principle of dialogue to resolve the problems on the peninsula has been upheld.
First, “the essence of the question of the peninsula is security” remains the same, and the key to achieving peace on the peninsula lies in the proper and balanced resolution of the legitimate security concerns of all parties, rather than a mere pressure on each other to emphasize their own claims.
Secondly, in the dialogue to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned are still divided on the steps and ways to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, and the “who is the first” game is still strong, owing to the long-standing lack of political trust between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States.
At the Council's previous open meeting on the Korean peninsula, held at United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices surrounding the issue of sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea once again highlighted these two points of “no change” in the case of the peninsula.
United States Secretary of State Pompeyo insisted that the sanctions against the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea would not be lifted until the Korean peninsula was completely denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, on the other hand, stressed the principle of “action in response”, noting that “the downward trend in sanctions should be the same as the step taken by North Korea on the step-by-step nuclear path”.
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement fully, fully and accurately the resolutions of the Security Council relating to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but that pressure is not an end and that the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are the requirements of the resolutions of the Council, both of which must not be sidelined or chosen.
As stated by the State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, Wang Yi, in the light of the current positive developments in inter-Korean and inter-Korean relations with the United States, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider the timely initiation of reversible provisions, thereby encouraging the DPRK and the parties concerned to take further steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process require sufficient political courage on all sides.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community for a political solution to the issue of the peninsula, it is particularly important that the parties show political courage, make political decisions, fulfil their commitments and resolve their difficulties, and continue to move forward on a step-by-step basis to advance the process of denuclearization of the peninsula in parallel with the establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula and to work together towards the establishment of a permanent peace on the peninsula.
A message was received from the People ' s Government of the Kikang District, Pingxi Province, on 1 day that the Yellow River Casket Area, located in the county, would remain at a relatively high level of water during the National Day and would not be open.
In order to ensure security, the scenery area was temporarily closed during the National Day.
The yellow pot mouth waterfall is the second largest waterfall in China, the largest yellow waterfall in the world.
The Yellow River has reached this point, and the walls of the two sides are stunned and the mouths of the river are bound as small as the mouths of the pots, forming the “one pot of the thousand miles of the Yellow River”.
According to journalists, the yellow river period of June to October of each year began on 12 July 2018, with the closure of the canal area in the Shanxi river, due to its high water level, for a cumulative period of almost one month.
Nie Woo Feng, the chief engineer of the Casino State Management Board, told the media that this was the longest time that the Yellow River's high water levels had lasted for nearly 20 years, “not so long ago, we closed in 2017 for four days, and almost a month this year.”
It is understood that, in order to meet the golden week of 11, the yellow canal waterfalls in Shanxi were preceded by additional staffing and vehicle maintenance, and even the hiring of temporary staff.
According to the circular issued by the Office of the General Command for Drought Control of the Yellow River on the implementation of the Yellow River during the National Day, the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan and Shandong were asked to do the National Day.
Currently, the main flow of the Yellow River is large, with the flow of the upper river remaining at 2,000 to 3,000 cubic metres per second, the flow of the middle river remaining at 2,500 to 3,500 cubic metres per second, and the flow of the lower river remaining at 3,000 cubic metres per second.
Influenza vaccination services are provided at health centres and health stations, especially during the national holiday
The Department of Health ordered 150,000 doses of a four-priced influenza vaccine for 2018-2019 this year, giving priority at this stage to high-risk persons for free vaccination against influenza during public holidays. Health centres and health posts under the Department of Health, especially during the National Day holiday (1 and 2 October), are scheduled from 9 a.m. to noon.
In addition to the above-mentioned measures for the population, since the introduction of the programme in health centres and health posts under the Department of Health, the influenza vaccination service has been extended from Monday to Friday until 8 p.m., and 4,158 people have been vaccinated as at 4 p.m. on 30 September, which is more than 3,714 in the same period last year.
Free vaccinations are provided to the following Macao residents: persons under 6 months to 18 years of age, persons over 50 years of age, pregnant women, all chronically ill persons, including obese persons (i.e. persons with a physical quality index BMI of 30 or more), as well as employees of institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools
At the same time, other persons, including the public sector, who are deemed necessary by the Department of Health, will contact the relevant agencies on their own initiative to obtain the list and arrange the vaccination at the health centre.
In order to facilitate vaccinations and reduce waiting times, the Department of Health will send health-care personnel between October and December of this year to Benwa Secondary School, Primary School, Kindergartens and Nurseries to provide group influenza vaccinations for young children, young and middle-school students, teachers and employees, etc.
Students and young children who are unable to participate in group vaccinations may be vaccinated at the vaccination stations or health centres of the General Hospital of the Count of Insein on 3 December 2018 with the Macao identity card, the Health Board user card, the influenza vaccination card (if any), the student certificate, the employee certificate or the vocational certificate.
The Department of Health reminded the population that between September 2017 and August 2018, persons who had been vaccinated against the influenza from 2017 to 2018 had yet to be vaccinated against a new flu season since September 2018, as the influenza antigen component of the influenza vaccine for the northern hemisphere from 2018 to 2019 had been updated
In Macao, the peak of influenza typically occurs in January-March of each year, later than in temperate regions (e.g., North China and Japan), and the Health Board calls upon high-risk persons, such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese persons and chronic patients, who are more vulnerable to complications following the influenza pandemic, as well as those who are in frequent contact with high-risk persons, to do so as early as possible.
On September 30th, the NBA champions started a fierce war with the forest wolves in the main field this morning, and Rore Dune, who joined the forest wolves in the summer, helped the team with a key catch-up basket to take a victory from the playground.
First of all, the wolf is the first to win the ball, and Ross is the first to hit the field.
The Braves are responding with an empty buttoned-up by Jones.
As a result, Curi Durant was killed and Ross and Tig were immersed and engaged in confrontation.
At the end of the first period, the warriors were at 36:37 Forest Wolf.
In the second section, the rotation exercise took place, with both teams having a lower hit rate.
The warriors scored inversely out of a few baskets.
They then played a wave of 8:1 small climax to split the score.
The wolves depend on the points of Tig and Dons.
Half-battle, man, 71:65 Forest Wolf.
The war was resumed by a wave of warriors at 5:0 to stop the forest wolves.
Pauseed back, the warriors have maintained a very, very high lead.
In the second half of section III, in a stand-off, the forest wolves began to score.
After a wave of small climax of 16:3, the forest wolf of 94:92 ended section III.
In the fourth round of the game, the wolf came up with another wave of 6:0 lakhs, and the brave Derekson hit a two-point-three to help the team stop the decline.

On the evening of 29 September, journalists were informed by the Communications Department of the Qing Baijiang District Committee in Cheng City that on the evening of 29 September Beijing time, a Central European row (Sengdu), full of goods such as car connectors, telescopes, liquid crystal displays, was converted via the Chemia Nufka port in Poland.
This was the first time that the country ' s Central European bane opened the Polish Chemianufka crossing line, marking the successful opening of another European transport line in Central Europe after Mara and Jopp.
The Central European class, which began on 14 September at a station in Chengdu Qingqing Shih River, exited through the Arasan crossing, entered Europe via the Polish Chemianufka crossing and eventually arrived in Nuremberg, Germany, for a total duration of about 16 days.
For the first time, the Central European class travels here to perform the line wide-track and track change operation.
The opening of the crossing effectively resolved the problems of long operations and long periods of time caused by the current traffic congestion at the Mara crossing, raised the ban on transport and provided new solutions to the problem of traffic congestion at the Mara crossing, further enhanced the transport capacity and efficiency of China's western hinterland to the Euro-Mediterranean market and opened up the European market for Central Europe.
With a 7.5-class earthquake on Friday in Sulawesi, Indonesia, more than 400 people have now been confirmed dead, many of whom have been swept away by the earthquake-induced tsunami.
The authorities expect a significant increase in the total number of Sunday deaths as new data are reported in remote areas.
Dozens of people are reportedly still trapped in the ruins of a hotel and a shopping mall in Baru City.
The earthquake triggered a wave of up to six metres (20 feet) that hit the city of Baru.
To date, only the number of deaths has come from Baru, the number of deaths reported in Dungla, north of Baru, is slow, and the authorities are preparing for a worse situation.
The population of Donguela is 300,000, closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
According to Vice-President Kara of Indonesia, the total number of deaths is likely to rise to thousands.
As the waves hit the coast on Friday at dusk, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate the festival, many were washed away by the waves and everything was destroyed wherever they reached.
According to a quarterly short-view survey published by the Central Bank of Japan on Monday, 1 October in Tokyo, the confidence of large Japanese manufacturers in the September season reached its lowest level in more than a year, owing to rising raw material costs and the effects of a series of natural disasters on production, which put pressure on businesses.
The survey hardly showed that the escalating friction of global trade undermined the confidence of large manufacturers.
However, the risk of a full-scale trade war undermines business prospects and can threaten corporate capital spending.
Active capital expenditure is one of the bright spots in the Japanese economy.
The survey called into question the view of the Central Bank of Japan that a sound economic expansion would help to accelerate inflation to the 2 per cent target, although there were indications that firms were gradually passing costs on to customers.
“In the context of concerns raised by the global trade war, the confidence of manufacturers has stagnated as a result of the slowdown in exports and weak factory production,” expressed Nan Takeshi, the chief researcher at the Golden General Research Institute in Agroforestry.
“Consumption is still high. And I don’t think confidence will continue to decline as business profits improve and prices rise.”
Short-view surveys show that the large manufacturing landscape judgement index in September declined from positive 21 three months ago to positive 19 and deteriorated for the third consecutive season.
The market estimate is 22 positive median.
In September, the large non-manufacturing weather judgement index fell from a positive 24 to a positive 22 survey in June, with the first deterioration in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey is positive 22.
The survey showed that both large manufacturing and non-manufacturing climate judgement indices remained stable in December.
Investors do not care about the decline in the short-term business climate judgement index, which rises on Monday, N 225, to a 27-year high, as the yen continues to depreciate and helps improve the export profitability prospects of Japanese enterprises.
Capital expenditure is robust.
Despite the decline in corporate confidence, the latest short view highlights the robustness of business capital expenditure plans, the benefits of renewed capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to respond to labour shortages resulting from population ageing.
A survey by central banks shows that large enterprises planned to increase capital spending by 13.4 per cent in the current fiscal year until March 2019.
The previous short view survey was 13.6 per cent.
Nan Wuzhi said that capital spending on all enterprises was planned to increase by 8.5 per cent in the current fiscal year, close to the pace of Japan’s bubble economy.
“There is still room for further growth in capital spending, given the expected increase in small-scale businesses’ profits from now on, but much depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence.”
Short-view surveys showing an increased ability of enterprises to transfer costs, with a positive 7 value index for large enterprises, a high point in the decade, are encouraging signs of progress in Japan ' s efforts to combat deflation.
The index for measuring employment in large enterprises, which reaches negative 23, is the most compact level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
Thanks to strong corporate spending, the second quarter of the Japanese economy rebounded from the contraction of January-March this year.
However, the upgrading of trade frictions in the summer and the disruption of the supply chain by natural disasters have overshadowed the prospects of the Japanese economy, which is dependent on exports.
In United States dollars, the rate of increase in services imports and exports is 16.4 per cent.
The Ministry of Commerce website press release quoted the head of the Division of Services and Trade as stating that exports and imports of new and emerging services had exceeded $1 trillion in January-August, increasing faster than overall.
Of this total, exports and imports of new services increased by 20.9 per cent by 1,138.3 billion yuan, exceeding the overall rate of increase in services imports and exports by 10.4 percentage points, and by almost 3 percentage points the share of new services.
In the area of services exports, in January-August, services exports continued the rapid growth momentum since this year, with exports growing at a faster rate than imports at 5.7 percentage points.
Among them, the top three areas of growth were telecommunications computers and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, and insurance services, which increased by 61.1 per cent, 38.8 per cent and 26.5 per cent, respectively.
The Officer-in-Charge of the Division also noted that the share of imports of new and emerging services had also risen steadily in January-August.
Emerging services imports grew rapidly in January-August, reaching 23.6 per cent, an increase of 1.6 percentage points over the same period last year.
Of these, imports of financial services, royalties on intellectual property rights, telecommunications computers and information services have increased by more than 20 per cent, at 47.1 per cent, 23.3 per cent and 23.2 per cent, respectively.

Indeed, China has developed particularly well in recent years and has made me happy.
Happy birthday to the Chinese people!
The price of oil, or a “three-in-one” rise, can be fully replenished ahead of schedule on the occasion of the national holiday.
On 30 September, at 2400 hours, a new round of price-fixing windows for finished oils will be opened in conjunction with the long holiday at the National Day.
A number of agencies forecast a substantial increase in oil prices to achieve a “three-in-one” increase.
The owners of the car, who plan to travel on their own, can fill the car with fuel before the price increases.
Based on data from crowd-based estimates, it is estimated that the relative increase in domestic finished oils will be around $190 per ton, and 220 per ton.
In September, there were two increases in oil prices: 180 ton for petrol on 3 September, 170 ton for diesel, 145 ton for petrol on 17 September and 145 ton for diesel on 17 September.
Domestic oil prices have been linked to international oil prices, and international oil prices have risen since the current round of prices, and Brent crude oil has continued to be explored after it has crossed the $80 threshold.
As of 28 September, the volume of WTI crude oil futures in the United States had increased by $1.13 to $73.25 per barrel.
Brent ' s crude oil futures increased by USD 1.0 to USD 82.72 per barrel.
“In the light of the international situation, tensions such as the United States sanctions against Iran have increased, and oil prices have generally tended to be biased, followed by a clear refusal by the OPEC Conference to increase production, giving market confidence, and a steady upturn in oil prices.”
According to Drozen's information-based oil analyst, Xu Wen.
On the retail side, the current prices for petrol in Beijing are $7.66 and $8.15 per litre for petroleum and petrochemical gas stations and No. 95, respectively.
According to Li Ying, the public information analyst, there has been no significant change in the marketing promotion strategy for gas stations, which currently have preferential margins of 0.5-0.7 yuan per litre for major stations, such as Central petrochemicals, and 0.5-1.2 yuan per litre for private stations.
“The retail price of this round is about ‘three consecutive increases’, which rises by about US$0.14-0.16, suggesting that the owners of private cars should refuel before the long holiday comes.”
School students are subjected to corporal punishment by their teachers for making mistakes, the schools involved are disqualified from the annual Qualifications - the new Chinese network.

There has been a recent response from parents that Suning 1st grade 6 girls have been beaten at school by class math teachers for having made mistakes, causing widespread concern.
Subsequently, an investigation team was set up by the New District Social Services Department in Suining City to investigate, interrogate, gather evidence from the site and remove the teachers involved from their positions.

Opening of the 69th International Astronautical Congress in Germany -- China New Network
The 69th International Astronautical Congress was inaugurated on October 1st at the Bremen Exhibition Centre in Germany by Xinhua Society Bremen, Germany, on October 1st, with the participation of more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and businesses, academics and young students from all over the world.
In his opening address, the President of the International Astronautical Federation, Jean-Yve Legar, said that the cause of global space was no longer a mere minority of countries and institutions and that the number of participants had increased significantly over the previous session this year, indicating that an increasing number of institutions and individuals were joining.
He called on States to strengthen cooperation and innovation and to work together to advance the cause of space.
In attending the exchange, the Vice-Minister of Industry and Informationization of China and Director of the National Space Agency, Zhang Ke Yiu, presented China ' s space programme and indicated that China would expand international cooperation in the field of space and contribute to the cause of space for mankind.
The participation of representatives of relevant institutions such as the China Space Science and Technology Group and the China Space Science and Technology Group, as well as a number of private enterprises, demonstrated the latest achievements in Chinese space, including launch vehicles, satellites and space science and technology applications.
The International Astronautical Congress, which has been held annually since 1950, is the largest gathering of the world ' s aviation community.
The Congress, which lasted five days, was co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Centre for Applied Science and Microgravity Research of Bremen University and the International Institute of Space Law.
According to a press release issued by Reuters Beijing on 5 November - China ' s Foreign Trade Centre on Sunday, the Hiroshima Conference showed that China ' s foreign trade situation remained complex and that 80.6 per cent of businesses were expected to export better than the previous year or even more than the previous year in 2018.
However, taking into account the external environment, where the cost of domestic raw materials, labour, etc., is constantly rising, and where trade friction between China and the United States is increasing, participating enterprises at the same time consider that the export situation next year is not promising.
At the closing press conference of the 124th ordinary session, the Deputy Secretary-General of the inaugural meeting, the press spokesperson and the Deputy Director of the China Foreign Trade Centre, Xu Jun, stated that the number of foreign buyers arriving and the number of exports at the current session had fallen by the same amount.
There were 189,812 participants from 215 countries and territories, a decrease of 1.11 per cent over the same period.
Exports amount to RMB 2,064,494 million (equivalent to $29,860 million), a decrease of 1 per cent over the same period.
From the market point of view, for Japan, for the 10 ASEAN countries, for the BRIC countries, for Korea, it grew by 74.4 per cent, for 11.4 per cent, for 7.2 per cent, for 2.5 per cent, and for the traditional markets of the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union, respectively, it fell by 30.3 per cent.
In terms of industry, transport, mechanical equipment, building and decoration materials, electronic consumer goods and information products and bathing equipment grew by 24.8 per cent, 21.1 per cent, 20.0 per cent, 15.1 per cent and 7.6 per cent respectively, while textile clothing and domestic appliances fell by 13 per cent.
Xu has indicated that, as a barometer and a wind sign of China ' s foreign trade, the data on the participation and exports of the buyers at this meeting show that China ' s foreign trade development will continue to face a number of uncertainties and uncertainties in the coming year.
However, as structural reforms on the supply side are advanced and as national and local policy measures have recently been introduced, such as the “six-stable” approach, the new dynamic of China's foreign trade development is accelerating and new progress is being made in diversifying the enterprise market, which is an important basis and a strong condition for the development of foreign trade.
“With a combination of factors, China’s foreign trade exports and imports are expected to grow steadily throughout the year, with further improvements in quality and efficiency.”
The General Customs Administration of China announced a 14.5 per cent increase in exports in United States dollars in September, a 14.3 per cent increase in imports in September, a $31,690 billion trade surplus in September, and the highest export growth and trade surplus since February this year.
China ' s export performance in September, despite rising trade frictions between China and the United States, continued to outpace expectations, with strong external demand, the collapse of firms ' exports and the devaluation of the renminbi before the United States imposed customs duties, or the main supporting factors, showing, to some extent, the resilience of China ' s foreign trade, but the impact of the China-United States trade war on confidence
According to the Reuters survey, in September, the United States fund manager recommended an increase in cash holdings, maintaining a cautious stance as the United States and China began their latest round of reciprocal import duties and the dispute showed no signs of abating.
However, the 12 fund managers participating in the survey recommended that North America ' s asset allocation increase to the highest level since June 2017, while the United Kingdom, the euro area and, in particular, emerging markets, have declined.
The global equity allocation averaged 56.6 per cent and the bond ratio 35.5 per cent, largely in line with last month’s survey.
The most notable change has been the increase in the cash distribution ratio to 5.1 per cent, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager from a large funder said, “Some economic data bring confidence to the market, but the war on trade remains the biggest concern, so it is better to be prepared to enter when the market falls.”
The Fund Manager, however, continued to favour equities in September, particularly in the United States, even though United States equities were considered to be overpriced.
Today, in China’s open landmark, the world’s first major national exhibition on the theme of imports – China’s International Import Expo – officially opened the scene of expectations.
An exhibition is like a "window" that gives the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the Expo, people see a move towards a higher level of "open China"; with the "window" of the Expo, the world is welcomed as a mutually beneficial win-win with the "reform open again" China.
“For a country, openness is like a flutter of cocoon, which, while suffering for a while, will be replaced by a new life.”
The Secretary-General of Xi's summary of the road to openness points out an important reason why “China can”.
Looking back at the 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which had dared to penetrate the world market, despite its experience of vortexes and wind waves, had always faced all the risk challenges in an open posture, constantly unleashing its internal dynamism and increasing its competitiveness.
It can be said that China, with its own solid achievements, has eloquently interpreted the value and meaning of openness.
At the beginning of a new history, the organization of an exhibition on the subject of imports was a major decision taken by the party's central focus, Comrade Xi Jinping, to promote a new round of high-level opening to the outside world. It was a major initiative by China to open its markets to the world. It was a practical move by China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization.
And the “one hard to ask” seat for a large number of participants is the biggest positive and optimal response to China’s broader, broader and deeper development of an open economy.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
The build-up of the walls of protectionism in some countries and the return to the old path of unilateralism had increased the international community ' s concerns about the prospects for free trade and added to the uncertainty of the world economy, which was now warming.
In the context of such an era, this event on the eve of Huang Pu River reflects China ' s defence of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets and shared future Chinese confidence and China to assume its role.
Solo, solo, so far away.
China's open-mindedness and embrace of the world have not only made a powerful contribution to its own development, but have also brought tremendous “China opportunities” to countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the creation of a “one way” together, the launching of the Asian Investment Bank and the establishment of a Silk Road Fund ... China has provided a range of international public goods that provide real export markets, opportunities for development and jobs, and has given enterprises a ride to China's development fast bus.
The Expo is also a major platform for public goods, global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in the Chinese market with their distinctive high-quality products and services.
In addition to national enterprises, domestic consumers are the real beneficiaries.
By setting up this platform of “optimal excellence”, it provides a multi-channel, high-quality supply for the upgrading of consumption and meets the needs of the population in terms of individualization, diversification and differentiation in consumption.
As China opens its doors, the flow of goods and the use of goods becomes larger, and the steps towards a better life will be stronger.
From a broader perspective, the significance of the Expo goes beyond economics and trade to a vision of the future that conveys the concepts of openness, inclusion, inclusion, balance and win-winness in order to forge a common understanding of today ' s challenges.
The world is better, China is better; China is better.
We look forward to the great and successful event that will bring to the world; we look even more forward to a higher level of “open China” and the world working together to build a bright future for the community of human destinies.
External media: A framework agreement between the United States and the United States on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The [summary] agreement includes Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States and the temporary exemption of the United States from customs duties on Canadian-produced cars.
According to external sources, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of 30 September local time that the United States and Canada had concluded a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It was revealed that the agreement included Canada ' s opening of its dairy market to the United States and the temporary exemption of the United States from customs duties on Canadian-produced vehicles.
On 27 last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary principled agreement to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement by the 31 August deadline set by the United States to extend the duration of the negotiations until 30 September.
Previously, Canada’s Foreign Minister Freeland’s spokesperson said that Canada would only sign a favourable agreement, “focusing on substance, not on a timetable. We will continue our consultations in the hope of reaching an agreement that is in Canada’s national interest.”
More than 90 per cent of Brazilian women voters stated that the presidential candidate did not take women's needs into account.
According to the South American Diaspora, data published recently by the Brazilian National Institute of Geography (IBGE) show that more than 90 per cent of Brazilian women do not believe that the presidential candidate takes women ' s needs into account.
It was reported that the number of women in Brazil had now reached 107 million and that if Brazilian women were brought together to form a country, the country's population would be 13th in the world, twice the population of Spain as a whole.
In Brazil, where women account for 52 per cent of voters and men for 48 per cent of voters, the proportion of women in the Brazilian Congress is only 10 per cent, although the proportion of women among voters is very high.
Of the 193 countries in the world, the participation of Brazilian women in politics is only 154, which is higher than that of Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women have not succeeded in acquiring their rights.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori points out that this phenomenon is due to the combination of ancient patriarchal societies, racism and capitalist values.
“Political should have been a national’s claim to citizenship, identity, access to public goods, and a society made up of several social groups. But Brazilian politics is a monopoly of a certain group, and the majority of the population is not represented.”
A previous study by the Brazilian Automobile Institute (Locomotiva) also pointed out that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not feel that elected politicians could represent their rights, 90 per cent did not agree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93 per cent did not agree with the current government policy on governance.
“We need to reverse the underrepresentation of women in parliament, and Brazil’s political system continues to be affected by inequality. So far, Brazil’s political sphere has been marked by serious gender, class, and racial discrimination.”
Despite the lack of women ' s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76 per cent of women believed that they could make a difference in democratic elections and 72 per cent were interested in politics.
In addition, 55 per cent of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to subject women to less prejudice.
On 1 October, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn flag-raising ceremony to mark the 69th birthday of the new China.
More than 80 representatives of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, news agencies in Kazakhstan, financial institutions, Chinese enterprises, Chinese diasporas, Confucius and students attended the event.
On 1 October, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a flag-raising ceremony to greet the 69th birthday of the new China.
Following the flag-raising ceremony, the Ambassador of China to Pakistan, Zhang Xing, stated that, on the occasion of the 69th birthday of the great motherland, it was a profound patriotic educational activity that we celebrated the flag-raising ceremony in a different country.
Although you have lived abroad for a long time, you are always a great country.
Zhang Yuan said that the Chinese people are today closer than ever to the great goal of achieving a national renaissance and to the centre of the world stage.
“Our mission, our responsibilities and our work are more honourable, arduous and onerous than ever before.”
Zhang Xiang stressed the importance of keeping in mind his mission to promote the construction of the "one-way" by the Chinese and the Chinese Communist Party, to ensure that the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-by-one" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the "one-way" by the nation.
The T2 terminal at Kirin International Airport in Guangxi was inaugurated on 30 days.
According to Zhao Le Qin, Secretary of the Central Chinese Communist Party, the opening of the new terminal will meet the annual demand for 12 million passengers and will create a new advantage in air traffic for the further improvement of the Guangxi River Union, sea and rail transport, surface and air ports.
Kiirin is expected to receive more than 90 million visitors this year.
The expansion of the T2 terminal and the pedagogic facilities at the two Rivers International Airport is a major public benefit project for the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Guangxi Gang Autonomous Region and a landmark project for the construction of an international tourist destination in Guilin.
The project began in December 2015 with a construction area of 100,000 square metres, with a total investment of RMB 3.258 billion, which will meet the requirements of 12 million annual passenger throughputs, 10.12 million landings and 95,000 tons of mail throughput.
On the same day, more than 200 flights took off and landed at the T2 terminal at Gjilin International Airport.
The design of the new terminal is inspired by the waters of Guilin Hills, and it looks like a mountain cinnamon, near the roofs of the Dragon Ridge Trails and the people of Guibei.
It was reported that the new terminal at Guilin airport could accommodate a peak flow of nearly 4,000 people per hour to and from the port, using smart baggage sorting systems, security integration platforms, face recognition, etc., as a technical tool for “smart empty harbours”, and planning for catering, department stores, tax exemptions and recreational activities.
As growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets is largely not encouraging, the United States is increasingly becoming a major engine of global economic growth.
On 23 September 2018, a container cargo ship docked in a port in New Jersey, United States of America.
However, as the current growth in the United States has benefited from the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts, the economy has also received close attention from the outside world.
“As the United States regains full employment, the economic downturn is inevitable.”
The only question, he said, was when it would happen, which, in his view, would probably only be left behind.
Despite Barclay ' s optimism about the United States economic outlook by the end of the year, the Bank acknowledged that it was more difficult to forecast further time.
“In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the potential for economic growth, the current growth stimulated by fiscal policy will not be sustainable”, the Barclay economist said in a study.
“In the absence of investment growth, the risk of the economy landing hard in 2020 will rise,” they said.
A series of business surveys will broadly show that major economies are at the stage of the economic cycle at the end of the third quarter.
The euro area and United States manufacturing surveys, which are due to be published next Monday, will receive attention and services surveys will be published on Wednesday.
But next week ' s data will certainly focus on the non-farm employment data for the United States, which will be published next Friday, and will provide clues as to whether the tight employment market is driving wage growth.
Its importance, not only because of its importance to the profitability of enterprises and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because of salary hikes or overall inflation increases, may be a source of concern for officials of the United States Federal Reserve (FPR/FED).
“Payroll will be of great concern, as the ring is likely to rise again significantly over the previous month.
The rise in September over the same period of the previous year may not have been over 3%, but we can well expect a breakthrough next month, as the Netherlands International Group (ING) economist wrote in a study.
European politics may become a source of market volatility at a time when vacations in China and other parts of Asia have led to a bleak data profile for the region next week.
The Italian government ignores previous financial commitments to the EU, and the rest of the EU member states will have to quickly determine whether or not to oppose Italy’s decision. Tria does not support the decision, and he hopes to abide by EU rules.
The annual meeting of the British Conservative Party in Birmingham may also be sparkling as the British retreat talks enter a critical phase.
At the same time, concerns surrounding emerging markets are unlikely to diminish as Brazil holds the hoped-for presidential elections next weekend.
[Summary] When completed, the vessel will be placed at the disposal of the East China Sea Division of the National Oceanic Administration of China, and Chen Xiao, Chief of the Observing Service of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, stated that its operationalization would be of great importance for the development of the China Offshore Ocean Observing System and the promotion of global ocean observations.
On 29 September, China's first 3000-ton large-scale buoy vessel, Sun Hung-22, was in the water of the China Warships Group.
The completion of the vessel will break the current equipment bottlenecks in China ' s safeguards work on large buoys, submarine placement, recycling and looting.
The “Girl 22” wheels are used mainly for regular buoy/submarine cruise maintenance, regular placement, recycling, contingency placement of buoys/submarine, recovery, recovery and repair, as well as the ability to carry out integrated marine survey missions, such as gap surveys.
The new ship is 89 metres long, 18 metres wide, 7.2 metres deep and has a continuous capacity of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Xiao, Deputy General Manager of the Warships Group, said: “The 22 ships to Yoon Hong are our first large buoy operating vessel, and the only one in the country with 10 metres of capacity to operate a large buoy, will further enhance our large buoy security capability.”
It is understood that the ship, once completed, will be placed at the disposal of the East China Sea Division of the National Oceanic Administration of China, and Chen Xiao, Chief of the Observation Service of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, stated that its operationalization would be of great importance for the development of the China Offshore Ocean Observing System and the promotion of global ocean observations.
“The vessel is simultaneously equipped with large-scale buoy-laying and maintenance operations, as well as with integrated maritime survey capabilities, and is our first integrated vessel dedicated to mid- and long-sea buoy operations and integrated ocean survey operations.
With such a buoy ship, our ocean observation and ocean survey will now have a powerful sharp instrument.”
The first day of the race was postponed until 1 October by the opening of the 2018 International Qingjia Tournament series, scheduled for 30 September.
Under the influence of the typhoon, the wind in the pool was strong, the wind was as high as 24 knots, the departure signal was delayed by almost 90 minutes from 1 p.m. 30 p.m., the wind was still not down, and the contestant general, Anne Mdrand, announced the cancellation of the first day of the competition.
“The strong winds from the shore continue, and the sea is too intense.”
Mdrand explains: “In this case, no one knows when the wind will strike the ship.
A race near the city, and in the current state of affairs, cancellation is the wisest option.”
There is still some disappointment on the part of all prepared crews.
"The ship is ready to stop, and we're in good shape."
Max Richardson, the Qingjia rudder, said: "But I know it's the right choice to change the game, and I want the wind to be smaller today, so we can do it."
Omika Wilkinson, who is known as the New Zealand team for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, says, “The loss of a day makes the game more interesting.
Because today's game's gonna be worth more and there's only two days left.
We're all going to have to work really hard."
Despite the sea winds, the French ABM rudder Pierre Ives Durand, who met before the race, complained about his warmth with the race in the Tianjin Island: five years ago, the International Expeditions Series had its own injuries, broken muscles, thanks to the local medical team.
According to the information received, the International Expeditions Series, which was launched in 2007, is a world sail league event known as the Volvo, the American Cup and the World sailboats against the Tours.
The Aoshima Station competition will use the FlyingPhantom.
The year 2018 was the eighth year in which the race landed on Qingdao Island, the capital of the sailboats, and Qingdao Station was also the time to take office in the series.
Despite the worldwide financial market shocks, the Hong Kong Financial Authority reported on Monday that foreign exchange fund investment revenues fell significantly by 97 per cent each year in the third quarter of this year, but were better than in the previous quarter, and that foreign exchange losses were significantly reduced owing to the rise in overseas shares during the China-United States trade war.
According to the Agency ' s latest data, the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK$ 1.6 billion in July-September 2018, which is significantly lower than HK$ 61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$ 100 million in the second quarter of this year.
The President of the King's Administration, Chen Deok-hyun, stated in the Legislative Assembly that at the beginning of the China-United States trade war, the Hong Kong and emerging market stock indices ran counter to the United States stock index. Until late September and early October, when the United States stock market index peaked, market sentiment began to reverse, as investors became aware that the trade war was adversely affecting the United States itself.
“A change in market sentiment is a good thing, and if the trade war has only a one-sided impact, it will not help to solve the problem.”
At the same time, he pointed out that “if the US-China trade war fails, the volatility of financial markets will continue to rise.”
During the third quarter of this year, foreign exchange funds lost between 8 and 4.7 billion Hong Kong dollars in equity investments compared to the previous quarter, while overseas stock returns increased significantly by 172 to 12.8 billion Hong Kong dollars; foreign exchange losses decreased by 16.2 billion Hong Kong dollars and bonds by 9.7 billion Hong Kong dollars, representing a 24 per cent and 31 per cent reduction, respectively, per quarter.
Foreign exchange funds are mainly used to support the HK$.
The Hong Kong dollar-to-dollar linked exchange rate system has been in place since 1983.
With regard to the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Deok-hyun stated that while economic and asset market uncertainty had increased and downside risks had increased, the Hong Kong financial system was robust and resilient.
“Hong Kong’s international investment position, with a net external asset value of $1.4 trillion equal to four times GDP, 2.5 times higher than Singapore’s and 0.6 times higher than Japan’s, is sufficient to cope with a downward or reversal of the economy.”
In recent years, Hong Kong dollar debundling has continued to fall and has increased the dollar spread. Chen Deok-kyung noted that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate had risen by more than 400 basis points on 21 September, and that the market was generally believed to be mainly related to the increase in the Hong Kong dollar debundling rate, which then hovered around 7.80-7.84 levels against the United States dollar.
However, he is of the view that, with the start of the Hong Kong Bank interest increase cycle and the normalization of Hong Kong dollar interest rates, future rates of lower Hong Kong dollar interest rates will change.
“The trend in Hong Kong dollar interest rates will be more consistent with that of the United States dollar, and more care will have to be taken to manage risks and prepare for market fluctuations.”
The Hong Kong dollar was well funded and further reduced, dropping 0.9 to 2.08179 per cent on Monday for three months, increasing the difference from 46 basis points to 51 basis points for the United States dollar; and creating a five-month low for the United States dollar.
From May to mid-September, the Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate was close to 7.85 to the United States dollar for most of the time.
During this period, exchange assurances for weaker parties were triggered several times in May and August, after they were first triggered in April, as a result of arbitrage activities and the partial withdrawal of shares from Hong Kong dollars after the completion of large-scale equity campaigns.
The Hong Kong dollar was purchased by the Authority at 7.85 levels in accordance with the associated exchange rate regime and the United States dollar was sold in order to maintain stability in the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
The Authority purchased approximately HK$52.1 billion in May and August under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism.
Does the new tax law offer advantages to persons outside the country?
In response to a 30-day question from a journalist, the relevant head of the Department of Finance and Tax Administration indicated that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law would be to consider the continuation of preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong and Macao.
Journalists have asked that the newly revised Personal Income Tax Act adjusts the rate for taxpayers of our individual income tax residents from one full year to 183 days.
Are there any preferential arrangements for persons outside Hong Kong, including Hong Kong and Macao, as the next step in the implementation of the Act?
In response, the Officer-in-Charge stated that the implementing regulations of the current personal income tax law provide for special benefits for the payment of taxes to persons outside China. Individuals who do not have a residence in China but who have resided for more than one year or more than five years may pay personal income tax only in respect of a portion of the income paid by a unit or individual in China.
The Officer-in-Charge stated that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new Personal Income Tax Act would be to consider the continuation of preferential arrangements for persons outside the country, including Hong Kong and Macao.
There are no “threshold” monthly centres: quality certification leads to quality improvement.
With the growth of the “two-child economy” and the prosperity of the mother-child market, the city has grown from the north up to the three-to-four-line cities, and every part of the country has grown into a variety of monstrosity centres.
The popular demand for consumption was met by the active Moon Club at the present time, with fees ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, but at the same time in an awkward position, an institution that so far had no threshold and there were gaps in supervision.
A series of national “Quality Months” 2018 has recently been launched by the General Directorate of State Market Supervision, and journalists have come to a five-star moon centre in Tianjin City to visit the certification experience of mother and child care services.
The general monthly centres provide services such as neonatal care, nutritious meals, postnatal rehabilitation and plasticization.
In this monthly centre, journalists observed that nurses check the breastfeeding of newborns on a daily basis, and professional caregivers provide intensive care services such as bathing and touching for newborns.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of the new mothers, the mothers are helped to recover their positions by providing services such as early care for the wounds of the first and later months of the month, as well as nursing programmes such as Chinese medicine and beauty treatment.
A new mother living in the house told the journalist that she had not been able to book the moonshine club until eight months earlier.
The services of the Moon House have a direct impact on the comfort and physical recovery of the mother during the period of the month. Some of the small Moon Clubs can only provide simple monthly services. There are health irregularities in disinfection, vulnerability to cross-infection and problems of a single non-scientific diet.
The head of the Moonko Centre said that they were the only one in all five-star Moon Koko centres in Tianjin City to be certified as a B-class service.
“Although some clients did not initially understand the meaning of B-level certification, it was important for the long-term development of an enterprise to benefit from rigorous standardized process management through certification.” He said.
The Deputy Director-General of the Department of Accreditation and Supervision of the General Directorate of State Market Supervision, Panreiven, said that certification of services was a new certification system based on customer perception, concern for organizational quality management and the satisfaction of service characteristics. It was an important component of the country ' s quality infrastructure and had a positive role in increasing the share of quality service provision and enhancing the international competitiveness of China ' s services.
Since 2004, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has undergone a process of continuous and progressive development, with the emergence of a number of influential services, such as financial service certification, certification of mother and child care services, certification of after-sales services, certification of e-commerce services and certification of health services.
According to the General Directorate of State Market Supervision, there are currently more than 130 service certification bodies, more than 2,000 service certification officers and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates in the country.
Panreivin stated that the development of service certification should be further guided and promoted by the gradual expansion of service certification coverage in the areas of health, education, sports, finance, electricity suppliers and the promotion of service supply side reform and quality improvement.
Reuter Hong Kong 5 November - Hong Kong Building prices fell for two months in a row after it peaked. Chen Deok-hyun, Managing Director of the Hong Kong Financial Authority, said that it would take time to see if the city had entered the down-cycle, and if confirmed, to consider easing counter-cyclical measures at the appropriate time.
Chen Deok-yung added that, if the price of the building were to return, the first people to be affected would be those who would be in business at the peak of the market, but the expected price of the building, as in the case of the Asian financial storm of 1997, would fall sharply and the opportunities for citizens to cut down significantly on the sale of their property would be much lower.
In a briefing to the Legislative Council, Chen Deok-hyun led a number of senior members of the Kim Bureau, who said that if it was confirmed that the city was entering a downward cycle, the measure could be eased at the appropriate time.
“However, it is still too early to relax when only a few weeks of data are seen to see whether the city is going down the cycle.”
Since October 2009, the Authority has introduced eight rounds of countercyclical measures to boost bank risk management and earthquake resilience by significantly tightening mortgages in all categories of property, including by reducing the number of mortgages and requiring mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests.
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest-raising cycle, the price index for private residential buildings for the whole of Hong Kong fell for two months in August-September, and the monthly decline increased to 1.44 per cent in September.
But the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of the year was 10.2%.
According to the Monetary Authority, the financial situation of households measuring their resilience to financial risks is still healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of households without mortgages in Hong Kong reached 66 per cent, which is higher than the average of 60 per cent in 2009-11; the average number of new mortgages and the number of mortgages
Chen Deok-yung stated, however, that high seismic resistance did not mean that the economically disadvantaged would not suffer, as property valuations would fall and those who bought buildings at the peak would bear the brunt.
Although the Authority tightens bank lending to mortgage lenders, mortgage lenders can also obtain high-value mortgage lending through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans from developers.
Chen Deok-yung indicated that at present, together with mortgage lending to developers, borrowers can pay 85-90 per cent of mortgages, and that if building prices fall by 10 per cent, negative assets (i.e. property market value drops below the level of total outstanding mortgage loans) will emerge.
However, the Vice-President of the Monetary Authority, Nguyen Guoh-hung, noted that the authorities estimated that the total amount of mortgages provided by developers was only 2 - 2.5 per cent of the total amount of bank mortgages, which remained low.
At the peak of Hong Kong ' s negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, representing 22 per cent of the supply population.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive seasons.
On 1 October, Xinhua Xinhua ' s electricity (Lu Hongxia, Mawe) retail e-commerce export firms welcomed another wave of negative tax returns on 1 October, involving value added tax (VAT) and consumer tax (CAT) exemptions.
The Ministry of Finance, the National Directorate of Taxation, the Ministry of Commerce and the General Customs Department have recently issued a joint communication stating that the VAT/CAT tax exemption policy is being implemented on a trial basis for exporting goods that are not supported by valid import certificates to electric power exporters in the integrated cross-border e-commerce pilot zone, provided that the following conditions are met.
First, e-commerce exporting enterprises are registered in the CZZ and register export dates, goods names, unit of measure, quantity, unit price, amount on the integrated services platform on the cross-border e-commerce line of the place of registration.
Second, export declarations for e-commerce are processed through the customs offices where the CSI region is located.
Third, the export goods do not belong to the Ministry of Finance and the Directorate-General of Taxes, pursuant to a decision of the State Council, to explicitly cancel the export of goods for which the tax is (exempted) from taxes.
It is clear from the circular that the General Customs Service regularly transmits electronic information on the E-Commerce Export Declaration List to the National Tax Administration.
The tax authorities of the Comprehensive Test Zones strengthen the tax-exempt management of export goods on the basis of electronic information from the Export Goods Declaration List, which is cleared by the National Tax Administration.
The circular states that specific tax exemptions are administered by the provincial tax administrations, the finance and commerce sectors.
Inter-sectoral collaboration and related policy implementation should be promoted in an integrated manner by the leadership team offices and business authorities in the integrated pilot zones to accelerate the establishment of a system for monitoring e-commerce export statistics and to facilitate the rapid development of cross-border e-commerce.
A man in Liaoning province killed his lover and dumped his body, after which he fled to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
On 5 May, the journalist was informed by the Public Security Bureau of the East Victory District of Ordos, Inner Mongolia, that the man had been successfully captured following a joint police investigation between the two regions.
On 26 June 2018, a female disappeared in the city of Saddle Hill, Liaoning province, and her family reported her disappearance to the local police.
Following a police investigation, it was found that this was not a simple case of disappearance and that there was a high risk that the missing person would be killed by a lover, and the police set up a special unit for further investigation.
On 30 October, the task force found out that the suspect Wang may have been hiding in the East Victory District of the city of Ordos and that the police immediately organized a strong police force to cooperate fully with the Liaoning police in the detection of the case.
After five days of investigation, the civilian police finally figured out the location of Wang Yi and detailed their associates.
On 4 November, the two police forces joined forces to capture the suspect, Wang, at an excavator fittings shop in Dong Shing District.
According to Wang, he had a relationship with the victim ' s lover, who had a large sum of money deposited under his name, and they decided to take it for themselves.
On 22 June 2018, after a disagreement between Wang and Paik over the disposition of the funds, the King proceeded to kill White in the rented house and to dump the body.
At present, the suspect Wang has been handed over to the Liaoning Hill Police.
"Green Development in Action" of the "Five Developments: A Better Emblem"
The second column of the "Five Developments, Better Emblems" — the "Green Development in Action" — was officially launched on 5th.
In order to provide a comprehensive picture of the excellent results of the construction of the "Five Developments, Better Emblems", the "Five Developments, Better Emblems" series of train trains was designed jointly by the Homogene City Orbital Corporation and the Golden Ribbon Media Technology Corporation.
Among them, the first train — the “Innovation in Action” — was officially launched on 1 October on Track 1 in Homogene City.
The theme train on the line selected the blue green modulus that symbolized mountain water, reflecting the birth engine, vitality and purity.
The campaign focused on the core ideas of the “Five Developments: A Better Emblem” and 18 representative examples of green development outcomes in the province, including the construction of green development priorities such as the Jianghua Canal Project, the Long Forest System, the Yangtze Economic Zone Conservation Development, and the Ten Million Acre Forest Growth Project.
In addition, the “Coordination of development in action”, “Open development in action” and “Shared development in action” trains will be on the line in the near future.
On October 1st, the first day of the "gold week" in the Mainland and the last day of the Hong Kong national holiday, many residents of the Mainland used the holiday to travel, shop and go abroad.
According to the data provided by the Shenzhen General Inspectorate, at 1600 hours the same day there were more than 429,000 departures and departures from the Shenzhen port, more than 168,000 vehicles (lines, racks and columns), and the ports remained busy and maintained a good order of entry and exit.
It is understood that, owing to a number of positive factors, such as the increase in the number of countries offering exit waivers to Chinese citizens, there has been a steady increase in the number of tourists taking advantage of national holidays for resort shopping in countries such as Europe and South-East Asia.
In the early morning hours of 1 January, the crossing points of Lo Lake, Shenzhen Bay, Wanggang and Fukuda reached their peak, which lasted from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., and the Shenzhen crossing from 6.30 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.
It was reported that, in response to the peak flow of passengers (cars) entering and leaving the country, the Shenzhen General Inspectorate station was deployed in accordance with the National Immigration Administration, initiating the passenger (car) peak hour service model, arranging for overtime police to support the first line of duty, conducting early foot-checking routes, guiding passengers and vehicles in an orderly manner and ensuring that they were ready for screening.
The General Inspectorate at Shenzhen also reminds incoming and outgoing passengers of the validity of their documents and visas and notes before travelling, to make reasonable arrangements for travel, to avoid peak periods of passenger flows and to choose the right time and the right port of exit.
Passengers travelling to Hong Kong in Hong Kong by high railway are required to have valid entry/exit documents and a visa sign, and such tickets are issued only by car and cannot be used as an entry/exit document. If they are unable to leave Hong Kong due to, inter alia, non-compliance with documentation procedures, they must follow the guidelines of the Border Guard and wait for the port at a designated location.
Systematic haemorrhagic ailments, which were considered to be “irresistible”.
The lack of effective treatment prevents them from being treated because of the lack of clear mechanisms for their occurrence.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the Life Sciences Institute at Qinghua University, and Chewie Chim Tsumi, Director of the Vishni Immunization Centre at the Beijing University Hospital, jointly discovered the presence of human immunoglobin and its involvement in the regulation of immune B cells, which increases the susceptibility of systemic red-coupled lupus.
In short, both teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body was an important cause of systemic haemorrhagic disease.
According to one of the authors of the article, Sun Xiaojun of the Great North People's Hospital, the Chestnut Nation team collected and studied nearly 2,000 cases of systematic haemorrhagic ailments and found that patients with immunoglobin mutations had developed disease-producing cells and a wide range of antibodies of their own, kidney inflammation.
The Liu Wanli team, through various research methods such as immuno-cell trace, animal trials, sequencing etc., discovered the path of immune signals activated by this immuno-molecular mutation, and the pathogenic mechanisms that promote the partition of B cells into multiple self-resistances.
Journalists learned that the two teams were strong and united, taking full advantage of their respective strengths and bringing basic research and clinical applications closer together.
The Liu Wanli team is working on the Blymphocyte immuno-immunisation study, while the Chestnut Nation team is engaged in long-term clinical research on systematic red-coupled lupus.
“The study is one of the results of years of collaboration between the two teams, and it is the first time that the academic community has institutionally recognized that immunoglobin genetic anomalies will induce systemic haemorrhagic ailments, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeting.”
It is not a matter of protection, but of the law.
The lawyer's in court with the ax?
The news was indeed exciting at first sight, and it also blew up in the legal circle.
The Fujian Quan City Central Law subsequently fined the lawyers involved $500 and recommended in writing that the Quan Quan City Bar Association conduct an investigation.
According to the Newjing newspaper, the former City Council of Quan County issued an official circular stating that the actions of the two lawyers did not involve violations of the law and were not punishable under the law.
According to multiple reports, the handling by the Quanzhou City Bar is not short-lived or confrontational, but is endorsed by the Quanzhou Middle Court.
An incident that could have triggered tensions within the legal community was finally properly resolved.
The reversal of events stems from a more complete return to the truth: the axes carried by the lawyers involved are identical to the murder weapon of the accused, of the same type, but not of the same type, and are supported by evidence only at the evidentiary level, without any intimidation or subjective intent “to endanger the safety of the court”.
There are four very important details to determine whether the lawyer's conduct was in violation of the law: first, the local court held two previous sessions and showed only an ax photo, which, from the defence's point of view, was necessary; and second, the ax was purchased only an hour before the trial, not the lawyer's unwillingness.
Combining these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer involved “was present in court with an axe” was not involved in the offence, but merely in the defence.
After clarifying the facts, the City Council of Quan did not go to work, but took the decision without punishment, despite pressure.
This decision, in turn, is subject to the test of fact and law.
It is true that, without the court's permission, the ax to be brought to the court as a control knife can be a source of anxiety and misunderstanding.
For reasons of safety and caution, previous fines and judicial recommendations by the Quanzhou Central Court are no exception.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from making lawyers difficult, the Supreme Law issued the Rules on Security Inspection of the Judicial Police of the People ' s Courts in 2014, which establishes the principle that lawyers are not required to carry out physical security checks when appearing before a court.
Since the issuance of the rule, a wide range of lawyers have led by example, and few incidents have occurred that endanger the safety of the Tribunal as a result of security loopholes.
In very isolated cases such as the one in Quanzhou, it is easy to dispel misunderstandings as long as they are communicated in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
The Bar Association, as a self-regulatory organization in the legal profession, has a dual mandate of disciplinary misconduct and guarantees of legality.
In the past, IAJOs have suffered from severe illness due to their bias towards discipline and lack of security.
The decisions of the Quan State Bar, both in terms of process and outcome, are commendable and serve as an example for more members of the Bar to perform their duties properly.
From October 1st, which tax revenues will affect our money bags?
The new personal income tax law of Xinhua Society in Shanghai on October 1, 2019 will come into force on January 1, 2019. In order for the public to benefit from the tax bonus as soon as possible, from October 1st, the tax pay actually earned to taxpayers will be set at $5,000 per month.
What are the advantages and benefits that would affect the population along with the New Deal?
Good one: significant tax deductions from wages and salaries
Taxpayers who receive wages after 1 October can deduct the basic deduction of $5,000/month and apply the new tax scale. Most taxpayers have different degrees of tax deductions, especially for low- and middle-income persons.
According to the tax deduction table for the different income groups, the monthly income after the deduction of the “triple risk” amounts to $8,000, $10,000, $20,000 and $50,000. The tax adjustment amounts to $90, $290, $1590 and $9090, respectively, and the starting point.
It is worth noting that, for the purpose of holidays, the salaries that were to have been paid by law in October at the end of September are subject to the application of a new basic scale of deductions and tax rates.
To this end, the collection client software, which is widely used by the tax authorities, has provided the corresponding tax calculation functionality, but the corresponding taxes still have to be reported for payment within the statutory filing period.
Good two: the low-tax grade is significantly larger.
In addition to raising the point of origin, a new tax scale will be applied as of 1 October.
There has been no change in the current salary, the seven-step rate of pay and the previous one, but there has been a marked change in the tariff range, with 3 per cent, 10 per cent and 20 per cent of the three-step low tax range significantly increased, and 25 per cent of the tariff range has been reduced, compared to 30 per cent, 35 per cent and 35 per cent.
It is worth noting that the tax code also adjusts the tax rates derived from production operations, with the threshold of 35 per cent of the ceiling being raised from $100,000 to $500,000.
This means that both individual business owners and individual sole proprietors will benefit from tax changes.
“As far as previous tax cuts for individual taxpayers in Shanghai are concerned, the dividends of individual tax reforms will be fully felt by a wide range of taxpayers, especially among low- and middle-income people.”
The head of the personal income tax division of the Shanghai Municipal Revenue Service of the National Revenue Authority, Ramin, stated that
Three benefits: tax services are easier and better optimized
Since the promulgation of the new Personal Income Tax Act, the tax authorities of Shanghai City have carried out a series of comprehensive and wide-ranging tax campaigns.

Ltd., and the Red Star Keilong Family Group Inc., which have a large number of employees, large surcharges, large taxes, voluntary mentoring by the tax authorities,
On the other hand, a tax policy of “fullness, multidimensionality and stereotypicity” is implemented for the general public taxpayers.
The timely delivery of policy hot spots through the Shanghai official tax website, Weibo Public, Weibo etc. to ensure that policy advocacy is in place.
At the same time, on 28 September, the Shanghai Tax Micro-Intelligent Public Information Platform 12366 was launched to provide an integrated “target-to-target” tax reform promotion service through the “man-to-intellectual” tax service counselling.

The Trilateral Trade Agreement between the United States of America and the United States of America will bring new opportunities to 500 million people.
According to external sources, a joint statement by Foreign Minister Freeland of Canada and the United States Trade Representative Letheze, published on the Canadian Government's website, stated that the United States, Canada and Mexico had entered into a tripartite trade agreement, which would be known as “USMCA” (the USMCA agreement).
Previously, CTV News television Canada quoted senior sources from the United States as saying that Canada and the United States had overcome their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post quoted two sources who reported that the agreement reached on 30 September between the United States and Canada would retain the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a tripartite trade agreement and that the three heads of State would sign a new agreement within two months.
The statement stated: “Today, Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed on a new trade agreement — the USMCA Agreement, which will provide our workers, farmers and companies with a high standard of trade agreement that will lead to a freer market,
According to the information received, the existing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
Following the inauguration of the President, Trump announced plans to reconsider the agreement and sign a new agreement.
The three countries started the negotiation process in 2017.
The Okinawa Supervisory Council election, which was held in advance of the death of the former Governor, Yukio Yoo, was announced in the early morning of 1 local time, with the successful election of Danny of the Yuzhmorgeologiya, who opposed the relocation plan of the United States military base in Japan.
The final results of the vote cast on 30 September showed that the city had obtained 396,632,000 votes, the highest in the history of the Okinawa District Governor's election, and that it had more than 80,000 votes more than its main contestant, Jok Jin.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a turnout of 63.24 per cent, a decrease of 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 Okinawa Prefectural Election.
According to the media on 1 January, the results of the election showed that the people of the county did not want to let the Governor's efforts to survive wasted, that he would continue to work with the Governments of Japan and the United States against the relocation of the United States military base and the closure of the Panchaun base, among other things.
The U.S. military base, located in Ieno Bay, Okinawa County, has been plagued by a long-standing illness, and the Japanese-American Government had previously agreed to relocate it to the bordery areas of the city, but the people of Okinawa strongly opposed it, hoping to move the base completely out of Okinawa.
On the other hand, with regard to the relocation plan, which was strongly opposed by the people of the counties, and the withdrawal of the land-filling permit on the coast of the border, the city stated that it had not been in opposition to and divided with the central Government at the outset, and hoped that the two sides would have a full exchange of views that would demonstrate their intention to reach a negotiated settlement.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also expressed to the media in the morning that he took this outcome seriously and that he would make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and ease the burden on the base.
At a press conference on 1 January, Japan Chief of Staff Yu Yi Wei said that there had been no change in the Government ' s approach to moving United States military bases as soon as possible.
At the same time, he expressed his intention to meet with the city.
On 4 this month, the city will officially assume its functions as Governor of Okinawa County.
Since the mid-2000s, Paul Thomas, a farmer from North Dakota State in the United States, has grown more soybeans in his land as Chinese demand for oil seeds has grown.
This shift peaked this year with 1,600 acres of soybeans planted in 5,000 acres, an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and a lot of farmers like him plan to turn in 2019 to the former United States agricultural areas for staple crops: maize and wheat.
For the first time in 35 years, farmers in the United States have grown more soybeans this year than maize.
Other food crops are planned because American farmers are facing difficulties in selling soybeans against the backdrop of the trade war launched by United States President Trump against China.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of United States soybean exports, but in recent months almost zero United States soybean purchases have resulted in soybean prices falling to a decade low as a result of trade wars.
Thomas intends to grow more wheat next year, hoping to earn more by reducing dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Thomas says that soybean prices “do us a painful blow”.
He stated that, without the Chinese purchases, the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per futon, while the price necessary to cover the cost was $8.50.
Farmers in the United States recorded a record high in soybean cultivation this year, and the harvest is expected to reach a record high.
At such a time of vulnerability, they were hit by a trade war.
In July, China imposed import duties on imports of soybeans from the United States in response to Trump's imposition of additional tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.
The United States Department of Agriculture will issue its first estimate of the area to be cultivated next year, which will include consideration of tariff implications.
This estimate is expected to confirm the expected reduction in soybean soybean soybean cultivation by private institutions.
According to a report by Reuters, Informa Economics projected an increase of 4 to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in maize cultivation in 2019 and a decrease of 7 to 83 million acres in soybean cultivation on 19 October.
Informa also expects a 4% increase in wheat cultivation in the United States.
The area of soybean planted prior to the imposition of retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, some 15 million acres more than 10 years ago.
The area under maize cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008, to 89.1 million acres. This year, the area under wheat cultivation is 47.8 million acres, the lowest level in 100 years.
Aaron Carlson, head of the Illinois Corn Growing Association, has a total area of 3,600 acres under his own cultivation, and this year nearly half of him is used for soybean cultivation, but it is planned to reduce it in the future.
He claims that he may have increased maize cultivation by up to 20 per cent on his farm in northern Illinois, the largest soybean State in the United States.
Soybeans produce less than maize per acre but require less fertilizer, which makes soybean cultivation generally less costly.
The transfer of farmers to final maize may raise costs, but will benefit a number of enterprises, including Andersons Inc. Fertilizers.
Executive Director Pat Bowe of Andersons stated to Reuters that he expected that the conversion of maize would be beneficial for fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the conversion of farmers to maize.
The Director-General of the Santilawa airport administration in Bangkok, Thailand, held a press conference on 29 September to apologize for the beating of a Chinese citizen at the airport and to say that Thailand welcomed Chinese tourists and that the authorities would strengthen their management, raise awareness of services and avoid similar incidents.
It was reported that, on 27 June, security guards at the airport in Toonman had physically clashed with a Chinese man who had been denied entry into the country.
Sutilava stated that the security guards involved had committed serious misconduct and had been suspended from duty by the Airports Authority, and that a Board of Inquiry had been established to investigate the matter in accordance with the procedure, and that the security guards would be dismissed if the facts were correct.
The Thai Immigration Service has now arranged for the man to return to China by air.
Sutilawa apologized for this incident, which tarnished Thailand ' s image, and said that the Thai side attached great importance to the matter, was willing to do its utmost to mitigate the impact of the incident on the tourists who had been beaten, and would send a letter of apology to the person concerned through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that the airport was willing to facilitate Chinese visitors to Thailand and that the Thai Immigration Service had established special access routes for Chinese tourists at the five major Thai international airports in Bangkok, namely Suvanapur, Sunman, Chiang Mai, Puji and Yoai.
The next step, he said, would be for the Airport Authority to overhaul the area of the site sign-off, to indicate the cost of the sign-off and to improve the quality of services and communication capacity of the staff.
When the Chinese Embassy in Thailand became aware of the incident, the first contact was made with the person concerned to learn what had happened.
At the same time, the Head of the Thai Immigration Service, the Airports Authority and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports made representations to the Thai side to investigate the incident thoroughly and to severely punish the perpetrators, and will continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side in order to properly deal with the matter and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the persons concerned.
Xinhua International Times Review: To defend multilateralism, China is one and the same.
The international rules and the multilateral order were being shaken at a time when unilateralism was inflaming.
To some extent, unilateralism and multilateralism have entered a critical period.
As a responsible Power, China has joined the international community in upholding multilateralism and promoting it as it continues to move forward, in keeping with the ideals of greatness and commonwealth and strong action.
In the face of new challenges in the new situation, China has made a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
As the State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi said in his address to the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should be based on a cooperative win-win approach, based on a rule-based order, based on equity and justice and guided by effective action.
At the same time, China called for a global development cooperation architecture complemented by the United Nations and North-South cooperation, and South-South cooperation, and called on all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China ' s thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As President Espinosa said at the 73rd session of the General Assembly, in the current circumstances, “the United Nations needs more than ever to promote multilateralism and uphold a rules-based international system”.
The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Lagarde, said that the international community should remain steadfast in upholding the multilateral trading system, upholding the rules of international trade and resolving differences through consultations.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the political power of the global economy, a number of emerging markets and groups of developing countries have emerged to play a greater role in the main international multilateral mechanisms and to provide a new dynamic for the development of counter-winding multilateralism.
Standing on this scale, China ' s advocacy of building a large family, rather than collating small circles, adhering to the idea of multilateralism, such as co-convening rather than winning, is an inescapable choice to meet global challenges and solve the world ' s problems, representing the common claim of the majority of the world ' s countries.
There are advanced ideas and more solid actions.
China's “one-way” initiative had become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China has launched international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the one-way street, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the 16+1 Cooperation to promote international regional cooperation, complement the existing international system and order, bring new dynamism to multilateral cooperation and contribute to the development of a more just and equitable international order.
As the guardian of the international order and the implementer of multilateralism, China ' s actions have become increasingly strong in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices in international hot spots, combating climate change, participation in peacekeeping operations, strong efforts to reduce poverty and reduce poverty and help other countries to implement the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Guterres, has said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the world faces a “trust deficit” and populism and polarization rises, it is at a time when the world's need for multilateral cooperation is most pressing.
At such a historic juncture, the international community needs to join hands in translating consensus into action, firmly defending multilateralism and working together to build a community of human destinies.
On 30 September, the first standard 4K demonstration area in Guangdong was inaugurated in Jinjin Garden District, Haiju District, Guangzhou City. On that day, the 4K operation of Guangdong Guangta Network was officially launched in Guangdong province.
The event was co-sponsored by the Guangdong Cable Radio and Television Network Ltd. and the co-building co-management and shared social governance leadership group in the Great Pond area of the Haiju region.
Based on the deployment of the Guangdong Provincial Council Government, Guangdong Guangbo Network actively implemented the 4K Action Plan for the new digital family. The first new digital family gateway end product - “U Point” - was launched in December 2017 in support of IPv6 and the national headline in support of 4K.
In 2018, the Guangdong Wide Power Network launched a series of wide-banded initiatives for the benefit of the people and launched the “4K Service Month” to promote the full range of “U Point Home Servers” throughout the province.
On the day of the event, 4K operations were launched throughout Guangdong and the first 4K smart television home-sharing platform, based on 4K applications, was officially launched to build shared social governance between Guangdong cable and the Great Pond area of Haiju District.
Chen Xiaoging, Chief Engineer, News and Publications, Guangdong Province, stated at the event that the campaign was a useful collaboration between the Government in actively using the Internet+ to create a “digital government” for the benefit of the population through cooperation and outreach.
A new digital family application, with 4K TV at its core, was shown and made widely available at the ceremony.

The report reads as follows: 30 September is the fifth national anniversary of martyrs.
At 10 a.m. on the same day, the Xi Near Equality Party and national leaders joined representatives from all walks of life in the capital to attend a ceremony to honour the people ' s heroes and honour their martyrs.
A quick review of the situation: this is the first anniversary since the implementation of our Heroed Martyrs Protection Act.
Five years ago, five years ago, on the eve of the National Day of Remembrance of the Martyrs, the great journey of the Chinese nation from misery to glory, we woke up: “Where we come from, where we go”.
Xi’s secretary-general pointed out in depth that “the abandonment of tradition is tantamount to the cutting off of one’s own psyche.”
"Don't forget history to open up the future."
We honour heroes and remember martyrs in order to remember history forever, to keep the spirit of life alive and to rally the strong and positive energy of national renaissance.
Let's just say that strength is the backbone of the nation.
To honour the martyrs and to honour them is to make them noble, sacred and powerful eternal memories at the bottom of our hearts.
According to incomplete statistics, some 20 million martyrs have died heroically for their national independence, their liberation and their country ' s prosperity and their well-being.
Every sacrifice for his country will be remembered, and the spirit of every devoted nation will be looked upon.
The establishment of national days for them and the organization of various forms of observance are intended to pay tribute to them in the name of their countries, to pay deep tribute to their great service and to learn the precious spirit of their love for their homeland, loyalty to their people, selflessness and sacrifice.
The party committees at all levels of government have improved the system of preferential treatment and have continued to raise the level of pension treatment, and the party and the State have acted effectively to honour heroes.
Each year, countless people look at the memory of the martyrs, so that we can feel the deep feelings of popular remembrance and the momentum for recovery that has been raised in the blood of the nation.
Heroes, the defense of heroes, the learning of heroes, and the love of heroes prevail in society as a whole.
Finally, it is clear that today, when China’s special socialism enters a new era, we can tell the restless elites that a powerful China is rising in the East and that the Chinese dream of the great renaissance of the Chinese nation is turning into reality in our hands.
Let's move forward with a spirit of greatness and greatness!

The fifth Disability Voice Month is coming to focus on sexuality education for young people with disabilities.
In recent years, the subject of sexual education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenge for education for young people with disabilities remains daunting.
Recently, a workshop on challenges and strategies for comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities was held in Beijing.
Sexual education for children and young people with disabilities was an important topic of the seminar.
The report on sexual-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of disabled children and young people in China, published at the conference, showed that disabled children suffer from higher rates of sexual harassment and sexual abuse than healthy children.
Social attention to disabled children and adolescents is also “sexually protected”.
The purpose of the seminar was to explore the promotion of comprehensive sexuality education for children and adolescents with disabilities in China from the standpoint of family support, school education and institutional services, and to provide support to children and adolescents with disabilities from the source so that they can enjoy their right to love on an equal footing with others.
According to the experts, the awareness of the general public in Chinese society of the disabled population has been at an insufficient level of depth.
China ' s comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities, especially children and adolescents, is not sufficiently advanced, owing to factors such as traditional attitudes.
In recent years, however, with the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the public good, there has been a welcome development in the practice and path of comprehensive development of sexual and reproductive health education for persons with disabilities throughout the cycle in China.
The Report shows that children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical impairments, while having some difficulties in accessing sexual knowledge and understanding intimate relationships, have generally moved towards ease and enrichment.
“Seminar on challenges and strategies for comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities”, sponsored by the Shanghai People's Welfare Foundation, with the support of the UNESCO Office in China, the International Disability Alliance in Beijing (France) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in China, to discuss the full cycle of sexual and reproductive health for persons with disabilities in the context of a broad strategy for healthy China.
Wednesday, 30 September, in Beijing, the Central Bank of China published data on the short-term net outflow of foreign currency assets, showing that, as of the end of August this year, the Bank’s foreign currency had zero forward and futures contracts for 12 months in a row.
According to the central bank ' s previous data, at the end of August last year, the central bank held a total of $6,044 million, or the fourth consecutive month, vacant positions for forward and futures contracts in foreign currencies; the size of the empty positions in the SDR (Special Drawing Rights) was 4,276 million SDRs.
Since then, the central bank ' s foreign exchange forward position has been zero.
The central bank released the data for the first time at the end of March 2016; the data show that at the end of February 2016, the foreign currency of the central bank had a multi-position of $2,438 million in forward and futures contracts and $28.9 billion in empty positions.
For the first time, the September data released at the end of October of the same year showed a net increase of $16,401 million to $45,301 million.
The Central Bank has previously stated that foreign currency forward and futures empty positions in this currency largely reflect its foreign exchange forward operations with commercial banks to meet the demand for hedging of corporate foreign currency liabilities, and will continue to provide long-term risk-avoidance products on a demand-driven basis, and that the Bank ' s forward operations will be directed towards the size of future foreign exchange reserves
On the evening of 20 September this year, on the K158 train, Joe, a senior student in Chengzhou, took the car to the crane wall.
One of the masters on the train bought a ticket without a seat, but took her seat: "Take a picture of it."
Two hours away, the train captain persuaded him to remain ineffective for an hour.
Eventually, a male passenger in the same car couldn't look down and pull him up.
From the standpoint of bad faith, while the result is mostly public condemnation of the hegemonics, administrative punishments by the public security services, and even the blacklists of good faith, the public still feels that it is not “free of hatred”: why not let the hegemonics be punished on the spot?
Why can't they be punished in the first place, rather than in the second place, by preventing their immoral and even unlawful behaviour?
And how can a male passenger be dragged up by a male passenger for the unreasonable conduct of the Grand Priest?
This is mainly due to the fact that only long-distance trains are equipped with police officers and that short-distance trains are not generally available; even when they are available, they tend to worry about the possible rogue reaction of the hegemonics and do not resort to coercive removal measures.
Repeated hegemonic incidents have led to the realization that hegemonics must be forcibly removed from the scene and even punished in order to act as a deterrent.
This requires that our trains take robust measures in a timely manner and that the trains without them be deployed as soon as possible in order to ensure that violations are stopped and combated in a timely manner.
On 1 October, on the first day of the national holiday, there was a sharp increase in the number of vehicles travelling to Songpan, Mau County, via the Sichuan-North Trunchuan Autonomous District.
At around 1300 hours, a call for help was made to the Niekawa traffic police saying that their family had been in a traffic accident in Songpan and that, owing to the limited medical conditions in the area, there was an urgent need to send them to Mianyang for treatment.
A single-way traffic control was imposed on the Lake Tungjiang road in Kitchen, and the traffic police were asked to release the 120 first aid vehicles.
Upon receipt of a call for help, the civilian police on duty promptly reported the situation to the brigade, and immediately after the commander was briefed, he arranged for the civilian police officers on duty at the control point to contact the caller and requested that all efforts be made to provide the escort.
“There were more than a thousand vehicles entering the control section at that time, and after contacting 120 first aid vehicles, we were expected to arrive in Kitagawa at around 1500 hours, and we immediately arranged for their deployment.”
Captain Xiaowei of the Kitagawa traffic police station said that the first aid vehicle needed to be bypassed from Tang Jiaxuan Lake Ring road and the road was narrow. In order to prevent the traffic of vehicles that had entered the road in parallel, the traffic officer was at the start, centre and end of the road one hour earlier.
Subsequently, the drumming squadron of civilian police also suspended their vehicles from entering the control section and queued for the 120 emergency vehicles that were about to arrive.
At 1500 hours, an ambulance with a Kawakami U licence plate entered the territory of Kitagawa and a police car was sent by the police to escort the ambulance back into the control section.
It is understood that only one vehicle is available in some areas of the road around the lake, and that the civilian police made early temporary control of those areas and ensured the smooth passage of the 120 emergency vehicles.
Upon arrival at the 10 miles of the village, there was a road that could not be wrongly ceded, so the traffic police contacted the village councils in advance, borrowed the village lane by detour and banned social vehicles from entering the village.
“it took only 40 minutes to get a 120 emergency vehicle from the Kitagawa traffic police to the normal road to 302 provincial road.”
Mr. Wei explained that, as a rule, it took four hours for the entire passage time to pass.
“This arrangement has successfully secured valuable treatment time for the patient.”
At 1720 hours, the patients at risk were said to have arrived in Mianyang in time for treatment.
The number of confirmed deaths due to the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose rapidly to 832 and the authorities fear that this number will rise, as relief workers have difficulty in providing assistance to remote areas that are no longer connected.
Of particular concern is the fact that this area, north of Baru, has a population of 300,000, close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Two other areas have lost contact with the outside world since Friday.
“We have not yet received reports from the other three regions.”
Communications and electricity continued to be disrupted.
Nugroho indicated that the missing persons included five foreigners, three of whom were French, one Korean and one Malaysian.
The earthquake and tsunami killed 832 people.
According to Vice-President Kara of Indonesia, the death toll is likely to rise to thousands.
Earlier, Indonesian President Zorko-Vidodo had surveyed the affected areas and called on the population to endure.
Reuters 4 November - The British Daily Telegraph Sunday reported that British Secretary of State for Europe, Dominic Raab, had privately requested Britain's right to “safe” arrangements outside the Irish border after three months.
Rabb was reported to have made this request to Simon Coveney, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Ireland, at a private meeting in London last Tuesday.
It was reported that this request was “manifestly contradictory” to the statement made three days later by British Cabinet Secretary David Lidington during his visit to Dublin.
The United Kingdom Department of Trade and Social Affairs indicated that it would not comment on private meetings.
Yesterday morning, at 8.05 a.m., two suspects of theft were arrested while the 20th bus was stealing from the 20th bus station at Yongding Gate to Pearl City.
Two of the men who stole the passengers cut off their outer clothes and stole 800 dollars in cash from them, leading to the capture of civilian police who had already been standing by.
This was the first case of theft by the Beijing police during the National Day.
Yesterday, at around 5 a.m., the counter-prosecution officers of the Beijing Public Security Mobile Investigation Unit arrived at their intended positions.
According to past experience, places where human flows are concentrated, public transport hubs, public transport subway lines, including those in Tiananmen Square watching flag-raising, are the focus areas of their work.
During the flow, civilian plainclothes officers watched the passers-by calmly.
At more than 7 a.m., two suspicious men were found by investigators who were at the bus station, following a male passenger who had been on a 20-way bus from the Yongding gate.
In the car, two suspicious men, one left and one right, caught the male passenger in the middle, one of whom tried to cover the other.
They did not know, however, that their actions were already in the eyes of civilian plainclothes officers who were watching.
“Kidnapping of thieves”, the plain-clothes civilian police caught people waiting for the men to commit the theft, and while they were waiting for the men to do so, the civilian police looked at the men who were ready to steal and were caught by the investigators as soon as they had been able to steal them.
Reporters from the Beijing Morning News observed that the civilian police had seized $800 in cash from suspects of theft.
"They took the money out of the passenger's pocket."
The civilian police, pointing to a broken jacket pocket, said: “They cut the place open, stole $800 from a tourist who came to Kyoto, and when we caught them, the money was just loaded into their own pockets.”
The journalist learned that in order to capture the two men, the plainclothes civilian police had followed him for an hour and had finally caught him at the time of his crime.
Two suspects are currently under police scrutiny.
The civilian police in plain clothes told journalists who was suspicious in the crowd, a problem that was simple for the civilian police.
“The more thieves are caught, the more their eyes, the more their look, the more they look at the ordinary passengers, the more they look at people’s pockets and backpacks, the more they like to drill into the crowds, the less they run away from them.”
The civilian police also told journalists that suspects often wait for vehicles that are not purposeful and that they prefer to wander at the station to follow after they find the object of the theft.
"These are the words of experience. You've been working in plain clothes for a long time. You'll see."
In addition, the civilian police warned that “the most convenient and easy to steal is to hide.”
Take care of your belongings while travelling in the car in case of theft.

The British Prime Minister, Teresa May, called on his party on Sunday to unite in support of her European retreat and directly called on critics to support it, saying that the free trade agreement they wanted was at the heart of her European retreat.
On 30 September 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May, Birmingham, travelled to attend a Conservative Party meeting.
At the beginning of this exciting annual meeting of the Conservative Party, Teresa May's plan was once again criticized by two former cabinet ministers, including former Foreign Secretary Johnson, who described the plan of Teresa May as “wrong”.
But she also received strong support from other ministers who supported the retreat: “Tresa May is one of the most polite people”, and international trade ministers Fox and Foreign Secretary Hunt pointed their anger towards the EU.
Theresa May's fragile leadership has been further pressurized this month by the rejection by the European Union of part of the so-called “Chicks” plan.
However, Teresa May took a positive view of those consultations and stated that she was prepared to consider the doubts of the European Union.
"My message to my own political party is that let's work together to find the best deal for Britain," told Teresa May.
Former British Foreign Secretary Johnson called Tereza May’s plan “wrong” and criticized her for her lack of confidence in Europe’s retreat.
He and former British Secretary of State for Europe, Davis, are pushing for a Canadian-style trade agreement with the EU.
Teresa May, for his part, said that the proposal would enable Northern Ireland to implement different tariff provisions, in the form of a division of Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom.

Markron's promotion of France's legacy of "bread with sticks" and the protection of French technology - China's new network.
According to Reuters, European countries have successively made their own dietary claims. France has also recently planned to apply for stick bread to be included in the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage following the Belgian beer and the Naples pancakes in Italy.

The head of the airport administration stated that, at the time, the Chinese tourist was not satisfied that he had been refused entry and was unwilling to comply with the control and stay in the restricted area of the repatriation, and that there had been a push and physical confrontation with security personnel.
The security officer is currently suspended by the Airports Authority.
The incident has had an impact on Thailand ' s tourist image, and there has been a profound apology on the part of the Hong Kong airport. In order to try to make up for the damage, the next step will be to convey through the Chinese Embassy a deep apology to the Chinese visitor who was attacked.

In recent years, this newspaper (internship journalist Li Xuan) has experienced numerous incidents of incompetence of the school ' s plastic runway.
To this end, the Ministry of Education has issued a circular requiring the implementation of the new national logo at the surface sports site for synthetic materials in primary and secondary schools to be delivered after 1 November this year.
Mandatory national standards, " Primary and Secondary Synthetic Materials Surface Sports Grounds " , organized by the Ministry of Education with the participation of 26 scientific institutes and testing agencies, were revised over two years, during which more than 100 expert meetings were organized, as well as country-wide field visits, sampling tests and the collection of hundreds of corporate products on the market.
In comparison with the 2005 old national logo, journalists found that not only did the new country sign change from a “national recommended standard” to a “national mandatory standard”, but it also added a number of elements, including thickness requirements, physical performance, age-resistant performance, inorganic filling requirements, high elastic protection particles.
In particular, the new flag limits the amount of hazardous substances that may arise from the construction of plastic runways in schools, increasing from 7 to 18, and regulates the amount of volatile organic materials in the completed runways in accordance with domestic standards.
For example, the release of hazardous substances is specified in the `Restrictions and odour requirements for present and prefabricated surface products', requiring total volatile organic compounds to be no greater than 5 mg/m3, formaldehyde to be no greater than 0.4 mg/m3, and carbon dioxide to be no greater than 7 mg/m3
The new logo also provides details on sampling requirements for plastic runways in primary and secondary schools, the rules for testing, the rules for determining them, etc.
In addition, for the first time, an artificial lawn on campus was included in the compulsory testing of national tenders.
In the near future, special work will be carried out on the implementation of the new national tender, which will be transmitted to the Department of Physical Health and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education during the course of the year.
In the afternoon of September 30th, the Chinese and new Internet customers will be playing “The Civil War” in the finals of the 2018 Women's World Cup.
At the end of the day, Hu Yu Ling, a friend of the team who was the winner of Master Tinning ' s main battle at 4:0 p.m., took the throne of the female World Cup four years later, which was the twenty-first time that the Chinese woman took the title.
Tinning and Yu Ling are teammates and friends, and both are familiar with each other ' s tactics.
Both sides followed each other, whether in preparation for war or before the race.
On entering the finals, the two of them indicated that they had completed the campaign without meeting each other.
But the match between Tinning and Jo Yu Ling in the game is a sight of swords.
In the first round, the winner of the tournament, Tinning, leads by 3:1, and then Jo Yu Ling, through Tinning's error, returns to a three-square score.
Then Jo Yu Ling ' s mistakes in the attack began to increase, and Tinning seized the opportunity to take the lead by a score of 9:5 and to take the lead at 10:6.
Even though Chu Yu Ling pursued three points, Tinning took the first round at 11:9.
In the second round, Zhu Yuling ' s failures remain high, with Tinning taking the lead from 6:1 to take advantage of the dominant position in each other.
During the lag of 2:7, Hu Yu Ling achieved two points by a change of rhythm, and then pursued the score at 8:9 using the attack.
At a critical time, Tinning won two points at 11:8.
In the third round, the two began with a sharper bite of 3:3 flat.
Tinning then lost three points by mistake in the attack, but she then hit three points by sharpness, which would have been six points.
Hu Yu Ling's two-point line re-created the advantage and took the lead at 10:8.
But Dinning was extremely aggressive, with a four-point line and a third round at 12:10.
In the fourth round, Hu Yu Ling's 4:2 lead.
But since then, Tinning has demonstrated a super-intrusive state, with four points after which she has stopped.
After the suspension, Yuling was able to recover some of her condition and gradually achieve a score of 8:8 p.m.
At this critical moment, Tinning is not soft enough to score two points to get to the point.
As Jo Yu Ling returns to the field, Dining sweeps the opponent to the crown at 4:0.
Last month, Tinning came to Chengdu with the crown of her 14-month-old champion in the Bulgarian public race, despite her saying that she had not set a goal for this race before the race, and in the semi-finals, which ended this morning, Tinning said that she had completed her mission.
In the end, Tinning won his teammate Joo Yu Ling and won the personal third World Cup champion, and she was satisfied with her performance: “A champion is important to every athlete.
Before the race, I didn't think of it, but I said, "One fight, and the finals are still quite satisfactory."
"I think I can handle the stress side of the whole game, and today Tinning's performance has been remarkable, leading to a failure to find rhythm.
Activating rural consumption depends on regularization mechanisms to clean up markets, guide demand for healthy consumption and enhance farmers ' sense of access to consumption.
The data show that the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released, with retail sales of consumer goods increasing 10.5 per cent in rural areas in the first half of the year, at an increase of 1.3 percentage points higher than in urban areas.
In a poor village in one of the western districts, the village had only one convenience store, and some goods appeared familiar, “Golden Dragonfish” was marked as “Golden Dragon Oil”, “Wanty” became “Mother Milk” and “Mounty” commodities were numerous.
Over the years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed, and some rural pseudo-goods brands with similar names, similar packagings, and disinformation have been inexorable.
A consumption survey published by a municipality in the west showed that rural traders had a serious problem with over-false goods, with 66 per cent of users buying fake goods at the sub-town supermarkets, of which more than half were food products.
Why is it that Li Chi continues to fight every year when the authorities are trying to control the rural market?
Unlike urban markets, farmers are less aware of their rights, coupled with the remoteness of many rural areas and the lack of regulatory literacy, which gives fertile ground to counterfeit commodities.
A commodity has many headlines, some sectorally regulated prices, some managed production, some managed markets, cross-functionalities, annual vacations, centralized management, and the counterfeits have sprung up again, just after the old vacations and new ones.
The lack of long-standing regulatory mechanisms, the impurity of rural markets, the low cost of breaking the law and the high level of profit have led some outlaws to become “downhill” and some rural areas to become “dismantling markets”.
From subsistence to welfare, large numbers of farmers are moving towards developmental consumption.
Today, the Party Centre and the State Council issued "A number of Opinions on Improving the Institutional Mechanisms for Promoting Consumption " , which further stimulates the consumer potential of the population, proposing to promote the upgrading of the consumption ladder for the rural population, with the aim of enabling the farmers to “consumption as they wish” and to “consumption” for the rural consumption.
On the one hand, there is a need to deepen reforms to eliminate the many regulatory and multi-managerial problems of market regulation, to improve food safety and product quality monitoring networks, and to continuously reduce the space available in rural areas for counterfeiting and selling.
On the other hand, greater enforcement and regulation of “fine veins” must not be allowed to spread in rural areas under false pretences.
Heavy punishment of farmers should not be used as a justification for the creation of false goods, regardless of the extent to which counterfeiters are hidden. The authorities concerned should clarify their responsibilities, the low level of supervision, and any link that is problematic must be held accountable and the counterfeiters and sellers should have no place to hide.
Market access has been strictly closed, producers have been subjected to rigorous qualification, markets have been closed, products have been brought to the fore, roads have been cleared, sources and roots have been found, and legitimate distributors have been reassured and farmers have been reassured.
Activation of rural consumption, leading to healthy consumption demand.
As consumption rises, many farmers not only seek to feed well, eat well, but also to live a high quality of life, such as culture and health. Rural markets cannot be equated with “low-quality” “low-cost” paintings.
This will require promoting the extension of e-commerce to rural areas, opening up rural and urban two-way distribution channels, facilitating the integration of off-line industrial development platforms and on-line power trading platforms, and supporting the expansion of new patterns of consumption to rural markets; and promoting business logistics and recreational agriculture and rural tourism in eligible townships.
The creation of a clear and secure market environment for the rural sector, which makes it difficult for farmers to consume more and more, enhances farmers ' sense of access and well-being.
With the reduction of some MFN rates for commodities from 1 November, the total tariff level will fall to 7.5 per cent.
In accordance with the decision of the 26th Standing Meeting of the State Council, the State Council Committee on Customs and Excise issued a circular on 30 November 2018, which reduced the most-favoured-nation (MFN) rates for some commodities as of 1 November 2018.
Pursuant to the State Council ' s Customs and Excise Commission ' s Proclamation on the Reduction of Tariffs on Imports of Selected Goods, and in order to accommodate the needs of industrial upgrading, lower business costs and meet the multi-level consumption of the population, the MFN rate for some goods, including industrial goods, was reduced as of 1 November this year.
The average tax rate fell from 10.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent, with an average reduction of 26 per cent.
This tax reduction relates mainly to textiles; stone, ceramic and glass products; parts of iron and steel and base metal products; mechanical and electrical equipment and parts such as metalworking machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, transformer equipment, electrical appliances, instrumentation, etc.; and resource commodities and primary processing products.
At the same time, as the overall level of tariffs, particularly on pharmaceuticals and imports of daily consumer goods, has been reduced, the tariff lines of import duties on imported goods have been reduced accordingly.
As a follow-up to the decision-making deployment of the Party ' s Central and State Council, the country introduced zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported medicines on 1 May this year, reduced import tariffs on cars and spare parts and part-time consumer goods on 1 July, and implemented an information technology agreement extending the third step of tariff reduction for products.
Journalists have learned from the Customs and Excise Committee of the State Council that, since this year, the overall level of our customs duties has been reduced by an average of 23 per cent, from 9.8 per cent in the previous year to 7.5 per cent, following successive autonomous adjustments.
Appropriate tariff reductions would facilitate balanced development of foreign trade and higher levels of openness to the outside world, as well as the integration of both domestic and international resources into domestic supply-side structural reforms.
The relevant officials of the Committee stated that this year marks the 40th anniversary of the opening of the reform, and that the initiative to reduce the overall level of tariffs is a practical step in the implementation of the spirit of the important speech of Secretary-General Xi Jinping at the Forum for Asia, as well as an important step towards further expansion of the country ' s open and proactive import expansion in accordance with its high-quality development needs, which demonstrates China ' s firm commitment to mutual benefit.
On 29 September, the launch of the regional public brand of “Girls” agricultural products was held in Nankai District, Tianjin City, Gansu province.
The Red Army Xiaomei, Black Bean, Mountain Boys singing Montenegrin sheep, tweaked tea, paper-scissors, hand-held slippers... a piece of finely packaged produce placed on the exhibition stage with a common brand name called "Callers of the Country."
“Build a regional brand of the ‘Close Country’ that effectively addresses the development bottlenecks of the ‘multiple scattered, small and weak’ agricultural products around the county, and became a powerful vehicle for poverty eradication.” On 29th, a regional public brand of the ‘Close Country’ agricultural products hosted by Gansu Quantang County was launched on the day.
It is located at the border of the three provinces of Kaning, China, as the “advanced counties of the nation's food production”, “China's small groceries”, and has a long history and a wealth of resources.
Snacks such as lamb meat, yellow wine, pasta, tender oatmeal are often reminiscent of swimmers in other parts of the country.
As China ' s urbanization has increased, the urban population has grown rapidly, and a large number of young rural people have left their homes to begin urban life.
Chinese agricultural brand researcher Yang Xiaojia said: “Cities are now fast and under stress, and more and more people are beginning to miss their village life as a child, but, ‘The home country is the home country, the most beautiful memory is the village’, and the ‘Close Country’ brand is designed to be the country’.
The surrounding subdistricts have special climatic conditions, with long daylight periods, very poor day and night temperatures and unique conditions for the cultivation of small groceries.
There are more than 20 small-scale groceries in China, the largest producer of small groceries and the highest quality in the country.
Wang Xiao Li, a local girl who went to school in Tianjin, took part as a volunteer and said, "The natives are the closest, the natives are the most beautiful, and the brand of `Tianjin' brings back so much of our memories and memories.
Dr. Tam Bin, researcher at the Scientific Research Institute of the National Food and Material Reserve, stated that, through the testing of more than 900 sets of indicators, all tests of agricultural products such as wheat, bitter beans, black beans, etc. in the surrounding districts were highly superior, many of the physico-active material content of the groceries was higher than the standard data, and that the “circle people” had more than the standard data.
The District Committee Secretary, Chai Chun, said that the publication of the “Circle Country” brand would further enhance the quality, standardization, scale and innovative level of development of high-quality agricultural products in the Rim County, contribute to the overall image of the ring's agricultural products and rapidly increase visibility, competitiveness and value addition.
In July, Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.2 per cent over the previous month, a higher than expected increase, and the market’s expectation that interest rates from the Central Bank of Canada would rise next month.
If the interest rate really rises, it will be the fifth increase in the central bank's interest rate in a little more than a year.
The analyst for the Reuters interview had previously estimated an increase of 0.1 per cent.
According to Statistics Canada, on Friday, 12 of the 20 industries registered growth.
This data is noteworthy because the Central Bank anticipated earlier this month that temporary factors might drag on the third quarter of GDP data.
The Governor of the Central Bank of Canada, Poloze, promised on Thursday that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates gradually and would pay close attention to economic data.
The next announcement of interest rates by the Central Bank of Canada will take place on 24 October.
As a result of the strengthening of the Canadian economy and the close to record low unemployment rate, the Central Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at the macro level, said that the country ' s GDP ring growth in the third quarter of the economy was expected to be around 2 per cent per annum.
“This would be more than the 1.5% expected by the Central Bank of Canada, and would therefore be another reason to expect the Bank to raise interest rates next month,” he said in a report.
The overnight index exchange shows that the market forecast for the BCC rate of increase in October rose from 76.46 per cent to 78.27 per cent.
For the first time in 65 years, the Koreans jointly visited the Han River to the sea.
The Korean Ministry of Defence confirmed that on that day it had launched a joint mission to Hanjiang and Pinjin River into the waters of the mouth of the sea.
The initiative is an advance preparation to guarantee the free navigation of civilian vessels on both sides.
A circular from the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea to the media on the same day indicated that this was the first joint visit of the two sides to the Han River to the mouth of the sea since the Korean War Armistice Agreement of 1953.
The Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea signed a military agreement in September this year to undertake a joint study of the Han River into waters such as the mouth of the sea, starting in November, in order to guarantee the future environmental protection of the waters and the development of tourism.
In October, the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea planned a joint study of the waters at a general level.
The joint Korean-Korean water expedition was officially launched on 5 November.
The joint mission consisted of 20 Korean and Korean military personnel, experts and others.
According to the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea, neither side carried weapons during the mission and was prohibited from provoking each other ' s words and actions.
“As there is no military demarcation line near the estuary, the area was an unexpectedly high point, but through joint visits it will become a new zone of peace in the future.”
The total length of the joint Korean-Korean expedition was about 70 kilometres, with a total area of about 280 square kilometres.
The Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Korea stated that it would send six cruise ships to detect seawater depths, etc., to provide basic information for safe navigation in the waters; pending the completion of the investigation, it would provide navigational maps for the movement of civilian vessels.
In October 2007, a summit meeting was held in Pyongyang to reach an agreement on the joint use of the rivers of Han and Pingjin to the sea, but the subsequent negotiations were stalled by the tense situation on the peninsula.
In accordance with the military agreement signed by the Koreans in September, future vessels from both sides are required to inform each other in advance of the voyage in common waters.
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia on 4 November, Chinese citizens Guo Yucsing and Mao Yuseng lost contact during their tour in Mong.
It is understood that the two were members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team and that on 19 October, they contacted their relatives and friends in the country, said that they were about to explore in the mountains near Lake Kusuguor and shared their positions through micromails, and that they had since lost contact and appeared to have gone to the no-man ' s area.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and security of Chinese citizens in Mongolia and to consular protection and assistance.
Upon being informed of the loss of contact between the two visitors, the Embassy launched an emergency insurance plan and tried to seize the time of the gold rescue and to work at full capacity.
The Embassy maintained close communication with the families of the persons concerned, assisted them in immediately reporting the incident to the police and provided them with a translation list for their choice.
The Embassy met with the heads of the Ministry of External Relations, the Directorate-General of Police and the Directorate-General of Emergency Situations of Mongolia at the first opportunity to inform them of the situation and to request that the search and rescue be carried out as soon as possible and that close communication be maintained with the latter throughout the search and rescue process to ensure that the latest developments are kept up to date.
At the same time, the Embassy assisted the family in issuing a search notice at Monwau and widely mobilized the active participation of Chinese and Chinese companies in the search, providing effective leads and providing assistance to a number of blue-sky rescue teams who were travelling to the city to assist in the rescue.
As a result of the Embassy ' s vigorous efforts, the first rescue team was dispatched by Mon Fung and promised a waiver of the search and rescue costs.
The General Directorate of Police and the General Directorate of Emergency Situations instructed the police and the Emergency Department in Kusguor province to do their utmost to search and rescue.
Because of the fact that Lake Kusukuur is located in the northern part of Mongolia on the border with Russia, is remote, very sparsely populated and extremely inaccessible to transport and communications, and that Mongolia is now entering a severe winter with temperatures of around 20 degrees below zero, the local police and emergency services have overcome enormous difficulties and mobilized almost all police forces,
At the same time, with regard to the special situation of pastoralist areas, Monfon has for many days been conducting circulars on radio.
Staff from the National Blue Sky Rescue Team have also been actively involved in the rescue, together with Monfon.
The safety and well-being of the two missing persons has always held our hearts.
So far, more than a decade has passed since the two were lost, the Embassy has received a number of leads, but no two have been found, and search and rescue operations are still under stress.
The Embassy will continue to follow the matter on a “people-centred” basis, to promote the continuation of full search and rescue efforts and to provide maximum assistance to the families of the persons concerned.
The Embassy appealed to Chinese compatriots and enterprises to contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia for the first time if they were informed of any relevant leads.
The ex-guard claims Michael Jackson put a tape on his nose to get on the headlines.
Michael Jackson ' s former bodyguard claimed that the late singer had deliberately committed some strange acts in order to incite the media.
Matt Fédés, now a real estate developer and owner of the martial arts/dance chain, told the Metropolis newspaper that Jackson believed that his personal obsession would end if he was no longer in the eyes of the public.
It was reported that, in order to be on the headline, he would wear a mask and put a tape on his nose in order to spark the debate.
We'll tell you the truth. You can have your own point of view.
"He knew how to manipulate the media. He knew exactly how to get on the headlines," said Freds, who had been Jackson's bodyguard for 10 years. "Put a mask on his face, stick it on his hand with a tape, or stick it on his nose with a tape.
He added: “It is very sad that the outcome was not what it was intended to be”.
Fédés also referred to allegations of child sexual abuse by Wade Robson and James Sefchak against Jackson, which had been broadcast in the controversial Emmy award-winning documentary Departure from Neverland.
Both Robson and Sefchak claimed that they had been ill-treated by Jackson for years as a child.
Fédés claimed, “Paedophilia is full of nonsense and this guy has multiple girlfriends and a legal marriage with Lisa Marie Presley, and that's his life.”
He claims that the abuse of children by Jackson on Neverland's ranch was “impossible” because he “almost” did not stay on the farm.
He said, “They said there were several boys around, but that was not the case”.
Jackson House denied all the charges against the deceased star. Jackson denied all the charges against him before he died in 2009.
The government has another 15 tax officials who have retired as a result of corruption.
New Delhi:
The Government, in its fourth round of operations against negligent officials suspected of corruption and other malpractices, forced 15 tax officials to retire.
According to official sources, under Rule 56(J) of the Basic Rules, the Central Indirect Taxation and Customs Commission, which supervises the collection of taxes on goods and services and import duties, forced 15 senior officials to retire on charges of corruption and other charges.
This is the fourth round of dismissal of corrupt tax officials since June of this year. A total of 49 senior tax officials were forcibly retired in the first three rounds, including 12 officials of the Central Direct Tax Commission.
According to the source, this action was in line with Prime Minister Modi ' s address to the nation in Fort Red, when Modi stated that some of the bad horses in the tax administration might abuse their power, harass taxpayers, either target honest appraisals or take excessive action against minor or procedural irregularities.
He said: “We have recently taken strong measures to force a significant number of tax officials to retire, and we will not tolerate such behaviour”.
Nearly half of the retired officials were arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation of India on suspicion of receiving illegal benefits. One of them was arrested for bribes of 15,000 rupees.
In June of this year, the Government forced 15 Central Indirect Taxation and Customs Commission Commissioners to retire on charges of corruption, bribery, smuggling and even conspiracy to commit crimes. Prior to that, the Government had imposed corruption, sexual harassment, massive uncertainty, in accordance with section 56(J) of the Central Civil Service (pensions) Rules.
In August, the Government forced 22 Central Central Indirect Taxation and Customs Commission officers to retire. Section 56(J) of the Central Civil Service (pensions) Rules 1972 provides for periodic review of the performance of public servants to determine whether they should remain in office or retire in the public interest.
According to these provisions, the situation of government employees provided for in Basic Rules, 1972, articles 56(J), 56(1) or 48(1)(b) of the Central Civil Service (pensions) Rules, if the situation as described in Basic Rules, 1972, article 56(J), and pursuant to Basic Rules, article 56(1) or
A Maine woman received 500 letters in five days from the joint health insurance.
Stephanie Ray indicated that from Thursday to Monday her mailbox had been plugged in by a letter from the insurance company.
“The first wave began last Thursday with 46 letters,” she told CNN. “I immediately called the Joint Health Insurance and informed them that I had received 46 letters of the same content.”
However, the letter was followed by more than 500 letters as of Monday.
The letters were mailed to her son, who lived in a private nursing home with autism, and she explained. But opened the letter, which did not mention her son's name, but said, “The Honourable Maine State Department of Health and Human Services — Cincinnati”, she told the local media.
Those letters were all claims outside the scope of joint health insurance coverage of 54 or 0 United States dollars, Ms. Ray.
When she asked why the joint health insurance had received a lot of letters, she was told that it was because of a problem with the code, which she said.
In its statement, the Joint Health Insurance informed CNN that they were addressing the issue and that they could not provide more details in view of privacy requirements.
“We have identified the root causes of the problem. We apologize for the incident, and we have contacted the family and asked about them.” The health insurance company says.
Ms. Ray said there was a message at the bottom of every letter calling for people to be paperless. “I think the letters they sent wasted half of the trees in the forest,” she said.
Antonio Brown claims he's not ready for retirement.
Antonio Brown indicated that he would not retire from the National Football League of the United States, and just a few days ago, he shouted on Twitter to announce that he had left the National Football Union.
The four full-time catchers wrote on Twitter on Thursday: “I'm in good shape and why I'm retiring now.” He accepted the suggestion that the game needs him.
Brown was accused of sexual misconduct by two women. He was released by the New England Patriots after a game last week. Last six months, Antonio Brown was abandoned by three different teams.
Brown, who lost Nike's sponsor last week, said that he would be training one day a week in high school, starting in Miami.
Thirty-one-year-old Brown also had an argument on Twitter with Eric Weedell, a security guard for the Los Angeles Goats, who was often in contact with him while he was on the Baltimore Crows.
HSBC Bank converts crime detection tools to start a new business
The British HSBC (HSBC) has converted the algorithm used to detect financial crimes into a means of opening up new business opportunities, earlier forced by the money-laundering scandal, as the head of the bank said.
The system combines data on customer banking and corporate ownership with public data on directorships, identifies suitable potential clients for HSBC staff and provides a means of communicating with these clients through existing customer relationships.
While HSBC's overall revenue collection strategy seeks to generate additional benefits from its large physical network and client data, the use of data and artificial intelligence to try to increase revenue is also part of the strategy, and raising the overall collection is also a top priority for Interim Chief Executive Officer Noel Quinn.
“This is the first time that an investment in financial crime prevention has been used for commercial purposes, and the business so developed has itself been low-risk and quick-impacted,” said Stuart Neveson, the global head of HSBC's network bank.
HSBC refused to disclose the expected benefits of the new system, but stated that the overall “network gain” initiative had already generated hundreds of millions of dollars in additional benefits.
This is also an important step in the efforts of the HSBC Bank to maintain its global operations, as some analysts and investors have previously indicated that the Bank should downsize or exit markets with lower returns than capital costs, such as the United States market.
In 2012, HSBC failed to prevent drug traffickers from carrying out money-laundering activities through its Mexican subsidiaries, concluding a settlement agreement with the United States authorities of $1.9 billion, of which hundreds of millions of dollars were forced to invest in financial crime compliance.
The system can achieve its original design by mapping relationships between individual clients and companies, looking for unusual trading patterns, or discovering previously unknown links between the two.
The system has freed the workforce of more than 400 staff members, who no longer need to manually check transactions and records and take on more customer-oriented services, as stated by the Chief Operator of the HSBC Trade Operations, Adléon Rigby.
Fédération Niveson pointed out that they suddenly realized that, with a slight modification of the tool, it could be used to find a “small green flag” for more attractive potential clients rather than a “small red flag” for violations.
“We have acquired customer data sets, combined them with data from the (United Kingdom) company register, and then turned the previous algorithms to the client's potential, which may be achieved through registration, company development or links to existing customers”, said Niveson.
This tool has already mapped 22.5 million British entities and individuals and can identify a link network within three minutes, and bankers often take three hours to manually create the map, he said.
Ruhani said that Iran had been promised that the United States would lift “all” sanctions in exchange for dialogue.
European countries were eager to negotiate with Iran, and all hinted that if Tehran were willing to engage in dialogue, the United States would end its sanctions on Iran, as President Hassan Rouhani said.
According to Rouhani, the European signatories to the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement urged him to meet with United States President Donald Trump and promised Washington that “all” sanctions would be lifted in exchange for dialogue.
“Three of the six - the German Prime Minister, the British Prime Minister and the French President - insisted on holding this meeting, saying that the United States would lift all sanctions,” said the Iranian President.
He said that he had rejected the offer because the negotiations would take place “with the maximum pressure and sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States”, and it was impossible to predict any outcome.
Trump quickly denied that any relief had been provided to Iran, and Twittered that Tehran had asked him to lift the sanctions as a condition for dialogue, but that he had “of course” refused.
In his statement, Rouhani also stated that many countries had expressed their support for Iran in one-on-one talks during the United Nations General Assembly. “We discussed a number of issues with others, and all condemned the withdrawal of the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan and its pressure. This was a great success for Iran.”
The Government initiated consultations on the review of the law on the raising of dogs
The dog law in Scotland is under review for fear of uncontrolled animal control and lack of responsibility on the part of the owners.
The Scottish Government has initiated a consultation for public comment.
The Scottish Minister for Community Safety has committed to “ensure community safety and keep people away from irresponsible owners”, with a view to determining whether the law against uncontrolled dogs needs to be amended.
Member of Scottish Parliament Ash Denham said: “We are in the process of conducting two reviews of the law on dogs, because we are absolutely determined to ensure the safety of the community and to keep people away from the irresponsible dog owners and their uncontrollable dogs.
This consultation is intended to seek advice on how to improve the implementation of the Canine Control Act 2010 in Scotland, and next year we will review all canine control bills more broadly to assess whether changes are needed.
“Dog-raising entails certain responsibilities, including keeping your dog under effective control, and I encourage everyone interested in this field to respond to our public opinion consultations.”
The public opinion consultation will continue until January 15, including proposals to strengthen and clarify existing legislation, such as the question of whether a national canine control database should be established.
The Scottish Parliament ' s post-legislation Ombudsman has been hearing the testimony of victims and parents of children who have been attacked or killed by dogs, urging the Government to review the law on the raising of dogs.
Members of the Scottish Parliament were informed that legislation was in urgent need of reform to protect vulnerable groups and children.
The Committee was informed that, in Grand Glasgow and Clyde alone, 1417 people, including 255 children, had been taken to the emergency section of the hospital last year as a result of dog bites.
912 The highest number of people receiving treatment in four years were those receiving treatment at the National Health Service in Larnak County and 439 at the National Health Service in El County.
In July, members of the Council concluded that the current dog law was not relevant to its purpose and called on the Scottish Government to undertake a comprehensive review of all dog law.
The head of the committee, Jenny Marla, said: “The Scottish dog law does not serve the purpose. There are still many dog attacks against children, but the laws in force that may prevent these attacks are almost never enforced or known.
“It is clear that the current dog-keeping laws are not working. The current dog-keeping laws are in urgent need of reform in order to deal properly with uncontrolled and dangerous dogs, and we can try to create a system to prevent our children from being hurt by dogs.”
The consultation, which was posted on the Government's website on Friday, reads as follows: “Uniform and effective enforcement of the law is key to addressing the problems associated with uncontrolled dogs in Scotland.
The review focused on measures that could be taken to help aid implementing agencies, such as local authorities, to use the power at their disposal to maintain community security.
Saudi Arabia, for the first time, granted tourist visas to abolish the Abaya robes.
Currently, Saudi visas are granted only to foreign employees, their families and Muslim pilgrims.
On Friday, Saudi Arabia stated that it would provide for the first time a tourist visa to open up the extremely conservative kingdom to holiday tourists in order to promote economic diversification and reduce dependence on oil.
Launching tourism is one of the core elements of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ' s Vision 2030 reform plan, which aims to prepare for the development of the largest Arab economy in the post-oil era.
Just two weeks ago, the United States Government accused Iran of a destructive attack on Saudi Arabia ' s oil infrastructure, which disrupted the global energy market and raised concerns about wider regional conflicts.
“Opening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for my country,” said the Director of Tourism, Ahmad Khatib, in a statement.
“Tourists will admire the treasure that we share — the five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the vibrant local culture and the amazing natural beauty.”
Bloomberg quoted Al-Khatib as saying that Saudi Arabia would open its application for an online tourist visa to citizens of 49 countries on Saturday.
Khatib stated that the Kingdom would also relax the strict dress code for foreign women, allowing them not to wear the blanketed Abaya robe, which is still a public dress that Saudi women must wear.
He added, however, that foreign women would be required to wear “peasant clothes”, without giving details.
In this desert kingdom, which has numerous Bedouin monuments and archaeological sites, visas are currently limited to foreign employees, their families and Muslim pilgrims travelling to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
It is a rare initiative that the Kingdom began last year to issue temporary visas to tourists to participate in sports and cultural activities in order to launch the tourism industry.
However, this serious Kingdom, which prohibits alcohol consumption and has strict social norms, is seen by many as an obstacle to tourism.
Prince Mohammed was trying to change the situation through a comprehensive liberalization campaign, which had brought new cinemas, mixed concerts and sporting events to Saudi Arabia.
According to observers, criticism by the international community of the Saudi human rights record, including the horrific murder of the commentator Jamal Kashuji and the repression of female activists last year, may be further detrimental to attracting foreign tourists.
Following the attack on the State-owned oil giant Amer Oil Company on 14 September, concerns about the regional conflict may also weaken the attractiveness of Saudis to holiday tourists.
In the face of low oil prices, the Government has expressed the hope that by 2030 tourism will have contributed 10 per cent to GDP, compared with only 3 per cent at present.
By 2030, Saudi Arabia is said to be aiming to attract as many as 100 million domestic and foreign tourists per year.
However, Saudi Arabia currently lacks the infrastructure to accommodate such a large number of tourists, and officials estimate that the country will need an additional 500,000 hotel rooms over the next decade.
The Government indicated that the tourism industry was expected to generate up to 1 million jobs in the tourism industry at a time of high youth unemployment.
Saudi Arabia had invested billions of dollars to build tourism from scratch.
In 2017, the Kingdom announced a multi-billion-dollar project to create luxury resorts in 50 islands and other original sites in the Red Sea.
Last year, the “recreational city” in Gidia began construction near Riyadh, which will include high-end thematic parks, motor sports facilities and a hunting area.
The country is also developing historical monuments, such as the centuries-old Madinshal, which is the site of the grave of sandstones inherited from the construction of the same civilization in the Jordanian city of Petra.
Facebook hides some "good" numbers in Australia's new tests
Facebook today indicates that it has already begun to hide the dynamic dots published in Australia, a test designed to relieve social pressure that could be replicated globally in the future.
Today, Australian Facebook users are unable to see the number of reactions and video views to the dynamics that others publish, but they are still able to see reactions to their dynamics.
"We don't want people to feel like Facebook is a game."
“This time we want to test how people are using the new version. We want to spend some time watching the new version of user feedback to see if it can be replicated,” the company says.
Facebook users worldwide exceed a billion, but the social media giant is also under pressure to prevent the platform ' s impact on users ' mental health.
According to the Australian Cybersecurity Commissioner, one in five children in the country reported having experienced cyber violence.
Before this decision was made, Facebook tested a hidden version of the punctuation on another important social media under its flag - the photo wall - in July.
The photo wall was tested in Canada and subsequently extended to Australia, Brazil and several other major user markets.
Facebook describes this test as “an early understanding of the situation through a small scale test”.
“Although a photo wall has been tested, Facebook and (photo wall) are different platforms, so we may have different test data,” the company says.
Social media giants have not confirmed how long the test will last.
“We would like to know if the elimination of a few praises would improve the user's experience and limit other positive interactions.” The Facebook Australian regional head, Mia Garrick, said.
Lorenzo stepped up to Hurricane 4 in the eastern Caribbean.
According to the National Hurricane Center of the United States, Hurricane Lorenzo was strengthened on Thursday to Class 4 and the waves generated by the hurricane could affect the Windward Islands and parts of South America.
At 11 p.m., hurricane eyes are located about 1660 miles south-west of the Azores. Eastern summer hours are updated. Storms move northwestwards at 14 miles per hour, with a maximum sustained wind speed of 145 miles per hour.
The storm is not expected to land in the next few days, but a shift to the north-east on Saturday may bring Lorenzo closer to the Azores next week. Weather forecasters predict that the storm will cool down to below level 3 on Monday.
The waves generated by the storm may cause life-threatening waves and currents in the Windward Islands and in the north-eastern part of South America.
Lorenzo was the second level 4 or higher storm in the Atlantic hurricane season. Dorian reached 5 in the vicinity of the Bahamas.
According to Philip Klausbach, a meteorologist at Colorado State University, the western hemisphere (including the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific basins) has produced 16 named storms since 21 August.
Philip Klausbach wrote on Twitter: “This was the first time that a named storm had been recorded in the Western Hemisphere between August 21st and September 21, breaking an old record of 15 named storms created between 1984 and 2002.
The presence of the Patriot missile system in Saudi Arabia following the Iranian attack on the oil facility
Following the routine inspection of the Patriot missile batteries at the Turkish military base in Gaziantep, Turkey, the United States soldiers argued.
On Thursday, the Pentagon announced that, as a result of the attack on Saudi oil facilities earlier this month, the United States plans to redeploy to Saudi Arabia a Patriot missile battery, a radar system and approximately 200 support personnel.
In a statement, the spokesman for the Pentagon, Jonathan Hoffmann, wrote that the Minister of Defence, Mark Esper, had “approved an increase in force to prepare deployment orders”. “Although no decision has yet been taken on the deployment of the additional troops, they will remain on high alert”.
The additional strength consisted of two Patriot artillery batteries and a terminal high-altitude area defence system, also known as the Sad ABM system.
The SAD ABM system is one of the most advanced missile systems in the world, capable of targeting incoming missiles and destroying them in the air. The SAD interceptor is launched by a launch vehicle, using kinetic energy to “crash down” the ballistic threat.
“It is important that these initiatives demonstrate our commitment to regional partners and to security and stability in the Middle East. Others have accused Iran of causing disaster in the region, but we hope that they will help to strengthen Saudi defence capabilities,” Hoffman wrote.
The United Nations world summit said that President Donald Trump had criticized Iran’s role in attacking Saudi oil facilities. On Tuesday, the United Nations General Assembly said that they should press Tehran to engage in diplomatic negotiations.
In a call to confront Iran, Trump said: “All nations have a responsibility to act. No responsible government should finance Iran's killing. As long as Iran does not stop its dangerous acts, the sanctions will not be lifted, but will only become more severe.”
On September 14, a strike at the world’s largest crude oil processing plant and oilfield forced Saudi Arabia to shut down half of its production operations. As a result, the price of crude oil rose sharply in the last few decades, again raising concerns about the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East.
The parachute jumper hit a big trailer on the California Highway and died.
This 28-year-old woman and seven other people jumped around 2 p.m. On Thursday, Ruben Jones, Public Information Officer, California Road Patrol, told CNN.
These people took off from Lodi's parachute centre. CNN contacted the agency to comment.
Jones said that the wind was heavy and that the woman hit a truck while the parachute team landed near Loti airport.
There was an interview with Lisa Reyes, who was driving on Highway 99 with her father and brother when the woman crashed.
She said to the television station, “The man struggled in the wind, but her body landed very, very fast”.
A perverted child rapist from the Central Coast was ordered to see the victim in court.
In May 2017, the man, dressed in a foliage camouflage suit, grabbed and dragged a 12-year-old girl from behind to a school on the central coast.
He then tied the girl to a tree and sexually assaulted her.
Shortly after his arrest, the police searched one of his residences and found a number of items related to the investigation of the case.
The man accepted seven charges relating to the attack, in addition to which he pleaded guilty to three other charges of enticement and sexual assault committed by the man against another 11-year-old girl between August 2016 and April 2017.
The 12-year-old victim was walking along a trail, and when she looked back, she saw him pop out of the bush with a big branch and a knife in her hand.
The man was wearing a leaf camouflage dress.
Although the girl repeatedly begged the man to stop, the man locked her neck with his hand and dragged her into the bush.
The man said to the girl, "Shh, don't scream. Don't scream, or I won't blame you for being rude."
With a knife in his right hand, he tied the girl ' s hands and feet with nylonza, then tied her to a tree, violating her for almost an hour. After he released the girl, the girl went to school crying.
The man arrived at the work place at approximately 9.30 a.m., before which he was unable to respond to several messages and calls from colleagues.
His clothes were covered with dirt, grass and leaves and the like, and he claimed to have been in a road rage accident, car racing with another driver, driving it into the bush and falling from the embankment.
The sentencing hearing for the man will continue on Tuesday.
California police didn't bring a federal charge after they shot a black man.
On Thursday, federal authorities refused to institute civil rights proceedings against the Sacramento police, who shot unarmed black men, and the shooting provoked protests and prompted changes in the state laws restricting the use of lethal force by law enforcement agencies.
According to the United States Federal Prosecutor's Office and the FBI, a federal review of the shooting of 22-year-old Stephen Clark in 2018 revealed that there was no “substantiated evidence” to prosecute two police officers, Terence Merkadante and Jared Rownett.
In March, the Attorney-General's Office of California refused to initiate criminal proceedings in California against two policemen after almost a year of investigation. Attorney-General Javier Bethella stated that the evidence showed that the two police officers had reason to believe that their lives were in danger because the man was approaching them and suspected to have a gun in his hand.
Also on Thursday, the Sacramento police issued a statement stating that their internal investigation did not reveal any violation of the rules or training requirements of the police.
“Notwithstanding the fact that there were no police violations of the rules of the police during this accident or during the process that led to it, we are determined to pursue a new strategy in order to avoid the recurrence of such tragedies.” Daniel Hahn, Chief of Police of Sacramento, said in a statement.
Clark's brother, Stefan Clark, published a development on Facebook on Thursday, saying that he was meeting with federal and local authorities. “These people (in terms of accountability) were completely negligent,” he wrote.
The authorities said that the police were convinced that Clark had a pistol in his hand as he approached the police, after he ran away from the police chase to his grandmother ' s backyard. On the same night, the police went after Kraka after having reported that someone had broken the glass of the car and a glass slide door in the home of an old neighbour.
When Clark approached the two policemen, the police shot him seven times.
Federal investigators examined relevant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, live video and audio recordings, police records, police reports and autopsy reports, to determine whether the police officers in question had deliberately used force beyond an objective and reasonable limit.
Last month, legislators added an amendment to the oldest United States law regulating the use of lethal force by the police, which will become the most stringent standard for the use of force in the United States once the entire police force is trained.
California’s old version of the standards makes it more difficult to prosecute police officers who shoot. It is based on the principle of “reasonable fear” that they can use lethal force if the prosecutor or examiner believes that the police have reason to fear for their own safety.
The new law, which has been in force since 1 January, requires the police to use lethal force only when “necessary” to respond to a lethal threat to the police or surrounding personnel.
Pope Francis warned about the use of artificial intelligence for the public good by technocrats.
Pope Francis warned the executives of technology companies, diplomats and financiers on Fridays that the creation of artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development competition increased the risk of social inequality, unless it included an ethical assessment of the public interest.
Francis spoke at a conference of government envoys, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists and ethicalists in the Vatican. A few scholars and Catholic bishops participated in the conference “Public Interest in the Digital Age.”
The three-day meeting was an up-to-date demonstration of the Vatican ' s desire to have a place in the debate about the prospects and dangers of artificial intelligence.
Debates included technological advances in war, increasing reliance on machines for future work, case studies of the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand and decisions taken by social media companies following the spread of Holocaust videos.
In his speech at the conference, Francis praised the potential of technological progress and pointed out that machines kept workers away from danger and single labour in the early stages of the industrial revolution. But Francis also warned that increasing reliance on robots for profit could deprive people of the dignity of their labour.
He cautioned: “If technological progress is the cause of growing inequality, then technology is not real progress.” If so-called technological progress becomes an enemy of the public good, then society as a whole will unfortunately degenerate into a barbarous age dominated by the most powerful laws.”
The organizers of the meeting expressed their desire to use the expertise of the participants to find suitable consultants for the Catholic Church on high-tech issues in the future.
On Friday, the House of Representatives held a vote to prevent the President of the United States, Donald Trump, from issuing a “State of Emergency Declaration”, which Trump would like to use to finance its proposed border wall.
By 236 votes to 174, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives adopted a resolution to put an end to the Trump operation and sent it to the President. 11 Republicans and one independent party expressed support for the resolution. As 11 Republicans joined the Democratic Party, the Senate voted in 54.
Trump may veto the resolution, which will be the sixth time that he has blocked congressional legislation in his capacity as President. In March, he has rejected a measure to end the state of emergency declaration.
Neither House of Parliament appears to have been able to achieve the two-thirds majority required to overturn the veto.
In February, Trump declared a state of emergency due to the failure to obtain from the Mexican Government and Congress the funds needed to build the southern border wall. The Trump government plans to allocate $3.6 billion from military construction funds to border projects.
Democrats accuse Trump of not only bypassing Congress’s “brief rights,” but also of using key defence funds to create unnecessary obstacles. A few Republicans in the House of Representatives and the Senate are also concerned that Trump’s statements will lead to “exceeding power” in the future.
Some of the senators who will be participating in the elections next year are under great political pressure to vote in the national state of emergency.
Google launched its 21st anniversary graffiti: a story you don't know.
Google celebrates its birthday today with graffiti. The graffiti is a 90s-style computer photo with Google search pages and a date stamp on September 27, 1998, surrounded by Google colours of paper chips. The search results show a smaller one on the page.
If you think it's the company's birthday, Google was born on September 4, 1998, but the company never celebrated its birthday on that day, at least not in the form of graffiti. Until 2005, Google celebrated it with graffiti on September 7th.
Initially, the search engine was referred to as the “cyber reptiles” and later renamed the “Google”.
"We named our system Google because it's a common spelling of Google (or 10100), which coincides with our goal of creating a large-scale search engine," Sergei Bryn and Lawrence Page published in 1998.
The company was founded thanks to the co-founder of the solar computer system, Andy Bertolsheim, who invested $100,000; in June 1999, the company raised $25 million from Redwood capital and Keiperhua. Google moved to the Mountain View Office the same year.
Starting with a web search engine, Google is an affiliate of a huge corporate group of letters holding shares. Today, Google operates in more than 100 languages worldwide, answering hundreds of billions of search queries every year.
Google wrote on the "Our Story" page: "The relentless search for better answers remains at the heart of everything we do." "Now, Google has more than 60,000 employees in 50 different countries, from pipelines, Andre to treasures, and, of course, Google search, and develop it.
Trump denied Iran's claim that oil prices fell after the United States proposed the lifting of sanctions.
On 10 January 2019, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani addressed a ceremony in Tehran.
Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, claimed on Friday that the United States’ proposal to lift all sanctions against Iran in exchange for negotiations had led to a fall in oil prices. President Donald Trump and the United States Department of State later denied these claims, causing oil prices to rebound from a low point.
The most recent price of the Middle-Current Oil Futures in Western Texas fell to US$ 55.91, or 0.9 per cent, before falling to US$ 54.79. Brent Oil Futures fell to US$ 61.89, or 1.4 per cent.
According to Reuters, Rouhani stated on his official website that “the German Chancellor, the British Prime Minister and the French President are all in New York, and they insist on convening this meeting. The United States has indicated that sanctions will be lifted.” “What sanctions will be lifted in the future are still to be discussed, but they (the United States) have made clear their intention to lift all sanctions.”
Trump subsequently responded to Iran, “Of course not!” He expressed his country's hope that he would lift the sanctions in order to hold a meeting.
According to Bloomberg News, the United States Department of State described the report as “unfounded” and added that the United States was determined to reduce the Iranian regime's oil exports to zero.
On September 14, a series of drones attacked Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities, forcing it to cut oil production by half, and Rouhani commented on it. The United States and some European countries, as well as Saudi Arabia, blamed Iran for the attack. Tehran denied that it had played any role in the incident.
The U.S. Department of State did not respond immediately to requests from U.S. consumer news and business channels for comments.
John Kirdaf of Renovating Capital said: “A long time may not have seen the easing of tensions between the US and Iraq, which would allow for the immediate return of large quantities of oil to the market”.
“This refers not only to Iran's production and export, but also to millions of barrels of oil in floating oil storage facilities and millions of barrels of oil that remain in Chinese ports awaiting customs processing,” said Kirdaf.
During the past year, Trump had ordered the United States to withdraw from the nuclear agreement signed by Iran, the United States and five other States, under which States had lifted sanctions against Iran in exchange for their commitment to cease nuclear projects.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has been the target of United States sanctions for decades, and Washington recently accused it of attacking a tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, which Tehran denies. Iran also shot down an American military drone and announced plans to execute 17 suspected American spies.
Enhanced security in Afghanistan in response to the presidential elections
Large-scale security operations were conducted throughout the country in preparation for the national presidential elections on Saturday.
The Government will arrange for approximately 100,000 security personnel to guard polling stations in response to the threat posed by the Taliban.
Fearing reprisals, many voters, especially in rural areas, would remain at home, while others said that the voting system was prepared for the powerful and not suitable for the poor.
Royal News: How Princess Beatriz is “Angering against hostile family members”
On Thursday, the Duke and Duchess of York announced that their eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, was engaged to her boyfriend, the 34-year-old property owner, Eduardo Mapelli Motz. As the ninth successor to the British throne, the princess will end next year with Mapelli Motz.
“We have many similar interests and values, and we know that this will be of great benefit to us in future years of love and happiness.”
Princess Beatrice's parents Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson also expressed their excitement.
Duchess York wrote on Twitter: "I know what my mother feels like, so I shed tears of joy. I am proud of this sensational news.
Andrew and I are the luckiest people, because we have two wonderful sons-in-law."
This royal wedding will be an opportunity for the entire royal family to gather together once again, in the hope that this will completely restore the relationship between Figi and the Duke of Edinburgh.
Since Sara became involved in one of the greatest scandals in the Crown's history, her relationship with other members has become extremely difficult.
In 1992, five months after the announcement of the break-up with Prince Andrew, a photograph of her and her “financial adviser” at the resort house in St. Tropic was made public.
In these photographs, images of John Bryan, a millionaire in Texas, kissing, sucking on the toes and bows of the Duchess, were reported to have been the strongest reaction by Prince Philip to the scandal of the Duchess' daughter-in-law.
However, it was reported that he was “shocking” at the behaviour of the Duchess Yorke, who had claimed that her mother had been the victim of “decent acts that made her feel unwelcome”.
Recent information: Close the door to Kate and William: Spoiling habits of couples exposed
It was reported that the Duchess' spokesperson was unable to comment on it, but a friend of Figi's said: “It is no secret that Sarah's daughters are very tired of the way members of the royal family treat their mothers.
“Some of the bills she received were quite mean.
“They have been blaming their father for allowing this to happen, and in particular Beatrice has been pleading with Prince Andrew not to treat their mother like a deportee.”
Last October, at the wedding of Princess Yugini and Jack Brooksbank, Philip and Sarah were filmed together for the first time in 26 years.
There's been a second wave of strikes in Oregon.
State University staff complain, most notably in terms of low wages and lack of dignity at work. The pay gap alone is striking. About half of these staff earn less than $40,000 a year (and hundreds of people earn less than $25,000 a year).
As another IT worker at Portland State University, Alejandro Segura, said: “I'm willing to take part in a strike because I think it's unfair that the wages paid to people do not guarantee their lives in the cities they serve.” Teresa Stackerberg, Portland State Library staff, said more directly.
As inflation increased, the cost of living in Oregon soared, and the staff members were in a difficult position, with little sympathy from management.2 Contract negotiations started in mid-August, when the bosses made a number of particularly excessive proposals — a slight increase in the cost of living, a rejection of the seniority requirements of long-term university staff, and an increase in the cost of staff meals —
He went on to say, "For decades, educators have been under attack. We've finally stood up and fought back. Business executives can even face class discrimination and the crushing of the middle class when they see their relatively cynical pay rising at a rate higher than inflation.
The staff at Oregon State University are not the only ones to take action. Oregon is now a hot and hot powder keg, and the fuses are burning. The workers at Fred Meyer's grocery store chain are running a campaign against employers, although not yet.
In the health-care sector, a strike (98% approval rate) will be approved if the local 49-member of the International Federation of Service Employees of the Kessa Medical Institution does not reach an agreement before the expiration of the existing contract in October (only temporarily avoided through a new interim agreement). In other areas of the industry, it represents Astoria.
Burly explained: “The labour movement in Oregon is very strong and indeed very thorough. This is part of a wave of labour growth across the country. Economic instability is seen, real wages are falling, and the solution is collective action in the workplace.”
The extent to which such collective action will take place this fall is not yet clear, but it would certainly be appropriate if the strike were to return to the northwest in 2019. We can only hope that the spirit of action will spread further to agriculture in the Midwest, manufacturing in the South, the Texas oil fields, and Appalachia.
Political Civilization: The new prize program was created to overcome Westminster differences and honour polite politicians.
The new award program was set up to honor polite politicians.
The resumed session of the Assembly ushered in a contentious week in Westminster.
During this controversial week, the threats faced by parliamentarians and statements such as that of Prime Minister Boris Johnson provoked outrage.
In response to the differences, the “political civilization” prize was unveiled last Friday, and the politicians were awarded an annual prize of Pound300 for charity.
Boris Johnson was criticized for the tone he used in the House of Commons.
Lord Stewart announced the award, saying, “We all agree that British politics is facing a crisis of trust and civilization.
“It is our firm belief that politics must respond, not to these trends, but to counter them, in the light of the ever-increasing controversy and growing divisions and suffering in the United Kingdom.
These awards are a small attempt by a group of publics to draw public attention to those who have different or no political affiliations, those who defend their reasons in a proper and polite manner, and those who are able to reach out to people and cooperate across differences that affect us all."
The nomination will be announced in cycle six, and the award ceremony will be held next March.
In an exclusive interview with the British Standards Evening newspaper today, former Cabinet Minister Amber Raad accused Johnson of using provocative words such as “de facto incitement to violence”.
Johnson, for his part, expressed his “regrets” for the threats directed against parliamentarians.
Jesse Phillips "stupid" after receiving death threats of "fear."
On Thursday, Labour Congressman Jesse Phillips, another critic of Johnson, said that a man had been arrested after trying to “kick off” the door of her constituency office and that the man was said to be a fascist.
Meanwhile, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Joe Svenson, spoke to the police after a young child had been threatened.
The senior Labour Congressman, Ivette Cooper’s daughter, Ellie Cooper, posted a fast-circulation post on Twitter about her fear for her mother after Cox’s murder. Ellie Cooper accused Johnson of “incitement to violence against parliamentarians.”
Lead by example? America's income gap is the highest in history.
Last year, the income gap between the rich and the poor in the United States was at its highest level since the United States Census Bureau began to count income in 1967. Washington and New York are among the regions with the largest income disparities.
The United States may be the richest country in the world, but the same is true of its status: the super-rich can continue to grow, however, and poor families often have to “finance me” to pay for their health care. Economic imbalances affect both wealth and income, and the latter are at the highest level in history.
One way to measure the income gap is the Gini coefficient. The Gini coefficient is the smallest 0, representing the absolute average, and the largest 1, representing a scenario in which a family has all the income in the country. For the past 50 years, the Census Bureau has been tracking this indicator. The Gini coefficient in the United States was 0.397 in 1967, but the Gini coefficient in the United States was 0.397.
There are other countries in the world where the income gap is more severe, including some of the more powerful economies. For example, the World Bank estimated the Gini coefficient for South Africa in 2014 at 0.63, while the Gini coefficient for Brazil in 2017 was 0.53.
New data show that the areas with the highest income differentials are often areas of wealth concentration, including Washington, D.C., New York and Connecticut, and, of course, some impoverished areas, such as Puerto Rico and the United States of America, Louisiana. In Utah, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota, and South.
Census Bureau data also show that the growth in median household income has stagnated, rising to over $62,000. This is the highest level measured by the United States community survey, but the increase between 2017 and 2018 was only 0.8 per cent, a significant decrease from the increase of the previous three years, if taken into account.
It is likely that the new statistics will lead to a campaign for Democratic candidates nominated within the presidential election party next year, which usually supports the collection of additional taxes on super-rich and large companies.
It also threatens to undermine the conceptual underpinnings of the corporate tax concessions implemented by the current administration, which were approved by Congress in 2017. The aim is to persuade transnational corporations to take manufacturing jobs back to the United States, while shifting income to middle-class and poor sectors.
A man from North Carolina was drawn five times in the same lottery.
A North Carolina man took five of the same lottery prizes, including the first prize of $163634.
Garan Lancaster of Pikerville told the North Carolina Education Lottery officer that, while he was staying at the Wiesam Brothers Company in Pikerville, he had bought five cash lottery tickets with his five sets of numbers, which he could draw five times on Monday night.
"My wife wrote my number when the prize was drawn," said Lancaster, "When my wife handed me the paper, and I checked the lottery, I couldn't believe it. One of the lines matches five numbers, the rest matches four numbers. I yelled, "I'm in."
One line in Lancaster matches the winning number in five, winning a prize of $163634 for him, and the other four numbers matching their winning numbers winning a bonus of $250 for him.
The winner indicated that he intended to use the money to pay his bills and to carry out some house repairs.
Tristan Thompson, Cole Kardashian's cheating ex-boyfriend, left another very provocative comment on her photo wall, after rumours that he wanted to get back together with Kardashian.
Tristan Thompson, Cole Kardashian's cheating ex-boyfriend, left another very provocative comment on her photo wall, following rumours that he wanted to get back together with Kardashian.
Earlier this year, this 35-year-old star abandoned the American National Basketball Association player completely because Thompson was accused of cheating with his family friend Jordan Woods.
Tristan was found to have left another passionate compliment on Koller's photo wall home page.
However, 28-year-old Tristan refused to give up easily - leaving an embarrassing euphemism on his ex-girlfriend's latest selfie.
In this vague picture, Koehler stood in front of the rising sun and wrote in her mother's image: “May you have the courage to explore every dream of your dreams”.
In a public comment, Tristan wrote, "The sun shines brightly on you."
The fans were irritated by this comment, and some answered, "Yes, the diamond you dropped."
When Kohler was nine months pregnant, Tristan betrayed her.
Another fan warned: "Get out of the photo wall."
The third person wrote, "Kolle, don't fall for it."
Just a few days ago, Tristan wrote, "Perfect," accompanied by a heart-shaped eye expression, underneath one of the other real-life pictures in Koller, a picture of her modeling for Gaels jeans.
According to The Sun, earlier this month, Tristan, at Drake's suggestion, spent £400,000 on buying a Porsche for Kohler and trying to get back together with Kohler.
Earlier this year, he was accused of cheating with a friend of the Kardashian family, Jodin Woods.
After his rap partners urged a “big move”, Tristan decided to choose this benevolent gift, which is said to be the Porsche 911.
In the end, his friends said that Tristan had won an invitation from Kohler and had been able to attend a “Taco” dinner at her house on Tuesday, which had brought him closer to being reunited with Kardashian and their 17-month-old daughter, Tru.
According to one source, “Tristan and Drake were good friends and, as he planned to recover Kardashian, he had been asking Drake for advice.
Tristan's infidelity broke Cole's heart.
"Drek told him that if he wanted to recover Kohler, he would have to do everything he could.
"Although it may sound unreasonable to trade a fancy supercar for a random dinner.
“But after Tristan did this, Kohler didn't immediately open a red carpet for him.”
This couple is the parents of 17 months old Tru.
In the new season reality show, Walking with the Kardashians series 16, Köller Kardashian cried out of tears because of his boyfriend Tristan Thompson's affair.
Last month, The Sun revealed that Tristan had vowed to invite Kohler to a romantic Greek trip: “I'll get my family back.”
Although Kohler was heartbroken by Tristan's constant derailment in their relationship, earlier this year he invited Tristan to their daughter Tru's first birthday party.
However, the star ' s family reality show, " Walking with the Kardashians " , later showed that the incident ended with Kölöl ' s bitter acceptance of Tristan ' s infidelity.
Children ' s hospital freezer malfunctioned, 56 children with cancer suffered from stem cell damage
A breakdown in the L.A. Children's Hospital freezer resulted in the destruction of the blood stem cells of 56 children, which were collected at the time of each patient's commencement of oncological treatment and stored for future use.
In a statement, the hospital states: “We apologize for causing pain or confusion among the patients and their families.
All patients have received basic treatment, with the exception of one patient. The Chief Medical Officer, James Stan, has stated that the patient does need to recover stem cells.
The letter sent to the patient’s family at the beginning of September informing them of the loss of stem cells was sent unexpectedly to the children, not to the parents.
The hospital states that the destruction of long-term stocks of stem cells does not endanger the health of any child. The hospital has also provided assistance to families who wish to collect them again.
One of the patients described it as “suffering.” 13-year-old Sean Anderson Corona was diagnosed with a 4-stage neurotemphoma (a cancer often found in the adrenal gland), and he was treated with stem cells. The boy kept the machine alive all day.
"I'll try to sleep, but my body will start shaking, and then I'll start to freak out and start crying," Corona told ABC-7.
In November of this year, Corona will have had no cancers for three years. But his mother, Elizabeth Anderson, said that she feared that if he had cancer, she might not be able to collect more stem cells from his blood.
Stan indicated that patients were recommended to recover stem cells only if the patient needed stem cells to repeat his or her condition.
He said, “We believe that this is almost impossible, and therefore we will not ask anyone to do so in advance”.
Refrigerators have been replaced and sensor monitoring and alarm systems have been upgraded.
“It is clear that this is a huge expense for us.” Stan said, “We will personally reach out to every family to ensure that all their questions are answered.”
Prince Harry's been passing through the Angolan minefield on foot.
This is the sixth day of his visit to Africa with his wife, son Megan, and Archie. But on Friday morning, Prince Harry returned to Angola alone with the intention of inheriting the legacy of his mother, Princess Diana.
Halo Trust provides a bright blue protective vest, successfully inherits the mother's legacy. Twenty-two years ago, Princess Diana left a trail on a similar road through an area of deadly mines in Angola that were left over from the civil war.
On January 15, 1997, Princess Diana of Wales, wearing protective vests and masks, visited a minefield cleared by Halo Trust charity in Huambo Province, Angola.
Diana has been trying to eliminate this weapon of war, but she has not been able to do so throughout her life, having passed away just a few months before the promulgation of the International Convention on the Prohibition of Landmines in December 1997.
Twenty years later, the world is still not free from the threat of landmines. Prince Harry detonated a newly detected mine, responding loudly and clearly to her mother ' s legacy.
Prince Harry said, “Mines are the wounds of war that are not healed. By clearing them, we can help local communities to achieve peace, which offers opportunities.”
Prince Harry detonated the latest mine detection in Angola.
Thomas Cook's pension trustee planned the spending rescue agreement.
The pension fund under the banner of Thomas Cook has begun negotiations with professional insurance companies on an agreement to save the retirement scheme benefits of this bankrupt tourist group.
The Sky News has learned that the Chairman of the Trusteeship Agency, Steve Steeter, is negotiating a buyout agreement with several companies that will exempt the majority of the 1.4,000 members of Thomas Cook's pension scheme from a significant reduction in pension payments.
Any transaction with an insurance company may involve a cut in expenditure, which is much smaller than the 10 per cent that was triggered by the transfer of the pension scheme to the pension protection fund lifeboat.
The discussion is still at a very preliminary stage -- even if successful -- and the agreement will not be reached until the pension protection fund evaluates the Thomas Cook program.
Thomas Cook's bosses are facing an investigation into the reasons for the collapse of the group.
The survey may last for two years, and if the Thomas Cook programme does introduce pension protection funds, future spending on approximately 10,000 pensioners will be reduced by 10 per cent.
According to the information received, several pension risk transfer experts, as well as at least one new "superfund" consolidation company, are negotiating an agreement with Thomas Cook's trustee.
Four days after the closure of the oldest British travel company, news of the trustee ' s efforts to ensure the welfare of its members triggered an international repatriation programme and led to the unemployment of thousands of people.
Thomas Cook's deep bankruptcy triggered a heated recrimination, and Board members, government ministers and auditors needed to explain their actions in the months prior to the group's bankruptcy.
According to the latest data, the four pension schemes of Thomas Cook are fully funded, with a £100 million surplus on the Pension Protection Fund.
In total, they hold assets worth about £1.5 billion.
However, as the Sky News revealed last month, the trustee asked Thomas Cook to propose more favourable terms for the rescue agreement, which complicated the conclusion of the transaction.
Thomas Cook's bankruptcy brought to an end his 178-year-old solvency transaction, prompting government bankruptcy services, accounting regulators and an influential Parliamentary Committee to initiate an investigation into Thomas Cook.
Ministers had set up a task force to deal with the crisis, which had led to meagre gains for creditors following the group ' s bankruptcy.
To date, less than half of Thomas Cook's overseas British clients have returned home.
Just hours before his bankruptcy, Thomas Cook sent a final plea to his lending institution to reduce its financing needs by £200 million.
What's wrong with Thomas Cook?
Negotiations ended on Sunday night, but no agreement was reached, and Thomas Cook was forced to seek over £10 billion in new financing, which was the last of its frenzy. Prior to that, the company had lost £1.5 billion for six months and the deal was deteriorating.
Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 by a 32-year-old furniture carpenter, a former Baptist missionary, to launch a one-day train trip from Lester to Ravburg, each of which required a shilling.
Since then, Thomas Cook has been one of the largest resorts in the world, three years ago, on its 175th anniversary.
A spokesperson for the Pension Protection Fund said, "Some bankruptcys, such as that of Thomas Cook, were the cause of the pension protection fund.
“We provide financial security for the future of the members of the fixed-income pension scheme, who should be assured that we will protect them.”
Thomas Cook, a spokesperson for the Pension Trustee, refused to comment on Friday.
Newly-born rhinos are rubbing their mother's nose and exploring their new home.
The baby, named Stella, was born early this month at the Cortswald Wildlife Park in Oxford County, the first female baby to be born in Monty and Ruby.
The cub is healthy and well cared for, as can be seen from the photographs, it is curious about its surroundings and sleeps on a straw bed with its mother.
In 2009, Mother Ruby and another female named Nancy joined the wildlife park, hoping to have the first small rhinoceros in the park with Monty.
In 2013, Nancy gave birth to the next female cub named Astrid, the third female cub born in 49 years of the park ' s construction.
Jamie Craig, head of the Kotswald Wildlife Park, said, “We have achieved great success in the cultivation of the existing rhinoceros.
“Stra is the sixth child of Nancy and Ruby, and our bull Monty has proved to be an excellent father.
“He is the perfect combination of a bull with power and a caring parent.
“It is particularly gratifying that Ruby has given birth to a cow calf — vital to the development of breeding programmes — and that Stella will eventually be transferred to another group in the hope that she will become a successful mother.”
Ruby had two male cubs before, Ian in 2015 and Allen in 2017. Alan stayed at the park, and Ian was at the Turin Zoo in Italy.
When Alan was only a week old, he weighed about 11 stones.
Surrounding births is considered extremely rare. Females only reproduce every two and a half to five years, so the window of opportunity for successful reproduction is limited.
According to the park, female rhinoceros usually have to pass 16 to 18 months of pregnancy before giving birth to a small rhinoceros.
It is considered to be one of the longest-pregnancy animals in terrestrial mammals, after only 22 months of elephants.
The first-born rhinoceros can stand up within an hour of birth. After birth, the little rhinoceros will try to suck, although in the first few days its feet may be a little shaky.
It will suck milk for about a year under the eyes of the mother.
They are very close, and little rhinoceros will stay with their mother for at least two years. Females will be very active in protecting their offspring, and if they are challenged, they will intimidate their opponents.
Alex Minasian, who was involuntarily alone, told the Toronto police that he was a member of the 4chan website.
The man on the scene allegedly killed 10 passers-by in Toronto and told the police that he was a member of an online sex-deficit men ' s organization.
Twenty-six-year-old Alex Minasian indicated that he was a member of the Forum of Involuntarily Singles on the 4chan website.
Following the attacks of 23 April 2018, he is now facing 10 murder charges and 16 attempted murder charges in Canada.
When asked about the deceased, he told the police: “I feel that I have fulfilled my mission”.
In the wake of the events, attention was drawn to the world of online isolation, anger and anorexia.
Minasian said that he had approached a killer in California who was angry at the woman who rejected him.
He was accused of driving a rented van into a crowd in a busy community in northern Toronto. Eight women and two men were killed in a crash, ranging from 22 to 94.
His trial started in February, but the press ban on him being questioned by the police was lifted today. The police interviewed him hours after the attack.
Minasian stated that he had never had a girlfriend and that he was a virgin, that he had admitted to using the van as a weapon and that he wanted to carry out more attacks.
He said: “A few other people I met online felt the same way,” but added that they were “too timid to take action to vent their anger”.
Minasian called himself “incel,” the acronym “involuntarily single person.” The involuntary solitude movement is a web-based subculture associated with the deadly attacks in Toronto and the attacks in California and Florida.
According to sociologists and other scholars who study this group, “involuntarily single persons” have gradually become popular words that provoke certain men who are angry at their rejection by women and tend to generate violent reprisals.
In online forums, interested people sometimes use the terms “Chad” and “Staci” as sham words to refer to men and women who are more sexually active, respectively.
Minasian stated that he had discussed his sexual misconduct on the 4chan website, which was notoriously the site for extremist voices.
The U.S. courtyard is worried about the shooting. The Clown audience is not allowed to dress up.
The biggest independent court line in the United States forbids viewers dressed up as popular clowns -- telling stories about the super-negative life of Batman. While cinemas have banned them from wearing masks or painting faces, security concerns remain.
Most American courtyard lines have banned viewers from wearing masks, painting faces or carrying toy weapons because of a major shooting in the city of Colorado Aurora when another Batman film, The Rise of Dark Knights, appeared in 2012.
However, on this occasion, the Museum announced that viewers dressed in disguise were not allowed to watch the restricted film " Joker " .
"I want the audience to be more relaxed when it comes to the movie," Ted Mondov, the director and CEO of the photo studio, told Hollywood reporters.
The company, based in Los Angeles, has 52 cinemas in 27 regions of the country and is the largest professional cinema line in the United States.
At the same time, the largest chain of cinemas in the United States, the American multi-challenged cinemas based in Kansas, reiterated that the cinemas prohibited “masks, paint faces or any object that shielded the face”, but welcomed viewers in costumes.
Most of the mask and the fake gun are banned for practical security reasons, but as Joker's appearance approaches, there are fears that it will trigger an imitation of the shooting. LAPD says that on the day of the premiere, the police will be “advanced” around the cinema, while the second-largest chain of courtyard kings in the United States.
The United States Army has even warned military personnel about “involuntarily single persons”, usually men who are displeased by the lack of access to dating opportunities and who worship clowns and may mimic his cruelty.
The Clown, led by Todd Phillips and led by Jackon Phoenix, was set to land on the entire American courtyard line on October 4th, and it was predicted that the film would recreate a ticket house record.
The Joker was well received after the premiere of the Venice Film Festival and won the highest prize, the Golden Lion Award. It's a psychological horror film adapted from a comic by the same name. Some critics are worried about the negative effects of the film, because the film sympathizes with the opposition, and the violent images are too much.
Midway Broadcasting announced today that the president of the company, Ms. Melodi Spaniard Cooper, will publish a much-awaited new book to help women entrepreneurs and executives develop their careers. The Guide to Success for Women's Friends shares many of her insights and ideas, including how women speak at the negotiating table to gain access to it.
In his book, Spaniard Cooper has consistently cited anecdotes to explain controversial topics, including the “#I too” campaign and the failure of President Hillary Clinton's campaign and its impact on the rise of women's empowerment in the United States.
In 2017, Spaniard Cooper gave a groundbreaking speech at the Chicago National Association of Businesswomen on the subject of self-propriation, the result of which was a book published by the author himself. The Guide to Successful Trades for Women's Friends is very well-spoken in language, and every woman's friend can read it.
Christy Hefner, a businessman and founder of Playboy, was the daughter of Hugh Hefner, who said, "The Guide to Success for Women's Friends is interesting and helpful. Melodie combines personal anecdotes, success stories, frustration lessons with practical experience.
As Chairman of Midway Broadcasting, in 1999 she bought the company’s holdings and successfully joined the United States elite women’s broadcasting company, Midway Broadcasting Corporation, a leading women’s family-style media company with multiple broadcasting and interactive platforms.
T. Sean Taylor, co-author of the book, is a journalist, writer and founder of the full range of service media consulting companies, Tre Top.
Romania spends billions of dollars on the Black Sea military base.
The Focus News Agency quoted the Times report that Romania will spend 2.5 billion euros to modernize the Black Sea military base to counter the growing Russian presence in the region. The local news site has documented that Mikhail Koglig, located about 200 kilometres east of Bucharest, is located.
The base has become the centre of NATO’s increased activity in the Black Sea, which has become a key area of tension between Russia and the West. Following Moscow’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin began to use its deep-sea base in Sevastopol to carry out naval missions in Syria to increase its naval presence in the Black Sea.
Romania and Bulgaria, located on the coast of the Black Sea and former allies of the Soviet Union, joined NATO and the European Union after the break-up of the Soviet Union. The Times reported that, in response to Russia’s actions, they called on NATO to strengthen its presence in the region. In February, 500 United States troops arrived at Romania’s airbase.
The “New Berlin Wall” is once again entangled in the Ukrainian scandal.
The growing fear that political opponents will block their re-election has cleared the way for Juliani to pressure the Ukrainian Attorney-General, Yuri Lutchenko, who was later dismissed, to investigate Joe Biden and his son for Tron.
But it is not clear how Poroshenko expects the Trump government to help him turn the tide before the two rounds of Ukrainian presidential elections in March and April of this year. In any case, he was hit hard and defeated by Zelenski, whose officers quickly became the Trump team.
Although the Democrats wanted President Trump to be impeached for his dealings with Ukraine, the President and his allies had responded with a home-made Ukrainian scandal. They reiterated a well-disclosed claim that Ukraine had collaborated with Clinton’s campaign team to reduce Trump’s 2016 campaign.
For many years, the Ukrainian people have been tired of watching their leaders use their power and privileges continuously for personal economic or political interests; today, most Ukrainians have not been content with the most serious scandal against the White House Trump Government since it was possible that President Richard Nixon was overthrown in 1974 by the Watergate incident.
Ukraine, which used to be the center stage of Washington with little American attention, has given rise to great confusion in Ukraine. It is a feeling of pride that, after centuries in the shadow of Russia, a powerful neighbour in the north, Ukraine is no longer regarded as dead, but as an incredible turning point in the fate of the most powerful nation in the world.
This week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavlo Kremkin, under the auspices of Poroshenko, sent a mean message on Twitter, saying that “as a country that led to the impeachment of the President of the United States” was in the history book “the prospect is not wonderful.” But he added: “Now, we all know what we can do.”
The brother of Red Khandel Baloch of Pakistan was sentenced to life imprisonment for honour killings.
Kándr Baloch, famous for his social media photos, was strangled in July 2016.
Pakistan's social media star, Kahndell Baloch's brother, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment last Friday, the country's most prominent “honour killings”.
Baloch became famous for her ridiculous self-programming, not according to Western criteria, but was found provocative in Pakistan, where she was strangled in July 2016, where she was extremely averse to feminism.
Her brother, Muhammad Wasim, was arrested. A few days later, at a press conference, he said that he did not regret what he had done and that he admitted that “of course” he had murdered his sister, whose behaviour was “unforgivable”.
His lawyer, Sadar Mehmud, told AFP that his client had been found guilty by the court in the eastern city of Murtan and sentenced to life imprisonment, a high-profile sentence.
He said: “If circumstances permit, he will be acquitted by the High Court.”
Earlier, the mother of Baloch, Anwar May, told AFP that she had hoped that her son would be acquitted.
"He's innocent. My daughter was killed and my son was murdered," she said.
The murder of Baloch became an international headline and renewed its call for action to combat the spread of so-called “honour killings”, in which a victim — usually a woman — was murdered for flouting patriarchal social norms.
Women have been burned, shot, stabbed and strangled for having freely chosen their husbands or — in the case of Baloch — for crimes such as glorification of their sex as a “stigma” to their families.
These murders are usually committed by close relatives. Under Pakistan’s Blood Bond and Revenge Act, they can seek the forgiveness of the victim’s relatives.
Three months after the murder of Baloch, Parliament passed new legislation providing for life imprisonment for honour killings.
Whether or not murder is defined as a crime of honour, however, is left to the discretion of the judge, which means that in theory a murderer may claim different motives but may still be pardoned.
In the Baloch case, her parents initially insisted that they would not pardon their sons.
However, it was sad to think of losing his son, and they changed their mind and said they wanted him to be forgiven.
The international community ' s revulsion with the murder prompted the Government of Pakistan to take unprecedented steps to declare the Government, along with its parents, the heirs of the victims, but this forced the case to proceed.
Some well-known behaviour in Baloch included strip dances for the Pakistani cricket team and the wearing of a falling red dress on Valentine ' s Day.
Her actions have attracted some criticism and threats, but many, including young people, believe that this Kim Kardashian figure can be seen as a bold political act that empowers women and creates a new situation for the State.
“honour” killings are rooted in tribal social norms, which are still prevalent throughout South Asia and specifically regulate female behaviour, although men may also be victims.
Three Scottish students were rated as the best in Europe.
Three students from Dundee University in the United Kingdom were selected as the best graduates in the European region.
In 2019, three students from Dundee University were selected as the best graduates in Europe in their respective fields, while five other students from the University were also recognized by the judges.
Scott Sheldrick graduated in molecular genetics and was awarded the best European graduate award in the life sciences; Chester Conford was awarded a Master of Science in Mental Health Care and an award in nursing, midwifery and full-time health care; and Lola Niebbs was awarded visual arts.
Although all three students were in the final round of the global round, they were defeated in the final heated battle, with 3,500 students from all over the world in the final round.
Professor Blair Grabb, Vice-Rector of Education at Dundee University, said: “In order to reach this stage, our students and graduates face competition with the world's top university students.
“The fact that thousands of students around the world are stimulating competition for undergraduate awards and that students from Dundee University are well represented among the winners also reflects the quality of our students and the level of education they receive here.
“Heavy congratulations to Scott, Chester and Lola on their remarkable achievements, as well as to the other students' representatives of Dundee, who have received high praise.”
Five other Dundee University students were also recognized in the world ' s top undergraduate awards, which recognized their top academic performance and shared the results with global audiences.
The five students who received recognition were Nicholas Gallagher and James Osborne (all life science students), Ferentz Kojikawa specific (medical profession), Caitlin Scott (analysic science) and Wako Yokota (philosophy).
The selection further praised the academic performance of the best undergraduates and helped to build bridges of collaboration between students and graduates worldwide.
The oldest cluster of pretzels. "The Queen's Palace."
An international team of astronomers, using Sparu, Cake and Gemini Telescopes, discovered 12 galaxies that existed some 13 billion years ago. This is the oldest cluster of planets found to date. The largest of these systems is the puking that was discovered 10 years ago through the Sbaru Telescope.
In the current universe, clusters of galaxies can contain hundreds of galaxies, but how these clusters are formed remains a major question in the astronomical field. To understand the formation of clusters of galaxies, astronomers look for possible origins in ancient universes.
The team of astronomers, led by the Japanese National Observatory of Astronomers, has been a big researcher at the Japan Academic Renewal Society, explaining: "The group of primary galaxies is a rare and uniquely dense system of galaxies that is very difficult to detect. To solve this problem, we used the wide viewing field of the Sbaru Telescope to map the sky.
On the map of the universe drawn by the Sbalux telescope, the team found a suspected interstellar galaxy, z66OD, 15 times the density of the normal galaxy of that time. The team then followed the light using the Cake Observatory and the North Twin Telescope.
Interestingly, one of the 12 galaxies in z66OD was found in 2009 through the Sbalux Telescope, which contained a lot of gas. The team members of the Japanese National Astronomy Observatory and the University of Tokyo found it.
Nancy Pelosi's daughter Christine Pelosi's new book star.
A new book on Nancy Palosi, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, is about to be published by Christine Palosi, who is well known to her daughter.
On Thursday, Tianma Books announced that Nancy Palosi Road will be released on November 26. Christine Palosi's work will tell how a mother of five children will be the first woman to head the House of Representatives and how she is currently a Democrat of the House of Representatives under the Trump administration.
Christine Palosi is currently a Democratic Strategic Analyst, and he is the author of the campaign training camp and the campaign training camp version 2.0. Palosi’s sister, Alexandra Pelosi, is a film maker and journalist who has been filming a lot of contemporary politics.
Warren's money for lemonade was donated to an anti-abortion charity.
When Senator Elizabeth Warren (Massachusse Democratic Party) bought drinks in August from two girls running the lemon soda stand, she might not have realized that the $10 she bought would be donated to an anti-abortion charity.
"Our daughters thought it was friendly," a Trump supporter, Dan Michel, the father of one of the girls, said to the Washington Lighthouse, "She came and told us that we should vote for her. Our daughter told us that she was a good person, but we didn't agree with her politically because she wanted to.
On August 8, Warren stopped in front of a lemonade stand on a campaign bus trip in Iowa with two 11-year-old children: Siena Michels and Audrey Billings.
"Come to Harlan, Iowa, and have a little drink in front of a lemonade stand. When life gives you lemon, a major structural change is required!" Warren posted on Twitter.
The two children were pleased to see a presidential candidate. When the photos were released, the girl, Michels, urged her parents to vote for the Massachusetts senator in 2020. However, the parents explained Warren's position on abortion. The girls and their parents decided to donate to the Life Education and Defence Foundation, which was not for profit.
Michelles said, “My daughter told us that she wanted us to vote for her.” “We talked about abortion, and that perhaps we should donate money to the anti-abortion business, and my daughter fully agrees.”
Why do we need to reclassify herpes and card viruses: the impact of biotechnology?
Recent studies have shown that the way people perceive the structure of the virus needs to be reoriented, as they are actually more diverse than they know before, and these findings may have a significant impact on their classification, on our understanding of how they form, evolve and infect their host, and on how they can be designed to respond to their vaccines.
In the 1950s and 1960s, scientists began to acquire high-resolution images of the virus, discovering the detailed structure of the virus's coat; the coat is a layer of protection consisting of multiple copies of the same protein, which protects the virus's genetic material. Most of the virus's casings are typical cascading spherical shapes.
The shell is the protective layer of the virus, and when scientists discover the structure of the shell, they suggest that the shell is of different sizes and carries different amounts of genomes, so that the virus can infect the host in different ways.
Why is that important?
In designing virus-specific drugs, scientists can now consider their different structural shapes to improve their efficacy.
Two researchers at the Institute of Information on Viruses, Anthony Luke, the theoretical biophysicist at the State University of Santiago, and Reton Devaloc, the mathematical biologist at York University in England, concluded that many viruses had been largely misclassified over 60 years, including common ones.
Although we have acquired structural images of cryogenic electron microscopes, researchers do not provide mathematical descriptions of different viral structures.
Luke said, "We found six new protein formations for the T-shirts. So many viruses don't just use two well-known structures. There are now at least eight ways to design their T-shirts."
Researchers use the generalization of the quasi-equivalency principle to observe how proteins encapsulate twenties.
The results of their research, which will be published in the Natural Newsletter magazine on Friday, September 27, also show that viruses belonging to the same structural spectra will use a consistent 20-face crust layout based on their composition, which provides a new approach to the evolution of the virus.
Biotechnology applications
Structural biologists can now use this information to reclassify the structure of the virus, which will help to reveal the molecular and evolutionary relationships between the different viruses.
It will also provide guidance for the design of new molecular containers for nanotechnologies and biotechnology applications, and will help scientists to identify specific strategies for protein assembly in clothing. This can provide a more systematic approach to developing antiviral vaccines.
Luke said, "We can use this discovery to target the formation and stability of the shell in order to prevent the virus from being infected with the host cell from forming a virus or disintegrating it after it is formed. This may help to identify and identify the antiviral target of the virus sharing the same XX layout."
This new framework accommodates previously isolated viruses, provides new predictions of the structure of the strains of the virus and establishes common geometric patterns in the long evolution of the virus from human to bacterial infection of all organisms.
Divalock mentioned that the new blueprint also provides “a new perspective on the evolution of the virus, showing a new way for a larger and more complex virus to evolve from a simple virus at the time scale of evolution”.
Building applications
Geometric graphics can also be used for new architectural design and construction.
Inspired by the geodetic dome designed by the famous architect Buckminster Fuller, structural biologists Donald Kaspar and the biophysicist Allon Krueger have introduced a geometry framework that has been applied to people since the 1960s according to the geometry of the virus's crust.
Luke explains, "This study will present a more general framework than the classic Caspar-Kruger structure. It will be based on the persistence of local peaks formed by proteins that interact within the shell. This approach will reveal six new t-shirt layouts, based on high hysteria and measurements.
The pastor for sexually assaulting a boy in Wisconsin was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
A former pastor accused of sexually assaulting a boy in Wisconsin decades ago was sentenced to 30 years ' imprisonment.
According to the Wazo Daily Herald, 72-year-old Thomas Eriksen was sentenced to a maximum term of imprisonment on Thursday and faced two charges of sexual assault against boys, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when he was a pastor in the Catholic Church of St. Peter. He had to be registered for life.
Four men testified in court on Thursday to complain about the impact of sexual abuse on their lives.
Eriksen apologized to the victim in court, stating that he was beginning to realize the impact of his actions on the victim. At least 11 men claimed that they had been violated while serving as pastors.
Eriksson was removed from his post in 1988.
Too much of this sauce could damage the liver.
Cinnamon is made from the insides of cinnamon trees and is a popular choreographer for all kinds of foods, and has even become a unique odour in itself.
Such spices have some impressive health benefits, such as reducing the risk of life-threatening diseases such as heart disease, cancer and even diabetes, and it is therefore inevitable that they be welcomed.
But let's not rush to the conclusion that too much is too much and too much is harmful to the body. In this case, if too much cinnamon is in the body, there are some side effects. We should make sure it's safe.
It can increase the risk of cancer -- although cinnamon can help reduce the risk of cancer, it can unfortunately cause cancer as much as it can. According to animal studies, excessive consumption of cinnamon is likely to increase the risk of cancer. Scientists say that cinnamon can destroy us in the long run.
May harm the liver - According to studies, over-ingestion of acupuncture can also cause liver toxicity and damage. This is based on several studies on effects on humans after over-ingestion of acreage.
It can cause oral ulcers -- over-ingestion of cinnamon can cause not only fatal conditions, but also oral ulcers. It is assumed that this is because cinnamon contains cinnamon, which is a compound that reacts to human allergies after extensive ingestion. But only cinnamon has been enthralized.
There may be breathing problems — more so because cinnamon is nuanced and easily inhaled, which can cause cough and vomit, and cinnamon stimuli the throat.
This can lead to low blood sugar — for many, cinnamon is good for the body because it reduces blood sugar significantly. This is very good, especially for those with high blood sugar. But over-ingestion can cause blood sugar to drop too low in the body, creating a new set of health risks.
The state of Tennessee's abortion waiting trial is pending before a judge.
In a 48-hour waiting period for abortion in Tennessee, a federal judge had to decide which expert to follow.
During the four-day trial, which ended on Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee tried to prove that the law requiring women to travel to the clinic at least 48 hours apart would give them time to reflect on the decision to have an abortion, which would be beneficial to them.
Both experts agree that some women seeking an abortion do not have the best idea, and some women who have had an abortion later regret their decision. But the experts disagree that this part of the population is smaller than the number of women seeking an abortion, and that the 48-hour waiting period does not have any impact on these women.
On Thursday, the state attorney presented the Utah study on the role of the 72-hour waiting period. The study found that 8% of the women who went to the clinic for the first time indicated that they no longer wanted to seek an abortion.
Antonia Biggs, a socio-psychologist at UCLA in San Francisco, was asked about the research and agreed that some women would change their minds about abortion or that they would not be sure at first. She pointed out, however, that the study did not prove that the mandatory waiting period in Utah had changed women's minds, nor did it find that it was otherwise directed at women.
Biggs also confirmed that, to date, there was no evidence that abortion could lead to mental health problems for women. She said that a national study comparing successful abortions before the deadline for abortion with those outside the clinic who had passed the deadline had found that there was no difference between the rates of depression and post-traumatic stress.
During the cross-examination, Biggs pointed out that the study did not track the mental health results of women who changed their minds after the waiting period, although only three such women were found in the study. She contradicted the testimony earlier this week of Priscila Coleman, a professor of psychology at Bolling Green State University, Ohio, who called abortion.
Coleman testified that she believed that most of the scientific literature relating to abortion had a political propensity to support abortion.
On Thursday, a Memphis gynaecologist testified in favour of the state and joined a highly controversial network that tried to block abortion. According to the British doctor, he was “physically exposed to a woman who changed her abortion's mind”.
Tennessee's waiting period law has been in force since mid-2015, and Pedraza says that since then he has witnessed a lot of women who have taken abortion pills and tried to stop them. There are also women who have changed their minds again and have finally finished the abortion, and he testified that even if there is a waiting period,
The head of the clinic has previously confirmed that waiting periods cause financial hardship and stress to women. The chief also stated that the requirement for two visits posed coordination challenges for both patients and clinics, which led to the postponement of abortion far beyond the 48 hours required by law, forcing some women to seek surgical abortions, which are at greater risk of complications. A small number of women were forced to wait.
According to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports the right to abortion, 14 states across the United States have enacted laws requiring women seeking abortion to travel to abortion clinics in two separate stages, of which Tennessee is one.
In deciding whether the waiting period in Tennessee violates the United States Constitution, District Judge Bernard Friedman has to determine whether it places an excessive burden on women seeking abortion. Some subjective criteria have led to the repeal of some waiting period laws, while others continue to be retained, depending on the state’s actual situation.
On Thursday, after the parties had submitted the evidence in their possession, Friedman said that he would rule as soon as possible.
There's a lot of problems. The fire at the French chemical plant was extinguished.
The stench continued to spread to large areas, and the French authorities and Normandy residents were cleaning up the remains of the chemical plant fire.
On Thursday, a lubricant plant in Rouen caught fire and no injuries were sustained, but residents on both sides of the nearby Seine expressed concern about the potential health risks and consequences.
The head of the local administration stated on Friday that, after nearly 24 hours of effort, the fire had been extinguished on Thursday night. The firefighter was still on the scene.
The French authorities warned that when the fire was extinguished, a particular odour would be emitted, which could spread to neighbouring areas.
The French Minister of the Interior, Christopher Castane, stated that people with health problems should stay at home until Friday night.
The cause of the fire is being investigated. The plant is listed as one of the highest-risk industrial sites in Europe.
Liquefied natural gas investments were recorded in 2019 and China recorded the highest growth.
Since the beginning of the year, investment in liquefied natural gas has reached an all-time high of $50 billion, as stated by the Director of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birrol, at a meeting of the industry.
“This year, investment in 2019 broke its record for the first time (final investment decision-making) of $50 billion,” Bill said at the Consumer Conference of Liquefied Natural Gas Producers in Tokyo, Reuters quoted Bill's comments.
As expected, investment growth is driven by rising energy demand in Asia; China is expected to surpass Japan as the world ' s largest importer of liquefied natural gas.
“The biggest increase comes from China. Over the next five years, one-third of global demand for liquefied natural gas will come from China alone.” Birore said. He added that, five years later, China will be the largest importer of the fuel.
And it is not surprising that the volume of investment has increased. Of this, the United States and Canada have completed most of their investments.
In a report released in December 2018, the United States Energy Information Agency (IEA) stated that the United States is expected to double its LNG export capacity to 8.9 billion cubic feet per day by the end of this year. This would also make the United States the third largest LNG exporter in the world after Qatar and Australia.
Canada currently has only one ongoing liquefied natural gas project - Canadian liquefied natural gas - but its final annual capacity is likely to reach 28 million tons. The project cost $31 billion, led by Shell, with a small number of equity participants including the Malaysian National Petroleum Company, China Oil, Mitsubishi and Korea Natural Gas.
At the same time, Qatar is stepping up its efforts to maintain its first position in the global LNG export competition. Qatar and Iran now share the world’s largest marine gas field, the northern gas field, and Qatar has lifted the mining ban on the new wells in the field, with the goal of increasing its annual export capacity by 43% to 1,100 per year.
The global demand for liquefied natural gas is projected to reach 550 million tons by 2030, according to the well-known global commercial information service provider.
Viola Davis recorded "Jimmy Kammore Live" as the true journey to play Michelle Obama.
Viola Davis is under some pressure to play Michelle Obama.
And this actor said on Thursday, "I'm scared," in Jimmy Campbell's Live Show.
Last month, it was announced that Davis would be playing the former First Lady in the selection series First Lady of Entertainment Time. Davis said the script was great, but she was keenly aware that it was not so easy to perform well.
She said to the moderator, Cammore, “I don't care what I've accomplished in my life. I've had one Emmy, one Oscar, two Tonys, but if I screw up this time, it'll be a decisive moment in my life”.
Davis said she was waiting for her PR to call and said, "Don't hang up, I'm Michelle Obama -- scolding you."
Davis also considered the audience in the sixth (final) season of Impunity.
She said, "Listen, I don't want those who look at me to go crazy."
The judge cares about the choice of drinking on the night of juvenile violence.
The judge sentenced a juvenile for violence against an enemy, while expressing concern that the juvenile had chosen to drink before the violence had been committed.
A 17-year-old man, Kieran Clifton, beat up a 17-year-old boy who, in his view, had caused him to break up with his ex-girlfriend.
The Oxford Royal Court was informed that Clifton had been drinking modifiers at the fat fox bar in Waterlington, Oxford County, shortly before the violence of March last year.
Judge Nigel Daley told Clifton, who confessed to causing physical bodily harm (abbreviated ABH), that alcohol played an “important role” in the violence that night.
But he talked about Clifton's choice of drinking: "Do you drink Coca-Cola and Italian almonds? I'm surprised you're not sick!"
Clifton, from Chargrove, was sentenced to 12 months in prison, 12 months in probation, 15 days in rehabilitation and 160 hours in “unpaid work” and £750 in compensation.
"It sounds weird, but it's really funny: in a warm world of books.
A pink blanket is full of spirits: Jane Austen's classic novel, a strange young man's love play, fantasy novel Six Crows. Jordan Higgy's version was made by her grandmother and appeared in most of her photos on the travel page of her wall account.
Higgy is a user of the Book, and the label on the wall of the photo, which is different in style and attracts the eye, records the love of the book and makes many fans ecstatic. The tag has been forwarded by more than 35 million photo wall posts, and the popular text.
According to the President of Colombia, the head of the national criminal group Los Pellosos was killed.
The Supreme Leader and founder of the criminal group Los Pellosos was killed in an operation led by the Colombian National Police, announced by President Ivan Duque on Friday.
The group was one of the most well-known criminal organizations in this Andean country and was involved in a battle that had threatened the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in the eastern part of the country bordering Venezuela.
Luis Antonio Quintro, alias Parkra, was a left-wing opposition leader, who commanded more than 440 gang members, as described by the Government.
Parkla, 49 years old, wanted by the police for terrorism and murder, was located in North Santander province on Thursday.
“Our goal is clear: to bring this organization down completely”, Duke said in a statement issued by the United States that he had travelled to the United States this week to participate in the United Nations General Assembly.
The statement added that Quintro was responsible for organizing the killing of several human rights activists and community leaders.
Duke has been criticized by some in the international community for his lack of action to prevent killings throughout the country with impunity.
Another leader of Los Perlosos was also arrested in the course of the operation, adding that the details of the death of Quintro were not mentioned.
"How dare you?" Tomberg's speech at the United Nations inspired Dutch climate change protesters.
On Friday, tens of thousands of young Dutch people took a strike to participate in the global climate change protest, blocking local traffic and asking their leaders “How dare you?” They quoted Greta Tomberg, a Swedish radical environmentalist, in her speech to the United Nations.
On September 27, 2019, in The Hague, the Netherlands, a protester, carrying an image of the Swedish radical environmentalist Greta Tomberi, called on the government to take action to address climate change.
The number of people who took part in the march in The Hague exceeded expectations, and organizers estimated the number of protesters to be around 35,000.
Tomberg, 16 years old, gave a passionate speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York this week. Millions of people from around the world joined the climate change protests on Friday to promote the United Nations Climate Action Summit.
“When people continue to join the protests, the strike will have a great impact, not only on today, but also on the future, and we can see the involvement of people from all walks of life.” The protester, Rendel Rustema, said.
Protesters marched through the heart of the city and shouted with flags and pictures of Bailey, with slogans saying, “For the beauty of Greta”, “Don't act like stupid antiques”, and “You die of old age, we die of climate change”.
“I understand their concerns, and I believe that people have heard their calls.” The Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutt, told the press at his weekly press conference that the protesters were marching not far from him. “We have come up with a number of costly plans to deal with these problems. But we need to be flexible so that we can also create jobs.”
The Climate Action Summit began with a short message from Tomberi, which was aimed at mobilizing Governments and enterprises to break the paralysis of the international community ' s action on carbon emissions, which reached record highs last year despite decades of constant warnings from scientists about the effects of climate change.
“This is all wrong. I should not sit here. I should go to school across the ocean, and you ask our young men for hope. How dare you?” She said that with passion and a twitching voice.
In the Netherlands, with 17 million inhabitants, renewable energy generated less than 7 per cent of its total energy in 2017, compared with 15 per cent in Germany and more than 50 per cent in Sweden.
The Government of the Netherlands committed itself to reducing CO2 emissions by half by 2030, but by 2017 it had achieved only 13 per cent reduction.
On Friday, Tonberg also participated in a climate protest in Grana, when the ICAO leadership was meeting in Montreal to discuss emission reduction targets in the air transport industry.
There has been a surge in suicides, and the situation facing the military is not promising.
This year, the rate of suicide among active military personnel has soared to an all-time high that the continuation of this situation has been fatal and, according to officials of the Pentagon, the situation is discouraging and is being actively addressed.
On Thursday, data released by the Pentagon show an upward trend in the suicide rate and the total number of suicides in the Army, Navy and Marine Corps, while only the rate in the Air Force is decreasing.
Earlier this month, the Navy reported that three crew members serving on the George H. W. Bush carrier had ended their lives in one week. This highlighted the difficulties in identifying potential service personnel and finding ways to prevent suicide.
When asked about the suicide of the aircraft carrier crew, the Minister of Defence, Mark Esper, said, “I hope I can tell you that we have found the answer to prevent future suicides in the armed forces, but we have not found the answer. We are in the midst of what some call the national youth suicide wave.”
The number of suicides in the U.S. military increased from 511 in 2017 to 541 in 2018. According to the Pentagon, the highest risk factor was among young recruits, and in at least 60% of cases they chose a gun as a form of suicide.
“Our numbers are not moving in the right direction.” She said that most military personnel were treated in the same way as civilians and added: “This is hardly reassuring”.
The military and defence leaders expressed their disappointment and resolved to take additional measures to improve the force ' s resilience, to train military personnel to respond more effectively to stress and to encourage force personnel to seek help when needed. Van Vinck said that the military was also considering enhancing the force ' s training in the safe storage of firearms and drugs. She said that there was no inter-departmental presence.
She and the Director of the Suicide Prevention Office, Karen Orves, stated that it was difficult to identify those serving in the service who might be in distress or who might have suicidal ideas, and that sometimes suicide was a sudden and impulsive decision with little warning. They said that it was difficult to find the reasons for suicide, because there were too many stress factors that caused suicide.
They also acknowledge that service personnel are reluctant to ask for help on their own initiative, because they fear that this will affect promotions or security checks. Military leaders say that they must all work harder to solve problems that are perceived as impediments to development.
The Commander of the Marine Corps, General David Berger, said: “In addition to physical health, gun training, training and education, the Marines must also be free to discuss life difficulties, mental health and suicide. We must build a community where we can make important decisions to seek help and help become marines and marines.”
This year, for the first time in the Pentagon, statistics on the suicide of a general’s spouse and family were taken into account. Van Vinck said that the latest figures were in 2017, but officials were working to improve their capacity to collect family-related data.
According to the data, 186 families were reported to have committed suicide, of which 123 were spouses and 63 were family members between the ages of 12 and 23.
The vast majority (approx. 70%) are female spouses under 40 years of age, while 70% of suicide-related family members are men. About half of suicide-related family members are 18 years of age, and for younger people, the majority are young people between 15 and 17 years of age.
Seth Meyers laughed in Donald Trump's "Tango and Cash" impression.
On Thursday, Seth Meyers, the host of the late-night show, brought a moment of relief to the week that had been so depressed by the mass shooting, and he made a little pass at Donald Trump, but he couldn't help laughing in the interrogatorium.
The comedian referred to Trump ' s visit to a hospital in El Paso, Texas, where the victims of the mass shootings that took place over the weekend were treated, while his campaign still owed the city more than $500,000 for a political rally in February.
The activity also resulted in a one-time late payment due to delays in payment.
Meyers said, "This is the consistent tone of Mr. President. I am surprised that his office desk was not flooded by the unreturned DVD."
He then began to mimic Trump in the 1989 popular film Tango and Cash, but he was quick to live with it.
When a bullet was found in a woman's skull, a man went to jail.
A man in Georgia, in the United States, was sentenced to 25 years ' imprisonment for shooting his girlfriend because his girlfriend realized that she had been shot in the head and survived when she went to the hospital to receive treatment for headaches.
According to press reports, the 39-year-old Jeranté Kane was sentenced on Thursday for the felony of possession of a gun in the attack on 42-year-old Nicole Gordon in 2017.
Gordon, suffering from severe headaches and memory loss, was examined last year by a doctor who found a bullet in her skull.
Gordon told the police that she did not remember being shot, but did remember the argument with Kane when her window broke and she passed out. She thought she had been hurt by broken glass and she was wrapped up at Kane ' s mother ' s home.
He's in Paris on Fashion Week, and he's on stage and he's showing off.
As Miss Gargae sang in her 2008 popular song Roman Death: "Go, go, fashion baby."
One editor said that a male model had kept those words in mind, that his T-table show had overshadowed other models, and that on Wednesday's Paris Fashion Week, he was the closing model for the John Galano Margira 2020 Spring Series.
This man's name is Leon Dam, 20 years old, conquered the audience with a unique T-cat. He stomped and stomped, and kept a strong face in his eyes.
He wears a shirt with a belt, a white pair of shorts, and a long knee boots, and he wears a student's hat. In a catwalking video, when he passes by Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of Fashion.
Many praised the young German model, who was famous for his unique fashion sense by participating in a show in the name of Gil Sand, Fay and the Korean Hard Man.
The actor and Bevelie's wife, Lisa Lina, described Leon as her "souls" while the fashion designer and singer, Rehana, followed him on the photo wall application.
Following the release of León's show, a fan wrote on Leon's page: “This video and the walk-out really came out of nowhere.” Another fan also said, “Big Aron,” while a make-up artist and big Humpty McGrall made up for his performance.
Perhaps the highest praise comes from Tim Branks, the contractual editor of fashion business reviews on the Fashion website.
“You are an unknown young man when you leave, but you are a hot star!” On Wednesday, Branks wrote in the title of the photo wall application, quoting the classic line in the film 42nd Street.
And he added, "@leondame let the cat go wild @maisonmargiela, I think, they're telling the truth. No one's "like Dam!"
There will be a geomagnetic storm in the middle of the month.
According to the Space Weather Forecast Centre of the National Atmospheric and Marine Research Institute of the United States, geomagnetic disturbances are expected to occur between September 27 and September 29. High-speed solar winds can lead to medium-sized geomagnetic storms (G2)
The Russian Solar Activity Research Laboratory at the Lebedev Institute predicts that the disturbance will start on the evening of September 27, and reach its highest level the next morning at noon. The planetary index can reach 5 Kp level.
Geomagnetic storms affect people with cardiovascular problems. Doctors warn that some people may have heart strangulation, headaches, and lack of concentration. Magnetic disturbances often affect people with mental disorders.
If there is more disturbance, the grid will fluctuate. Satellite signals that provide navigational information will also be weak.
The most beautiful sight of this phenomenon is the spectacular aurora in the sky above the poles.
Sony and Disney are working together again to launch the third film, Spider-Man.
Disney and Sony are now on their way, and Spider-Man is on his way back.
The two companies announced on Friday that they would cooperate in the production of the third film Spider-Man, featuring Tom Hollande.
According to a press release issued by both parties, the unnamed film will be released on July 16, 2021, and will be produced by the Mandarin Film Industry under the Disney flag and its Managing Director, Kevin Figg.
According to the press release, Amy Pascal will also produce films through the Pascal film industry, just as she did in the first two films she directed in Holland.
Fig said in a press release: "I'm very happy that Spider-Man's journey will continue in the universe of the Mandarin Films, and I'm very excited about it. Spider-Man is a powerful idol and hero, a story that goes around the world and is loved by audiences of all ages.
The agreement also allows Spider-Man to appear in a film about the future of the Mandarin Film industry.
Fig admitted that this cooperation had left the ability to fly above the wall unique among superheroes.
He said, "The Spider-Man happens to be the only hero with the power to cross the film universe, so as Sony continues to develop his own Spider-Man universe, we never know what surprise the future will bring.
More than a month after the end of Spider-Man ' s impasse, it was reported that the two companies were unable to reach agreement on the continuation of the previous film Heroes Return and Hero Expedition.
It is reported that the crux of the problem lies in the desire of Disney, who owns this role, to co-finance the shares with Sony in the future film, and the agreement reached before Disney, who started with Mickey Mouse, acquired Bangwee in 2009, and that Sony has film copyright.
Hollywood reporters say that there is a good reason for both sides to work together. Heroic Expedition is the highest ever film in Sony’s box office, while Mandarin can maximize commodities and maintain creative control.
Also pleased with the end of the impasse was Holland himself, who expressed his joy on the photo wall application.
European Union and British negotiators working in Belgium to reach a de-European agreement
The EU chief negotiator for trans-European affairs began negotiations with British officials in Belgium on Friday to reach a de-European agreement; there is about a month before the deadline for reaching the agreement.
Michelle Barnier met with British Minister Stephen Barclay in Brussels, who insisted that any agreement would exclude Ireland's “border protection measures”, which in effect ensured the soft border between post-United Kingdom Ireland and Northern Ireland, and had become a major obstacle to negotiations.
Buckley indicated that, while the United Kingdom was committed to reaching an agreement, he indicated that there was not much time left.
“I think there is still a long way to go, and I think it is now at the critical juncture of the negotiations”, said Buckley.
The deadline is 31 October, but a new law in the United Kingdom prohibits British Prime Minister Boris Johnson from completing it without a trade agreement, and does not allow the British Parliament to approve it before 19 October without a trade agreement.
Last week, EU negotiators expressed their willingness to accept an alternative to border protection measures, but the representative of Ireland, Simon Corvini, said last Friday that London had yet to submit a “serious” proposal.
He said: “Unless there is a serious proposal as a basis for negotiations, the current great differences will continue to exist”.
The negotiators also stated that “time is running out” and that “the British Prime Minister and his team have a responsibility” to come up with a serious proposal.
On Friday, the Johnson Office indicated that reaching an agreement remained “difficult”.
“From the Irish point of view, we certainly believe that the extension of DeOu is better than the non-agreement,” said Corvini, “but I think that the reasons behind the request for the extension are sufficient”.
The President of the European Union, Jean-Claude Juncker, said that he and Baniye were making every effort to reach an agreement, and if that was not possible, it was in the United Kingdom.
Prime Minister Valladka of Ireland said he was pessimistic about whether the Trans-European agreement could be reached, but he would urge British leaders to come up with a plan at the 17 October summit in Europe.
“The de-European agreement is in fact an international treaty”, according to Valladka, “it is not something that can be modified or amassed late in the night”.
Scientist's Confusion: Large planets orbit around tiny stars
Scientists were surprised to find that in a solar system of its type 30 light-years away from Earth, a giant woody planet orbited around tiny red dwarfs, completely destabilizing the existing theory of planet formation.
A picture of the gas giant GJ 3512b orbiting the Red Dwarf Star, published on 26 September 2019.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planets orbiting around them. But the size of the stars observed is not so different from that of the planet, as researchers say on Thursday.
The mass of this star, GJ 3512, is about 12% of the Sun, and the mass of the planet around it is almost half that of Jupiter (the largest planet in the solar system).
“Yes, this is surprising.” Juan Carlos Morales said that he was an astrophysicist at the Institute of Space Science in Catalonia, Spain, and that his team published the results of the study in the journal Science.
“This discovery is surprising because theoretical models suggest that low-quality stars usually have asteroids like Earth or small Neptune. But this time we found a gas giant like Jupiter orbiting around a very low-mass star.” Morales adds.
With telescopes from the Cara Alto Observatory in Spain, researchers found this agglomeration planet, composed mainly of gases. It orbits the main star in elliptical orbit for a period of 204 days.
The mass of red dwarfs is small and the surface temperature is low. Not only is the GJ 3512 much smaller than the sun, it's so small that it can even be compared to larger planets, the GJ 3512 is only 35% larger than Jupiter.
"Red dwarfs release less energy, so the light from radiation is very weak, and their surface temperature is very low, about 3,800 degrees below Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit 3,527 degrees Fahrenheit). This explains why red dwarfs are.
There is evidence that another planet is also orbiting around this red dwarf, and that there may be a planet that has been thrown out of this galaxy, which explains that the orbit of this log-like planet is elliptical, as Morales said.
Planets and their surrounding stars are born in an asteroid made up of interplanetary gases and dust. According to the most accepted model of planetary formation, the Core Absorption Model, the stars were originally formed in solid particles in the astrolabe, where the gravitational pull of the planetary embryos gathers around them.
Another relative model is known as the Gravity Instability Model, which may explain this unusual galaxy.
"In this case, the original planetary disks around young stars may be a little higher in quality and lower in temperature than expected," Morales notes. "This will destabilize the astrolabe, and there will be dense areas that will form clusters. These clusters can grow until they collapse and form planets."
School strikes around the world on the streets demanding climate action
On Friday, children from all over the world launched another wave of school strikes calling for action on climate change, the first major action since the issue became high on the agenda of the United Nations world leaders this week.
More than a year ago, the “Friday Campaign for the Future”, launched alone by the Swedish teenager Greta Sandberg, came to the attention of developing countries in Africa with millions of students walking to the streets of cities such as New York.
Some of the initial protests began in New Zealand, where, according to Sandberg, organizers estimated a total of 170,000 demonstrators throughout New Zealand. Cities in Italy, Finland, Nigeria, Austria and India also held demonstrations.
Friday's protest followed a week of climate negotiations at the United Nations in New York, including a speech by Sandberg, in which world leaders were severely reprimanded for their inaction.
“You stole my dreams and my childhood with your empty words”, she said on Tuesday, “The eyes of future generations look at you, and if your choice disappoints us, I can say that we will never forgive you”.
Citing a report endorsed by the United Nations last year, which called on Governments to take measures to prevent global temperatures from rising by more than 2.7 degrees, scientists warned that this would have terrible consequences for human life and the planet.
Sandberg and her inspired young people said that they would not stop the weekly class strike until they saw a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that contributed to climate change.
In Nigeria's capital, Abuja, Oladosu Adinek went on a Friday strike 46 consecutive times. The activist posted some pictures on Twitter in which students were wearing blue school uniforms, banners, "Climate change is happening" and "We don't have a lot of time."
According to local reports, in August in Lausanne, Switzerland, hundreds of climate strike organizers gathered to prepare for this week ' s event, and thousands marched in the city.
Thousands more are expected to go to the streets of Helsinki, Finland, where the local media reported that schools in Helsinki would allow students to participate.
Samberg has remained in North America since his visit to the United Nations and plans to participate in a climate strike in Montreal, Canada.
Serena Williams was fined $10,000 for sabotage of Wimbledon tennis court.
Tennis legend, the seven Winbledon tennis championship champion, Serena Williams, was fined $10,000 for allegedly damaging the London practice with a bat.
According to Associated Press and CNN, the All-English Club, hosted by Wennet, issued a ticket to Williams for damage allegedly caused by Williams during an outdoor exercise competition on 30 June.
The 37-year-old tennis star was interviewed by a journalist after winning a quarter-final match with Alison Reese on Tuesday and seemed to laugh at the fine.
When asked about the fine, she said, "To be honest, I didn't mean to destroy the field. I just threw the bat. Then I got fine."
Williams says she doesn't know how this could cause damage to the stadium.
She said to the reporter, "I mean, I'd appreciate it if you could tell me how I caused the damage. I've always been a man of vengeance. Maybe I'm strong, but I don't know."
Williams is on the run for the eighth temperate title, and she's going to be the twenty-fourth-largest. In the single-and-a-half finals on Thursday, she's going to fight against Czech contestant Barbara Strykova.
Last year, a judge at the U.S. Tennis Open Competition accused Williams of having illegally communicated with the coach during the game, and Williams defended it and was fined US$ 17,000 as a result.
In that incident, the judge issued three irregularities to Williams: the first was that she received unlawful instructions, the second was that she interrupted the bat because of emotional frustration, and the third was that she called the other party a “thief” in her confrontation with the judge.
Many Williams fans claimed that the judge ' s response was too harsh for her, especially given the circumstances in which male players were excited throughout the history of sport.
"Do you know how many men do much worse than that?" Williams told the American public race officials who entered the field during the game after she confronted the referee.
Williams was not the only person who had been fined in the Wennet Open Competition this year, but she had the highest amount of fine.
The Italian contestant Fánini, after losing on Saturday to the American contestant Tannis Sandgren's third round, said, “The bomb should be detonated on the tennis court”, and was fined US$ 3000.
The Australian contestant Nick Kirgisos was fined two times for violating sports ethics, one of which was fined US$ 3,000 and the other US$ 5,000.
The Ho Man band suspended last night's concert: the Friday and Sunday shows were canceled.
The rock legend, Ho Man, is on tour in America. Roger Daltray, Houston, Texas, was forced to cancel the concert halfway through it. The 75-year-old singer said to the disappointed audience, "I think it's best to do it."
After playing the 1982 classic song, The Front of Excellence, Dartley withdrew. He had voice problems, apparently following the advice of his surgeons.
The British star told the audience that he couldn't finish the show: "If I continued to perform, I'd be hurt. I think it'd be better to take it." Last time I was in the hospital for a month, I didn't want to go. I'm sorry."
Peter Townsend explained to the audience: "It looks like he can't continue, I'm afraid..."
The band left the stage and was going to try to finish the rest of the show without Roger.
And when he came back, Townsend said, "I'm really, really sorry. Roger's lost his voice now.
"It's obvious that before the show, he saw a doctor, you know, he sang very well in the tour. I don't know what happened. He's been doing everything he could.
"I'm really sorry you couldn't watch the show tonight and we need one. It's Roger's performance and he's in bad shape."
The audience fully supported him, cheering for his 74-year-old, explaining what had happened and how the band wanted to return in order to fulfil their commitment to the show.
And Townsend said, "We'll announce the date of our return as soon as possible. Let me explain... we'll rehearse one day and take a day off. That's because Roger's surgeon insisted he'd take a day off.
“I swear to you, we'll be back, and we won't let you buy the ticket down. I love you and I'm sorry to disappoint you.”
The Friday and Sunday evening concerts to be held in Dallas and Denver were cancelled at the end of the performance.
Their next show will be held in San Francisco on October 9th. The band will start their British tour in Manchester on March 16th, 2020.
Michael Schumacher's broker issued a statement about his state of health.
The official statement on Michael Schumacher’s health has been published. According to the Gong.bg website, the legend has been recovering for almost six years since he was injured in the 2013 Alps skiing accident.
A few weeks ago, the global media reported that the former pilot had been admitted to a hospital in Paris. Sabin Kom, a long-time broker of the Shumah family and an old friend of the Shumah family, made a statement.
Com said, “Michael's health is not a public issue, so we will not comment on it simply because we need to protect Michael's privacy as much as possible. We know it's hard for some people to understand, but we're doing it exactly as Michael wanted and thank you very much for understanding.”
She also revealed that Schumacher was a very sensitive person. He did not want his name to appear in the headlines, even before the incident.
The broker called on everyone not to believe any of the “spills” on social networks and in yellow magazines around the world.
Authorities investigated a fatal car accident in Los Angeles National Forest and found the body.
On Thursday afternoon, the police were investigating a fatal car accident in the Los Angeles National Forest.
According to the police, a car with a body was found below the Los Angeles Forest Road and Grand Tuhunga Gorge Road.
Preliminary reports from the scene suggest that the vehicle may have been there for some time.
It is not clear how the vehicles were found.
Is the nuclear-free world beyond reach?
Seventy-four years ago, two nuclear bombs exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing hundreds of thousands of people.
Since then, the threat of nuclear war will follow as long as there is conflict between the major Powers.
While various treaties are trying to contain this threat, there are about 14,000 nuclear weapons in the world today.
Thursday is the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, but the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons seems increasingly difficult to achieve.
So, do States have the political will to abolish nuclear weapons?
Megan's "go with his heart" and insists on not giving up his own pursuit while performing royal duties.
As a member of the royal family, Megan Marker, who decided to “go with her heart” and insisted on carrying out her royal duties without “abandoning” her own aspirations, wishes to be a model for young girls and boys.
It is reported that 38-year-old Duchess Sussex made the same statement earlier this week during a visit to South Africa with her husband, Prince Harry, in a campaign to motivate women entrepreneurs at the Woodstock Exchange in Cape Town.
The Woodstock Exchange, a British-South African technology centre, promotes skills development and market access by helping entrepreneurs, especially women, to acquire skills, resources and support.
At the meeting of the Association of Women Entrepreneurs, the 38-year-old former actress met with a number of women entrepreneurs in the fields of technology, environmental protection and fashion and praised them for “energizing the creative thinking of the next generation”.
In its dialogue with women science and technology founders, Megan strongly advocated for the empowerment of young women and girls, and expressed the hope that young men would also be empowered.
South African engineers, social entrepreneurs, co-founders of engineering women, and mothers of two children, Nadia Moussaji, revealed: “We recognize the importance of not only educating girls, but also being role models for boys, we are influential women, we are role models for boys,” as reported in The People.
“We both have sons, and we must remember that we are role models not only for girls, but also for boys, not only for our sons, but also for the general public.”
She added that we did not feel “any sense of hierarchy” for Megan's presence, because it was “a gathering of women to talk about the difficulties we face and the mission we need to accomplish in order to move forward, grow and change our society”.
The founder of the skills-training company, Simodis Mordisa, said that, although Megan was a member of the royal family, she was determined not to give up her deep-seated pursuit.
“She spoke of her responsibilities as a mother and Duchess and the fulfilment of her inner desire, not because she was the Duchess, who gave up the pursuit”, Mordisai recalled.
"You must be faithful to yourself."
She said that the Duchess had urged them to continue ploughing their new ideas and to indicate how they would continue to move forward and make it clear that they were doing so in order to set an example for others.
Mordis added that she did not mean being a member of the royal family, but when faced with challenges in everyday life, and admitted that she felt a little “fearing” about Megan.
“She spreads grace and accepts this task in such an elegant manner,” said Mordis.
“As founders, many of us have made impressive achievements, but meeting with a royal member is somewhat daunting. She's easy. She's an accompanied royal member.”
Megan also revealed that she enjoyed the pressure of being a working mother and admitted that she found it “heavy” but “very exciting” to be a royal member and Archie, who took care of her children.
Megan said to Laura Rosemarin, CEO of Cape Innovation, and the mother of two children, "Now I'm a mother for only five months. As a working mother traveling with a child, my God, how much trouble is it, but it's all so exciting.
"Sometimes you're dealing with some hard-working things, but when you meet people who can positively influence them, you say, "Aha," it's all worth it."
Megan then went to the Mothers of the City Agency, which trains and hires women living with HIV.
She brought some of Archie's baby clothes, including a dress with “the future” and a baby's uniform with the word “invincible”, which he no longer fits, as well as items donated by her mother's friends.
A couple of parents were sentenced to six years in prison for loading five-month-old babies in suitcases and throwing them in garbage cans.
The body of a five-and-a-half-month-old baby was thrown into a garbage can and, on Thursday, his parents did not contest the death of the baby and were sentenced to six years ' imprisonment.
The Los Angeles County District Attorney announced that neither Adam Manson, 34 years old, nor Karena Williams, 32 years old, had contested a felony charge of child abuse resulting in the death of their son, and confessed to a special charge alleging that they had caused the death of their son, Jackson Manson.
Both Manson and Williams initially pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The prosecutor stated that the two men had found their son dead on the eve of the New Year, when they were using drugs in a motel in southern Los Angeles. The prosecutor added that they had placed the child’s body in a suitcase and then threw it in a garbage can near Crenshaw Square in Baldwin.
Later in the month, after several weeks of searching of the Corona El Soblante landfill, the authorities cancelled the search. The body of the child was never found.
In a statement at the time, the police stated that they had decided, with a “heavy heart”, to close the search on Jackson, but stated that because they were unable to locate exactly at the landfill, “there was no longer any reasonable reason to continue the search”.
The supply of unagreementd drugs in England is still unclear.
According to the British government regulators, if there is “no agreement”, the Government still needs to do “substantial” work to ensure an adequate supply of medicines in the country.
According to a report released on Friday by the UK National Audit Office, the Government’s extra leased trans-English freight capacity may not be in place until the end of November (one month after the October 31 deadline). There are about 12,300 medicines authorized to register in the UK.
According to the “reasonable worst” scenario forecast by the British government, the volume of medicines may be reduced by half on the first day of the unarranged journey, and may take one year to recover. Time is said to be “extremely urgent” if the transportation problem is to be resolved by the end of October.
The report also noted that drug stocks were “incomprehensive” but were growing on a daily basis. As of 20 September, suppliers reported that 72 per cent of medicines were in stock for six weeks.
“In the absence of an agreement, the British (health) sector would work under highly uncertain conditions, and it would be very difficult to fully implement the planned programmes.” Government regulators wrote.
The Chairman of the Board of Auditors' Oversight and Audit Office, Meg Cyril, expressed “deep concern” about the content of the report, saying that she had seen the British Government “many times” miss the deadline, but that was particularly worrying this time.
“If the Government screws up this time, it could have serious consequences”, she said.
Dr. Richard Tobette, of the British Pharmaceutical Industry Association, stated that although enterprises were preparing for Europe, “some things were beyond the control of the enterprise”.
He said that if there was to be no agreement in the United Kingdom, businesses needed to know more about it and how to take advantage of the additional shipping capacity prepared by the Government.
In his view, “the best way to protect patients remains to ensure that an agreement is reached”.
Cleveland police are labelled "failure" in every way.
The Cleveland police, entangled in the scandal, has become the first police force to be labelled “failure” by inspectors in all respects.
Her Majesty ' s Police, Fire and Rescue Services Inspectorate, which conducted an assessment of its overall and three key areas of work, reviewed its capacity to reduce crime, ensure the safety and efficiency of the people and treat the public and employees.
The results of the survey indicated that special measures should in fact be applied to the force and that the Chief of Police, the Police and the Crime Commissioner were interviewed by the National Commission and asked to ensure that “significant improvements” were implemented.
If there is no improvement, the Home Secretary can intervene to resolve the issue.
A series of scandals have plagued the team, including Harterpur, Redkar and Cleveland, Stockton and Middlesburg in the north-east of the United Kingdom.
Over the years, six police chiefs have been replaced.
In 2012, the former Chief of Police, Sean Price, was dismissed for serious misconduct; after the phone calls of journalists were illegally tapped, 7 police officers were under investigation and there were persistent complaints of racial discrimination in the team.
Recently, the Inspector-General of Police stated that police work in an “imaginable inefficiency” and that police must share laptop computers and cameras with them.
According to British police inspector Phil Gomler, this is a “failure force”, which has become increasingly “serious” over the past two years.
According to Mayor Ben Huchen of Tis Valley, the report “is the worst police force in the country's history” and “finally officially confirmed” that the police force is “problem” and that the Ministry of the Interior now needs to intervene.
He added: “There is no dispute. This is the fact described in black and white in the present report.
“These results are part of the most painful and shocking part of what I have read.”
Cleveland is one of the 15 units recently inspected by HMCFRS inspectors and the only one that is not qualified in all fields.
Gomle added: “The Force did not give due priority to crime prevention. The lack of strategic direction and the insufficient resources allocated by the Force to the defence ... failed to provide adequate protection to vulnerable groups such as children. The opportunity to protect and put them at risk was lost.”
He said that senior leaders had not consistently demonstrated “ethical behaviour” and that “the level of misconduct by senior leaders in Cleveland was very serious and was affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the force”.
He added: “The force has not always been fair and respectful of staff, nor has it been effective in communicating with or understanding staff; the process has been perceived to be unfair and the understanding of staff is inadequate to support them”.
Despite the seriousness of the findings, the Force has indeed received some praise in dealing with serious and organized crime, but the way in which crimes are investigated must be improved.
The Police and Crime Commissioner, Barry Copinger, said: “I am very concerned about the worrying part of this report.
“The recent performance of this force has been too poor.”
He said that he had been assured by the current sheriff, Richard Lewis, that he would take “prompt action” as soon as he became aware of those failures.
The British Department of the Interior has ordered Cobinger to respond to the report within 56 days.
Lewis said that the report “set a line for this force” and added: “I have made improvements, and I am fully responsible for these obvious changes. During my five months in office, I met with outstanding police and staff at all levels, and I saw the efforts and determination of frontline police officers working to protect their lives.
Without significant improvements at a sufficiently rapid pace, the Government may step in, as in the case of collapsed prisons.
So far, however, politicians have never asked the police force to enforce this measure, according to the inspectors.
The Minister of Crime, Security and Fire Prevention, Kit Martehous, said that he encouraged the sheriff “to act quickly to address these failures and will closely monitor the position”, adding: “Transparency and accountability are key to building public trust in the police.
Manelli Christian School: Many sixth-grade boys in Virginia are accused of being trapped in black girls and cutting their hair off by force.
A black secondary school student in Virginia accused three white boys of being stuck with her and cutting off her braids. The incident took place at the Christian School in El Manelli, where Karen Pens, the wife of Vice President Mike Burns, was teaching.
Amar Allen, a 12-year-old student at the 12-year-old private Christian school, said that the boys caught her on the playground during the break, saying that her braids were ugly and curly and then cut off her braids.
Amari told WUSA-TV under the CBS flag with tears, “They laughed at me and scolded me. They said I was ‘Ugly’, ‘I shouldn't have been born’. They said I was ‘wanting to get someone else’.”
According to WUSA, one of the boys allegedly held Amari ' s mouth over her, another grabbed her hands behind her and another cut her braids with scissors.
Amari didn't tell her family about it until her grandmother found out her hair was shorter.
"They were laughing and running away, and I was just sitting there," Amari said.
The incident occurred on Monday, but the child said that she had not told her family until Wednesday because her grandmother had noticed that her hair had changed. She said that she was afraid of reprisals after she had told the truth.
Mary's grandmother Cynthia Allen said, "It's heartbreaking. I want the school to fire the students. I want the school to act."
The family spent almost $12,000 a year on Amari's school, and Karen Pens became famous at this famous anti-homosexual school at the beginning of this year.
In a statement from the Christian School of Manelli, “We attach great importance to the mental and physical health of our students and apply a zero-tolerance policy on any form of bullying or violence. We are deeply disturbed by these allegations, and we are currently communicating with the families of the victims, collecting information and providing support as much as we can. We have also contacted law enforcement and requested them to investigate thoroughly and provide more information.
Although the school had adopted a zero-tolerance policy on bullying, Amari said that the boys had tortured her before. She said that the boys had taken her lunch before, and had yelled at her.
The family of Amari met with school officials on Thursday and the investigation continued.
Iran released the British tanker Stana Anplio.
Iran released a British-flagged tanker last Friday, two months after Iran seized it on suspicion of entering Iranian waters in violation of international law.
According to the Iranian National News Agency, the Iranian Ports and Maritime Administration confirmed that the tanker, Stana Anprio, had left Abbas port at 9 a.m.
Eric Hannell, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Swedish Oil Transport Company (the operator of the vessel), also confirmed that the vessel had been released.
Eric Hannell wrote on Twitter: “Swedish Oil Transport Company and the British Northern Sea Authority confirm that Steiner Anplio and his crew have been released”.
On 19 July, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards detained the vessel for entering Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz on suspicion of violating international maritime law.
However, the arrest of the ship is widely regarded as Iranian retaliation against the British army, which captured a tanker in the waters of Gibraltar suspected of transporting Persian oil to Syria in violation of international sanctions. The ship was released in mid-August, despite all the efforts of the Trump government to prolong the detention.
According to the New York Times, Steiner Anprio was officially authorized to leave on Monday, but remained at the port until the investigation into the vessel ' s conduct was completed.
“The tanker has left the port of Abbas and is on its way to Dubai for a medical check-up and debriefing of the crew”, said Al-Khanair, “the families of the crew have been informed and the company is currently arranging for the early repatriation of its important crew”.
The oil tanker was the victim of an escalation of tension in the vicinity of the Persian Gulf, where the United States and Iran shot down each other ' s drones and destroyed at least two tankers, and the Trump Government accused Iran of being responsible.
The Trump Government recently accused the Iranian drones of attacking oil installations in Saudi Arabia, and Tehran denied any involvement.
On Twitter, Prime Minister Modi paid tribute to Jacques Chirac as a true global politician, a friend of India.
Prime Minister Modi of India paid tribute to the passing away of former French President Jacques Chirac and to a true global politician and friend.
Jacques Chirac, who had expressed support for India following its nuclear tests in 1998, died on Thursday and was 86 years old. From 1995 to 2007, he was President of France.
“I deeply mourn the death of Jacques Chirac. India mourns the death of a truly global politician. Indian Prime Minister Modi on Twitter said that, as a friend of India, he played a decisive role in building and building a strategic Indian-French partnership.
A strategic partnership was established between India and France during the first visit to India in January 1998 by Jacques Chirac, who again visited the country in 2006 in his capacity as President.
Jacques Chirac is said to have been in poor health for a long time.
Uganda: Government roll-out of the HIV oral test reagent box
The Ministry of Health in Uganda has introduced an HIV self-testing reagent box aimed at ensuring that citizens, especially male citizens, can be tested for HIV.
The aim of the plan is to reduce the number of new infections in 2020.
Orasure Technology produces OraQuick HIV self-testing reagent boxes designed specifically for vulnerable groups such as young people between 18 and 24 years of age, adult males and sex workers.
“18 to 24-year-olds are our current target group. Young people in this age group are our focus. Of course, any person over 18 years of age should be taken into account. We have no evidence of a minor's illness under the Constitution, but as more and more evidence emerges, we will move towards that goal. For men, we will.
Accessibility
The previously provided self-test kits need to be tested for HIV through blood, but the HIV self-test kits can be tested through oral fluids.
The reagent box is made by detecting antibodies (natural guards of the human body who resist infection). If the human body is infected with HIV, the antibodies of the virus are found in blood and saliva.
Data from the Uganda AIDS Commission show that there are 1,000 new HIV and 500 new AIDS deaths per week in Uganda, which means 53,000 new infections and 23,000 new deaths per year.
Dr. Diana Atwan, Permanent Secretary-General of the Ministry of Health of Uganda, said that such a product would be very timely and would help humanity to better combat AIDS.
However, she called on men to take HIV testing seriously.
She added that 14 per cent of those infected were still not aware of their HIV status and that more work was needed to take care of that population.
“For the time being, 86% of people living with HIV know their status, which means that 14% of the people living with HIV do not know their status. So the question is how we use this innovative technology. For me, it's true how we're creating demand on the other side of the reagent box, especially for those 14% of the patients.
However, health officials warned that diets were strictly forbidden for 15 minutes prior to testing.
Mr. Tassi said that research had shown that no suicides had occurred and that the Ministry of Health was confident in avoiding such a possible tragedy, as testing was voluntary.
Dr. Atwan stated that, in addition to educating users through images and videos, government and private institutions (including all pharmacies) should provide 24-hour free telephone counselling services.
Studies have shown that HIV-infected and non-infected persons tested through OraQuick HIV self-test kits have an accuracy of more than 99 per cent.
Qatar World Cup athletes feel the heat.
During the Athletics World Cup, which opened on Friday, many of the contestants have already met their most challenging opponent: Qatar ' s suffocating weather.
The humidity in Doha is suffocating, the day temperatures hover around 38 degrees centigrade, and athletes and track and track officials are discussing the weather in Doha, which is why they are worried about some of the events.
Marathon and walk competitions are held at midnight, thereby minimizing the adverse effects of high temperatures.
Although high temperatures may have a lesser impact on players playing in the international stadium in caliphate because of air conditioners and the maintenance of temperatures around 21 degrees in the room, because of the outdoors of the training sites, the relevant players still have to adjust their training arrangements.
“We are also from tropical climate countries, but it's nothing compared to here.” The Bahamas coach Ronald Cartwright told Reuters.
"Here, you're walking out like someone gave you a heater. I guess that's why the race starts in the middle of the night."
Athletic officials committed themselves to providing additional medical care and security measures for marathons and contestants.
According to the International Athletic Movement Management Organization, the female marathon, originally scheduled for Friday at midnight, will take place as planned, as temperatures are expected to be below 30 degrees or around 30 degrees.
The Agency stated that its medical representatives had assured athletes that they would monitor the weather day-to-day and report to the teams “so that the event would operate at an acceptable level of health risk”.
The track and track players who participated in the indoor competition said that the impact of high temperatures on their performance should be modest, but they also acknowledged that training was particularly exhausting.
"I'm glowing when I'm trained because it's too wet, and I'm sweaty," said Ray Benjamin, the 400-metre column player.
"Just like I just took a shower. But I don't think it's too bad because there's air conditioning in the house."
The 2016 Olympic champion, lead ball player Ryan Klaus, said he had to heat the ball to about 38 degrees centigrade each time in order to prevent it from becoming damp when trained in high-temperature and humid conditions.
"The normal temperature of a lead ball is far below the point of disclosure, and once you take it out, it's wet, and it's dripping," says the American athlete. "This is worse than the rain pouring down and we've been overcoming it."
Amande Duplantis, the European champion of the poles, has been training in hot weather in Louisiana in the south of the United States for many years, saying that the damp weather has proved to be useful for training, because the smooth powder on his hands has been watered “to make the grip stronger”.
But for the other poles of the stick spray that are often used to boost the grip, it is even harder for them to hold on to the poles in this damp state, he says.
“I understand that people who often use sticky sprays encounter problems because their hands feel slippery and sticky,” Duprentis adds.
The locksmith was arrested, and the security breach in the main prison was worrying.
In recent days, a British prison locksmith was arrested and paid £500,000 to replace all the locks in the prison cell for fear that the key to the prison cell would be copied.
Fearing that copies of the key would be sold to some of the 1400 prisoners in the prison, Her Majesty's prison Wanceworth called the police.
This suspicious security breach will result in the replacement of 3000 locks, possibly cells, internal and external doors.
The police arrested a 40-year-old man in the prison on September 13, suspected of conspiring against public office. The man came from the south-west of London and worked at the Government Facilities Services Ltd., which provides maintenance services in 52 prisons in the south of the United Kingdom.
The police investigation raised concerns that some key marks might remain in clay until a true copy of the key was produced.
However, the prison officials stressed that they had found no evidence that any of the prisoners had obtained the keys.
Wanceworth Prison, a class B prison located in the south-west of London with a capacity of up to 1628 inmates, is one of the largest prisons in Western Europe. ... This prison, built in 1851, is used to house convicted male offenders and male remand prisoners.
“Her Majesty's Prison in Wanceworth has been upgraded to the security level at the gate, and a special identity check is currently under way as a result of a security incident.
The President of the House warned Trump to stop attacking informants.
They said, “The President's speech today constitutes a threat to witnesses and should be strongly condemned, an act that impedes impeachment by Congress. We condemn the President's attacks and call on our Republican colleagues to do the same, because Congress must do everything in its power to protect this informant and all informants.”
According to the statement, Trump “is now fully aware that our committee is seeking the testimony of the informant and other persons mentioned in the `whistleblower indictment', which was published today in the House of Representatives impeachment investigation, and that our national law prohibits any act of dissuasion, intimidation or other pressure on witnesses to prevent them from giving testimony to Congress.
They added that “no official with knowledge of the Commission's investigation — including the subject matter of the whistleblower's complaint — would be subjected to any intimidation, reprisal or threat of reprisal, and all witnesses must be able to testify in Congress”.
The statement was issued on Thursday, a week when the “whistle-blower charges” triggered a wave of “charges” in Washington alleging the abuse of official power by Trump in the upcoming 2020 elections “to seek the intervention of the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky”, while the White House took steps to cover it up.
There is no evidence that Joe or Hunter Biden was wrong.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced on Tuesday that Trump had betrayed his oath and announced the official initiation of an impeachment investigation against the President, just before the whistleblower had filed the “whistleblower complaint” with the Congressman.
Michelle Obama praised Megan Marker for "invigorating" on his photo wall application.
On Thursday, Michel Obama wrote an euphemism on the photo wall application, paying a high tribute to Megan Marker, saying that the Duchess of Sussex was “a wise leader who is breaking stereotypes and making the world a better place”.
The Duchess and Prince Harry are currently on a 10-day trip to South Africa with their beloved son, Archie Harrison Mombatten-Wincesa, who participated in a youth reception earlier this week and met with the leadership of the Obama Foundation.
The former First Lady of the United States enthusiastically wrote in her post: “Thanks to my friend, Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussex @sussexroyal, a wise leader who is breaking stereotypes and making the world a better place.”
Michelle Obama added: “She has inspired many people, whether by meeting with our Obama Foundation @ObamaFoundation leaders or helping girls around the world to seek education.”
Megan, who was a special editor of the British Fashion magazine, interviewed Michelle Obama for the magazine’s 9th month. The two women had a great time, and the former First Lady reviewed her mother’s experience and the changes that had been brought to her.
In an interview, Michelle Obama said: “Motherhood has always been a master's lesson to learn to let go.
As a mother, I understand that, in most cases, my duty is to provide children with the space to explore and develop and to make them who they want to be. It is not what I want them to be or what I want them to be when I am the age, but what they really are.
Aware of the pressures of being under a global spotlight, Michelle Obama gave some advice to the Duchess in an interview with Good Housekeeper.
She said, "The pressure from myself and from others can be very high sometimes. So my best advice is to be patient and not to rush into anything."
She goes on to say:
"I was worried about my daughters in the first months of the White House, to make sure that they had a good start in school and to meet new friends, and I went to a better job. I think it's okay, even good."
Heroes: Officer rushing into a busy high speed to save a hit dog.
It was a time of heroism, when a policeman headed for a busy highway and saved the next injured puppy.
Videos taken by Joseph Pugriya's CarLog show that Joseph Pugriya saw the puppy jump off a police car within seconds of being hit by another vehicle.
The police officer working in Pinelas Park, Florida, wrapped the injured puppy in a first aid blanket, put it in his own Land Cruiser and quickly took it to the nearest animal hospital.
Puglia said to the American Broadcasting Corporation, "I'm not really in a better mood until the puppies start breathing."
Thank God, the puppy survived, only with minor scratches.
The officer said, "We gave him the nickname "Lucky," and I think it's more appropriate than ever. "It's a lucky dog."
The puppy was sent to the local animal shelter and its rescuer was recognized as a hero.
But Puglia insisted that he was just doing his job.
The officer added that if the Animal Services Centre failed to find the owner of the puppy, his family would be happy to give a “lucky” family.
After WeWork went bankrupt, for the first time, the open equity market braked unprofitable companies.
Boston (Reuters) — Companies leading the United States stock market resounded flat, especially when they were losing, which cast a shadow over the first publicly released calendar for the rest of the year.
Surprisingly, the sudden delay in WeWork's first public fund-raising highlights how market confidence in companies and investors seeking financing is being eroded.
Peloton Interactive Inc. (PTON.O) continues to be punished on Friday for being a more critical market for first-time public fund-raising, the day after it started trading, and the stock price of this gym fell to $24.74, or 4%.
In the past, open-market investors often expected companies to make a profit about 18 months after their first public fund-raising. This timeline was eased by capital operators’ desire to add their fast-growing businesses to their portfolios.
Recent transactions, however, seem to indicate that uncertainty about economic prospects is prompting investors to become more selective about the losses they are willing to support.
According to Peloton’s report, corporate income grew at a rapid rate of 110 per cent in the fiscal year up to 30 June. However, the company’s operating leverage also showed negative values, with operating expenditure soaring by 147 per cent over the previous year.
SmilleDirectClub (SDC.O) became the first publicly listed dentistry company in the United States earlier this month. Research company recovery capital data show that the first open equity offer in three years will exceed the target area and will be collected on the first day of the transaction.
The average return on the first public fund-raising fund in 2019 is currently around 9 per cent, down from 30 per cent at the end of June and 18 per cent about two weeks ago.
In the United States, most of the attention in the third quarter focused on an unrealized transaction — the first public fund-raising initiative of WeWork's parent company, We Company.
The company had originally planned to conduct its first public equity collection earlier in September, but had postponed the listing plan until late 2019, after which the CEO was replaced and indicated that the listing schedule was under review.
Endeavoor Group Holdings (EDR.N), a entertainment and talent broker supported by the Hollywood heavyweight broker Ali Emanuel, decided at the last minute to give up the first public fundraiser, which had previously recorded a loss.
Jonathan Van Ness just launched a plan with Nancy Pelosi.
On Thursday, the star, Jonathan Van Ness, showed up in the United States Congress to discuss the Affirmative Bill with the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi (California Democrat).
The Equal Rights Bill will provide non-discriminatory protection to persons belonging to sexual minorities in the areas of credit, education, employment, housing, federal financial assistance, jury services and public facilities.
The Bill will amend the Civil Rights Act 1964 to include sexual orientation and gender identity in the list of protected categories.
Van Ness recently publicly admitted that he was infected with HIV, first sharing a video of himself walking in a congressional building and explaining in the text that he had met with the Speaker of the House of Representatives to discuss the Affirmative Bill, living with people living with HIV and the Prep (an HIV-prevention drug)
He then shared a longer post depicting the two men holding hands, urging his followers to stand up to the Senate majority leader, Mickey McConnell, and pressured the Republican senator to submit the Affirmative Bill.
The Bill of Rights was introduced on 13 March. The House of Representatives passed legislation in May. The Bill has not yet been submitted to the Senate.
In August, the Trump Government requested the Supreme Court to establish the fundamental legitimization of anti-homosexual discrimination in the workplace and, at an amicus curiae meeting, argued that the federal law on employer discrimination in the Civil Rights Act 1964 was not intended to protect individuals from dismissal on grounds of sexual orientation.
At the beginning of the year, Palosi and Van Ness, together with the three other Pink Saviors, and Congressman Alexander Okacio Cortez (Democrat of New York), met to discuss policy and promote the bill.
On Thursday, Pelosi shared a picture of her and Van Ness shaking hands on the balcony, thanking him for his voice in this struggle:
David Edenburgh is producing a new documentary on animals and colors.
David Edenberg is 93 years old, but this iconic master of nature is still alive.
He launched the seminal Naife documentary, Our Planet, and, with great success, this popular star will return with another series: The Color of Life.
This time, the father of the two children will study how the animal uses colour in life through a high-tech camera specially designed for the programme.
The BBC has revealed that the purpose of this star is to present a “coloured world of invisible eyes”, which indeed sounds very attractive.
While fans look forward to the release of this series in the near future, it seems that we all need to wait patiently, because it won't be on our screen until 2021.
But we are sure that it is worth waiting for.
Early this month, at a famous ceremony in London, David was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award for TV Select.
So far, the career of this national treasurer has been 60 years old, bringing laughter to millions of people.
In collecting his medals, the reporter enthusiastically said, "Yes, indeed. What I do is not always so funny, and sometimes people hear things they don't like."
But it's an honor and a great pleasure.”
The TV Select magazine spoke of the winner: “Sir David Edenburgh is still working, studying and doing programmes, and he is not only a British hero, but also a global icon”.
This week, once again, David was praised for having been named after him by a polar cruiser.
The star figure, along with Prince William and Princess Kate, attended the naming ceremony at the Birkenhead Kammelled Shipyard in Mercesardshire.
He said, “The world is facing all kinds of difficult problems, which are not news to any one of you, and it is the young people of today who will inherit the world that are most aware of it.
The difficult issues require a great deal of research and fact in order to resolve them.
That is what this amazing expedition will do to find the facts and find the law of science to deal with the problems facing the world today, and more and more people will do so in the future.”
Colours of Life is expected to be broadcast on BBC 2 in 2021, while Naife will retain global copyrights.
The husband of the murdered congressman Joe Cox said not to use my wife's name for political scores.
Jeremy Corbin criticized Boris Johnson by publishing a video of the murdered congressman last night, after which Joe Cox ' s husband stated that his wife ' s name could not be used to obtain political scores.
The Labour leader's video clips the night vigil after Mrs. Cox and her death, with subtitles: "Boris Johnson doesn't care about our street violence."
Critics argue that Corbin is using the Joe Cox murder case to obtain a “cheap political score”, while Joe Cox's husband, Brendan Cox, states that the Labour Party leader's attribution of hate speech to “simple party politics” is “wrong”.
Mr. Cox said: “Jeremy is right, and the best way to respect Joe is to defeat hatred and division. He believes that parliamentarians have a special responsibility and are right.
“But Jeremy was wrong to attribute hate speech to simple party politics. Although Joe was a passionate Labourist, there were things that had to go beyond party politics.”
Cox also shared a post saying that Joe Cox's name was "not just a political score point," and it was subtitled "Thank you." Corbin's video started with him talking about Mrs. Cox being murdered three years ago by an extreme right-wing radical in the West Yorkshire constituency.
Referring to the clips on Mrs. Cox, Johnson and the congresswoman, Corbin said, “The Prime Minister knows that these words fuel violence and have serious consequences. The Prime Minister wants to divide. Clearly, he doesn't care about our street violence.”
He continues to criticize Johnson and calls for a Labour Party government.
Corbin added: “Many people are worried about Boris Johnson's statements, which are being relayed by extreme right-wing elements. When women parliamentarians facing death threats asked him this question, Johnson looked down on them. It's shameful.” John Woodcock, a former Labour Congressman, shared this.
At the same time, Nadine Zahawi, a member of the Conservative Party and Minister of Commerce, said, “It's a mistake to use Joe Cox this way, because her family has made a clear request not to do so. Please stay away from politics.
“If you had a little dignity, Jeremy Corbin, you would have dropped the video.” Prior to that, the British Parliament had a debate this week about a number of statements in which Johnson said that the “best way to honour Mrs. Cox was to “finish” Britain.
Joe's sister said to British Independent TV: I'm talking openly about some crazy things about Boris Johnson -- I just think it's a bad way to move things forward. I can say what I think is right and what is wrong, but I'm going to try to do it in a cautious way."
The daughter of Labour Congressman Yvette Cooper publicly stated yesterday that she had been worried about the safety of her mother in view of the way people talked about politicians.
The House of Representatives accused Trump of the border wall, but he was planning to use a veto.
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives tried once again to overturn President Donald Trump ' s use of emergency power to attack military base projects (e.g. schools and firing ranges) in order to cover his long-standing commitment to the construction of the border wall.
The bill was submitted to Trump with 236 votes in favour and 174 against, but he would certainly veto it, just as he rejected a similar measure in March.
The bill was passed by the Senate last week, but more than a dozen senior Republican parliamentarians condemned Trump.
The voting was different on Friday, as the Government recently published a list of 127 military construction projects totalling $3.6 billion, which will be cancelled to cover the cost of building the border wall, including many projects in Republican constituencies and states.
Brazil claimed that it was not responsible for the oil spill on its northeast beach.
On Thursday, the Brazilian Environmental Protection Agency, the Brazilian Agency for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, indicated that, through an analysis of the large-scale oil spill on the north-eastern beaches of the country, the leaked crude oil was not produced domestically.
In a statement, the agency stated that it had conducted an oil spill survey on several beaches in the north-eastern states since 2 September. The local media published photographs of turtles, who were covered with black tar from the oil slick.
Oil pollution spread along the north-eastern coast of Brazil over a total length of more than 1,500 kilometres (932 miles), affecting local wildlife and contaminating painted beaches in many hot tourist attractions in the country, including Fortno Beach, Ceará, and Mara, Alagoas.
In a statement, the Brazilian State-owned controlling oil company, the Brazilian National Oil Company, stated that, after a molecular analysis of the crude oil, it had proved that the crude oil leaked was not produced or sold by the company.
The crude oil produced in different fields can be identified on the basis of a range of chemical ingredients, including sulphur content, nitrogen content, acidity and viscosity.
The Brazilian Oil Regulator, the Director General of the Brazilian National Petroleum Authority, Décio Odone, stated that, according to the Agency, it was possible that a tanker far from the Brazilian coast had leaked oil, but added that this possibility had not been confirmed. A statement by the Authority indicated that no leaks had been reported from any of its oil drilling platforms.
Some turtles were contaminated by oil and were rescued in the state of Rio Grande do Norte and sent to rehabilitation centres. The bodies of some other animals were also found, and the Brazilian Agency for Environment and Renewable Natural Resources added, but did not disclose the number of specific animals or deaths.
In a statement, the Brazilian National Oil Company stated that it was involved in the clean-up, although not related to the oil spill, and that approximately 100 employees were helping to clean the beaches.
Scorda's voice-digital assistant to the driver.
Scota will introduce a digital assistant that can be activated by voice command. In a Wednesday's announcement, the Czech car manufacturer said that drivers could use the phrase “Yes, Laura” to activate the digital assistant.
The system supports six languages and is capable of performing a range of tasks, including navigation to destinations and searching for music. The system will initially be configured in the Kamiq city, SUV, and the compact sedan Scala.
For example, some BMW cars are now equipped with “intelligent personal assistants” that can be activated using buttons, call words, or the phrase “Hello, BMW.” Drivers can use voice commands to heat their seats and access them.
On Thursday, Jack Palmer, a senior online car expert at SBD Automotive, sent an e-mail message to the CNBC channel, in which he said, “Voice is the ideal interactive tool for cars.”
“If most of the driver's orders are received through virtual assistants without touching screens and buttons, the prevailing driver distractions will be greatly reduced.” Palmer adds. “Car manufacturers are aware of this, and to that end, they are competing with Google, Asia, and Google.
The actions of companies like Scorda and BMW suggest that the way people interact with cars may change. The market intelligence company Inmint's car analyst, Hannah Casey, told CNNC via email that a recent report by the company focused on why nearly 40% of the American consumers own cars."
Ghana: Focus on World rabies Day
On Wednesday, the thirteenth World rabies Day was celebrated in Accra, which actively called on pet owners to vaccinate their own pets in order to protect the lives of citizens.
The theme of the event was “Inoculation: combating rabies”, organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in cooperation with the Agricultural Veterinary Authority.
The aim of the campaign was to highlight the important role of mass vaccination of canine vaccines in the eradication of rabies in Ghana.
Addressing the meeting, the Assistant Director-General and representative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Ghana, Mr. Abebe Haile-Gabrier, noted that the problem of rabies could be minimized if vaccination was significantly stepped up to keep vagrant animals away from humans, especially children.
According to the Global Strategic Plan for Zero rabies by 2030, “500,000 people die of rabies every year, 40 per cent of whom are children living in Asia and Africa”, he called for comprehensive measures to address the situation and protect children from rabies.
Mr. Haile Gabriel said that most rabid animals were infected with rabies, which again reflected the need for Ghana to further expand its “United Against rabies” strategy (i.e., by 2030, with zero rabies), which required pet owners to inoculate animals with common diseases of humans and animals.
He stressed the need for Ghana to embark on a campaign and vaccination programme (for a period of five years) to raise the profile of the population and eliminate the risk of rabies among humans.
He noted that, through the Ghana rabies and prevention action plan (2018-2030), we had developed a comprehensive road map for the gradual elimination of rabies, with the hope that by 2030 the tropical epidemic, which had not received sufficient attention, would be eradicated.
Mr. Haile Gabriel promised that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations would be prepared to work with other relevant units to prevent and control rabies in Ghana.
Dr. Owen Kalwa, representative of the World Health Organization in Ghana, stated that rabies are an epidemic and must be controlled in order to save lives.
He explained that through the strategy “Zero deaths by human rabies by 2030”, countries were supported in the development and implementation of national plans to combat rabies, which included the concept of “health as one” and cross-sectoral cooperation.
According to Dr. Kalwa, 99 per cent of rabies and other animals suffer from diseases transmitted to humans through dogs, adding that it is appropriate to control and eventually eliminate the “health as one” approach of human rabies.
Dr. Asiedou Baa, head of veterinary services, lamented the fact that rabies had become a global burden.
He said: “Although rabies cannot be cured, they can be prevented by vaccination, so the elimination of rabies is feasible and all animal owners must ensure that they are vaccinated against their animals.”
Dr. Baa said that, while the use of appropriate sustainable control strategies could completely prevent rabies, the death rate of rabies would continue to rise and the epidemic would increase owing to lack of funding and insufficient coordination.
He added: “It is imperative for the animal sector to have adequate resources to prevent the transmission of rabies on dogs as a means of preventing the disease”.
The 12-year-old girl who kept the world silent.
At the age of 16, Greta Tungberg established her position as a global voice on climate change. But 27 years ago, another girl denounced United Nations leaders on the world stage long before social media was popular.
Since Greta Tomberri organized a student strike against climate change in her home country, Sweden, her environmental movement has been impeccable; on Monday, her angry and passionate speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit has pushed her environmental movement to the top; and she has vehemently criticized politicians for using it.
The unsatisfied criticism of Tonberg has been met with intense criticism and high praise. The New York Journal calls her the “Sacred Virgin of Protesting the Climate Change World” and the Guardian has brought this statement to bear on the meaning of the President of the United States Lincoln Gettysburg Speech.
By the way, in 1992, this was the way the media commented on Suzuki. The Internet splits into two completely opposing parties - the opposition and the supporters of Suzuki Suzuki, which was held in Rio de Janeiro, long before Barry cold-faced charges officials that “we may not have a future.”
The tone of Suzuki's rebuke is the same as that of Tomberi. “We came here only to tell you adults that you had to change your way of life,” she started her own speech like Tsuzuki told the adults at the meeting, “We won't let you get away with these responsibilities”.
As Tonberg told the United Nations Climate Summit, “The great extinction disaster is on the way, and you know only the fairy tales of money and economic growth all day long,” Suzuki Suzuki told the leaders that “lost my future is much less simple than election failure or stock market swings”.
And the focus of both girls is nihilistic fatalism. "I'm afraid to stand in the sun now, because the ozone layer is empty. I'm afraid to breathe air because I don't know what chemicals are in it," Suzuki said in her speech in 1992. And look again in 2019.
The environmental problems of Suzuki were reflected in the world in the early 1990s, when ecological issues focused on deforestation, ozone depletion and species extinction. But after several years of intervention, humans were quite successful in solving these problems. Ozone depletion thanks to a landmark ban on chemicals.
Suzuki himself later created an environmental think tank and worked with the Special Adviser to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan at the beginning of the twenty-first century.
So what's the future of Tomberi? It depends on how you look at the example of Suzuki. On the one hand, none of her worst fears has happened. On the other hand, governments are still fighting environmental problems and are subject to child condemnation.
Assuming that 27 years from now our world still exists (and, according to Tonberg, unless humans cut carbon emissions to zero over the next decade or so, the world will be extinct), this radical environmental girl is likely to recall her long career at the United Nations and non-governmental organizations, which she began with this famous speech.
By that time, another worried child might be giving a vehement warning about the acid rain in the Martian colony.
The Scottish National Party may support Jeremy Corbin as interim prime minister to stop the lack of agreement.
The Scottish National Party has indicated that it may support Jeremy Corbin as the interim Prime Minister of the British Prime Minister's Office in order to block the lack of an agreement.
As the relationship between parliamentarians and the Prime Minister's Office became increasingly tense, Nicolas Sturgen suggested that the Labour Party leader could be supported as acting Prime Minister before the general elections.
Mr. Corbin appealed to Conservative traitors and opposition parliamentarians to support him in leading the interim Government in August, but this was resisted, particularly from FDP leader Joe Swanson.
On the basis of these proposals, the opposition sought to remove Boris Johnson through a “vote of no confidence” and then form a coalition government to seek an extension to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union on 31 October.
The plan failed to gain cross-party support at the time, but the Scottish National Party high-level feared that if no agreement was reached before 19 October, Mr. Johnson would ignore the law and force him to postpone the British retreat.
The leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicolas Sterkin, suggested that the extension could be ensured through the appointment of Corbin, as it was a “deep idea” to put Johnson in charge of the operation.
In response to a tweet suggesting the appointment of a Labour Party leader or another interim prime minister, she said: “Approves this approach.
The vote of no confidence and the opposition unites around someone with the sole aim of ensuring the postponement of the elections, which are immediately followed by general elections.
Everything is at risk, but it seems to me that letting Johnson take office, forcing him to fail to reach any agreement, or even to reach a bad agreement, is an alternative.”
Senior Congressmen Harriet Haman and Ken Clark have been nominated as potential candidates for leadership of the coalition Government, but senior SNP sources have insisted on the need for a Labour Party leader.
The source told Robert Peston of British Independent Television that “we will have to elect a new Prime Minister through a `vote of no confidence' so that we can ask for a postponement of the decoure and the holding of general elections, a situation that is becoming increasingly clear.
It's too complicated to try to find a compromise, national unity candidate, especially now that we have a candidate. Whether people like it or not, Corbin must be the interim prime minister.”
A spokesperson for the Scottish National Party stated that it was committed to preventing the lack of an agreement and “remove as soon as possible the current Prime Minister, who is dangerous and undemocratic”.
“If there is political will, it is now possible for the political parties to unite in order to ensure that the letter of the extension does not fall into the hands of Boris Johnson and his close friends, who are determined to find a way out of the Bann Act, but by the Acting Prime Minister, who will only be able to deliver the letter within the necessary time.
We remain open to all options in order to achieve the goal of stopping the untied and removing Boris Johnson.”
Even with the support of the Scottish National Party, this will be a decisive vote for Mr. Corbin. With 288 Conservatives and 10 Democratic Unity Party members, the opposition will need to bring some of the 34 independent members together.
The Labour Party considers the plan to be “the easiest and most democratic way to put an end to the lack of agreement”.
However, according to the Liberal Democratic Party, the interim Government under Mr. Corbin needed the support of the former Conservative Congressman and his own party ' s traitors and was therefore unable to obtain the necessary support in the House of Representatives.
“This report confirms the long-standing suspicion of many people that members of the Scottish National Party will be very happy to support Jeremy Corbin as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
There is no doubt that the unswerving position of Corbin on the second referendum of independence (indyref2) is a determining factor for nationalists.
If he was Prime Minister, he had opened the door to a new referendum in 2014.
Only the Conservative Government would stand up for those who voted “no” in an event that was supposed to be a century old.”
Convicted of sexual harassment, more than 50 students at Surrey University were barred from sports.
"People just expect the boys to do what the holidays are supposed to do. You can accept it as an overdrinking, noisy trip.
However, according to the students, some of the students acted out of proportion this year, especially during a game during which members of the football club were provoked by their teammates to flirt with women, and their friends tried to “stop” them from doing so.
Alan Sutherland, Chairman of the Surrey Student Council, said: “We are aware of the impropriety of this conduct and, as the investigation proceeds, any student accused of “serious” wrongdoing will be referred to the school for investigation under the student disciplinary regulations.”
Three students were formally punished by the school and the conduct of the football team was investigated in person.
One student was removed from school for three acts of sexual misconduct or harassment and one aggressive act.
At the same time, two other students who were also accused of harassment were given a final warning and asked for an apology.
One of the students is prohibited from entering the university campus at a given time, while the other student is prohibited from participating in organized social activities.
The boys' football club at the University of Surrey stated that they were “good apologies” for the conduct of their members on their journey to Croatia.
Matt de Grodt should not be punished for the stigma of schizophrenia.
In 2016, Matthew de Grodd, who had killed five people at a family gathering in Calgary, was found not criminally responsible for his actions.
Now, in 2019, a hearing will decide whether he should be allowed more freedom, such as to go out without supervision. The decision will be made in the next few weeks, so in the meantime, we have to consider whether this is a good idea. There are different views on the matter: one believes that, given his past violence, calls should be kept from happening again, while the other believes.
First of all, let's look at the more pessimistic side. De Grodt did stab five people during a mental illness. It was an unpredictable violent attack. He was schizophrenic, and that's why he was found not criminally responsible, but he's been seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication ever since.
As long as De Grodt continues to take medication and the risk of reoffending is not so great, why are people so worried? I think the stigma attached to people with mental illness, especially schizophrenia, has largely led to this fear. Some mental illnesses have become less terrible, such as emotional and anxiety disorders. But others, including others, have become.
In fact, most schizophrenia patients are non-violent, and they are more likely to be victims of crime or violence than perpetrators. With this in mind, fear of reoffending is more based on a biased attitude towards schizophrenia rather than on a biased attitude towards schizophrenia patients.
I don't think that Degrod should never be unsupervised. Supervised through a parole-like system to ensure that he is still on his medication and that the medication is effective. He argues that he or other mentally ill persons remain in solitary confinement unless absolutely necessary. This would leave the mentally ill, especially schizophrenia, permanently unable to integrate into society; and thus they would never integrate.
The Prime Minister of Hungary, Orbán, defended his country's candidate for the Council of Europe, “with a solution at hand”
The Prime Minister of Hungary, Victor Orbán, stated that, following the rejection of the nomination of a candidate for a Council of Europe member in Hungary, he had “at his disposal” with a number of solutions.
According to Reuters, Rowana Prembu, a Romanian Socialist politician designated by the Minister of Transport of the European Union, and László Trojani, the nominee commissioner for the enlargement of the European Union and former Minister of Justice of Hungary, were informed that their nomination hearings could not take place due to inconsistencies in the financial statements.
“I firmly believe that [Trojani] is the most suitable candidate for membership in the European Commission”, Orbán said, “If he is guilty, it is he who helps the Government and I to protect Hungary from immigration.”
This was an embarrassment to Orbán, who recommended Trojani, which had also been in conflict with Brussels on issues such as migration policy.
A baby in flight: Japan has launched the Scream Baby Selection Service.
Japanese Airlines has introduced an online booking tool that shows the seating of children in walking schools, and since then long-distance flights that are disturbed by crying babies may no longer exist.
When a passenger with an 8-day to 2-year-old child takes a seat, a child identifier appears automatically on the selection list, reminding other passengers who have not yet been selected.
The Japanese Airlines quickly pointed out that the new functionality did not guarantee that passengers could avoid crying out loud babies altogether.
The icon may not appear if passengers book flights through third parties, take part in travel missions or change aircraft at the last minute, as indicated on the Japan Air website.
The Japanese and other airlines have yet to come up with a way of predicting the seating of consecutive snorings and of passengers who are completely tilted in their seats while eating on board the aircraft.
Nevertheless, it has won a number of user praises in social media.
"Thanks to @JAL_Officel_jp for reminding me where the children planned to shout during the 13-hour journey," the businessman Rahhart Ahmed wrote on Twitter. "This should indeed be enforced throughout the cabin."
However, there were also some urging for tolerance on the part of travelling passengers.
“They are babies, and we used to be. We have to learn to tolerate them. Otherwise, we will soon need a map of the location of the situation that is common in life, such as snorting, drooling, farting, drunks, etc.” One user wrote.
Pompeo accused Syria of using chemical weapons in the May attack.
United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeyo addressed the United Nations Conference, and the United Nations General Assembly said on Thursday that the United States had concluded that the Syrian Government had used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year.
Pompeo said that United States officials had confirmed that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad ' s Government had used chlorine gas in the 19 May attack on opposition forces in Idlib province.
“The Assad regime is responsible for countless atrocities, some of which have risen to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity”, Pompey said at the press conference.
United States officials said in May that they had received reports that were consistent with the chemical attacks in north-western Syria, but that no precise conclusions had been drawn at that time.
In April 2018, the United States, Britain and France launched air strikes on Syria in retaliation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month.
“This is different in a sense, because it's chlorine... but, you know, President Trump is very active in protecting the world from chemical weapons,” Pompeo says.
He added that the United States would provide the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons with an additional $4.5 million to finance investigations into other suspected chemical weapons use in Syria.
Pompeo also called on the Assad Government to release thousands of prisoners who had been unjustly detained, including the missing American journalist Austin Tis, who had been presumed to have been in custody for seven years.
“He is only one of some United States citizens detained in Syria, and we call on the Syrian regime to release all of them.”
Tesla released a report that Mask's goal was to deliver 100,000 vehicles this quarter.
Ellen Muske, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors.
According to the electric car news network Electrek, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Ellen Musk said that Tesla was expected to deliver 100,000 vehicles this quarter, which would be a new record, and Tesla ' s share price had risen by more than 5 per cent since the news story.
The Electrek website states that this message was leaked from an e-mail sent by Mask to Tesla's employees. In this e-mail, Mask wrote, "We expect to deliver 100,000 cars for the first time this quarter. This is an exciting milestone for our company!"
In the report, the CEO added: “The challenge of this goal is to ensure that we have the right model in the right place and to maximize corporate resources to help meet delivery targets by the end of the quarter.”
The vehicle manufacturer is expected to report its quarterly vehicle delivery in the coming days.
Last quarter, Tesla delivered about 95,000 electric vehicles.
Greece: 5 denials of trafficking in newborns of poor women through illegal adoption
Five Greek and Georgian citizens appeared in court on suspicion of involvement in a criminal organization that allegedly trafficked newborn children in the form of adoption.
On Friday, these five denied the charges before the District Judge of Thessaloniki, two of whose Georgian nationals were accused of being the principal perpetrators.
The group allegedly recruited a number of extremely poor Bulgarian pregnant women who were willing to give up their newborn baby. According to the authorities, the group sold the babies to mostly Greek couples who had no children.
This week, 12 people were arrested on suspicion of illegal adoption and trafficking in human eggs. 54 others were charged with conspiracy.
According to the police, this is one of the largest and most well-organized groups of similar organizations in Europe. Europol provides assistance in the investigation of cases.
Mike Pompeio stated that the Syrian Government had used chlorine chemical weapons in the May attack.
The United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeyo, stated on Thursday that the United States had concluded that the Syrian Government had used chlorine chemical weapons in May of this year while fighting insurgents in Idlib.
“The Assad regime is responsible for countless atrocities, some of which have risen to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity”, Pompey said at a press conference at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
“Today I declare that the United States has concluded that the Assad regime used chemical weapons on 19 May.”
The United States indicated that, in May this year, it received numerous reports that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad ' s forces suspected the presence of certain chemical substances in areas of armed fighting against the Government in the north-west; however, the United States did not draw clear conclusions as to whether the Syrian Assad Government had used chemical weapons.
In April 2017 and April 2018, the Trump Government bombed Syria twice on the grounds that Syrian government forces in Assad were suspected of using chemical weapons.
Father still has the hope that the suspect who shot his son a year ago will end up dead.
One year after the shooting of a 20-year-old in Long Beach, the victim ' s family did not give up hope that the killer would be caught.
The victim's father, Guy Alford, said, "I wish I could do it with you, son. I wish I could do it with you."
Alford returned to the crime scene one year after his son, Guy Alford III, was shot dead — the Jack fast food chain in a box near 52nd Street and Atlantic Avenue. He said he wanted to draw attention to the unresolved murder of his son.
He said, "Someone knows something, and they need to say it."
The security video, which was never released, showed that when Alford stopped at the car restaurant, the second car was parked behind him. Then three suspects came down from the car. One of them went to the driver's seat of Alford's car and opened fire on Alford. The four men in the Orford car jumped out of the car and ran away.
Alford said, "Whereever this son of a bitch is, he'll be caught."
The sad father said that he did not know who would want to harm his son or who else was in the car when his son was shot.
Alford said, "They ran out of my son's car like they did in the video, and where did they go? Did you go back and try to help him or something? No one said a word."
Alford said that his son was a star football player at Alemany High School, and then an outstanding security guard for the Long Beach City College football team. Alford said that his son was working hard to play, to get into grade 1 school, dreaming of becoming a nurse.
A friend of his son's, Michael Harvey, said, "He worked three jobs. I'm 21, he's a year younger than me, and whoever keeps this busy state and the idea of work will be admired."
The police continued to investigate the fatal shooting, and Alford stated that he himself had not given up.
He said, "The problem will be solved, I can assure you."
Alford himself offers a reward of $2,000 to look for clues that might lead to the arrest and conviction of the suspect. We strongly recommend that all those who can provide information about this crime call the Long Beach Police.
It's hard for England to get out of Europe.
If Johnson tries to evade the promise of an extension, he will be humiliated in Brussels before the European Court of Justice. This will ease the mood of European officials, who will probably agree to do so.
However, European diplomats have also seen that the British political impasse has delayed the British decision. Parliamentarians have been able to set aside their differences, restrict Johnson’s movement and seek a postponement, but all the consensus they can reach is that.
Even if elections were to take place, the outlook remains worrying, because European countries want a friendly solution to the chaos brought about by Britain’s tremors. The discomfort of the opposition Labour Party is so painfully distorted that it is almost impossible to understand; and the centrist Liberal Democratic Party’s suggestion that it be abolished is considered too extreme.
Brussels might be optimistic if there was a viable outline for an agreement at the headquarters of the European Commission Belemón Building, but the reality was that such an outline did not exist.
Johnson often criticized the former Prime Minister's “back-up” program aimed at preventing Ireland from returning to hard borders and protecting the EU single market, but he did not bring any convincing alternatives. Officials said that many of the alternatives proposed by the United Kingdom were not specific enough to be operational, and that on October 31, the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
Moreover, Johnson's weakness will make it even more difficult for the leaders of his EU-27 to eliminate the “red line” of focus, despite the claim by British Minister Michael Goff, who is responsible for “no agreement” that they are “regulating” the back-up programme.
Johnson was criticized for inappropriate rhetoric in the British Deloitte debate, the ideal outcome of which was that a series of strikes on him would bring the fight to a close. Europe had no choice but to negotiate with the current British government while working to preserve the unity of the remaining 27 member states, so Europe should still try to get Britain to the top.
But it's more like a football game, with 27 players on the line, while the players try to pick up the ball and go home.
The EU is good at setting rules, drawing “red lines” and insisting on enforcement, but unilaterally imposing its will is short-cut. At least until the UK’s general elections or the second referendum break the deadlock, Britain is tired of its own internal contradictions.
It is difficult for the United Kingdom to get out of Europe.
For the first time, a black hole was captured to devour and tear up a star.
For the first time, a huge black hole was captured to swallow and tear apart a star.
Researchers published an article in Astrophysics magazine saying that this star is about the size of our Sun, 375 million light-years away, and can see it distorted and spiraled up under the gravitational forces of a super-mass black hole.
Subsequently, the star was swallowed up and astronomers called this rare cosmic event a tidal tearing event.
NASA's Planetary Search Telescope, the Ling Day Planet Exploration Satellite, captured for the first time a detailed time line from the beginning to the end of the event.
Astronomers used a global network telescope to detect this phenomenon before observing the planetary exploration satellite, which was designed to find distant planets, and captured the beginning of the violence in the continuous observation area of the planetary exploration satellite.
Thomas Hollian, astronomer at the Carnegie Institute of Science, who led the study, said: “This is actually a combination of rationality and good luck, sometimes what is needed to drive science forward.”
When stars venture too close to a supermassive black hole, they are sucked into it, which lies at the heart of most galaxies, such as the Earth's Milky Way.
The powerful gravitational forces of the black hole tear the star apart, some of its material is thrown into space and the rest is inhaled into the black hole, forming a hot and bright gas during the swallowing process.
Mr. Holli added: “In particular, we can measure the speed of the star's brightening, and we have observed rare planet temperatures falling and brightness getting darker.”
The British Commercial Council will investigate Thomas Cook's bankruptcy.
The British Civil Aviation Authority stated that following the collapse of the Thomas Cook Tourist Group, 72 flights were planned to be operated and another 16,000 passengers returned to the United Kingdom.
The Aviation Regulatory Authority stated that more than 40 per cent of the passengers had been picked up during the “Mathorn Plan”, the largest repatriation operation in the period of peace launched on Monday.
At the same time, the Business Committee of the United Kingdom Parliament has launched an insolvency investigation into Thomas Cook, seeking to question management issues related to executive remuneration and accounting policies.
Thomas Cook, the oldest travel agency in the world, collapsed this morning on Monday morning, affecting hotel owners, tourist attractions and resorts around the world.
“Unfortunate British tourism companies have unfortunately collapsed and their principals should face public scrutiny and be held accountable for their actions prior to the collapse of the company”, said Rachel Reeves, Chairman of the British Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee.
The hearing will begin in mid-October.
“The directors were pleased to accept this opportunity to clarify the facts and to prove that their actions were always in the best interests of Thomas Cook's clients, employees and stakeholders.” An informed source from the company stated to Reuters.
Why does The Times publish details of the identity of the informant?
On Thursday, The Times published detailed information about a whistle-blower whose allegations led the Democratic Party to launch this week an impeachment investigation against President Trump. (The article states that the whistle-blower was a CIA official who used to serve in the White House and was very professional in Ukraine.)
Many readers, including those working in national security and intelligence, have criticized the publication of detailed information in the Times, arguing that it could put at risk the life of the person who reported it and could discourage those who wanted to do so.
We conveyed the concerns of these readers to Dean Barquett, the executive editor of The Times, who responded in discussions with the Readers Centre:
The President and some of his supporters criticized the credibility of the whistleblower because the information provided by the whistleblower triggered a landmark impeachment process. The President himself described the whistleblower’s account as “political hacking”.
We have decided to publish limited information about the whistleblower, including his work in a non-political body, and his complaint is based on an in-depth knowledge of the White House, as we want to provide information to readers so that they can make their own judgements as to the credibility of the whistleblower.
China claims that it has not provoked any war, nor has it invaded any other country's land.
On Friday, China stated that it had no intention of provoking “a war or conflict” and did not “appropriate” the land of another State, evading the reference to the Indian war of mid-1962.
“China has always been committed to resolving territorial and maritime delimitation disputes through negotiation and consultation.” On 1 October, four days before the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, China published an official white paper.
“China has maintained world peace through practical action. For 70 years, China has not initiated any war or conflict, has not appropriated an inch of the land of another country.” The White Paper China and the World in the New Age states:
The White Paper, while emphasizing the “peaceful rise” of the Communist Party, did not mention the bloody war with India in 1962 and the vast areas of land occupied by China, particularly the Aksaichin region.
The Chinese-Indian border dispute over the 3488 km de facto line of control remains unresolved. China also claims that Arunachal Pradesh is part of southern Tibet, and India rejects it.
To date, 21 rounds of meetings of the Special Representative have been held between the two countries to resolve the border dispute.
In addition to the 1962 war, there was also a military confrontation between India and China in Dokram in 2017, when the Chinese People's Liberation Army tried to pave a road in an area close to the corridor known as the “Indian cock” and connected to the states of north-eastern India, which Bhutan claimed to own.
The problem was finally resolved through diplomatic means, with both sides withdrawing their troops.
In 1979, a major military conflict broke out between China and Viet Nam. China claimed sovereignty over the South China Sea as a whole. Viet Nam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei Darussalam, and Taiwan all objected.
“China and 12 of the 14 neighbouring countries have completely resolved the issue of the land boundary and demarcated the maritime boundary of the Gulf of North China,” the White Paper states, and states that since the reform and opening of 1978, China has taken the initiative to reduce military posts by “more than 4 million”.
The Chinese army, with 2 million troops, remains the largest army in the world.
The prolonged monsoon has caused flooding and chaos in many parts of India.
The monsoon season in India has been raging for almost a month, with unprecedented rainfall leading to the collapse of buildings and the beginning of the decomposition of many crops.
The monsoons in northern India usually dwindled in early September, but the average rainfall this month was 37% higher than normal. According to experts in the Indian meteorological sector, this would be the last monsoon season in decades if it continued for a few days.
Many parts of India are still suffering from unprecedented flooding, most recently in the town of Puna in western India, which resulted in several deaths on Wednesdays and Thursdays and severe damage from the collapse of buildings.
Houses are flooded and people travel on the streets, which are flooded with flood on their knees, which is usually the only sight that can be seen at the peak of the monsoon.
Other cities, such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hyderabad, also experienced heavy rains, and houses were severely damaged in North Akand State in the north as a result of continued rainfall.
The monsoon is too late. In many areas there is a shortage of water and farmers are prepared to cope with a possible drought disaster.
The prolonged monsoon season is a headache for farmers. "It's not normal this time of year. It's causing my vegetables — my cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes — to rot."
For consumers, this late-to-late monsoon has led to an increase in onion prices, an important ingredient in Indian food. In cities like Delhi and Mumbai, onions are sold at 80 rupees per kilogram (approx. 1 Pound), whereas normally they are sold at every kilogram.
The next big holiday is the 10 grand festival on October 8th, where the Hindus made the giant cartoon Robona portrait. Robo was a figure of the Hindu epic "Romocona", with a thick beard, a bad mouth.
The burning of the Robona portraits is a symbol of evil. These are made of paper, and if the monsoon continues, Robona may laugh until the end.
Julian Assange: Private security company `for the founder of the CIA surveillance of WikiLeaks at the Embassy of Ecuador'
According to the information received, Julian Assange was living in London when a Spanish private security company hired to protect the Ecuadorian Embassy in London monitored the founder of the WikiLeaks for United States intelligence services.
According to a Spanish newspaper El País, Spanish private security companies are suspected of providing the United States Central Intelligence Agency with audio and video from Assange ' s meetings with his lawyer.
It was reported that the company was under investigation by the Spanish High Court.
Assange himself initiated criminal proceedings, accusing the company of violating his privacy and the confidentiality of his client-lawyer privileges.
According to El País, the Spanish private security company failed to respond to its request for comments on the matter.
In April, when Assange was handed over to the British authorities by Ecuador, he was expelled from the Embassy.
In 2012, Assange entered the Embassy of Ecuador in the United Kingdom on bail and was at risk of being extradited to Sweden for sexual assault charges; Assange stated that he feared extradition to the United States if WikiLeaks activities were abandoned.
In June of this year, the United States officially issued an extradition request against Assange, who was charged with 18 counts of computer misuse and unauthorized disclosure of defence information.
He was accused of collaborating with Chelsea Manning, a former American military intelligence analyst.
Previously imprisoned for breaching the conditions of bail in Sweden ' s extradition request, Assange, currently serving his sentence in Belmash prison in London, should have been released last week, but was remanded in custody pending a United States extradition hearing in London in February 2020.
In May of this year, the Swedish prosecution reopened an investigation into Assange ' s rape charge, which Assange has consistently denied.
The flight landed in Baltimore after the All-Air emergency was declared.
According to the United States Federal Aviation Office, an all-power international aircraft landed safely at Washington International Airport in Baltimore after an emergency had been declared.
In an e-mail, the United States Federal Aviation Office indicated that flight 328 had landed at Washington International Airport in Baltimore at 6.19 p.m. on Thursday because of a hydraulic problem with Boeing B777.
According to the United States Federal Aviation Office, the flight has left Baltimore but its destination is unknown. The number of passengers on the flight is not yet known. The United States Federal Aviation Office is investigating the incident.
A telephone message was sent to All-China International Airlines, based in Tarsa, Oklahoma State, and returned immediately on Thursday evening.
Why do we need Gandhi?
As we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the birth of an extraordinary human being, the leaders of the world ' s two largest democracies should all the more heed the principles that he espouses.
Mohandas Karamchand, “Major Mahatma” Gandhi, born on 2 October 1869, dedicated his life to the cause of morality, non-violence, tolerance and social justice, has left a valuable legacy for the world. He has had a profound impact on both of America's most important national movements.
As American activists such as Howard Shurman and Benjamin Mays have travelled far to India to meet Gandhi, Gandhi's influence on the civil rights movement began long before Martin Luther King embraced his ideas.
Caesar Chavez, on the other hand, traced his political awakening to a news film that he watched when he was 11 or 12 years old about “the power of the British Empire conquered by a half-naked man without a gun”, and later, when he led the farm workers movement, he followed Gandhi in many strategies.
Gandhi has the same influence outside the United States. For example, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Marara Yousafzai and climate change activists all see Gandhi as a beacon.
However, President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi seem to be indifferent to Gandhi's ideas, apart from their recent words of complimentation at a major joint public gathering in Houston. Both are right-wing populisms that lack compassion or tolerance in their rule.
Modi has been a member of the Indian Nationalist Organization, the National Volunteer Organization, whose former member, Naturam Goldson, stabbed Gandhi on January 30, 1948. In fact, Modi is a member of the ruling party, the Indian People ' s Party.
In many ways, the Modi Government had shown anti-Gandziism by abolishing the autonomy and statehood of the Muslim-majority province of Jammu and Kashmir and imposing a blockade on the area; and it did not welcome refugees of mostly Rohingya Muslim origin who had fled from extreme persecution in Myanmar.
Moreover, the Modi Government has also caused social unrest by establishing detention camps in Assam State, located in the border areas, ostensibly to capture non-national citizens from the Muslim-majority neighbouring country of Bangladesh, which could result in nearly 2 million people being denied the right to vote and imprisoned.
The travel ban imposed by the Trump government on Muslim-majority countries is a response to Islamophobia, and this is what Modi's policy is about. Its indifference to refugees is also a resounding reflection of the suffering of the Rohingyas.
At these two leaders’ recent joint rally, there was a moment worth learning about. At the event, the majority leader of the House of Representatives, Stanley Hoye, quoted Gandhi’s definition of democracy as “democracy can give the weak the same opportunities as the strong.”
It was the 150th anniversary of Gandhi's birth, and the performance of Trump and Modi in their tenure would have been much better had they kept Gandhi's advice in mind.
White House statement: Trump nominates Peter Géner as Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
On April 3, 2019, on Congress Hill, Washington, United States, the Acting Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Peter Guena, smiled and testified at a hearing on the budget request of the Senate Appropriations Committee for the 2020 fiscal year, held by the Subcommittee on Homeland Security.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, nominated Peter Geiner as Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as stated in a statement by the White House.
The current Deputy Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Guena, served as Acting Director General of the Agency, which is responsible for overseeing the Government ' s response to disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires.
Since the resignation of Broc Lang in March, there has been no Senate-approved head of the agency. The Department of Homeland Security, the parent department of the Department of Management, determined that Lang had violated the law by using a bus to and from Washington and his residence in North Carolina, and subsequently resigned as Director General.
Earlier this month, the nomination of another Administrator candidate, Jeffrey Bayad, was withdrawn, as background checks revealed that he was suspected of involvement in a bar fight.
He also needs a majority in the Senate to approve the nomination before he can take up the post of Director.
According to the White House, before assuming the post of Deputy Administrator of the Administration in 2018, Qana worked for the Emergency Management Department on Rhode Island and served in the United States Navy.
The man was “inflamed” at his doorstep.
A man was set on fire at the door of his home, which the police considered to be a targeted attack.
The 48-year-old man started a fire outside his home in Skelmersdale, Western Lancaster, where he was wet and flammable liquids were allegedly gasoline.
The man was severely burned and is currently in hospital in a critical but stable situation.
At around 1 a.m. on Thursday, the police received a police call to the man ' s home and opened an investigation into the attempted murder.
The inspector in charge of the investigation, Pauline Stables, said: “The nature of the incident is bad, the man is still in hospital and the situation is very bad.
“We are conducting a series of investigations to try to identify those responsible.
“We are trying to establish the motives for the incident, which we are convinced is targeted, and I would like to emphasize that I do not believe that the current incident poses a threat to the wider community.
“I hope that those who know the whereabouts of the murderer will report to us.
“Does your family behave suspiciously when they come home, smelling smoke, gasoline, or have inexplicable scars?
“We need someone to take responsibility for this terrible incident.”
Fragile Democrats have caused Perosi's fear of impeachment.
During the meeting, several members expressed their position that Democrats should continue to focus their investigations on Ukraine — alleging that Trump had asked the President of Ukraine to investigate potential political opponents in 2020 — rather than other cases of possible violations detailed in the report of Special Adviser Robert Müller.
At a press conference on Thursday morning, Pelosi said that the vast majority of Democrats agreed with the strategy that “whistle-blower complaints” were the “current focus”.
The leaders want to maintain intra-party unity by continuing to focus on impeachment investigations, while focusing on moderate members who have recently joined the proceedings. Members of Parliament say that Ukraine’s problems are also clear and easily explained to the public. They also believe that this investigation, led by the Intelligence Committee, is less extensive and will progress faster, and could be implemented within the next one or two months.
Shortly after her accession to the Democratic Party, Congressman Angie Craig from Minnesota expressed her support for impeachment investigations earlier this week, as the majority of Pelaussi and PDP leaders had listened to parliamentarians at previous meetings.
Craig said, “In my position, I have been reluctant to move the investigation forward only from the point of view of what I wish to be bound by, and I want to see due process and to ensure that we have all the facts — a process that will enable us to do so”, and she added that she supported a small inquiry led by the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives.
Democratic Congressman Matt Cartwright from Pennsylvania told CNN that he would not vote in favour of impeachment clauses at the moment.
Cartwright said, “I am not voting now because we haven't seen the whole truth.” “We have to assume that people are innocent, don't we? If all this is true, we have to see if the press is covering the news and whether there are any documents that reveal it.”
The Democratic Party will soon hear from voters about their push for impeachment, and members plan to return to their constituencies early in October for two weeks. This is the first time that a large number of members from conservative areas have heard, and sometimes negative news, of their voters calling for impeachment proceedings since earlier this week, following accusations in Ukraine.
Congressman Dan Kirdi, Democratic Party of Michigan, said, however, that there was merit in choosing to adjourn the session at this time.
He said to the press: “I can't imagine anything better than reporting to the boss before pushing the impeachment process.” “This is actually a good time for us to go back and take a breath, understand the views of the local people, explain what we're doing to them, then go back and move on accordingly.”
Although parliamentarians have returned, the process may have been faster.
The member of the Judicial Council, Jamie Raskin, was a supporter of the impeachment investigation, and she said, “I think everyone is interested in doing so in 2019”.
This Maryland Democrat said to the journalist on Thursday evening: “There is consistency within the party on the emerging irregularities and corruption in the White House, and our job is to reduce such acts and problems through a series of meaningful impeachment clauses for the country.” “We need a series of provisions to ensure that legal cases are convincing and tell a consistent story to the public. If we do our job correctly,
Anthony Brindisi, from New York, a newcomer to the Democratic Party, refused to call for impeachment investigations and told CNN that he was temporarily opposed to impeachment of Trump.
Brindisi said, “Although I find many of the statements in the informant's report disturbing, there is more to it.” “We must talk to some of these officials, who have listed the report here and looked at its whereabouts.”
According to CNN, more than half of the members of the United States House of Representatives support impeachment investigations. However, this includes many Democrats who, while expressing their support for impeachment investigations, are still waiting for the results before deciding whether to vote for impeachment.
Trump discussed former Vice-President Joe Biden in a telephone conversation with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenski, on 25 July, after which the number of people supporting the initiation of impeachment investigations increased significantly (more than 75 members of the House of Representatives). There is no evidence of Biden.
Trump staff said that lawyers had transferred Ukrainian phone records to the security system.
A senior official of the Trump Government admitted on Friday that White House lawyers had instructed the transfer of telephone records from President Trump to a highly secure system with President Zelenski of Ukraine in July.
Other actions for the transfer of records, other than those reported on telephone calls, are not yet known.
The Trump Government declassified the whistleblower's complaint, which was made available to the public on Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee, stating that White House officials had stated that they had been “directed” by White House lawyers to remove calls from the computer system in which the telephone was normally stored.
The whistleblower claimed that the transcripts were usually kept in different levels of the confidential system. The whistleblower added that, according to White House officials, “not for the first time” had been placed in the system to protect politically sensitive information, rather than national security sensitive information.
“In the days following the call, I learned from a number of United States officials that senior White House officials had intervened to `lock' all telephone records, in particular the official verbatim records of calls produced by the White House Intelligence Unit in accordance with established practice,” the informant said.
The White House released a non-confidential version of the call record on Wednesday. The memorandum, “not a verbatim record, but a “records and memories” of the call from the relevant personnel, shows that Trump sought assistance in investigating the Biden family.
He said, “The other thing is that Biden's son has a lot of rumours and Biden has ended an indictment, and a lot of people want to find out about it, and if you can do something with the Attorney General, it would be better.” “Baden brags that he stopped the prosecution, and if you could investigate it, that sounds terrible to me ”.
During his tenure as Vice-President, Joe Biden urged Ukraine to dismiss Victor Shawkin, its highest prosecutor, who was investigating corruption in the “Brisma Holdings” of the Ukrainian gas company, where Hunt, Biden's youngest son, was a director. Biden's allies insisted that he intervened because of corruption.
The complainant’s complaint, however, states that Trump sought foreign assistance during the 2020 campaign.
The instructions of the White House lawyers to amend the record were characterized by the DDP high-level as “concealing the facts”.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, announced this week an official impeachment investigation against the President on developments in Ukraine, which she described as “hidden” and said would be part of the impeachment investigation.
At the same time, Trump's lawyer, Jay Sekulo, diluted the importance of record-keeping details.
“This is a cover-up? Think about it, Sekulo said on Friday in Fox with Friends. “Isn't the White House supposed to protect the conversation with the president of Ukraine? Is this a secret and not a cover-up? It's a document. It's a total nonsense.”
Ukrainian scandal: Pelosi said Bar was a rogue; former United States officials supported the investigation
The head of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, accused the United States Attorney General, William Barth, of protecting the President on Friday by “couplingly” in a controversial telephone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian leadership, which also triggered impeachment investigations.
This indictment was filed on Thursday by an intelligence officer who was reluctant to reveal his name to Michael Atkinson, United States intelligence agency inspector. Atkinson handed it over to Joseph Maguire, national intelligence director.
In a telephone call on 25 July, Bar and Trump's lawyer, Rudolf Juliani, were repeatedly mentioned. The indictment stated that White House officials were very concerned about this and they tried to “lock” the phone records.
On Friday, Pelosi said to the Microsoft National Broadcasting Corporation, "Bal has become very rogue." "I think what they're doing is covering up the truth. I think it's sad that the Justice Department is so rogue. Well, it's been a while. It's only going to make things worse."
After Trump admitted that he had stopped providing military assistance to Ukraine, Pelosi announced a formal impeachment investigation this week. The aid was finally approved, but the Democrats of the House of Representatives wanted to know whether it had anything to do with Trump’s request for Zelenski to investigate Hunter Biden, who had worked for the Ukrainian gas company for five years.
Also on Friday, nearly 300 former U.S. foreign policy and homeland security officials signed a letter in support of impeachment investigations. The coalition stated that Trump's actions constituted “serious national security concerns”.
The letter said: “We applaud the congressmen, including President Perosi, who led us on this necessary path.” “President Trump seems to have used the power and resources of the country's highest office to invite more foreign forces to interfere in our democratic process. This would constitute an unjustified abuse of power.
“It will also represent an effort to subordinate the national interests of the United States — as well as those of our closest allies and partners — to the personal political interests of the President.”
Trump denied that there was anything wrong with this call. On Friday, he denounced the complainant and again stated that his conversation with Zelinski was a perfect conversation.
On Twitter, he said, “It sounds more and more like a so-called whistleblower, but it's not a whistleblower at all.” “In addition, all second-hand information has been proved to be inaccurate, and there may be no other person, leaker or spy giving it to him or her?” A party detective?
Complaints from informants indicate that Vice-President Pens also interacted with Ukrainian leaders, and that he met with Zelinski in Poland earlier this month. He said that he had not discussed either Joe Biden or Hunt Biden.
Chinese human rights defenders have been buried in detention centres, and all sides have called for a thorough investigation of the torture.
One Chinese defender was arrested and killed after holding a card demanding the resignation of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and a number of defenders called for a thorough investigation into his true cause of death.
In July of this year, Wang Meiyo raised a petition outside the Huanan Province Public Security Office asking Xi Jinping and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang to step down and introduce universal suffrage in China. The police then accused him of “suspecting for corruption”, a crime that was vaguely defined, and many dissidents used to do so.
According to Wang Miyu's mother and lawyer, he died on Monday. Wang Miyu's wife, Cao Jong-ha, received a phone call from the police claiming that her husband died in a military hospital in Shaeyang City, and that Wang Mi-yu's detention facility was located in Changyang. The police officers did not explain his death on the telephone.
According to the Chinese human rights organization People's Watch, the body of Wang Meiyu was later seen by Cao Songxia, who had blood on his mouth and nose and bruises on his face.
The “China Human Rights Defenders Network” (CHRD) issued a statement stating that “the Chinese Government must thoroughly investigate the torture and death of human rights activist Wang Meiyu in detention and hold perpetrators of torture and extrajudicial executions criminally accountable”.
According to Radio Free Asia, Cao Songxia said that she had been asked by the police to accept Wang Miyu’s accidental death, but she rejected it. A police officer at the Changyang City Police Department said he could not comment on the case. Wang Miyu’s mother told the Guardian reporter that the authorities had released 2 million dollars to her family.
“No thorough investigation of the facts, no criminal liability of the person concerned, but just compensation, so that the grievances of the victims of the snow are not really cleared and the prevention of torture is not effectively prevented”, stated the head of the CHRD study, Francis Eve.
“in particular, the victim's family has in fact been taken hostage and may be forced to stop demanding the truth of the incident by receiving compensation.”
Before Wang Meiyu, other Chinese defenders had experienced similar incidents, such as the death last July of Mr. Kisten, a root lawyer at the prison, and the death last year of a Uighur scholar, Mohamed Saleh Agui. In 2017, he was still serving a prison sentence.
According to CHRD, Wang Mi-yu’s family has been under house arrest since week after week. Wang Mi has two young children. Other people implicated in the case have also been pressured by the authorities.
In his early years, Wang Meiyu began his advocacy activities as a result of forced evictions; he had previously been detained by the police and claimed to have been tortured.
In 2018, following a call for Xi Jinping to step down, he sent information via the Internet that police officers had stormed his home and ordered him to write a letter of remorse and a warrant to stop such activities.
"These idiots, they don't want to think about how they tortured me all these years, even three days and three nights without water, two hours with electric needles, causing me to spit blood out of my mouth, and I won't give in."
The owner of a pet who doesn't walk a dog will face a $2,700 fine.
If the owner is unable to provide basic supplies such as shelter, food, and water, they will face a huge on-the-spot fine.
The zone was the first jurisdiction in Australia to recognize animal sensory capabilities.
“Modern animal welfare is concerned with how animals respond mentally and physically to their environment.” Chris Steele, Minister of Urban Services of the Action Party, was also an advocate of the bill, and stated at a press conference.
Hong Kong Police report an increase in the number of students arrested during protests
Last Friday, the Hong Kong police indicated that 1,600 people had been detained in anti-democratic protests since June, with 29 per cent of students, and that the police had urged young people on the weekends to take the right approach when planning larger gatherings.
According to Inspector General Xie Zhen of the Police Public Relations Section, 207 high school students and university students were detained this month alone, as compared to 257 persons arrested between 6 and 8 months, despite the resumption of classes after the summer vacation.
Xie Zhen said that there had been an increase in the number of juveniles involved in violent crimes, some of whom had already been charged in court. These included a 16-year-old recently charged with arson, who, if convicted, could be sentenced to life imprisonment; a 13-year-old girl accused of blasphemy of the Chinese flag; and others who attacked the police and carried dangerous weapons.
“Foreigns are worrying,” he said at the press conference, “It is worrying to see these young people breaking the law at this young age and possibly having a criminal record. We call on all young people to reflect on their behaviour and hope that the education sector and parents will help our young people to regulate their behaviour.”
Since June, young people have mainly protested the extradition bill, and the government has now agreed to withdraw it. But since then, the protest has attracted more participants, turning into a larger campaign against the Chinese government, which, according to protesters, is quietly interfering with Hong Kong’s autonomy; Hong Kong was once British.
Protesters expanded their demands, including by directly electing Hong Kong leaders and independently investigating alleged police brutality against protesters.
On Friday night, thousands of people peacefully protested in the city’s central square, alleging abuse of power by the police, waving anti-police slogans and chanting democratic slogans. The Hong Kong government stated that complaints against the police would be investigated by a police oversight body which, according to critics, had no real powers and no real powers of investigation.
The police authorized the Citizens’ Human Rights Front to organize a major rally in downtown Hong Kong on Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of the Umbrella Campaign, which ended without any concessions from the government during which the protesters occupied the main streets of Hong Kong for 79 days in 2014.
On Sunday, protesters will also organize “antipocratic” rallies in Hong Kong and many cities around the world against the tyranny of China, which they condemn.
He called on protesters to stop manipulating peaceful protests, as they had done before, such as throwing gasoline bombs, causing street fires and damage to public facilities. The police used tear gas, high-pressure water guns and other measures against the protesters, leading them to complain about the excessive use of force.
The Citizens’ Front for Human Rights also plans to hold another large march on October 1, and there are fears that this bloody duel might embarrass the ruling Communist Party of China, which is hosting a major event in Beijing to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
After the herbicide panic, Nestlé strengthened the control of coffee beans.
In a statement on Friday, the largest coffee company in the world stated that it had found residues of glyphosate close to the maximum residue of glyphosate in some green coffee bean products.
In the United States, the jury has found that those who claim that their cancer was caused by exposure to herbal glycol. Monsanto’s owner Bayer said that the herbicide was safe as long as it was properly used, as did the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
The Newman Coffee Group, one of the world’s largest traders, said that herbal glyphosate was one of the substances monitored in its purchases of coffee. Nestlé bought some coffee beans from the Newman Coffee Group. It was too early to predict the impact of Nestlé’s tight policies on the Newman Coffee Group, as the speaker said.
Nestlé's decision to increase the frequency of inspections has little impact on the global coffee supply chain, as the speaker said. “This is not a new process, we're just tightening controls.” The speaker told CNN commercial channels. Coffee is tested before it comes from the country of origin.
Nestlé will be implemented from suppliers in the world ' s largest coffee-producing countries, such as Indonesia and Brazil.
“Our agrologists will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve weed management practices, including the appropriate use of herbicides and other methods of weeding, as stated by the Swiss company”.
In Nestlé's pink and liquid beverage business, the brands Nestlé coffee and Nespizo account for a significant share, selling 216 billion Swiss francs (approximately $21.7 billion) in 2018. Nestlé agreed to sell Starbucks bags on a global scale last year.
Does herb glyphosate cause cancer?
According to EPA, 100 glyphosate is used in many food crop cultivations. Scientists from environmental organizations in the organic food industry say that some popular cereals contain more chemicals than they consider to be safe for children.
Nevertheless, the EPA claims that glyphosate is not a carcinogen and does not pose a risk to public health. In a April statement, the EPA stated that ecological risks include hazards caused by pollinating insects and weed resistance.
This did not prevent thousands of people from filing complaints against Monsanto, who claimed that they or their relatives were suffering from cancer as a result of their contact with the Nanda.
Earlier this year, a jury awarded Bayer $2 billion in damages to a California couple who claimed that they had spent more than 30 years in their property and that they had diagnosed non-Hoochkin lymphoma within four years. Bayer is appealing the decision.
A 2015 study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization found that, on the basis of “limited” evidence of human carcinogenicity and “adequate” experimental evidence of carcinogenicity in animals, glyphosone was “probably carcinogenic to humans.” However, a joint group of WHO and FAO subsequently concluded that glyphosate causes cancer through diet.
A man killed his ex-wife in Texas and six family members were sentenced.
A Utah man was convicted on Thursday of killing six members of his former wife ' s family in Texas and may face a death sentence.
The Harris County jury found that 39-year-old Ronald Haskell was found guilty of the murder of six members of the Star family in July 2014: his parents Stephen Star and Katie Star, 13-year-old Brian, 9-year-old Emily,
In a statement, the District Attorney of Harris County, Kim Og, said: “We thank the jurors for their attention to every piece of evidence in the case over the past few weeks.” “There is no doubt that Haskell has carefully planned and carried out the massacre of the Star family”.
According to the police, Haskell travelled from California to Spring, a suburb of Houston, ambushing his ex-wife ' s sister, brother-in-law and five children at home.
Mr. and Mrs. Star and four of their children were shot in the back of the head, and the fifth child was 15 years old and survived. Casidi, a teenager, was shot in the head and escaped.
The prosecutor requested the death penalty for his murder, but the jury would decide whether Haskell should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.
According to the National Broadcasting Corporation in Houston, during the trial, the defence argued that Haskell was mentally disturbed and heard voices that had him kill the six people. After reading the verdict on Thursday, he fell down.
According to television, one of Haskell's defence lawyers, G. Dalem, said: “I think that he could be severely punished, as everyone expected.” “He realized that this was the most likely result”.
The sentencing process starts on Monday. As Haskell's defense attorney Neil Davis III says, his team will try to “save him from dying.” This is our job, as reported by KPRC.
According to television, the sentencing process is expected to continue for about two and a half weeks.
Cassidy testified at the trial and was present with her family. According to KPC, she seemed to be praying before the verdict was read on Thursday.
At a memorial service for families in 2014, Cassidy thanked all sectors of society for their support and said that her parents, two brothers and two sisters “are glad to see them again one day in heaven”.
Haskell went to Star's house disguised as a Federal Express driver and apparently went to his ex-wife, Katie Star's sister.
The police said that he had forcibly entered and tied Cassidy. A few minutes later, when her family returned, Haskell tied them up and asked for information on the whereabouts of her ex-wife. They said they did not know that they had all been shot in the back of the head.
Cassidy was injured and kept pretending to be dead until Haskell left and was able to identify him to the police. She told the police that he was planning to drive to her grandparents' house to kill them. But the police traced to Haskell, after 20 minutes of police pursuit and 3 hours of right.
In view of the death rate in the United States, Scotland has banned fogging products and electronic tobacco advertising.
Ministers are considering banning advertising for electronic smoke and fogic products.
The Chief Minister has confirmed that consultations on this initiative will take place “in the coming months”.
Nicolas Sterkin stated that her Government would act “without hesitation” if there was evidence to support further action against the sale of such products.
At the same time, there were reports that two more deaths were caused by diseases associated with fogging products, resulting in 11 more deaths.
Fogization products (a mixture of nicotine, water, solvents and spices for consumption) are considered as substitutes for smoking and can help to quit smoking, but their safety is not yet fully determined.
But in the United States, more than 500 people have developed a mysterious lung disease as a result of e-smoking. Officials say that hundreds of new cases have been reported in the past week alone.
On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the first cases of death were announced in Florida and Georgia. Currently, 38 states have recorded cases of this disease, 8 of which have cases of death.
Although most patients reported the use of products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (a psychoactive compound in cannabis), those who died in Georgia on Wednesday were reported to have only “absorbed in large quantities of aerosol products”.
More than 100 officials in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating the causes of this mysterious disease and warning the public not to smoke electronic smoke products, especially those purchased on the “street” or “street” grounds, until more information is available.
The Chief Minister confirmed that the Scottish Government was monitoring developments in the United States and elsewhere “closely” in the wake of the death caused by the mist products.
She noted that, to date, they had not seen any reports of deaths due to fogging products in Europe.
She said, “We are cautious, so in Scotland we have adopted the strictest regulatory approach to fogized products in Europe.”
“The European Tobacco Products Directive restricts advertising of electronic cigarettes and ensures that electronic liquids do not contain known hazardous ingredients.
“The Directive also limits the concentration of nicotine in electronic smoke.
“In Scotland, we have also introduced retail registration and mandatory age certification schemes and have funded trade standards departments in all parliamentary regions to ensure that retailers comply.
“In the coming months, we will consult on a comprehensive ban on advertising and promotion of fogized products.”
She added: “It is important to stress that we all have to remember that these devices are relatively new products, so we have to continue to study their impact. We do not fully understand what that effect is, so be very cautious.
“This may be one of the reasons why e-smoking is not popular in Scotland.
“We continue to take all necessary steps, on the basis of the best evidence, to ensure that potential harm to human beings is avoided.
“Although we have put in place the strictest regulatory regime for these products, we will not hesitate to do so if there is evidence of the need for further action.”
Cambodian courts accused exiled politicians of rebellion.
A Cambodian court accused seven senior opposition party leaders of planning an armed rebellion, who planned to end their own exile and seek regime change through large-scale peaceful protests.
The Phnom Penh Municipal Court also warned that anyone who supported the Cambodian opposition party ' s plan to overthrow the Government would run the risk of long-term imprisonment.
If convicted, opposition leaders who end their exile and return home may be sentenced to between 15 and 30 years’ imprisonment, and their supporters may be sentenced to between 5 and 10 years’ imprisonment. Citing Justice Minister Qin Marin: Even participating in a rally or expressing support online may be considered as conspiring to overthrow the government.
This political struggle has intensified since opposition leader Sanlancie announced his plans to return to his country after more than three years of exile on November 9 in search of a “restoration of democracy”, and Thursday's court accused him of launching the latest round of political struggle.
On 9 November, the day of Cambodia ' s independence, Cambodia emerged from French colonial rule in 1953.
“I will continue to call upon the Cambodian people and armed forces to oppose the Hun Sen regime until the Hun Sen regime restores the right of the opposition to participate in the political life of the country, including genuine elections”, Sanlanci said on Twitter earlier this week.
Last year, prior to the general elections, the court dissolved the opposition party in Sananxi to ensure that Hun Sen-Sun would continue with a more authoritarian regime for 40 years.
The opposition party intended to launch a strong electoral challenge in July 2018, which was widely perceived as politically motivated, and the ruling Cambodian People ' s Party, led by Hun Sen, feared that it would lose power in the elections.
The Hun Sen Government seemed troubled by the planned return of the leader of the opposition party, although the practice seemed unrealistic, and Sananxi called for a large number of Cambodian workers in Thailand to return with him.
Officials vowed to arrest Sananxi as soon as he arrived in Cambodia, but there are also speculations that Cambodia may simply prevent Sananzi from entering the country, and that Sananxi may be barred from boarding a plane to Cambodia if the airline is officially informed of the ban. A neighbouring country is unlikely to allow Sananxi to enter Cambodia from their territory.
However, the Government has stepped up the arrest of supporters of Sananxi, and there have been reports of recent physical attacks against opposition organizers.
At the end of 2015, Sanlancie was sentenced to two years in prison for criminal libel, and in order to avoid imprisonment, he went into exile. After that, the local government initiated other judicial proceedings against Sanlancie.
In late 2017, in a crackdown on all opposition to the Hun Sen regime, the co-founder of the opposition party, Gensoka, was arrested, and other high-ranking members of the party were exiled. Genssoka was charged with treason for establishing ties with a pro-democracy organization in the United States and is currently under strict house arrest.
This year's Turner Prizes will be shown in Margate from tomorrow, and the British deo will be on the agenda.
Oscar Murillo, a Colombian artist, paints a picture of people looking at the North Sea, but their vision of the North Sea and the continent across Europe is covered by a black canvas, showing only a small fraction of the distance through a slant on the canvas.
This work is one of four feature works, an annual art award established in 1984 for artists born in the United Kingdom or the United Kingdom but living elsewhere.
The presenter, Fio Naperi, explained that Murillo’s work focused on the current political and socio-economic situation in the United Kingdom. This group of paper-film people represents the globalized labour force, while the black cloth represents “the dark moments of the British and even the global age”.
She added, "I think it's a broader way of covering the horizon, but it's actually covering the horizons of any distance. There's also the position of blocking the light. But I think there's still hope, there's a slash on the canvas, and you can see the sea on the horizon."
At the same time, Helen Kammock’s video, A Long Note, explores the role of women that was neglected in the civil rights movement in Delhi/London, Northern Ireland, which began in 1968. It also addresses the broader global class, race, and gender struggles of the late 1960’s.
All the works will be displayed from September 28th to January 12th, 2020 at the Turner Contemporary Gallery in Magatet, and the 2019 Turner Laureate will be announced at the awards ceremony on December 3rd.
The award was named after Joseph Maraud William Turner, a British 19th-century viewer, and was celebrated by Grayson Perry, Damien Hearst and Steve McQueen, director of " Twelve Years of Slavery " .
Men confess details of kidnapping and torture of plastic surgeons
A man in Florida confessed to kidnapping a plastic surgeon and ill-treated him with a blowtorch in extortion.
According to the Sun Sentry, 34-year-old Justin Bosio confessed on Thursday to the January attack on a surgeon whose identity has not yet been made public.
The lawyer for Bocio, Kenneth Lange, stated that his client had been involved in the abduction at the instigation of his co-accused, Serge Corina, who was to be extradited from Tenerife Island, Spain.
According to the court documents, the surgeon was abducted and pushed into the van by a man armed when he left Wal-Mart's store. After several hours of torture, he went back to his car and became unconscious. The surveillance video took a picture of the incident. The investigator said that Corinne's wife was in a coma.
For the second time, the British Parliament refused to hold an early general election.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was again frustrated in pushing for early elections in the United Kingdom.
The Speaker of the House of Commons stated that, under current regulations, it was not possible to vote before 31 October (the date of the planned withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union).
This is the second time that Parliament has been convened since the Supreme Court ruled that the suspension of the general elections was unlawful.
At the same time, the EU chief negotiator, Michael Barnier, stated that the EU was still awaiting a new plan from the British side.
The United States sent troops to Saudi Arabia and deployed anti-aircraft systems to stop Iranian attacks
United States officials announced on Thursday that the United States was sending a patriot missile unit, four ground radar systems and 200 support units to Saudi Arabia to contain Iran ' s increasingly aggressive actions.
The Pentagon said that one Sad missile defence system and two other Patriot missile units were ready if required.
“The other countries of the region have called attention to the situation in Iran, and we hope that they will contribute to international cooperation to strengthen Saudi Arabia's defence forces”, said Jonathan Hoffmann, spokesperson for the Pentagon.
Last week, the United States Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, stated that more troops would be deployed to the Middle East as a “defence” measure to help defend against attacks emanating from Iran.
Esper said that the deployment was a first step towards addressing Iran's growing violence in the region, including this month's drone strikes on Saudi Arabian oil installations, and he called on other countries to intensify their actions to condemn those attacks.
The Iranian-backed Yemeni Al-Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the 14 September attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant and an important oil field, but the United States and Saudi Arabia directly condemned Iran. Iran denied any involvement in the attack.
“It is clear that the weapons used were produced by Iran and were not fired from Yemen”, Esper said on Friday that all indications indicated that “Iran was responsible for the attack”.
The purpose of deploying troops and resources is “to send a clear message that the United States supports our partners” and to provide “free flow of resources,” Esper said.
The Secretary of State said that the United States called on other countries to also “stand up and condemn the attacks” and to contribute.
Megan Marker's “never invited” to go back to "Golden Bar."
Alan Korse, the founder of the Golden Bar, said that she had “never invited” the Duchess of Sussex, the Duchess of Sussex, Megan Marker, to return to the play, and that in the great end, Rachel Zane had been a part of the story.
In an interview with the United States news front in Hollywood, after the grand ending of Golden Hatting, Korse was asked whether it was “possibly possible” to invite the former resident actor to “accompanies” in the grand ending.
"Now that we're done with the big ending, I can tell you," said Korse.
“I thought about inviting her, and I thought about using audio material, which we have to think about, but I did not say anything at the end because I thought, “I want to respect her new life and not put her in a position where she has to be invited”.
“We decided not to put her in that position, so I never spoke.”
The Grand Duchess of Sussex appeared in Montacci's image at the end of the Golden Bar.
From 2011, Megan played Rachel Zane in this New York-based political play until the last episode of her performance last year.
In her final season, Rachel's screen husband, Mike Ross, visited her from Seattle and was asked how she was.
"If I told you how well she was, you might not believe me," he said.
The Beet Bulldog died of a snake bite to protect a Florida boy.
A man in Florida claimed that eight months old the Beat Bulldog Zeus had been bitten to death by a snake in order to protect several of his sons.
Gary Richardson told WOFL TV that his family lived in Samt County, Florida, and that on Monday, when several of his sons were cleaning Zeus' plates outside the house, a toxic coral snake crawled over them. Richardson said the kids didn't see any snakes, but the dogs saw them, and they did.
According to Richardson, snakes bite Zeus four times. Although Zeus was sent to the veterinarians at the speed of fire, he died the day after the attack.
Signal cases of West Nile virus reported in Germany
Authorities reported that the first case of a West Nile virus transmitted through mosquitoes occurred in Germany and that climate change had apparently accelerated the spread of the virus.
The German National Center for Disease Control and Tropical Medicine indicated on Friday that the patient had developed encephalitis, but had recovered from treatment at the hospital.
The West Nile virus originated in Africa, but was transmitted northward through migratory birds and mosquitoes. In recent years, there have been several outbreaks in southern and central Europe.
Jonas Schmitt Chanassit of the Bernhard Nokt Institute of Tropical Medicine, Germany, stated: “According to climate change, summer fever has clearly accelerated the spread of the West Nile virus in the north of the Alps over the past two years”.
Less than 1 percent of the people infected with the virus are exposed to dangerous meningitis or encephalitis.
After prostate cancer surgery, he skips radiation therapy. He's doing well.
A major study found that men undergoing prostate cancer surgery were in good condition without radiation treatment.
The examination of patients undergoing surgical treatment, the largest experiment to date, could save thousands of patients from treatment that could also have painful side effects.
The Royal Masden Hospital conducted a study of 1,400 men who received prostate cancer treatment.
Half of these patients have received immediate radiotherapy, which has been the standard treatment for preventing the recurrence of the disease to date. The remaining patients are monitored for radiotherapy only when there are signs of a recurrence.
Five years later, scientists found that there was little difference in the rate of relapse between the two groups of patients and that the situation of those who did not receive radiotherapy was slightly better.
The survival rate is 85 per cent in the physiotherapy group and 88 per cent in the standard care group.
The data were adjusted to take into account other factors, with a difference of about 1 per cent between the two groups.
This study, funded by the British Cancer Research Centre, found that urinary incontinence is twice as likely to deteriorate for patients receiving radiation treatment as for patients without radiation treatment, and that urinary incontinence is one of the main side effects of prostate cancer treatment.
In the year following the operation, 5.3 per cent of patients receiving radiation treatment suffered from a worsening condition, compared to 2.7 per cent of those receiving standard care.
The radio claimed that Seth Dunlap, the WWL radio host in Louisiana, threatened to sue for anti-homosexual tweets, but the tweets were sent by him, as in the case of Josie Smolit.
A radio host in New Orleans said he had received an anti-gay slander tweet from the station's Twitter account. The WWL host, Seth Dunlap, was an open homosexual who said on Wednesday that he intended to sue the radio parent company because for many years he had been in a gay and hostile relationship.
The controversial tweet was sent in early this month, and on the day that it was sent, Danrap also conducted his own programme as usual. According to the WWL-TV report of the Colombian Broadcasting Corporation, the day after the tweet was sent, he announced his leave.
In a statement, Danlap stated that 14 people had access to the WWL Twitter account. He claimed that he was not the only one using the account.
And his lawyer, Megan Kiefer, said that he had decided to take part in the polygraph, thus dispelling the speculation that he was the promoter himself. According to WWL-TV, Danlap had not filed a suit, but in his statement he said he would proceed soon.
WWL Radio, which is part of the Colombian Broadcasting Corporation news station, but which disseminates it, stated in a statement that it had opened an investigation into the tweet and decided to refer the matter to law enforcement officials.
“We believe that the most appropriate next step is to leave it to the law enforcement authorities. The current investigation is being carried out by the law enforcement authorities, and we cannot comment more on the particulars of the results of the investigation.” WWL said so in its statement.
Their investigation of the tweet was made public by the New Orleans police station, and in Thursday ' s police report, the story turned: the pseudo-defamatory tweet was allegedly sent from a private cell phone in Dunlap.
The radio host, Seth Danlap, once said that he had worked in a horrifying and hostile environment for many years. After he claimed to have received counter-defamatory tweets from the radio Twitter account, he threatened to prosecute.
According to NOLA.com, the WWL accuses Danlap of threatening the radio solely for money. WWL alleges that the 35-year-old radio director said he'd follow up on the tweets and then demanded over $1.8 million in compensation. According to NOLA.com
The police are still trying to confirm the charges, but have classified the case as potentially extortionary. Louisiana defines extortion as “a threatening message to others for the purpose of obtaining anything of value”.
Viola Davis plays Michelle Obama in First Lady.
Viola Davis said that she was “strained” by the role of Michelle Obama in the latest television series.
This 54-year-old actress at the Jimmy Chicken Show on Thursday talked about her role as Michelle Obama in the First Lady of the American Television series!
Davis said she had met Michelle Obama, but wondered if the former First Lady knew that she was playing that role.
"I'm nervous. I'm very nervous." Davis says, "I don't care what else I've done in my life -- I've got the Emmy, the Oscars, twice the Tonys -- but if I screw up this time, it's gonna be huge."
In the form of a joke, she said, "Like, "You raised a really great child, but you fucked up Michelle Obama."
Davis says, however, that she has confidence in the script of Aaron Couli. Davis and Couli will also be the executive producers of the show.
“I promise, this script is great,” Davis says, “Listen, I don't want to drive my people crazy.”
In First Ladies, we will look at the political and personal life of the first husband in American history. The first quarter will focus on Eleanor Roosevelt, Betty Ford and Michelle Obama.
In addition to the First Lady, Davis will be reunited with Denzel Washington in a web-drawn version of "Rani's Mother's Black Ass Dance " , with Danzer Watson, who co-hosts " Out of Adversity " and " Fence " .
"I had to wear a big suit," Davis said to the moderator, "I love this suit. I told them I wanted to be very, very big. I wanted to look mature."
Davis played the role of Analis Keating in the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) series " Impunity " , the first and last season of which began on Thursday.
Death of Mike Miller: a third man charged with drug trafficking
A third man has been arrested and charged with drug trafficking, linked to the death of a rapper, Mike Miller, who took overdoses.
Steven Walter is suspected of selling fake oxycodone tablets with fentanyl, who were in possession of fentanyl until his death last year as a result of overdoses of cocaine, alcohol and powerful opioids.
Walter was accused of being the source of medicines for another man, Cameron Petit, who had sold them to Miller.
36-year-old Ryan Reves, arrested this week in the city of Lake Havasu, Arizona, accused of being Walter's “legged man”, who handed over his medication to Petit.
Walter was released from custody for a drug case in 2005 and is currently in detention.
Miller, a Pittsburgh man whose real name is Malcolm James Myers McCormick, openly discussed his depression and drug addiction in his lyrics, winning some of the big fans of hip-hop.
His two-year relationship with Eleanor Grande also ended at the beginning of 2018. After Miller's death, she posted on her photo wall page a video that was full of love and a song, "Thank you, next," full of Miller.
In recent years, Miller has been one of the musicians who have died of opioid drug abuse and overdose throughout the country.
Prince died in 2016, when he took counterfeit drugs containing fentanyl, which looked like a copy of the painkiller Vicodin.
In 2016, Matthew Roberts, the guitarist of the three fallback bands, also died of an overdose, containing fentanyl and hydrogencodone in his body.
Females don't hang around Wal-Mart to prove their innocence.
In a Wal-Mart supermarket in Mexico City, a woman accused of shoplifting used extreme means to prove her innocence and stood in the supermarket naked and made supermarket security stunned.
Earlier this week, Mexico City's Tepayac Wal-Mart store took pictures of a supermarket security guard heading towards the woman suspected of theft, who was approaching the supermarket exit. However, when she was stopped, her reaction left the security guard speechless.
The woman first took off her dress and then started to exit, but she may still feel sorry for herself and quickly turned around and took off her shirt. She took off her shirt and left the supermarket with her hand in her hand.
The identity of the naked shopper is still unknown, but it appears that after the improvisation of the strip show, the shopkeeper allowed her to leave the shop.
Wal-Mart's weird news of this kind. In July, at a Wal-Mart supermarket in Simephrin, a woman from Pennsylvania was caught on camera firing a potato box. The woman in this video was clearly drunk, and she was.
This week, an Englishman, Steve Whitehurst, was forced to appear naked at the supermarket, and he had to expose himself to security because he found an unknown “bulb” on his pants. He did not steal anything.
“I was born and I had no choice,” Whitehurst told The Sun.
The Government of the State of West Bengal plans to establish a museum at the residence of Iswa Chandra Vidiasaga.
Kolkata:
The West Bengal government plans to set up a museum in the old settlement of North Kolkata, 19th century social reformer Iswa Chandra Vidiasaga, where he spent the last few years of his life, as State Minister Pata Chatage said.
On Thursday, he said that the museum would be built on the premises of Vidia Saga in Badur Bagan, and would exhibit photographs and models documenting Vidia Saga's life, from the village of Bir Singhpur, in the Paschim Medipur district, to the village of Gar.
In celebration of the 200th anniversary of this educational and social reformer, Chatage, who is the Minister of Education, said this at an event following the inauguration of the Vidiasaga School at Badurbagan residence.
The Minister also published two books at the event: Amed Vidiasaga and Chotod Vidiasaga.
Some items used in Vidiasaga will be removed from dusty storage rooms and placed in museums for public access.
He said that it would help the current generation to understand the celebrity, who had waged a war against the oppression of women and encouraged widows to remarry.
Mr. Chatje said that the Ministry of School Education and Higher Education would organize seminars during a year-long event focusing on the life and work of Vidiasaga in schools and colleges.
Citing other activities to be carried out by the Academy, Mr. Chatage said that a book on Vidiasaga, hitherto unknown, would be published.
The Chief Minister, Mamata Banaki, recently announced that Vidiasaga would be established as an educational tourism centre at the birthplace of the village of Birsinghapur.
On Thursday, Vidiasaga College set up the Vidiasaga bronze statue.
“Those who oppose the social transformation of Vidia Saaga have destroyed their semi-vessel, which stands in a college named after them,” the Minister said.
In May, during a road show by the Chairman of the Indian People ' s Party, Amit Shah, the image of the social reformer was destroyed.

The report published by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 26 June indicated that Iran had begun to use advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, in further violation of the nuclear agreement reached with the world ' s major Powers in 2015.
According to a comprehensive external report, the IAEA report states that the advanced centrifuges at Iran's Natanz Nuclear Facility are “accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium”.
Since United States President Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement last May and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the 2015 nuclear agreement with the major Powers.
The agreement provided that Iran could use only the first generation of IR-1 centrifuges to refine uranium.
The other signatories to the agreement, the United Kingdom, China, France, Germany and Russia, had been trying to salvage it, but Tehran had repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
According to the Japan Common News Agency, in the afternoon of 25 local time, Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs Shigeki held a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York, where he visited, confirming that he would move forward to include the four islands of the North (the Russian-Russian disputed island, known as “the four islands of the North”, and the Russians as “the South Kiloshima Islands”.

Maori said to the Russian side, “including the promotion of joint economic activities (on the northern islands) in the hope of effective consultation.”
According to the Government of Japan, the talks did not discuss the Territory in detail.
At the Russian summit meeting in December 2018, it was confirmed that the Foreign Ministers of the two countries, in their capacity as heads of State, should expedite the negotiations.
At that meeting, the Foreign Ministers of the two countries welcomed the progress made in the consultations on joint economic activities in the areas of tourism and waste disposal.
Shigeki expressed the expectation that the tourism pilot operation, scheduled for October, would “hope to be successfully implemented, leading to the next step”.

The women's platoon is expected to champion the World Cup ahead of time!
On 27 September, in a competition against the Dutch women's platoon, the Chinese team was brought back to the city by the opponent after winning two games in a row, culminating in a victory of three to one in the Netherlands.
The World Cup is nearing its end, but the Chinese women's platoon must not be taken lightly in the face of the Serbian team.
In the first two rounds of the competition with the Netherlands, the Chinese women ' s platoons were as strong as ever, falling down at 25:19, 25:16, until the third round, when the team suffered a setback.
The Dutch women ' s ranks have increased the aggressiveness of their serve while falling behind, and the Chinese team has been hit, and the girls ' aggressive intentions and failures have begun to increase, leading to their return to a city with their rivals at 21:25.
In an interview with Xijiang Ping, he also pointed out: “The third round, we sent about eight points because of a mistake.”
Of course, the Dutch women's platoons were not too bad, and the Chinese women's platoons were too hard to prepare for before the race, and although they lost a game, everything was still in Luang Ping's hands: “It's normal to win a fight with a strong team, it's normal to win a fight, it's normal to play five, so we said to the team,
In the fourth round, the players actively adjusted their positions, Zhang Changning opened fire at the attack and received eight points in the single round, giving the team a great deal of credit.
So far, the 11 rounds of confrontation have left only two rounds, and while one hand has touched the championship, it is true that in the competition against the Dutch team, the Chinese women were alerted: the more critical the moment, the harder the effort will be.
In another game, on 27, the Russian and American women's rows were filled with five rounds, and the United States team was not able to score all three points from their opponents, so that the Chinese women's platoon could be crowned in one round ahead of the battle against Serbia.
All things are moving towards a situation favourable to the Chinese women ' s platoon.
However, while the Serbian team has lost all its strength, this does not mean that they would easily send three points to the Chinese team.
In the current form of the scoreboard, the Serbian team has largely lost its medals, which means that they can “be light” in the competition against Chinese women in order to put down their loads and hit their opponents with full force, while the Chinese team is under pressure to win, and the situation is likely to rise and fall.
In addition, the replacement Serbian team was not a “sculpted” lamb, as evidenced by the depth of its thickness, as evidenced by the fact that in the five rounds of the war with the Netherlands, the Serbian 2nd team eventually reversed the Dutch all-power stance at 3:2.
Before the third stage of the game, Luang Ping also said that both teams would be tough: “The match in Osaka will be very difficult, and we have to prepare carefully, as we have always done.”
Now that the horn of the crown has been blown, the game has really entered the “white heat stage”.
In terms of strength, the Chinese women's platoon is above the rivals, but it is only the last moment of importance, and it is up to the girls to be able to play their normal role in releasing themselves from the playing field.
On this (27) day, the University of Macao organized the “Second Macao stem cell seminar”, which attracted more than 100 experts from the United States, Singapore, the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao in the field of “extremist stem cell” research, sharing and exploring the latest technologies and developments in stem cell research with students and teachers at the University of Macao.

On September 24, a boat ticket took me to the Longsand Orange Head, where more than 100 disabled people from Changsa were invited to the Orange Star cruise to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
Most of the more than 100 persons with disabilities who attended the event were boarded for the first time on a cruise ship.
Zhao Zhengung, 56 years old, is a crippled person and usually rarely leaves the home due to mobility problems on both his feet.
He said, “For the first time today, on a cruise ship, he was close to the vast waves of the Gang, feeling the development pulse of Changsha, very excited and unforgettable.”
Volunteers from the Fukuon Social Work Centre and the Blue Sky Rescue Team in Changsha City provided sophisticated services to persons with disabilities.
Specially for clients with severe physical disabilities, volunteers carry them up and down the liner.
According to the head of the Fukuoka Social Work Centre, over the past 70 years the cause of persons with disabilities in Changsha City has continued to progress with the support of the party and the Government, with an increasing number of persons with disabilities becoming real participants, contributors and beneficiaries of socio-economic development.
The Republic is about to celebrate its seventieth anniversary, and the spotlights of the media on all roads are glittering and glowing, and it's them who bring heat and light to our bright days, silk glitters...
However, if a hero walks around, it looks like you're just like me.
Yuan Yongping, in his study of deep-seated rice, has brought forth good seeds to feed the world, leaving billions of people at risk of hunger. It's not worth it. It's also like an old farmer who likes to be in the fields. Nan In-dong, a fine man.
And those who seek to be pure, pure and committed, so long as they are immersed in a cause in which the outsiders do not understand and which they cherish, it is easy for them to rejoice, not to think of a name, and to be rich and prosperous.
As in the golden novel, the temple of Shaolin hides the razed monk of the Cabinet, despite the horrors of martial arts and the lack of flair and joy.
Every Monk, every son of a bitch, has a share of his country that belongs to me.
Our country assumes responsibility not only on the shoulders of heroes but also in the hands of hundreds of millions of people.
Once upon a time, a girl in high school went crazy by the Internet, "When a hero passes, someone has to sit on the side of the road and applaud... and I don't want to be a hero, I want to be a guy sitting on the side of the road."
In fact, there is no contradiction between being a hero and being a hero.
People who applaud on the side of the road are also passing heat and light and are also glowing.
Just as you are me, there are opportunities in life, and there are moments, and there is a build-up of heroes.
Shanghai's excellent judge, Zou Beihua, who is responsible for judicial reform, has put on stage his own story at the annual conference, sent and sent numerous newspaper letters a year, never wrong, "Better to do the simple thing, it's not easy," and he led the judges.
It's between heroes. It's a hero who applauds another hero.
Shaolin temples are hidden, Yuan Long Ping has a vast rice field, Nan Indong has the Eye of Heaven, Qin Yi has the stage, Zhou Chang has the platform to be a hero, not only on his own, but also on a better environment.
China SkyEye, for example, is now a myth.
In the 1990s, the Chinese scientific and technological community was still struggling to climb the slopes, and the novelist Liu Tse Xin has yet to write " Three Bodies " .
The best “eye” at that time, the single-gauge radio telescope in the valley of Puerto Rico Island – Arecibo, 350 meters in diameter – was considered to be the largest in a world “unbeyond.”
At that time, the Chinese radio telescope was less than one tenth in diameter.
But Nan In-dong, who enjoys world-class scientific conditions and salaries in Japan, insists on returning home, bringing back an almost insane idea: building a new generation of radio “big telescopes” in China to receive more messages from outer space.
China's got a lot of money to play with stars?
The motherland trusted Nan In-dong, and the "Eye of Heaven" project began.
It took 12 years to select the site and nine years to set it.
The 500-metre “Eye of Heaven” opened, and China became an unprecedented “unique scientific engineering in the world”.
So, the Eye of Heaven is remarkable, the South In-dongs are remarkable, and the Republic, which has great tolerance and greatness, is remarkable.
With the trust of the State and the goodwill of its citizens, the South In-dongs have the opportunity to become the people of the nation.
A country with young talent, white-haired heroes who walk by, and people who applaud lightly on the side of the road, is beautiful and harmonious.
Garbage classification education begins at Gilling's kindergarten, and the idea of environmental protection begins with a doll.
On 27 September, a kindergarten in Gilling City, Jilin Province, introduced a garbage classification education course to teach young children how to identify recyclable waste and other types of waste.
This is known to be the first time that garbage is classified into local early childhood education classes.
A programme of work for the promotion of the classification of waste in urban life at the local level in Jilin province was launched jointly by nine departments in Jilin province.
In 2019, on the basis of the pilot compulsory classification of household waste in Changchun City, the province decided to carry out the classification of household waste in local cities.
Gilling City is one of them.
Through this event, we hope to achieve the role of a young child as a family, a kindergarten as a social enabler and an environmentalist.
The executive director of the Fong Children ' s International Kindergarten said that the event had been organized.
On the same day, the Director read out an environmental initiative, hoping that garbage would be sorted from the children.
After performing the " Low Carbon Babe " dance, the children grouped themselves into a little game of garbage sorting.
The tutor also issued the " Recoverable " " " Other Garbage " label and advised the children to stick the label on the trash bin and make small videos when they returned home.
Liu Lilong reported that the kindergarten has been promoting the concept of low-carbon, green and environmentally friendly, and has regularly opened environmental workshops.
Classifiable waste cans have also been installed at the dump site in the park, where the type of dropout is indicated.
Teacher taught the kids what recycling garbage is.
According to preliminary statistics, in 2018 in Jilin province, the amount of waste generated in urban areas amounted to some 54,652,000 tons, all of which went to the domestic waste disposal yard for disposal.
Of this total, 32.92 million tons were landfilled in sanitary conditions, 2,092 million tons were burned and 80.1 million tons were treated using integrated processes.
After many years of efforts, all municipalities and counties of the province have the capacity to treat household waste in a manner that is not harmful.
In the programme of work for the promotion of the classification of waste in urban areas at the local level in Jilin province, which has been published, there is a clear call for further activities such as the classification of waste in schools, textbooks, classrooms, and the promotion of interaction between students and parents through the creation of songs, songs, cartoons, micro-videos, etc.
According to data released on 27 September in Madda, global sales in August amounted to 117,015 vehicles.
Sales in China declined by 21 per cent as a result of the impact, inter alia, of the underinvestment of new vehicles and the reduction in prices.
In Japan, domestic sales fell by 6%, and there was limited demand for the last bus before the consumption tax increase in October.
In August, Majuta’s sales in China amounted to 17729.
In August 2018, it was also 13 per cent lower than in the previous year, and sales continued to decline.
China's dedicated main SUV “CX-4” sales decreased by 14%.
“CX-4” has been on the market for a long time since 2016, and the effect of new vehicles has declined.
Reductions in prices as a result of strategies to raise brand value from a long-term perspective are also known to have a significant impact on sales.
Madheda’s sales in the United States grew by 7 per cent on a year-on-year basis, reaching 27482 vehicles, which grew 14 months later.
In August, the vendor’s business days were one more day than in the previous year, combined with “enhancement of promotional activities such as publicity” (Majeda), which led to an increase in sales of SUV “CX-5” etc.
In Japan, domestic sales fell by 6 per cent to 14422.
According to the company, the emergency purchase before the tax increase was “not as high as in the previous case (2014)”.
The sales of cars such as "Demio" have been reduced.
The death of Chirac and the perpetuation of the political legacy.
On 26 local time, former French President Chirac died and was 86 years old.
At a time when the world is in the midst of a century of great change, the many political legacies left by the French politician when he came to power in that year are still worthy of our praise.
Chirac was President of France for 12 years in a very personal way.
He has inherited the diplomatic spirit of de Gaulle independence and steadfast support for European integration, representing the pursuit of the “European Dream”.
At the same time, he was a strategic statesman, a strong advocate of multipolarity and multilateralism in the world.
That is why the French media rate him as “a distinguished representative of France on the world stage”.
One of the promising political decisions of Chirac is to oppose the United States-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France, together with Germany, stood up to the pressure of the United States and was at the forefront of the war against it.
A year after the outbreak of the war, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to an increase in terrorist activity and make the world even more dangerous.
Later on, it proved that Chirac ' s warning was quite correct.
In a time of European integration and the growing prominence of the unilateralism of the United States, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices in international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly highly instructive.
Chirac is also a French politician who is familiar and friendly to the Chinese.
He was one of the protagonists and creators of the “Golden Decade” of Chinese-French relations, which, after his first election as President of France in 1995, was driven rapidly by the strategic vision of politicians.
In 2004, China established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and bilateral exchanges between China and China entered a completely new phase.
During the period of Chirac, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and cooperation between the two countries in various areas, such as aviation, nuclear energy and rail transport, has made ground-breaking progress.
The Meso-French Cultural Year of the Chirac Initiative has created a completely new model of cultural exchange in the history of China.
Chirac was particularly impressed with Chinese culture throughout his life.
It is known to his Chinese diplomats that Chirac is able to recite some of Li Bai's and Dupu's poems and even to judge accurately the history of China's bronze apparatus.
“Don’t look at the pyramids as if they were actually in Egypt or Qin as if they were in China” – this gold phrase comes from Chirac.
“The West is concerned about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth, and China's political status at the international level.
But I have confidence in China myself.
I believe that China is a country with a long history of civilization whose experience is sufficient to help it build ideas and values for harmonious development and to shoulder its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time.”
I also believe that the revival of China will bring new creative vitality to the world culture and enrich it.
The people have gone, but the political legacy and inspiration that Chirac left to the world will last forever.
The 7th China Computer Society Academic Conference on Big Data was inaugurated in Wuhan on the theme “Twilight Valley, For the Future”, and nearly 1,000 expert scholars and industry leaders in the field of big data research focused on the issue of big data hotspots and on the technical process of interpreting big data in the age of artificial intelligence.
The Congress was hosted by the Chinese Computer Society (CCF) and co-sponsored by the CCF Committee of Experts on Big Data and the Chinese University of Science and Technology. It organized 5 invited and 188 forum reports. It established 33 thematic technical and industry sub-forums around the big data base theory, big data education and big data visualization.
With the aim of strengthening contacts and exchanges between national and international scholars working in the field of big data and promoting multidisciplinary cross-integration and the development of the big data industry, seven sessions of the CDF Academic Conference on Big Data have evolved into one of the most influential in the country, mainly based on the exchange of scientific research results, which has been expanded to include such areas as basic theory and technology applications.
Members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region co-sponsored an anti-American Hong Kong bill.
In a joint statement issued on 27 July by some of the members of the Legislative Council of the HKSAR, a strong opposition was expressed to the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 by the Foreign Council of both Houses of Congress of the United States Congress.
This statement, co-sponsored by 40 formed members of Parliament, states that the rights currently enjoyed by Hong Kong are conferred by the Basic Law of the HKSAR, including the maintenance of the status of free trade ports and separate customs zones and the conduct of business with different countries and regions of the world in the different fields of economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports.
These rights are not exercised by any foreign Government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always been in strict compliance with international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, engaged in business with different countries and regions, and engaged in cooperation in a wide range of related fields.
The statement stated that it was not necessary for the United States Senate and the Foreign Affairs Committee to pass the bill in question, but rather to respond to the calls of its agents in Hong Kong, as a means of gross interference in Hong Kong ' s internal affairs and of securing political leverage for its agents in Hong Kong.
Formed parliamentarians expressed their deep regret that the United States would do so and strongly opposed it.
The statement noted that Hong Kong was an important trading partner and the largest source of trade surplus for the United States.
The good rule of law, a fair and free business environment and a clean society in Hong Kong make it a good place for American businessmen to run their business.
The adoption of the bill in the United States would, in addition to undermining the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself, further aggravate the relationship between China and the United States without any benefit or detriment to others.
The statement states that Hong Kong will remain committed to the principle of “one country, two systems” and will continue to enjoy the rights enshrined in the Basic Law and to fulfil its obligations effectively.
Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and to international commerce, whether in the past, the present or the future.
According to the 26th edition of the European Times, the two chambers of the French Parliament will discuss migration policy reform next week.
French President Markron recently claimed that France could not “take everyone” but at the same time try to “better accept” it.
It was reported that Markron had attempted to find a compromise route in immigration matters and to mitigate the impact of the upcoming debate.
In a recent interview in New York, United States, during the general debate of the General Assembly, Markron expressed the hope that there would be a genuine “two-pronged” approach to immigration policy that would strike a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Markron said, “If France wants to be properly admitted (immigrants), it will not be able to accept everyone”.
Markron identified four priorities for immigration policy: granting asylum to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; more efficient integration of migrants; reception and protection of all migrants entering French territory; and more efficient resettlement of those who entered France illegally and were not fit to stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the AME system has been the subject of much discussion in previous circles.
Markron indicated that he wished to be able to “assess” the system, but not to eliminate it, but to limit it to certain limits.
Following these statements by Markron, the extreme right-wing leader of the National Union, Le Pompas, stated that Markron had taken the position of “empty talk”.
Members of the right-wing Republican party, the President of the Senate, Rasher, also expressed the view that immigration policy should be discussed in a “moderated” but “counter-real” manner, indirectly criticizing Markron.
The leftist Socialist Congressman Valau argued that, in the case of immigration, France should “take more and better” and criticize Markron for “wiping” the subject.
Reports indicate that a new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act has been in place for one year and that it has led to differences of opinion within the ruling party, but at the same time it has not been possible to appease the right-wing opposition party.
In the next general election in 2022, the topic of immigration policy will again be the focus of an extreme right-wing attack, and Markron will need to make a difference on this issue, but at the same time he will run the risk of enraged left-wing elements within the ruling party.
It was reported that the lower house of the French National Assembly would start a debate on immigration policy on 30 September and the Senate on 2 October.
There are indications that China’s A shares are “backloading” and that many listed companies are buying back their shares with “real gold and silver”.
According to statistics on Eastern wealth of financial data service providers, in 2019 the total amount of repurchases by A-listed companies was more than 100 billion yuan (RMB, lower than in previous years), far exceeding the figures for the same period, and the amount of repurchases by A-stocks was the highest in history.
In response, Mr. Seo-yang, Chairman of McCoron Information Consulting Limited, Shanghai, stated that the overall value of the A share market this year was low and that the repurchase of shares at relatively low prices was beneficial to listed companies in improving the efficiency of the use of their funds, reflecting the willingness of listed companies to manage market value markets voluntarily and in good cash flow conditions, as well as to boost investors.
In addition, a well-developed equity buy-back system has also encouraged listed companies to actively engage in stock buy-backs.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued implementing regulations for repurchase of shares by listed companies, providing detailed regulations and guidelines for repurchase of shares by listed companies.
Also according to media statistics, since this year, listed companies with increased buy-back schemes have been concentrated in the capital sector, the real estate sector, the information technology industry and the electronic equipment manufacturing industry.
In addition, in terms of repurchase payments, six listed companies have repurchased more than $1 billion this year.
The first of these is the IRI shares, which buy back more than $5 billion.
What is the impact of stock buy-backs by listed companies on the market?
In an interview with a Chinese News Agency journalist, the Vice-President of the Financial and Financial Institute of the People ' s University of China, Zhao Si Jun, stated that repurchases showed, on the one hand, that listed companies were economically strong and financially better able to maintain stable stock prices and confidence in investors, and, on the other hand, that listed companies and their controlling shareholders were accountable to the company and to the market.
The former is based on the good business performance of the company, while the latter requires a high quality of the listed company and its controlling shareholders.
These are the most central building blocks for capital markets.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies has helped to boost investor confidence and has supported the stock prices of listed companies.
The Eastern Securities Research also estimates that, based on the expected stock buybacks from A stock listings as a whole since the beginning of the year, and on the average value of the stock that has been repurchased, it is expected that this year ' s equity buy-back will generate an increase of $150 billion in the A stock market.
During the last two months, the restoration of the Qur'an Monument, a large-scale mural of the post-Tianjin Palace by the national focal point, was concluded on 26 months, and will be reopened during this year's national holiday.
The Qur'an Map is a large, traditional mural that reflects Mother's life in its entirety.
With the approval of the State authorities, it was created from 1991 to 1994 by the Director of the former Civil Museum of Tianjin (the Queen's Palace).
It is known that this mural was painted on the south and north walls of the Queen's Palace, 32 metres long, 2.6 metres tall, in two parts, with more than 30 stories of the birth of the Queen, the sea crossing, the plume rising, etc., and 358 objects reappeared.
Tianjin's summer rains and dry winters in recent years led to the “dryness” of the mural, which accounted for 60 per cent of the total mural area.
In order to protect and rescue the murals of the mother ' s ancestors, the Council of Antiquities Streets and the Queen ' s Palace in the South Kaikian District of Tianjin city started work on the restoration of murals in and around the Queen ' s Palace.
The restoration work was led by Chai Chang-kyu, with the participation of four prominent national painters.
The restoration work was based on the principle of “renovation as old as the old” and, at the same time, partially adapted the original mural, which was supplemented where the mural had not been perfect.
In the process of repair, we have also made innovations and attempts in colours, materials, pen ink, etc.
The original mural style, spirituality, spirituality and art style was maintained after restoration.
The Palace of Queens was established in 1326. It is known as the Queens Palace and has undergone numerous renovations. It is one of the oldest buildings in the city of Tianjin and one of the oldest temples in China.
On 25 September, the launch ceremony of the Beijing Daesing International Airport was crowned.
The stylish plaque of the Beijing Da Hing International Airport terminal, called "The Phoenix's wings" is the first of the seven wonders of the new world.
At present, Beijing Capital International Airport is overstretched, carrying 100 million passengers last year, becoming the second year of the world after Atlanta Airport in the United States of America, where passengers have swallowed up hundreds of millions of times.
By 2022, Beijing Daesing International Airport is expected to have 45 million passengers and 20 per cent of international flights; by 2025, 72 million passengers are expected to have swallowed up and 30 per cent of international flights are expected.
How cool is it when it comes to the new country?
Beijing Dae-hing International Airport, located between Beijing City and Guangyang City, Hebei Province, is 46 kilometres from the Tiananmen Gate line and is currently the largest new airport to be built around the world.
The surface projection of the steel structure on the roof of its terminal amounted to 180,000 square metres, with 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Daesing International Airport is the world’s first air terminal with two levels of arrival and two levels of departure – F1-F4 international, domestic, domestic, and international.
The two-storey bridges that connect the high-speed and the airport from outside the terminal correspond to the F3 and F4 terminals, respectively – international departures to the floor and domestic departures to the two floors.
The first flight of the Beijing Daesing International Airport opened the era of Beijing's “double airport”.
The new airport has been established as a large international air hub, a new power source for the country, and an integrated regional traffic hub in Kyunjin, which supports the construction of the new area of Yu An. To date, a total of 66 airlines, including 20 domestic, 46 regional and foreign, have been interested in entering Dahin International Airport in Beijing.
During the winter and spring season of 2019, Beijing Daesing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, of which 101 are internal and 15 are international; it covers 112 points worldwide, including 97 national and 15 international.
This has resulted in a well-developed, well-competitive and internationally competitive “two-hub” airport configuration with the capital's international airport, which has eased the operational pressure on the capital's saturated airport capacity and better met the urgent need for rapid growth in air transport in and around Beijing and has effectively enhanced the international competitiveness of our civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daesing International Airport takes due account of its geographical location, its relationship to the surrounding airspace and operating environment. For the first time in the country, the airport runways have adopted a “all-way” layout, the world's largest automated air traffic management system and the establishment of China's largest terminal control area, which will maximize the efficiency of aviation operations.
For the first time at airports of this size in the country, a nationalized baggage processing and information management system has been used to improve the efficiency of baggage processing using innovative baggage transfer models.
The launch of the Beijing Da Hing International Airport augurs well for the phoenix.
This new airport, which has created more than 40 international, domestic and national first, with a national production rate of more than 98 per cent, is bound to have a direct and indirect economic impact on the surrounding industries and to inject a vibrant dynamism into the economic development of Beijing.
Marv is scheduled to hold a congress in November, to be transferred to the Party until the age of 16.
A central congress is tentatively scheduled to be held in early November, with the intention of amending the party charter to be transferred to the party until the age of 16.
With the adoption by Congress of a downward revision of the voting age for general elections, Mawar announced that the 66th Central Congress would be held this year, with proposals to amend the party charter, including a downward adjustment of the membership age of Mawar to 16 years from the current 18-year-old age.
The President of the General Assembly, Mr. Dato ' Seri Wei, said that the Central Committee had been scheduled for 2 and 3 November of this year, but that the date of the Congress might change as a result of the by-election of the Danish-Ai seat.
He said that, as the Electoral Commission would meet on 1 October to finalize the nomination of the Danfumi State seat by-election and the polling day, they would meet the following day, 2 October, to discuss whether to change the date of this year ' s Central Congress.
He also explained that the purpose of the Central Committee convened yesterday (26th) was to finalize the date of the congress and to amend the party ' s statutes, but only to coincide with the tragic death of Congressman Danjumpi of the Indigenous Unity Party, Dato ' Mohamud, and thus to join the agenda of the State ' s by-elections.
Xinhua Network
Wang Guoxiang, who was born in February 1943, worked in 1967 and served successively as secretary of the Commune Party, county committee secretary, mayor, etc.
In 1986, Wang was the secretary of the county council of Shandong Province, which was a poor district in the province.
During the five years of his tenure, Mr. Wang focused his efforts on three things: promoting the industrialization of vegetables; developing a salty salt beach; and laying the foundation for an industrial turn-up, which led to the emergence of a pocket and a backboard.
Life farmers have a tradition of vegetables and have learned the lessons of growing them.
In the early 1980s, subsistence farmers were unable to sell their harvests and rot in the ground.
The Wang Bo-xiang study found that the key to catching vegetables is to make the flow good.
Lifelight was the first to establish a wholesale market for vegetables and to set the stage for the development of a market economy.
Party cadres have to take the lead, screw up, and all the lost county has to take care of.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Bo-xiang, 17 members of the three-dollar village, Lo-yee Wang, built 17 warm winter vegetables sheds, and 17 “two million households” emerged from the village in that year.
This was followed by the establishment of outreach teams in the county, which, with the mobilization of Wang Bo-xiang, directed Wang Lo-yi to the communes; over 5,000 vegetable sheds were promoted in the first year, and the vegetable sheds moved to the county and to the country as a whole.
For hundreds of years, 1.6 million acres of land have been painted on shallow beaches in addition to saline beaches.
The local population is living in very difficult conditions.
Soo-nam's got a vegetable shed. What about Su-bei?
Wang Bo-xiang organized a war of congress for 100,000 people and set up camps on the desolate beaches for 40 or 50 days.
Wang Bo-xiang and the county's leaders lived on the site, pushing cars and carrying loads like private workers, eating and sleeping, and the people saw them stretching out their thumbs and admired them... when Subei developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds and 200,000 acres of salt.
In July 1986, Wang Bo-xiang participated for the first time as county secretary in the industrial conference of the city.
During the meeting, a “Comparative table of industrial economy figures in the 12 counties of the city” was released, which at first glance shows the value of industrial output, which is still in its fourth place.
However, if the original salt is removed, a mere $119 million in pure industrial output remains in the third lowest position.
Wang Xiang, with more than 70 men, went to the field to “change his mind”.
Less than a year later, the county invested $150 million in 77 projects.
Every year since then, we have organized a "creaking mission" to Shenzhen, Dongjung and Shanghai.
There is a shortage of businesses and a shortage of entrepreneurs.
Wang Bo-xiang presided over the thematic meeting: 40 “careful and talented” leaders were chosen publicly throughout the county and placed on the industrial front.
In 1991, he joined the ranks of the country ' s top 100 counties, and Wang Bo-xiang was transferred as Deputy Mayor of the city.
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, 4854 businesses, more than 100,000 “millions of yuan” and a cadre recognized by the people, who still call him “ours.”
On 26 September, local time, the Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi chaired the meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of China and the African States members of the Security Council at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Côte d ' Ivoire, which is currently a member of the Council in Africa, Oyono of Equatorial Guinea, Pandor of South Africa, and Kara of Niger, which is a member-designate of the Council, and Jehinawi of Tunisia, attended the meeting.
Wang Ying made four proposals to strengthen cooperation between the two sides in the Council.
First, we are united in strength.
The greatest challenge in the current international situation was unilateralism, the direct consequence of which was the challenge to the basic norms of international relations and the impact on the role of the United Nations, to the detriment of the interests of the vast majority of developing countries, including African countries, and small and medium-sized States.
Meeting this challenge requires the strength of solidarity by hand and shoulder.
In the Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, focusing not just on three votes, but on the African continent as a whole.
Together, China and Africa will not be just four votes, but will lead others to follow up, influence and shape the Council's agenda.
Since 2018, China has established a “3+1” coordination mechanism with African members of the Council, which needs to be fully utilized.
Secondly, we rely on consultations to resolve disputes.
China has always advocated a political solution to hotspot issues. Africa has a good tradition of consultation, as well as the experience of successful mediation by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex and difficult issues on the Council's agenda, particularly hotspots in Africa, are mostly the root causes of colonialism and, in some cases, are directly related to external factors.
Together, we want to use Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations to play the role of the United Nations in good offices, mediation, etc.
Thirdly, self-sustainability.
African countries and peoples know best about Africa ' s problems, and Africa has the capacity and the wisdom to solve its own problems.
In addressing Africa ' s hotspots, the Council should focus on listening to and respecting Africa ' s will, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is ready to strengthen coordination with the African side and to resolutely promote capacity-building for African-owned peace operations.
Fourthly, development is fundamental.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries, and we will insist on putting economic and social development first and supporting each other in their chosen path of development.
China is ready to build a “one-way” with the AU Agenda 2063, the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030 and the development strategies of African countries, and to help African countries to strengthen their capacity for development and to address the root causes of conflict.
Together, we want to promote greater United Nations investment in Africa's development.
With the resurgence of the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, China has done and will continue to do its utmost to provide the necessary human and material assistance and is ready to coordinate its efforts with African countries to mobilize greater assistance from the United Nations and WHO and to play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Relays such as the Neonatal Unit save small lives.
It's dangerous!
The pregnant mother had an early pregnancy and, on her way to the hospital in a panic, a 32-week premature baby could not wait for her to be born on her father ' s sidecar.
Fortunately, obstetric and neonatal doctors handled it in a timely manner, and the relay saved the small life.
On 19, 20 and 21 days, the maternity and neonatal units of the maternal and child health centre in Hubei province received three premature births on their way for three consecutive days, while the other two were born in 120 first aid vehicles, all of which were for 29 weeks.
Ms. Cheng was a second-born mother and, at 7 a.m. on 19 September, she had a stomach ache, thinking that she had 32 weeks of pregnancy and that the first birth was premature, and she had packed the waiting items and was ready to take a bath and go directly to the hospital.
After 0930 hours, Ms. Cheng packed up and asked her husband to drive from Xu Dong ' s home to the hospital.
It was not expected that soon after the car had opened, the baby could not wait for her to be born on her father's sidekick.
After 20 minutes, Ms. Cheng and the baby finally arrived at the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Building at the Maternal and Child Health Home in Hubei Province.
The hospital security officers saw the upset couple and the baby and immediately informed the maternity ward that the four doctors and midwife Liu Yanyan, who were waiting for the deputy doctor, were carrying the delivery bag and the umbilical cord drive, were going down the stairs.
“At that time, the mother was half lying on the side of the car, under the water of sheep and blood, and a baby boy was next to her, with a umbilical cord attached.”
He was asked by Zhang Qing to learn that the baby was a 32-week premature birth, that the parents had not been able to cover the children on their way, that the early autumn morning had been cold, that his skin was cold, that he was not crying and that his limbs were weak.
Yoo Ying-hyang went to the co-pilot to deal with the baby's umbilical cord, and Zhang Qing came in from the cab, quickly opened the delivery bag, covered the child with a couple of layers of tissues and a package, and cleaned the respiratory tracts (e.g. diagrams) for the newborn.
Upon receipt of the information, the neonatal doctor arrived at the nurse ' s station to rescue the premature baby.
At that time, the baby had a purple face and a lack of oxygen was suffocated, and the doctor gave him a pipe intubation immediately. Less than a minute later, the baby recovered its heartbeat, the skin color gradually recovered and the recovery was successful.
Upon admission, this 32-week baby was placed with a trauma respirator, sustained rescue and smooth breathing, and successfully evacuated the next day.
After a week of treatment, the baby ' s vital signs are currently stable and breathing well, and a small amount of breastfeeding has begun.
Coincidentally, on 19, 20 and 21 days, the maternity and neonatal units of the Institute received three premature births on their way for three consecutive days, while the other two were born in 120 first aid vehicles, all of which were 29 weeks old and are currently actively treating them.
Mr. Sun Guoqiang, Director of Obstetrics at the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Centre, explained that, in recent years, women and children in the province had attended to a large number of babies born on the subway in private cars, a situation which might threaten the lives of their mothers and children.
Director Sun warned that pregnant mothers should visit the hospital as soon as they suffered abdominal pain, broken water, and so on.
In the event that the child is present at home or on the road, the mother shall try to be in a flat bed, with blankets on her buttocks, etc., in order to prevent the baby from falling back into the ground, the child shall be kept warm as soon as the child is present and shall be brought to medical attention as soon as possible.
The newer Aerial Technology Company is officially operational.
The establishment of VSTEA was a fine-tuning part of the memorandum of cooperation signed in April 2018 between VAECO and ST Engineering Aerospace, marking the emergence of the first Vietnamese aircraft equipment maintenance and repair consortium.
Two leading aviation technology companies in Viet Nam and Singapore cooperate to provide aircraft equipment maintenance and repair services to national and international airlines.
Vietnam’s general manager, Yang Zhisheng, said that the company’s associate, ST Engineering Aerospace, was the largest and highest-level aircraft maintenance group in the world.
It is believed that this cooperation will bring benefits to both sides and that it will be the beginning of a promising future of cooperation between the two sides.
Lim Serh Ghee, the Managing Director of ST Engineering Aerospace, stated that the sharing of extensive experience with ST Engineering would help the consortium to provide international-level maintenance and repair services and contribute to the flight safety of the airlines.
The birth of VSTEA contributed to a deep and wide-ranging approach to the market for the maintenance and repair of aircraft equipment with the potential to excavate.
At the same time, there is an excellent opportunity to access modern technology and to train senior aviation technicians.
To better meet the sustainable development needs of Viet Nam ' s aviation industry.
Research shows that manufacturing has become the focus of attention in major countries around the world - Xinhuanet
On September 27th, Xinhua, the National Intellectual Property Operation Public Service Platform released the White Paper on the Global Manufacturing Innovation Index (GMI) in Anhui.
The White Paper shows that manufacturing has become the focus of attention in major countries around the globe.
This is what journalists learned at the Forum on the Operation and Protection of Intellectual Property at the 2019 World Congress of Manufacturing.
The Forum focused on intellectual property rights (IPRs) contributing to the upgrading of manufacturing in China, exploring in a comprehensive manner innovative initiatives for the operation and protection of intellectual property rights in the manufacturing sector from the macro-level of policy interpretation and micro-views of business practices, exploring topical issues of intellectual property protection in manufacturing, continuously enhancing the high-quality application of intellectual property rights, and accelerating the construction of the advantages of industrial intelligence upgrading.
The Forum invited the National Intellectual Property Agency, scholars from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and experts from relevant domestic and foreign industry organizations and professional research institutions to share experiences and contribute ideas on how to strengthen intellectual property protection and promote the use of intellectual property rights.
At the Forum, the Angé Province Market Supervisory Authority issued an evaluation of the quality analysis of innovative development in the province of patent navigation, which, based on the results of a high-quality development index of innovation in the area of patent navigation, placed Angé Province in the eighth place among the 31 provinces and municipalities of the country for the high-quality development of regional innovation in the area of patent navigation in 2018 and brought together elements of innovation.
The Forum was hosted by the Anhui People ' s Government and co-hosted by the Anhui Market Supervisory Authority, the National Intellectual Property Operation Public Service Platform and the China Intellectual Property Development Alliance.
Today's opening of the 2019s net competition, with a number of Olympic champions at the opening ceremony.
The Olympic champions will attend the opening ceremony and the audience will sing "Me and My Fatherland" in concert with the Junior Choir.
2019 China's Tennis Open Games will be officially launched today at the National Tennis Center. A short and solemn opening ceremony will be held by the Organizing Committee before the opening of the evening games. A number of Olympic champions and sports personalities will be gathered at the diamond fields to participate in the opening guests and guests.
In the next nine days, including 11 golden weeks, Beijing will re-enter the tennis boom and the National Tennis Center will be a good place for fans on their holidays.
Since its inception in 2004, the China Tennis Open Competition has been held 15 spring and fall, the sixteenth of its kind this year.
This year, however, the overall prize for the Internet event reached an all-time high of $11.16 million.
With a total prize of $7.64 million for the women's crown races, compared to the Indian Villes and Miami championships, the latter two were 96 signatures for the women's single races and the midnets were 60 signatures, so that for the players, the middle-nets were more “sexy” than for the players.
The total prize for the ATP500 contest for Chinese men was even higher in history, rising from $3.4 million last year to $3.52 million, and the number of prizes continued to take the title of the ATP500 contest, while the total prize for the Tokyo station at the ATP500 contest the same week was about $2 million.
There will be a short and solemn opening before the first game scheduled for tonight at the Central Playground.
This evening's opening ceremony will be attended by 10 top players from all areas of Chinese sports, including Olympic champions and world champions.
After the opening ceremony, the first battle on the central field was a WTA first-round match between the Chinese Kim-hwa Peng and the Russian player Casakina, followed by the new American show Sophia Kenning, who challenged Muguraza, the mid-2015 net champion, who was a champion.
The most beautiful unwed princess in the world is engaged!
According to the British Metro, the Buckingham Palace announced on 26 that British Princess Beatrice and Mozi were engaged.
Mozi is known to be a 34-year-old Italian billionaire working mainly in real estate development.
Beatrice will marry this real estate tycoon next year.
Princess Beatrice, the granddaughter of the Queen Elizabeth II, the eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and former wife of the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, ranked fifth in the order of succession to the throne of England and was hailed as “the most beautiful unwed princess in the world”.
"We are very pleased to announce that Princess Beatrice and Mr. Mozi are engaged."
According to the British side, they were engaged in Italy at the beginning of this month.
The engagement was filmed by Beatrice's sister, Eugenie.
In a statement, they said that we were very pleased to share the news of the engagement.
We are excited to be able to embark on the journey of life together, and we cannot wait to get married.
We have many similar interests and perceptions that will make us more stable, full of love and happiness in the years to come.
Three points a ball?
On 27 Beijing time, the NBA Development Alliance announced a pilot new penalty, with only one penalty at a time, the value of which would be determined by irregularities.
O'Neill has a very low penalty rate in the NBA.
The new regulation provides for 2 points for 2 points for 2 points for 2 points for 2 points for 2 points and 3 points for 3 points for 3 points for 3 points for offenders and 1 point for 1 point for 1 point for 1 point for offences.
The last two minutes of regular time and the extra time competition follow the previous penalty rule.
While this new season is only being tested by the NBA Development Alliance, fans are more concerned about the implications for current players if it is introduced in the NBA.
For the time being, many believe that the new rules may be in favour of Hadden the Bigbeard, and that James, who is less than fine, is going to suffer.
Wuhan's promotion of industrial intelligence has given up to $20 million in subsidies.
On 27 September, journalists learned from a series of city launches organized by the Vuhan City Press Office of the “Present to the New China Games” that, since this year, the city has accelerated its industrial intellectual transformation and implemented a transformational subsidy of up to 20 million yuan.
To date, more than 800 industrial enterprises of more than size have collected information on their intellectual transformation needs.
Mr. Zhang Hong, Deputy Director-General of the Economics and Informatization Department of Wuhan City, introduced an action plan for the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises starting this year, providing free advisory diagnostic services and solutions to industrial enterprises of higher size than demand, and promoting a new round of technological upgrading of high-level enterprises in all its aspects.
In accordance with the plan, the city of Wuhan publicly selects a number of specialized diagnostic services each year to carry out a needs-based smart transformation survey for all industrial enterprises of the size of the city and above, by means of special columns, questionnaires and reports.
To date, information has been collected on the intellectual transformation needs of more than 800 regulated industrial enterprises, accounting for almost one third of all industrial enterprises in the city.
Five municipal diagnostic platforms have organized teams to be placed in enterprises to conduct “one-on-one” field assessments and programme validations.
According to Zhang Hong, the city is currently organizing 373 smart transformation projects with a total planned investment of $29,760 million, the top 5G smart production line in IYC, the Motorola lead smart cell phone production line, and the Wuhan Siemens sub transformer number.
In addition, the city of Wuhan has increased its financial support for smart transformation projects.
These include investment in industrial enterprises that are intelligently modified and actually completed; investment in equipment hardware, and soft investment in research and development, which is granted at 8 per cent, up to $20 million in conversion subsidies.
At the same time, financial institutions such as the Active Joint Exchange and the Wuhan Branch of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry provide individualized financial services tailored to the intellectual transformation of industrial enterprises, thus significantly easing the pressure on enterprise financing.
Trudeau, "Putting Man down," can he be re-elected?
This time, Trudeau tripped out of the big pit, and it was Trudeau himself that dug up a little bit.
In recent days, the Canadian media have exposed several old pictures of the current Prime Minister, Trudeau, in which Trudeau dressed himself as a black person.
This is considered to be a clear act of racial discrimination, triggering a wave of violence in Canada.
After what happened, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, Canadians do not buy much.
Trudeau sort of moved a rock and smashed his own foot.
As political critic Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the “anti-Black Face Movement” in the United States, Trudo and the Federal Liberal Party have been making high-profile accusations against opposition parties or dissidents within the party for “a great loss” in this regard, and have repeatedly threatened to “anyone who makes such a mistake”.
Simply put, this time, Trudo tripped out of the big pit, and it was Trudo himself that dug up a little bit.
Trudo, the son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudo of Canada, is young and handsome and, when he first came out, he was struck by a cyclone of “political idols”.
Formerly “politically” he, after taking the lead of the Federal Liberal Party, fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the Canadian federal legislative elections of 2015 – the Federal Liberal Party, half of which sits in the Federal House of Commons, gained valuable separate governmental power.
At that time, Trudeau put forward a number of political platforms, concepts, such as “ethnicity and gender equality”, “eco-environmental environment”, “economic revitalization”, and emphasis on the eradication of corruption and “irregular winds”.
However, for five years in office, he had been “high and low” in almost all of the above-mentioned areas.
In terms of “ethnicity and gender equality”, leaving aside the “black-face” incident, he “doesn’t speak for himself” on a range of Aboriginal issues, which led First Nations groups, leaders, to move protest tents to the gates of the Hills of Congress on the 150th anniversary of Canada’s founding.
With regard to the fight against corruption, at the beginning of last year, Trudo was involved in the boiling “Ranving” incident.
He was exposed to major irregularities by his home construction and engineering company, Ran Wanling, and pressured the authorities and officials in charge of the investigation to demand that the latter be “high-valued”.
Moreover, Trudeau, after the big deal, was angry at the disclosure officer, Wang Chaudhry, who was the first to disclose the malpractice, when he was the Attorney-General of Canada.
Although the case itself remains questionable, it is difficult to erase the suspicion.
Many observers have pointed out that the collapse of the Trudeau regime for five years was largely the result of its own “powdering pits”, the largest of which were the three “drawn by itself” and the “better by itself” and the “better by the law”.
The most authoritative Angus-Reed poll data in Canada show that, from 2015 to the present, those supporting Trudeau slipped from more than 60 per cent to more than 30 per cent, while those opposing it jumped from less than 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent.
Although other opposition parties and their party leaders have performed similarly poorly, even a significant proportion of voters who still wish to vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now not convinced that the Federation Prime Minister, the head of the ruling party, is the same.
On 21 October, when the new Canadian federal legislative elections are about to begin, will Trudeau be able to repeat what he won five years ago?
The answer may be one word: difficulty.
Both at the level of enterprise competition and consumer experience, as well as at the level of regional aviation integration and the development of the integration dimension of Kyoto, have far-reaching and positive implications.
On 25 September, Beijing Daesing International Airport was officially launched.
Reporters from the New Kyoto newspaper were informed by the Beijing Municipal Development and Rehabilitation Board that the capital airport was operating in a state of oversaturation and that the opening of the airport would enhance the capacity of the capital's air services.
Following Shanghai, Beijing became the second city with two airports in our common city, similar to Shanghai Rainbow Bridge International Airport, which serves mainly domestic aviation services, and Pudong Airport, which is dominated by international shipping, which will in the future be located in a differentiated position between the capital city airport and Da Hing airport, which will serve different air operations, both domestically and internationally.
The expansion of Da Hing Airport has had a more beneficial impact on the capital airport from the point of view of its operational development.
The capital airport reached 100 million passengers in 2018 and is the country ' s largest in terms of traffic, but there is still a significant shortfall in capacity compared to the rapidly growing demand for operations, especially for international routes.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passengers, travel, etc., and to respond to the growing trend towards open and internationally integrated cities in Beijing, Dae-Hing International Airport has been established as a large international hub airport, with plans to meet 100 million annual passengers and 4 million tons of mail and mail traffic in the future.
As a result, there is no overlap in the positioning of the two airports, targeting different client groups and having sufficient market space.
At the economic and financial levels, it is clear that the navigation of the International Airport will have a win-win effect by easing tensions in air transport in Beijing, accelerating the rate of passenger and cargo throughput and building incremental cakes for the two-nuclear operation of the capital.
From a user ' s point of view, as the international airport moves, it is not necessary to concentrate all future trips on the airport in the capital. It can also reduce a number of problems arising from the excessive concentration of routes, such as longer stop security, slower passenger boarding, indirectly increasing aircraft and passengers ' stay at the airport, increasing the burden of airport operations through the capital.
According to media estimates of the time and cost of a variety of transport routes to large international airports, such as moving from the southern five-ring to the high-speed to the high-speed airport in Tokyo, with 50 minutes of driving, fuel money coming back to around $40 and the high-speed fee of $15, and the choice of the orbital-traffic subway to the high-speed airport line.
In general, there are a wide range of transport options available for citizens to go to Da Hing airport, within a reasonable range of costs and time.
From the point of view of trends, Da Hing airport is located as a traffic hub in Kyotsu and is therefore a little further away from Beijing, but has increased radiation exposure to Hebei and Tianjin, facilitating more people to travel, and has significant implications for the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, Hebei and Tianjin passengers will be able to benefit from the increased international air route service provided by Da Hing International Airport, as can be seen from the traffic planning at Da Hing Airport.
In addition to the new airport line in the city of Beijing, which leads directly to the airport, there are several highways linking the airport to the surrounding area.
Just as urban passengers in Guangdong Dongdong, Fushan, Kiang and other cities can travel to Bai Yun Airport in Guangzhou via the Guangzhou Highway, residents of such places as the Beijing Ribbon and the Yu Anjin District will also benefit from the Great Euphoria Airport, which will provide easy and efficient air services.
As can be seen, the opening of Dahin International Airport has far-reaching and positive implications not only for the long-term layout and development of the shipping industry in Beijing, but also for the expansion of several runways and aircraft, both at the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience and regional aviation integration and the development of the integration dimension in Kyoto.
Therefore, with regard to the opening of the airport, we need to make an economic score not only for the individual, but also for the overall development.
On the 27th of mid-day, the tiles rose by 1.46 % - Xinhuanet
On September 27, Xinhua's Shenzhen electricity (journalist Zhao Rish) moved high on the mid-point finger on the 27th, with a final collection of 6077.23 points, an increase of 87.55 points, or 1.46 per cent, over the previous trading day.
On that day, the sum of $108 billion was paid, which is $31.9 billion less than on the previous trading day.
Of the stocks traded on the day, there were 668 stock collections and 15 stock receipts and suspensions for high-tech ideas; 222 stock returns fell and 4 shares fell for Xiaowei shares; and 40 shares were collected for Xiaoxing shares.
In 2019, the Forum on Economic and Social Issues of Viet Nam was held in the province of Suntsun
The Vice-President of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly of Viet Nam, Nguyen Dejeng, revealed that, at the beginning of the year, Viet Nam ' s economic and social development had seen many new developments and continued growth.
The forum focused on economic and social issues highlighted in the first months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development by the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the Forum, participants had an in-depth exchange of views and views on four themes, namely, economic development in 2019 and the impact of selected FTAs, outstanding issues in the Vietnamese economy in 2019, outstanding issues in the Vietnamese socio-cultural context in 2019, and projections and recommendations for the socio-economic development of Viet Nam in 2020.
There was general agreement that global economic growth slowed in the first months of 2019 and that risks and challenges increased.
Trade frictions among the major economies have further reduced global trade and investment.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), despite the uncertainty of the global economy, in which 70 per cent of the world ' s economies had stagnated in growth, Viet Nam ' s economic development had achieved many promising results, with stable macroeconomic performance and effective control of inflation, with an average consumer price index growth of 2.64 per cent in the first half of 2019, the lowest in nearly three years.
GDP grew by 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2019, down from 7.05 per cent in the same period last year, but the increase remained high compared to the same period in 2011-2017.
In forecasting trends in Viet Nam ' s economic development from 2019 to 2020, the Deputy Director of Viet Nam ' s National Economic and Social Forecasting Centre, Dundeyn, stated that the Vietnamese economy had shown a high growth momentum in 2019 against the backdrop of the turmoil in the world economy.
By 2020, Viet Nam ' s macroeconomic stability was expected to remain generally stable, the implementation of trade-related agreements would contribute to trade development, the restructuring of the economy and the improvement of the business environment were further strengthened, and Viet Nam ' s external export activities were expected to decline as a result of trade frictions.
There is therefore a need to strengthen early warning mechanisms for monitoring forecasts, to proactively seek trade relief measures for Viet Nam ' s exports, to find opportunities to expand new export markets and to facilitate the export of various commodities, including agricultural and water products.
At the same time, inflation has been kept at a reasonable level, thereby contributing to the development of ancillary industries and supporting the development of high-tech, organic and ecological agriculture.
Liu Ji Jie, Director of the Consular Office in Siem Reap, Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, hosted a reception in Siem Reap to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
Liu Jijie said that, 70 years after the establishment of the new China, China has actively participated in international affairs and contributed more to China ' s intellectual and Chinese programmes to improve global economic governance and promote common global development, making important contributions to world peace and development and bringing tangible benefits to Cambodia ' s economic development and the well-being of its people.
Liu Jijie explained that, as the world's second largest economy, China contributed more than 30 per cent to world economic growth, in particular to China's “one-way” initiative, and that cooperation between China's local provinces and cities and the provinces of Siem Reap and Siem Reap was deepening.
He said that this year marked the beginning of 61 years of Chinese-Cambodian relations, with fraternal friendships between the two countries, and that mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Cambodia would be the driving force behind the local economic and social development.
The Governor of Siem Reap Province, Dishiah, highly commended the great achievements of the new China over the past 70 years and congratulated the two countries on the results of their friendly cooperation.
It looks forward to continued joint efforts between the two sides to promote Chinese-Chinese friendship and cooperation, to strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit and to continuously improve the living standards of the people.
According to Desaiha, Siem Reap Province has had remarkable relations with China ' s provinces and cities, and has so far concluded friendly relations with China ' s 28 provinces and cities. Large cultural performance projects, " Angkor Smile " and " Angkor Dynasty " , Siem Reap-Gangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park and Siem Reap New International Airport Project
The reception was attended by the Minister of State of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, Ken Wensson, the President of the Siem Reap Provincial Council, the Governor of the 5 provinces in the region, the Siem Reap branch of the Cambodian Council, volunteer teachers, the Siem Reap branch of the Cambodian Chamber of Commerce, representatives of Chinese companies and representatives of the foreign Siem Reap corps.
"The Ten Years of Digital China" - Xinhuanet
If the 2009 local website forum were to be used as a starting point, the 2019 Cloud Habitat Conference in Hangzhou had been held for a full decade.
From the concept of “in the clouds” to the practice of “in the clouds”, big data and cloud computing became one of the core technologies underpinning China's economic development, social management and public services over a period of 10 years.
At the Jinhai Shining Energy Photovoltaic Battery Workshop in Heining, Zhejiang, there have recently been a number of new “colleagues” next to the Quality Inspector with AI intelligence.
It is open for 24 hours, is identified at more than twice the rate of manual labour, and the accuracy of the quality check is stable at more than 95 per cent.
According to the head of the company, the “quality examiner” with the camera has focused on more than 40,000 defective samples, which, with the cloud computing power behind it, can quickly convert infrared images into binary languages, with defective battery fragments classified.
This enterprise is only a microcosm of today ' s cloud computing assistive manufacturing transformation.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Informatics published the Guide to Promoting the Implementation of Corporate Clouds (2018-2020), which aims to achieve, by 2020, a significant increase in the awareness and motivation of enterprises and a significant increase in the proportion and depth of applications.
According to King Ken, founder of Aryanun, data-centred cloud computing today has opened the way for data to bridge the digital economy of key elements.
At the same time, our cloud computing industry has grown in size over the past 10 years.
The White Paper on cloud computing development (2019), published by the China Institute of Information and Communication Research in July of this year, showed that the total market size of the Chinese cloud computing in 2018 was 96.28 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2 per cent over 2017.
In addition to being the key technology that underpins industrial transformation and digital economic development, invisible “clouds” have unwittingly transformed urban governance and social life.
At this year's cloud-dwelling conference, the “city brain” of three years in a row continues to be a cause for concern.
The Aliun side described that the urban brain has now become the hub of urban governance from a traffic governance tool, and that the relevant collaborative application has been extended to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the urban brain achieves new urban management service functions such as “busting before paying” “real-time perception of the number of clients”, “tourism route design”, through a strong computing capability.
In the area of government services, “one thing” is being replaced by “one cloud”, which combines “one thing” with “one thing”, and cloud computing facilitates the supply of government services on both sides.
Zhejiang has now established a unified public data platform throughout the province through the political upkeep of Zhejiang.
As of 11 September, the platform had covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million corporate entities in the province, bringing together 3066 categories of 19.8 billion data.
On average, 12 million monthly calls have been made and shared between government departments in Zhejiang province, and every time the data is called on a cloud, it may mean that people are less likely to run their jobs.
Makoto makes tea with a plastic tea bag!
According to the Central News Agency, a recent study in Canada recently found that a bag of plastic tea bags could release billions or even billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than a single person's estimated entire intake of microplastics, but to date there is no evidence that ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
Researchers at McGill University in Canada have reportedly found that immersing plastic tea bags in a glass of almost boiling hot water (95°C), will release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than the total estimated amount of microplastics taken by a person.
According to studies published earlier in 2019, the general population eats at least 50,000 plastic particles per year, while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.
According to the information received, the study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, where researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea packs at Montreux Shop and Café, opened the tea bag, washed the tea bag and dipped it into almost boiling water for five minutes, and analysed it using electronic microscopes and spectroscopy.
According to this study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, “in several stages more than the plastic load of other previous foods”.
It has been reported that most tea bags are made of natural fibres, but many brands made of natural fibres still use plastic to seal them.
Some branded tea bags are no longer paper-based and instead use plastics, which are the subject of tests by researchers.
Plastic particles are microscopic fragments of plastic, which researchers define as being in the range of 100 nm to 5 m2 and are mainly produced by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and deep-sea trenches around the world, and these microplastics can be found in running water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
For the first time in October 2018, researchers found plastic particles in human excreta samples from several countries in different regions of the world.
In order to test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from tea packs, the Canadian research team placed daphnia in contaminated water and found that microplastics affected the behaviour of these daphnia and led to developmental malformations.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that the ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, WHO notes that more research is needed to understand fully how these plastics spread into the environment and how they affect humans.
Researchers speculate that the large amount of plastic particles released from these tea bags may be due to their exposure to boiling water and the possibility of decomposition or osmosis of toxic substances even when “food grade” plastics are heated up to more than 40 degrees Celsius.
Guterres stated that climate emergencies were the greatest threat to the survival of small island States.
There, a natural disaster erodes a generation of human development gains.
This has been illustrated by the hurricanes that have struck Papua, Dominica and the Bahamas since this year.
About one quarter of the population of small island developing States lives at an altitude of 5 metres or less.
The relocation may seriously affect their society and way of life and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At this Monday ' s Climate Action Summit, small island developing States are jointly committed to achieving carbon neutrality and 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030, thus once again leading the world in the right direction.
According to Guterres, “the climate crisis is accumulating new injustices over old ones.
Although the contribution of small island developing States to global warming has been small, it has paid the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many countries are caught in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must act, and the time has come to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States.”
Today ' s high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for the search for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and transform renewable energy sources; and urging international institutions to help small island developing States, particularly highly indebted middle-income countries, to access financing.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the lifeline of the planet — the oceans.
The latest special report issued this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have suffered from the severe consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, it is likely that there will be some extreme sea level rise in many regions every year that would have occurred only once a century ago.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable without significant investment in adaptation.
The costs of pollution, overfishing and acidification are enormous.
Over the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic contamination has increased tenfold over the past 40 years.
The demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a decline in resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.
Small island States also face high transport, energy and infrastructure costs.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, subjecting them to price fluctuations.
Some States are also making efforts to address the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons, arms and drugs.
According to Guterres, “the problem can be solved anywhere by resolving it in the most challenging environment.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples that the world can draw upon.”
He stressed that small island developing States were a special case for sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
The Ministry of Finance of India indicated that the financial system was sufficiently mobile.
India ' s finance minister, Seetalaman, 26, stated that the current financial system was sufficiently liquid and that India ' s economic growth was expected to recover during the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday demand.
The above statement was made after a meeting with representatives of private Indian banks, non-banking financial institutions, housing banks, etc.
Seetalaman does not state the relevance of these statements.
Some of the former Indian and overseas media have attributed the sustained slowdown in the Indian economy to the liquidity constraints of non-bank financial institutions.
The decline in car sales was cited by Seetalaman, who denied that liquidity constraints were the main cause of the decline in sales.
According to Seetalaman, the decline in automobile sales was mainly due to cyclical factors.
Seetalaman predicted that India ' s economic growth could recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday consumption.
India ' s annual shopping season began in September and will continue until the end of the year.
The market anticipates that shopping consumption will contribute significantly to economic growth in India.

Support for pig production, market supply.
Our loyalty requires that measures be taken in six areas.
A telephonic conference was held today to follow up on the policy measures taken by the Central and Provincial Councils and the Provincial Government to support the production of raw pigs and to secure the supply of the market.
There is a need for loyalty and for the implementation of measures for the production of raw pigs in six areas.
The mayor of the “basket of food” is responsible for its implementation, and this year 45 million registered pigs throughout the province have been separated into the municipalities and included in the accountability test.
Implementation of policy measures to effectively address the “last kilometre” of policy implementation.
The production of pig-rich pigs is being implemented, the policy of subsidizing them is being carefully implemented, the growth of pig-growing enterprises is being encouraged, and there is a systematic selection of good female pigs from the group of commodity pigs.
In order to secure the financing, it is important to ensure that large farming enterprises that are not yet well-known in our province have access to them as a top priority.
The implementation of market circulation systems has accelerated the construction of cold-chain logistics facilities for raw pigs and has contributed to the overall shift from “pigs” to “meats”.
The implementation of the modern system of immunization is ensured with the deployment of grass-roots quarantine personnel appropriate to the scale of farming and work tasks, and the first line of protection against disease and disease is secured.
Be faithful and do everything possible to guarantee the supply of the meat market, to ensure that there are no large-scale shortages and large-scale disruptions, and to ensure a stable supply of pork for major holidays.
It also deployed efforts to maintain the control and control of the African swine plague, the ban on retreats in key waters of my Governor's river basin, and the acquisition of medium-to-late rice throughout the province.
We're talking about the motherland, the nation's soul, the old Shanghai letters, the big white rabbits, taking classes for college students.
The "Me and My Fatherland" campus has made college students feel happy about it.
On the occasion of the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, four famous Shanghai Old Words gathered on 27th of the Shanghai Technical University “Art Party” in Shanghai, four of them on average over 90 years of history.
An exhibition of the old branded products on the scene.
The talk in the classroom made the students wonder that the display of the old branded product was carefully placed outside the classroom, and that the "Me and My Fatherland" campus had a punctuation point for the students.
Big rabbit lip cream, big white rabbit ice cream... as an old-word brand, big rabbit milk candy has been active in recent years, aggressive, innovating and cross-bordering.
The big white rabbit, born in 1959, happens to be on its 60th birthday this year.
She also looks at youth consumption groups.
Wang Weiji, secretary-general and deputy director-general of the party branch of the Shanghai Pilgrim Food Company Ltd., referred to the scene of "Spring with abalones, summer with venoms, autumn with blizzards with brittle shrimp, winter with brimming crabs" as a reflection of people eating.
Companies have also further developed branding culture in terms of taste innovation, caricature packaging design, etc., to adapt to the heritage of younger consumer groups.
The old word represents a presentation of the path of innovation on the scene of the Art Party.
The manager of Shanghai Feathers Co. Ltd., Yuji, agreed that, “All innovations are based on solid foundations, and the old word is a thin-haired process.
Each and every one of us has a hidden expectation of the old word.
At the heart of the product, the age of small and beautiful should begin."
As one of the country's first “old Chinese” characters, Shanghai Feathers also quickly adapted to market trends, upgraded brands visually, introduced professional business teams and achieved a significant increase in turnover.
“The old word mark is not only visible in such traditional channels as supermarkets, but it is now also active in new retailing and activities.
All our changes, in the end, will be to make it possible for consumers to see, to hear, to buy."
Uyang Jae Ling, Deputy General Manager of Soap (Group) Ltd., Shanghai, said.
In the future, Shanghai soap production will also continue its high-end development and the systematic development of energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products that are promising and satisfactory to users, following a high-tech and cost-effective path.
As a result of this art party class, the students were well-received.
I grew up with the old word, with the good memories and emotions of my childhood."
Mr. Song Yuen is sighing.
The Shanghai Old Letter represents the story of the motherland and the national soul of over 200 young students.
Chou Xianxing said that how to tap into brand culture so that high-quality traditional culture can be inherited and flourished is an issue that we, as design students, need to think about and explore.
The Party class is based on Ting Wai's "Shanghai Image" project of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Technology in Huadong, and Prof. Niang's "Old Words Incorporated Brand Innovative Studio" in the hope of further exploiting the cultural potential and modern commercial values of the Old Words and using them to use them to the old Shanghai.
According to the information received, the Arts Party class will also continue to invite literaryists, painting masters, pottery masters, non-residual masters, architects, landscape masters to serve as lecturers, through which they will tell about the innovation and commitment of the heritage of Chinese culture, highlight the characteristics of the time, and further strengthen the ideal beliefs of university students.

It is my firm belief that a new model of future relations between the two countries, working together to address the issues facing the region and the world and contributing to the international community, will be beneficial.
In conclusion, I wish Japan every success in its relations and my friends great success in their endeavours.
“It is estimated that over-age farmers on some sites account for more than half of them.
Where do we find young workers now?
There's no way to use so many "old people" on the site."
In recent days, Zou Kui, a contractor working in the construction industry, has lamented the existence of a large number of over-age farmers on the site (over and above retirement age).
In recent times, I have been working on rain-distribution projects in my high schools, where a large number of farm workers are present and, if observed, there are a large number of over-age farmers.
It's not "free" for over-age farmers to go out to work, but because they're "free" and have the insatiable and difficult — whether they save money to solve their own old-age and medical problems or help their children.
The "good old age" of over-age farmers is not as easy as we thought.
Child-rearing, support for the elderly, schooling for the children, helping the children build buildings to buy cars, helping the children to start a family, and raising grandchildren from generation to generation. When these farm workers complete their “life mission”, the bags have been emptied, and even many debts have been made, and most of their wealth has been accumulated.
In order not to drag children, but also to save some wealth for themselves, many farmers insist on “doing as long as they can”.
Many “after 80” “after 90” and even “after 00” new generations of farmers are reluctant to engage in secondary or low-end services that are under difficult conditions and labour-intensive, creating structural “workless jobs” that are unattractive and provide opportunities for over-age farmers.
As a result of a lack of skills and a decline in physical and labour capacity, many over-age farmers are engaged in high-intensity, low-income, high-risk and low-security jobs.
A day's work is a day's work, and a little more is a little more, and the survival dilemma of the over-age farmers behind the “don't be idle” cannot be ignored and ignored.
Addressing the problems of wage arrears and bargaining, improving labour protection, reducing security risks, increasing labour income and improving the survival of over-age rural workers, in addition to their “self-help” work, is also dependent on the public sector's system of care and human care.
It has been pointed out by scholars that over-age farmers are no longer likely to rely on their homes to grow land to solve their old-age and medical problems, and that they must support their families through other means.
The inability and strength to understand the “freeness” of over-age farmers help us to better understand the love and pain of over-age farmers.
Seeing the backs of the over-age farmers, hearing their sighs, trying to get them back to the countryside to really make their “good old” sense, requiring the public sector, markets and society to share their responsibilities in a virtuous interaction and to combine their efforts.
Chemetsov stated that Russia would not export such a system for the next five years because “first supply of its own military forces will be followed by export production”.
This practice is fully consistent with international practice.
The main producers of weapons and military equipment are always the first to ensure their defence needs and then to process export orders.
Earlier, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Sky Force, General Yuri Glehoff, said that the development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by the “Goldstone-Antai” Sky Defense Concene.
This is a new generation of anti-aircraft systems that apply the working principles used to destroy ballistics and aerodynamics objectives.
The main role of S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which are capable of intercepting missiles with a range of less than 3,500 kilometres.
In addition, according to certain information, S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of drones, ultrasonic missiles five times faster than sound, even near space targets.
Such weapons can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defence systems, in particular the S-400 system, which is very important from a defence perspective.
Sergei Chemetsov expressed particular concern about S-400.
He said that the system was currently in great demand in the world, but the Russian army also needed it, including in the Arctic region.
S-400 air defence systems are in service with the Arctic air defence corps.
According to information received on 15 September, the reconfiguration of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system by the New Earth Islands Arctic Air Defence Corps has been completed.
This is not the militarization of Russia in the Arctic.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, this is entirely a process within the plan for the transition to more advanced defence tools in the strategic direction of the north.
According to the news service of the Russian Northern Fleet, “According to the transition to a new S-400 air defence system, the controlled airspace of the Arctic region has significantly increased.”
It is very important that the military assess that the system has been used successfully in the far north and the Arctic.
Air Defence Corps personnel trained in the new system and were ready to enter combat duty.
The S-300 long-range air defence system, which was previously equipped, is still partially maintained.
When it comes to air defence systems, they must possess weapons capable of destroying a variety of air targets, be they high-speed targets at the outer altitude or “fish leaking” close to protected facilities.
According to open sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by the “Gold Diamonds-Antai” Sky Defence Concene, was designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, ultrasound targets and other aerial assault weapons.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 kilometres and shoot down ballistic targets at a range of 60 kilometres and 4.8 kilometres per second.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defence forces in the far north to ensure the safety of air space on the northern seaways.
Not long ago, the first 12 “Tor”-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, sufficient to form an air defence battalion to strengthen anti-aircraft systems in the Arctic.
At that time, the Russian Ministry of Defence indicated that the Arctic “Tor” force would be extended to full brigade-size units in the future.
Together with the new S-400 long-range system deployed on New Earth Island and the Kola peninsula and the Pantsir-SA short-range system deployed in the far north, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons are a powerful shield for the Russian polar sky.
It will be difficult for enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles to break through this defence.
In the view of the Russian Government, the flagship shop would serve as a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complex and lengthy process of opening their own.
Rusty, a Russian store operator, focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
Russians mostly in Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, Hand Q (ShouQ), Multifunctional Instant Communications
The Russian Export Centre will work with Russian suppliers to develop marketing strategies and criteria for participation in shops and to screen virtual shelf-loading enterprises.
The store plans to open by the end of this year and to build up at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to data from the Russian Export Centre, the total number of visits per month by China ' s power suppliers ' platforms is as high as 1 billion.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, reaching more than $1 billion in 2018.
Currently, the Alibaba Group will also open pilot shops for the sale of commodities from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of the Global Import Strategy.
According to Alexei Kozhevnikov, the new store will display goods from enterprises selling at least 500 million roubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher, and 500 million rubles are underselling.
As we all know, Chinese consumers are quite positive about Russian goods and view our commodities as high quality and green and green.”
Kozhevnikov stated that competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power was intense and increasing.
He said, “Our goal is ambitious, to launch 500 businesses through this store in three years.”
At the same time, the platform will also carry the products of Russian enterprises in the Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, Professor of the Basics of Trade Policy, Plyanov Economic University, Russia, said: “This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export centre is a State-owned rather than a private institution.”
“I don’t see a lot of highly competitive Russian goods on the market.”
He believed that the project would probably not be implemented in real terms, but would help to strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to the Russian News Agency, Andrei Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Centre, stated during the Eastern Economic Forum that more than 170 Russian enterprises ' product information had been published on the largest international wholesale platform, Alibaba.com, both in China and in other countries.
In addition, there is a model for cooperation with the Alibaba Group, namely, a training project for Russian enterprises by experts from the University of Poetry, the first of which was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Centre will also be the organizer of the participation of Russian enterprises in industry exhibitions and business projects at the Second China International Import Fair in Shanghai in November of this year.
A major exhibition will be held in the 1,000 m2 exhibition hall, which will also serve as a centre for commercial project activities, protocol signing ceremonies, promotions and meetings with Chinese business representatives.
Approximately 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
According to the Information Service of the Russian Export Centre: “In addition to the agricultural stand, we are bound to hold business meetings, i.e. to arrange direct contacts between entrepreneurs.”
“This is another direction of our efforts aimed at supporting businesses and ensuring that dozens of specialized meetings are arranged for them.”
In addition, the Fair will hold master courses, cooking competitions and Russian-renowned cook-cooked food fairs for the Russian project “Exploring Russian Food Top Sea Stations”.
Following the decision of the Mohamud Adi Coroner ' s Coroner ' s Court on Friday that the cause of death was not accidental, the police waited for the full report and for instructions from the Attorney-General ' s Office to take the next step.

The journalist learned from the Beijing City Forest Greening Authority that, in the recent 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China, the city of Beijing had recently adopted Chang-anang Street and its vicinity as its main axis, raising the landscape of the landscape in a comprehensive manner and creating a climate of peace and joy.
At present, all 12 square flower stands along Chang'an Street have been completed, with 20 million gardens of flowers all over the city dressed as beautiful capitals and dressed up for the national festival.
For days to come, the 12 lilydo-like, 3-story landscapes along Chang'an Street have attracted a large number of objective public visits and photographs.
These flower altars are very topical, starting with the “brilliant 70 years” at the north-west corner of the founding gate, and ending with the “good tomorrow” at the north-east corner of the revival gate, and are a tribute to the remarkable achievements of the new China in all fields in its 70 years of existence and a demonstration of the happiness of the people.
The director of the Beijing Parks and Gardens Greening Bureau explained that this year ' s greening of the environment took full advantage of its own innovations and brought together new domestic and international varieties and technologies.
More than 230 varieties have been applied as a whole, including 16 autonomous breeds, 18 green anti-reverse new varieties and 11 indigenous plants.
The country's self-proclaimed "Cool and Fashion" and "Autumn Candy" and "Autumn and Autumn" are being used for the first time.
In an effort to celebrate the National Day, Beijing has also recently undertaken a comprehensive clean-up of the city-wide landscape-greening landscape environment by replanting more than 12,000 logs, 230,000 shrubs and 2.3 million square metres of grass roots.
At the same time, 200 thematic flowerpots have been set up in important areas such as the city-wide roundabout, the Long An Street Extension Line, the Shan Memorial Site, the perimeter of the new airport and the perimeter of the major tourist attractions.

According to the Central News Agency, on 26 local time, United States health officials indicated that 12 people had died from e-smoking-related diseases throughout the United States and 805 cases of lung damage related to e-smoking.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States reported these figures and indicated that specific substances leading to the disease had not yet been identified.
However, most patients reported the use of electronic smoke products containing tetrahydrocannabinol, the main compound in cannabis that affected mental state.
The surge in lung cases is known to be related to the purchase of contaminated electronic smokers on the black market.
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the above-mentioned 12 deaths occurred in 10 states ranging from California to Florida, and 805 confirmed and suspected cases were notified by 46 states and the United States Virgin Islands.

When's the next bus coming?
"The Internet + Smart Station" gives you some insight.
On 27th, the Nanjing Smart Traffic Union Goth map announced that the first Internet + Smart Stations in the country would be officially in Nanjing, when 54 public transport electronic screens would be lit, which would result in a full upgrade of Nanjing's information services, greater efficiency of public transport services and public access.
In the past, the anxiety scenes of waiting vehicles were performed almost every day at the bus stop.
It is difficult to predict the duration of the bus, the condition of the bus route and the location of the vehicle, and the issue of the public handing over of the pain points needs to be resolved, especially in some major cities, where long commuting times and complex traffic conditions during morning and evening peak hours make it difficult to guarantee the speed of the bus.
To this end, Nanjing Wisdom Transport, together with the Goth Map, explored the new orientation of “Internet+Travel” and launched the country's first “Internet+Intelligent Station” intellectual service project.
According to the information received, the first Internet + Smart Stations in the country landed in Nanjing, integrating Grand de Gold data with the expected time frame of Goose's vehicle ETA algorithm, and relying on public transport electronic stations and mobile Internet and large traffic data upgrades to achieve a public transport smart site
Through the Internet + Smart Station, Nanking citizens not only have easy access to the expected arrival of the bus, the real-time location of the bus and the number of stops at the current site, but also have a three-colour visualization of the roadway through orange green.
Thanks to the “Internet+Intelligent Station” technology, the citizens of Nanjing have achieved easy and efficient public hand-over procedures such as “access to public transport places before leaving the country, know the time of arrival, and know the time of arrival at the destination at the time of the bus”.
On the basis of real-time bus information from Internet+smart stations, it is possible to select the most suitable travel route for itself, while at the same time providing psychological expectations and reducing the anxiety of waiting vehicles, thus making travel easier.

The Deputy Director of the Department of Antiquities of the Park Service, Xia Li Jia, introduced the high-level exhibition of cultural objects in number, variety of items and age of exhibits.
Nearly 30 per cent of the exhibits are State-level and secondary cultural objects, and the age spans from commercial generations to the years of cleanness.
Over 3,000 years have passed since the exhibition, and one of the “oldest” bronze artifacts was displayed for this exhibition; the green oxen are huge in size and weigh close to 80 pounds and are carved from a whole piece of green oxen, preserved in perfect order and rare; and the rocks are very rare.
According to Qin Lei, Deputy Director of the Beijing City and Park Administration, this cultural exhibition, in the spirit of keeping cultural objects “live”, is based on the idea of gardening in Beijing and the park “Fukuyama Sea”, and is carried by the collection of “Future Life” objects for visitors through the exhibition.
According to the information received, the exhibition will continue until 30 January 2020.
Xinhua Times Review: We're on our own.
The White Paper " China and the World of the New Age " , published on 27 September, answered that China ' s development had been successful for 70 years, and that the fundamental reason was that, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people had found the right path to development, with the socialism of the Chinese identity, and had followed it with determination.
China follows its own path of development. It is the choice of history and of its people.
In recent times, in a climate of poverty and internal and external distress, generations of human beings have sought and followed the path of national salvation.
However, “the constitutional monarchy, the reintroduction, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, the presidential system have all thought about and tried, and none of this will work.”
It was only with the Communist Party of China and the new China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a socialist path of Chinese identity in practice.
China ' s path is one of happiness for the Chinese people, the revival of the Chinese nation and the common development of China and the rest of the world.
It is on the right path that China can do its job well, become the second largest economy in the world and contribute most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As stated in the White Paper, China ' s development path, which is consistent with China ' s national circumstances and adapted to the requirements of the times, will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.
In retrospect, the Chinese people know how hard it is to find the right path, which they value even more in view of the world.
The Chinese understood the logic of South Orange and understood that what was good for others was not good for themselves, but best for themselves.
It is with this road of self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created a world-renowned miracle.
In the course of the twists and turns of the human race, the “end of history” was famous for a while.
Today, the success of the socialist path of China’s identity has brought to an end the “end of history”, the collapse of the “China collapse” and the failure of the “socialist failure.”
China ' s success had boosted the confidence of developing countries to become rich and powerful and had expanded the way for developing countries to become modern. It had provided experience and lessons for countries and peoples in the world that wished to accelerate their development while maintaining their independence and to follow a path that was consistent with their national circumstances.
The world is rich and diverse.
China has always respected the right of each country to choose the path of development appropriate to its own circumstances.
China will not “enter” the foreign model, nor “export” the Chinese model, but will resolutely pursue its own path, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen exchanges with countries on governance and good governance, and make its due contribution to the common realization of good governance and good governance.
At Fair Work Commission, it was found that a 66-year-old female worker was dismissed by text from the owner of the Foodworks supermarket because he preferred to hire employees from an Asian background, whose practices were strongly criticized as “honourable”.
The Board stated that Ms. Gail Ayton's boss, Jianbin Wang, English name Eddie, who had worked at Wagga store for more than 20 years, had treated her employees in a way that was “unfair” and could violate the anti-discrimination law.
Ms. Ayton told the Committee that Mr. Wang had taken over the shop in 2016 and that he had “wanted to fire me” because she was not Chinese.
In this case, the Vice-Chairman of the Commission, Peter Sams, conducted a search on the Internet and found that “Mr. Wang had published a number of job advertisements in various Australian employment forums in the past”.
Among the job requirements listed for these positions, one said “the first Asian woman” and the other “the first Asian employee”.
The third post states that he “would prefer overseas people (sic)”.
Mr. Wang dismissed Ms. Ayton by text message in April this year, later claiming that this was due to her absence from work and the alleged small cash deficit of $5.10 to $30 on the cash register.
Mr. Sams stated, however, that Mr. Wang ' s reasons for dismissing Ms. Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
She's only been absent from one of her classes for three years, and the missing amount amounts to a few Australian dollars.
He said that Ms. Ayton's dismissal was “in fact unrelated to her conduct or performance”.
He said, “It seems to me that, supported by the evidence of Mr. Wang's advertisement for the job, the real reason why she should be fired is that he prefers to hire employees with an Asian background.
According to section 772(f) of the Fair Work Act (FairWork Act), Mr. Wang's actions appear to constitute a violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or an unlawful dismissal of the applicant.”
Mr. Sams stated that it was not appropriate for Mr. Wang to consider reinstating Ms. Ayton's position in view of his “horrifying” treatment.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, a temporary worker with an hourly salary of $26.
In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and labour relations legislation, Sams indicated that he would submit his own decisions and documents to the Committee for consideration as to whether Mr. Wang ' s actions should be transferred to other bodies to investigate possible violations of state or federal laws.
He states that Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
He said, “I think it would be appropriate for the defence to take an irresistible, unfair and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant, and Mr. Wang “wait” for the opportunity, which, in his view, would ‘prove’ the termination of the applicant’s employment.”
“He was wrong ... to dismiss the applicant in total disregard of any natural justice and, astonishingly, his imprudent and grossly unjust perfunctory conduct.”
Mr. Sams said that while Foodworks is a small business, “it must be said frankly that no decent employer will dismiss an employee in the most unfair and perfunctory manner recognized in this case.”
He said, "This is shameful and extremely unfair."
Guangtai is on the run for the Golden Week, increasing the number of passenger trains 175 - China's new network.
On 27 September, a journalist from Guangqing, Guangzhou, was informed by Guangqing that, in order to meet the need for passengers to travel on the Golden Week on the National Day, Guangqiang will be driving an additional train in the hot direction, bringing the total number of passenger trains to 175 during the holiday days.
The Hiroshima Group will undertake a number of initiatives to provide passenger services during high-flow periods.
The three-storey security corridor was optimized at the south station in Guangzhou, with 12 additional security routes and a total of 44 security corridors in the third-storey waiting room. In addition, 19 self-help real-name validation devices were added at the south station in Guangzhou to facilitate access to the passenger flow line
In order to ease the presence and congestion of vehicles on the South South Station, three new parking lots will be opened in Guangzhou South Station, adding 1,000 parking spaces and easing the pressure on the perimeter of the South Station.
The Shenzhen North station will open a “high-trail” free green passage.
From 6 to 7 October, at the height of the flow, the A2 exit at Shenzhen North Station will be connected to the subway, with a free passage route to facilitate the movement of passengers arriving at the peak hours.
In addition, East and West Square will regularly set up the U-Claire Fast Track to serve passengers who arrive at the station 15 minutes before driving, as well as special priority passengers.
On the eve of the Golden Week on the occasion of the National Day, a full-time training programme was conducted to ensure that the entire crew, who performed the functions, learned the knowledge of the business, improved the quality of the service and ensured that the train attendants performed every trip with a good mental face and a more professional standard of business and performed every trip in order to provide better services to the passengers.
Six people denied being involved in the sale of pseudo-macca paper, and the case was referred to the High Court.
Six men suspected of counterfeiting and selling our passports, printed papers and identity cards, including an assistant director of the National Register and a businessman at the rank of governor, passed the case on Thursday, and the magistrates approved the charges against trafficking in persons and trafficking in migrants and referred them to the High Court for trial.
Among them was the defence counsel for the Chinese-Chinese defendant Le Zhenhua (translation), as well as Congressman Ryer of Sunset Hole District, who applied to the judge to withdraw from the hearing on behalf of the defendant and ceased to represent the defendant, and was granted leave in court.
He states that he himself attracted criticism from his political opponents by representing the accused, and that his party of action was also implicated.
He stressed that he was not afraid of any threat in himself, but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to discredit the Action Party and the Greek Government or other Greek leadership, and that the decision was taken after careful consideration.
He adds that there is no conflict of interest between representing the accused and being a member of Parliament, that he is not legally prohibited from representing any of the accused and that, to date, the accused Le Zhenhua has not been convicted.
The six accused were charged before the courts on 12 September of this year and denied their guilt and were not granted bail pending trial, in the face of numerous charges under article 26E of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Trafficking in Migrants Act and article 466 of the Criminal Code (forgery of documents).
On Thursday, two District Judge Noshaha and Mazlan granted the prosecution ' s application for referral to the High Court of charges against the six accused for anti-trafficking in persons and anti-trafficking in migrants, following the arguments of both parties; the charges of forgery of documents will be heard in the District on 3 October.
The earlier six defendants were arrested under the National Security Offences (Special Measures) Order 2012 (SOSMA) and the judge therefore did not grant bail.
Walking with the motherland — a unit of the Armed Police.
A unit of an armed police force of an average height of 1.83 metres was in a busy state of training at the military parade.
Shining spears, unique olive greens and red shoulders together form a bright landscape.
The day before, journalists walked into the party and felt the determination of the military police officers to remain party and loyal to the people, as well as their “honour above all” love and pursuit.
“Dreams shine a glorious life, writing the immortal legends of a new era...” this is a team song written by a team of soldiers and soldiers – Walking with the Fatherland.
In the team, this song is the motto of every member of the team.
Qui Xiaolight, 1.92 metres tall, was particularly visible on the side team.
He has a deeper understanding of honour as the champion of the former Carabinieri flag.
The honor of the military comes from hard training.
Qui Xiao Guang, a flagr, has always been a high standard of training.
He was strapped to sandbags, stuck to a second watch for speed, blindfolded for gadgets, and stabilized with a stormy wind.
In his “flag career”, there is a picture that remains unforgettable.
A flag-raising ceremony brought down heavy rains, while none of the tourists who came to watch the flag-raising ceremony left.
The moment the flag was raised, Xiaoqing felt deeply the glory represented by the five-star red flag on his shoulder.
In 2019, Qui Xiaoqiao was selected as the base soldier.
The base soldier and the flagman have different standards of movement.
Xi Xiao Guang explained that more than 20 paces of progress in the movement of flagmen and benchmark soldiers had to be followed by more efforts in training.
The benchmark is the first in the first row and directly determines the level of alignment of the formations.
After intensive training by the parade, he repeatedly kicked his legs on a daily basis and practiced hard kicks.
In the demonstration, he won a round of applause at the exact scale and speed of his march.
Almost every member of the team has the same experience as Xi Xiao Guang.
Two decades ago, the father of the soldier, Zhu Xu, was a participant in the 50th anniversary parade.
In order to follow his father ' s footsteps as a member of the team, he suffered repeated setbacks but was never discouraged.
He said, “It is an honor for me to walk through Tiananmen Square like my father, and to be seen by the party and the people in my life, and I will suffer whatever it takes.”
"The Master of the Capital's Stabilisation" has eight large words in his eyes.
Mr. Wang Xian, the team members are all from the Beijing Brigade of the Carabineros — an army with a glorious tradition that has carried out major tasks such as the opening of the country, the celebration of the National Days, the security of the National Congresses of the parties and the maintenance of counter-terrorism in the capital.

Viet Nam needs to seize opportunities for artificial intelligence development.
The four criteria used to assess and rank cities in terms of their level of preparedness to face the AI wave include prospects, ability to realize, asset base and development direction.
Singapore is ranked first, followed by cities in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an expert from the organization, responded to an interview with a journalist on behalf of Mohin Pevana, saying: “I find it very interesting to review and assess cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam.
On the whole, I believe that Viet Nam ' s future is bright in a context of high growth rates, strong economic development paths and rapid growth of the human base.
I think Viet Nam is on the right track and doing well.
It is important that Viet Nam know how to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the fourth industrial revolution to promote more economic development.”
Artificial intelligence is completely transforming people ' s work, communication and way of life.
It brings with it greater efficiency, but it also poses a threat of increasing social, economic and technological inequality.
However, according to a global study organized by Oliver Wyman, there are no cities in the world today that are ready for the breakthroughs of the age of artificial intelligence.
Guterres expressed his pleasure to celebrate China ' s 70th anniversary here together and congratulated the Chinese Government and people on their impressive achievements over the past 70 years.
Gutierrez said, “Every time I visit China, I am shocked by the pace of change and progress.
You created one of the most dynamic economies in the world, and helped lift more than 850 million people out of poverty – the greatest poverty alleviation achievement in history.”
He said that in achieving the vision of the Millennium Development Goals, China had witnessed transformative results: infant and maternal mortality rates had declined, nutrition had improved, the number of stunted people had decreased and the number of people without access to safe drinking water and sanitation had been halved.
At the same time, China has one of the best educational systems in the world, attracting international students from all over the world.
The photo exhibit celebrating the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China is open today at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
Guterres stated that this year also marks the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations presence in China.
Over the past 40 years, China has been a key player in the work of the United Nations and has been a pillar of international cooperation and multilateralism.
After advancing the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, China was actively pursuing the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As the second largest contributor to the regular and peacekeeping budgets of the United Nations, China has been a partner in ensuring the stability of United Nations activities.
China has contributed troops to eight peacekeeping missions, including more than 1,000 “Blue Helmets” soldiers on mission in South Sudan.

Wang Yi met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malawi, Kassala
On 26 local time, the Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malawi, Kassala, during his presence in New York at the United Nations General Assembly.

About 800 million people traveled to China on the Fourth of July to reflect the demand and supply of tourism in China.
About 800 million people will be traveling on the upcoming 11th Golden Week!
Large data from a number of tourism platforms show that the country ' s tourism consumer market is both supply and demand booming.
The CNM report projects that, in the light of previous national holiday tourism statistics, the number of domestic tourists is expected to be close to 800 million this year, and more than 7.5 million more trips are expected to take place abroad.
At present, tourists from more than 500 cities, covering 100 countries and territories, book products such as tours, free travel, customized tourism and local play, through the platform.
According to the Chinese Institute of Tourism, 726 million domestic tourists were hosted on the national holiday last year, an increase of 9.43 per cent over the previous year.
Not only will the number of tourists be renewed, but the increase in consumption will also be the “mode” of the holiday.
The couriers report that the national holiday, which cost more than $3,000 per person for inter-provincial tourism in the country, is an increase over the same period last year, as tourists generally opt for better-experienced products, such as high-rated brand hotels, shopping-free tours, elite groups, car-specific guides, etc.
There is a similar trend, as data from the Donkey Mother's Travel Network bookings show that “principal groups” of less than 10 people are more popular than in previous years, using comfortable cars throughout the long line of the country.
Spring and fall tourism data show that their consumers prefer “slow-paced” experiences, services and differences.
On the other hand, data on flying pigs show that the country’s four-line and suburban tourist arrivals are growing fastest, at a 30-per-cent rate on a year-on-year basis, refracturing the rising consumption of more parts of the country’s population.
Personalization is a major feature of this year's Golden Week.
Portfolio data show that the annual holiday rental car is expected to grow by nearly 60% compared to the same year, while the short-distance travel of small groups of people visiting the perimeter continues to be acclaimed; private group registrations have increased by up to 155% compared to the previous year.
The sharing of joy has become the main purpose of people ' s tourism and leisure.
Portfolio data show that 28 per cent of visitors to the holidays on the occasion of the National Day are parents and children, 25 per cent are couples and 23 per cent are colleagues and friends.
In terms of the age of tourists, “after 80” and “after 90” account for more than 50 per cent of the total number of visitors.
It is a matter of concern that, unlike in the past, there has been a more rapid growth in the gold sector of the country, and that the domestic market has shown a more “optimal” performance this year.
Flying pig data show a 42% increase in the number of bookings for the country’s cultural and travel routes this year’s national holiday, exceeding the speed of the trip.
Industry analyses that, while demand is strong, tourism supply side reforms are being promoted across the country to provide tourists with a richer “unique feast”.
For example, the National Directorate of Sports and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism have recently issued a joint launch of the “Fine Lines for Sports and Tourism for the 11th Golden Week of 2019”; the launch of 7 cultural and tourist events in Shanghai in 2019, which attracted foreign and Chinese tourists; and the proximity of the Golden Week, Henan and Zhejiang.
Portfolio data show that destinations with unique natural or cultural characteristics are the most “fire” in the country, and Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xian, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing and Tianjin will be the most popular tourist destinations in the country.

China is expected to become the largest export market for beef in Australia.
An animal protein analyst from the Dutch Cooperative Bank (Rabobank) said that, following the outbreak of the African pigpest, China faced a severe shortage of pork and was expected to become Australia ' s largest export market for beef.
In the wake of the outbreak, Chinese consumers are shifting from eating pork to other animal proteins, which has led to the destruction of many herds by the authorities. In the past year, the number of live pigs in China has been halved and the price of pork has almost doubled.
China produces and consumes two thirds of the world ' s pork.
According to Chenjun Pan, a senior animal protein analyst from the Dutch cooperative bank in China, demand for other meats, including beef, has increased, China, the world ' s largest animal protein importer, currently imports 27 per cent of the world ' s pork, and beef imports account for the world ' s imports.
Ms. Ban said that Chinese imports of beef from Australia had increased by 65 per cent in the first half of the year, and China had surpassed the United States and Japan and had become Australia ' s largest export market for beef.
Yesterday, the Chinese Government stated that more pork would be released from emergency reserves before the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party.

To date, 34 African-related projects have been launched as a new platform for triangular cooperation between China, Africa and the United Nations.
On the road to peace and development in Africa, China will continue to stand firmly with Africa and to join hands.
The world's highest-age barber died at the age of 108 and had his hair cut for 96 years.
There's Anthony Mancinelli, the world's highest-age barber certified in the world record in New York, in the United States. He's 108 years old. He's never retired.
According to CNN, Mancinelli emigrated to the United States when he was eight years old, helped to clean the floor in a barber shop, and began to pick up scissors for customers at 12 years old, thereby easing the economic pressure in the home.
Mancinelli, although attending primary school at that time, did not graduate.
The son of Mansinelli, Robert, revealed that his father loved work and people from all over the world loved him, but he was diagnosed with cancer in February this year, and was unable to work for physical reasons for six weeks before he died, but it wasn't retirement because he was planning it.
Robert, 82 years old, said that he had to find a new barber now after his father died, because he had been asked to cut his hair for the rest of his life.
During the year, listed companies bought back more than $100 billion in historic heights - Xinhuanet.
In order to stabilize the value of the company and maintain its image, listed companies have begun to buy back shares more frequently in the last two years and, through targeted buy-backs and pooling of competitive transactions, wish to convey to the market the information that the value of the company is undervalued, thereby stabilizing the value of the stock and enhancing investor confidence.
According to Eastern Wealth Choice data, 7.9 billion yuan in 2017 was used by listed companies to buy back shares, which jumped to 51 billion yuan in 2018. Since 2019, A shares have been repurchased for a total of over 100 billion yuan.
From the point of view of the purpose of the repurchase, the company's repurchase of shares appears to be on the same increase as that of the major shareholder, but it varies considerably in terms of the subject of the implementation, the source of funds, the purpose of the repurchase, and the equity interest in the stock itself.
Xu Yang, Chairman of McCoron Information Consulting Limited, Shanghai, in an interview with the Daily Securities Journal journalist, stated that the Opinion on Support for Repurchase of Stock by Listed Companies, published in November 2018, addressed the narrow scope of stock buy-backs, the complexity of decision-making procedures and the inventory system.
In January of this year, the closing offices officially published the Regulations on the Implementation of Repurchase of Stock by Listed Companies, which broadens the sources of funding for repurchase by listed companies, streamlines implementation procedures, guides improved governance arrangements, and encourages listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee ownership.
Following the issuance of the opinion, the listed company performed the repurchase of shares, which was more applicable, the repurchase process was easier and the repurchase of shares was more motivated.
Repurchase of shares at relatively low positions would also facilitate the efficient use of funds by listed companies, thereby increasing the level of profitability per share, increasing the rate of return on net assets and reducing the pressure on corporate profitability indicators.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies is even more significant than the increase in large shareholders and reflects the willingness of listed companies to manage their market value and cash flows.
Xuyang argued that undervaluation was a major factor in repurchases by listed companies, which were no longer able to reflect their future development prospects, and that such companies deserved the attention of investors, but could not invest blindly, and that attention needed to be paid to the financial statements and the specific operations of such listed companies.
Listed companies with large-scale buybacks at least demonstrate their development confidence and financial strength.
The repurchase enthusiasm of A-listed companies has also led to a steady increase in repurchase behaviour, with data showing that nearly a thousand listed companies have implemented repurchases this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the main players in the buy-back market.
China recently disclosed the progress of repurchases, stating that the company had accumulated 57.559 million shares, or 0.315 per cent of the company ' s total stock, through a centralized competitive exchange, and that the total amount of funds paid was 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction costs), and that the repurchases would be used entirely for employees.
Eli shares have been paid $5,792 million for repurchase of shares, and recent adjustments have been made to the use of repurchase shares, with the original plan to replace “repurchase shares will be fully used as a source of later implementation of equity incentives” with “cumulative repurchase of 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares will be used for implementation
The Ili shares indicated that the write-off of some of the repurchased shares would contribute to a further increase in the level of return per share and to an effective increase in the return on the investment of the company ' s shareholders.
On 25 September, the TCL Group issued an announcement on the progress of repurchases, indicating that TCL had accumulated 3.39 per cent of its shares, at a total cost of $1.65 billion.
The TCL Group Board Office stated to the Daily Securities Journal journalist that repurchases would be used for employee holding schemes, equity incentives or to convert corporate bonds issued by listed companies into equities.
The TCL Group adheres to established business strategies to continuously improve competitiveness and sustain healthy development.
Based on confidence in the future development of the company and the preservation of investor interests, the company plans to repurchase its shares using its own funds, self-financing and other forms of financing, taking into account, inter alia, the performance of the company ' s second-tier market over the past year and taking into account the company ' s business and financial situation.
According to Yang Delong, the chief economist at the former Kaitsu Foundation, the operation of stock buybacks by listed companies would, on the one hand, reduce the number of shares in the market and increase each share of the earnings of listed companies, which would be an important benefit for the stock price of the secondary market; and, on the other hand, the willingness of listed companies to come forward with real cash and silver from the stock market.
Repurchases by domestic listed companies have been increasing in recent years, particularly for merit-based shares, and it is an excellent way to boost investor confidence through stock buy-backs, as well as a positive and encouraging approach.
Hunan Province Standing Committee, Changsha City Council Secretary Hu Hshuhua and the four heads of the engineering and engineering machinery manufacturing army — Jan Junxin, Liang Biangen, Ho Qinghua, Liu Fei-fiang — set a “small target” around “From engineering machinery to intelligent manufacturing”
The construction of the world's leading engineering and mechanical cluster in Changsha, in the current fashion, is “the strongest on the surface”.
As the capital city of the Inland Province, Changsha shouts such rhetoric.
It's based on the power of hegemonic leaks.
The four engineering and mechanical companies that took part in the dialogue, each with its own skills, covered the entire field of the sky, the ground, the sea and the land: a light plane with a mountain river intelligence, a concrete transport pump for the Central United Nations Heavy Section, a full ground crane for the trio, and iron construction.
At some point, China had virtually no voice in the field of engineering and machinery manufacturing.
In a time of transition, Chinese firms “introduction” “outward” two-wheel drive, taking advantage of the eastward winds of the “one-way” initiative, a combination of acquisition, mergers, plant-building, etc., has become a global industry of engineering and machinery.
Among them, the leading engineering and mechanical enterprises, such as the three-carrying industry, the Central and Central Joint Heavy Unit, the iron and steel construction industry and the mountain river intelligence industry, have taken a significant lead on key economic indicators such as the value of production, market ownership and sales.
It's time for the camera to move.
The "Four Great Kongs" of the Engineering Mechanics are among the elites of the Changsha Engineering and Mechanical Industries, as well as leading companies in the global engineering and mechanical industries.
In the world ' s industries, it is hard to say who survives and lives well.
In earlier years, the global engineering and machinery industry had suffered a cold winter, and a number of internationally recognized engineering and machinery manufacturing companies had fallen, but Changsha's engineering and machinery manufacturing industry had used the word "cat winter" as a "winter swim", self-pressure, self-determining, through the transformation of the industrial structure, from manufacturing to intelligence.
It’s because the moon’s politics are shared by the stars.
The development of industries of advantage requires both active enterprise and government action.
Changsha's reputation for “the capital of engineering machinery” is that it brings together a whole industry chain from upstream to downstream, creates a number of clusters of related industries, and provides services by optimizing the business environment, improving the supporting services, simplifying the approval process, etc., and the cost of R & D, manufacturing and marketing for enterprises.
Good business ecology has led to the emergence of engineering and machinery manufacturing enterprises.
History has pushed the sand to the front desk of the world ' s leading engineering machine.
Both Governments and enterprises, as well as the producers and researchers associated with them, should seize opportunities, step up, target and sustain their efforts to contribute to the creation of powerful countries.
Wang Yi chaired the meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of China and the African States members of the Security Council.
Wang Yi said that China was a good brother and partner with African countries.
China stands firmly with its African brothers in the past, in the present and in the future.
We have advocated the convening of such a meeting of foreign ministers as a concrete step in the implementation of the important consensus reached between President Xi and the leaders of African countries at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation last September, in order to strengthen China's solidarity with African countries in the Council and to promote better international support for peace and development in Africa.
Wang Yi said that Africa was China ' s most important and trusted partner.
As a permanent member, China's vote in the Council has always belonged to a large number of developing countries, including African countries.
In the face of the new situation, China stands ready to work with African countries in the Council to strengthen solidarity and cooperation and to safeguard common interests.
The two sides should be united in their efforts to resolve disputes through consultation, self-reliance and development.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the African States participating in the Conference thanked China for its initiative to convene the Conference and congratulated the New China on its seventieth anniversary.
The Ministers stated that the relationship between Africa and China is based on equality and mutual respect and that Africa and China have always been the most trusted and trusted partners to each other.
It appreciated the important positive role played by China, as a permanent member of the Security Council, in African affairs, which had contributed significantly to a just and reasonable solution to Africa ' s problems and had made great efforts and contributions to the defence of Africa ' s interests and to the promotion of peace and security in Africa.
At a time when Africa faces the threat of terrorism and extremism, only by addressing security issues can Africa truly achieve long-term peaceful development.
We look forward to further coordination of positions with China in the Council and enhanced solidarity and cooperation.
Wang Yi said that there was an important consensus at today's meeting.
We all support the preservation of multilateralism, the strengthening of the authority and role of the United Nations, the maintenance of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rejection of unilateralism and hegemony; we all agree to strengthen mutual supportive cooperation between Central Africa in the affairs of the United Nations and the Security Council and to safeguard the common interests of Central Africa and the developing countries in general; we all support the African approach to African issues and call upon the United Nations to provide financial support for African-owned peace operations; and we all support it.
Gansu Qingyang: The lake sheep came to "get out of poverty".
The autumn of September rewrite the Yellow-Team Plateau.
The 58-year-old villager, Xavili, in a professional cooperative for the development of livestock in the town of El Ma, filled the canteens with the last herbs in the sheep, standing by the pits and watching the white lake sheep chewing.
"Eat well, when the fall and winter are full, you can get a good price out of the fence."
Xavilli says he feeds the sheep every day, regularly cleans and disinfects them, and takes care of themselves.
After more than 20 years of raising sheep, it was not until she came to work in the cooperative that she knew how rough herds were in the past.
Xavili is a member of the village of the summer flood pool in the town of Qingyang, Qingyang commune, Gansu province.
His right-hand neighbour is a sheep-breeding family, but he adheres to the traditional way in which the sheep are dispersed, of poor quality and of low standing.
In June of this year, 140 poor people in the village joined cooperatives under the guidance of the Government, and everything began to change.
Xavier Xavier spent all day working on farming because he was always holding on to it.
The stockholders, who are poor households, hold the sheep in trust to the cooperative and rely on him if they can divide the money and sell it at the end of the year.
It's good to have technical guidance, he learns to control the disease, he masters scientific feeding, and he becomes “good” for a small number of farm animals in the village.
The Professional Cooperative for the Benefit is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1,400 lake goats.
The cooperative leader, Zoutao, said that there were doors both inside and outside standardized sheep sheds.
"The wool is thick, it can easily breed bacteria, the lake sheep can't stay in a hot, wet place, the shed must be built in a three-sided ditch, and it must be filled with a wind changer to ventilate and evaporate the heat."
Zoutao stated that, in order to prevent the disease, it was also necessary to spray and disinfect sheep regularly and give them three to four vaccination needles during the quarter.
In addition to living well, the “fat” have to eat herbs that are mixed with green grains, wheat herbs, herbs, etc., and are sufficiently wide to stretch their bones in a playground.
The cooperative, using a foster-care approach, directs local farmers to place good-breeding, management, marketing, good-planting, scientificization, standardization and intensive farming.
Today, 140 poor households with sheep in their shares receive more than $6,000 per household per year, and four poverty-alleviation recipients work in cooperatives.
From the word "grassing" to the word "precision feeding", from the word "local mating" to the word " artificial insemination", from the words "see body size, touch belly" to the word "B super-by-b" in Gansu Qingyang, goat farming is more than just feeding.
Zoutao said that if market prices were weak, the local leader, Gansu Shun Sheeng Farming Development Co. Ltd., would buy up at a market price of $27 per kilogram, helping farmers to spread market risk.
Xu Jianfeng, General Adviser, Gansu Agricultural and Livestock Development Co. Ltd., said that enterprises had led an increasing number of poor households to learn about the “goats” through the provision of credit guarantees, sheep farming, order farming, purchase of quotations, and integrated processing and marketing services for poor households.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families achieved a steady increase in their harvests through the cultivation of grasses, the breeding of good seeds, large-scale farming, the division of slaughter and the marketing of the market in the “confederation”.
The city of Qingyang is located in a staggered northern agricultural belt and has abundant resources for herbing.
Currently, there are 913 large-scale sheep farms, cooperatives and more than 5 million goats, and two 1.3 million meat and sheep slaughter-scale processing production lines have been built throughout the city, and the herds are becoming “lead sheep” for poverty alleviation in the industry.
The French Chancellor said he'd cut taxes by more than €10 billion next year and called on Germany to follow suit.
September 26th, Reuters -- French Chancellor Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros (US$ 10.9 billion) next year, and that Germany should keep pace with France’s fiscal stimulus in order to revive its depressed economy.
In presenting the French budget for 2020, Le Mel stated that the European Central Bank’s latest monetary easing initiative had created an opportunity for Governments of capable member States to increase investment.
The ECB reached a record low in interest rates on 12 September, and plans to restart its purchase debt in order to lower borrowing costs in the hope of stimulating economic recovery and boosting inflation.
“The low interest rates will not allow Europe to prosper again, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough”, Lemel said to journalists.
“Germany needs to invest, and the sooner it needs to, the better. Don't wait until things get worse,” he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany on several occasions.
This year, France has implemented tax cuts of over €10 billion, which have greatly boosted its economic growth.
The global economy had lost its dynamism and the German economy, which was dependent on exports, had borne the brunt.
Le Mel noted that next year the tax burden on French families will be reduced by €9.3 billion, including €5 billion in income tax relief.
In addition, as the corporate tax rate is gradually reduced from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent over a five-year period, the enterprise tax burden will be reduced by almost Euro1 billion.

Research: The U.S. National Healthy Diet Index has increased slightly, but still presents challenges - China Net
According to the U.S. News Network, a recent U.S. study recently showed a moderate increase in the U.S. Government's healthy diet index over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58.
This is not to be celebrated, however, with a 100-point mark.
American nationals continue to face “substantial challenges” in their diet.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Fanfan, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University, Massachusetts, said that Americans still consume too much food that could cause diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and obesity, which are the most common diseases in the United States.
The study was published in the American Medical Association Journal in 24.
The study was based on the findings of a health survey of 44,000 adults conducted by the United States Government between 1999 and 2016.
The authors wrote that “despite significant improvements, there are significant dietary challenges”.
These challenges are known to include reducing the intake of foods containing saturated fat, such as snacks, hot dogs, fat cows, butter, etc., by United States nationals.
Research has found that the intake of these unhealthy fats in people ' s daily diet has increased from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent, exceeding the recommended 10 per cent limit.
The biggest improvement in America’s national diet is the drop in sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but the intake is still too high.
Officially, sugar-added intake should be less than 10 per cent in daily diets.
With regard to the reasons for the decline in sugar intake, researchers believe that it is associated with a reduction in the use of sweet soda, but Zhang Fong stresses that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
The intake of fruits, nuts, oatmeal and other all-grain food categories has increased slightly among adults in the United States.
However, data for 2016 show that these foods still account for less than 5 per cent of the daily diet.
Although the intake of salt has decreased slightly and the consumption of juice has led to the intake of low-quality carbohydrates, Zhang aromatics indicate that they still account for up to 42 per cent of daily heat, many of which come from processed white bread and other refined grains.
The study is based on biennial personal health surveys that remind adults of the food they have eaten in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have been asked twice every few days since 2003.
The government has published a dietary guide for American residents that recommends a “healthy diet” to reduce the risk of chronic illness.
The guide states that people should consume more nutrient-intensive foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, thin meat, poultry meat, eggs and seed foods that can provide proteins.
At the time of the study, the number of people with diabetes in the United States almost doubled, to over 7%, and the obesity rate has also increased over the years – today about 70% of adults in the United States are overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among United States nationals.
EU promotes strategic partnerships with Asia
The Forum was attended by members of the Central Political Bureau of the Viet Nam Communist Party, the Secretary of the Central Registry and the Minister of the Central Economy, Nguyen Wenping.
Based on the close cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the theme of the Forum was “European Union-Asia twinning: building bridges for the future of sustainable development”.
The Forum took place one year after the implementation of the twinning strategy in the two continents of the European Union.
The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, stated that the strengthening of the interface was part of that idea, as it brought benefits to the peoples and economies of the countries concerned.
These relations have helped to bring stability and prosperity to all concerned.
At the same time, he believed that the European Union wanted to convey messages about increasing participation and consolidating mutually beneficial interfaces between Europe and Asia.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan was a special guest at the Forum and will make an important presentation in the plenary.
The country's first stock-management subsidiary was set up to run the business with a technology enabler.
On 26 June, the Great China Bank ' s wholly-owned subsidiary, Qingdao Finance Limited, was inaugurated in Qingdao, the country ' s first joint-stock bank finance subsidiary.
The experts indicated that asset management was an important area for the development of financial science and technology and that the establishment of financial subsidiaries by banks facilitated their use of science and technology to upgrade their operations.
In April of this year, the Bank of Guang Da and the Caller Bank issued separate circulars stating that they had been approved by the China Silver Insurance Supervisory Board to prepare for the construction of the finance subsidiary.
On 24 September, Gwang Da Bank announced that it had been officially authorized to open its operations.
Just two days later, the Grand Bank led a number of stock-based banks and took the lead in the establishment of the Qingdao Bank.
The Chairman of the Big Light Group, Lee Xiaoping, said that the Big Light Group would accelerate the pace of innovation by using modern technological thinking and tools, relying on big data, object networking, cloud computing, increasing the coverage, utilization and penetration of financial capital, and improving client access, happiness and security.
By 2021, the establishment of the “Eight Pillar” for the sound development of financial science and technology in the country will further enhance the capacity of the financial sector to apply science and technology, achieve greater integration and coordinated development of finance and technology, and significantly increase the population's satisfaction with digital, networked and intelligent financial products and services.
Mr. Zhang Xuyang, Chairman of Xuyang's Finance Board, introduced that the financial platform for Xujiang would use such technologies as intellectual investment, intellectual investment, big data, etc. to help Quasi better manage the macroeconomic situation.
New technologies, such as block chains, will also be applied in the future to capture trends and trends from traditional to alternative to digitally alternative assets.
The Special Research Fellow of the National Laboratory for Finance and Development, Dong Xijin, stated that, in the face of a new competitive situation in the financial sector, financial science and technology companies and financial institutions would explore new growth paths using capital and technology together.
Financial science and technology enablers are both a need for financial science and technology to transform itself and, above all, will inject new dynamism and dynamism into the development of financial services.
At the beginning of this year, Kyoto Digital Science and Technology launched a new technology management system to upgrade the production research and development and wind control capabilities of the capital through technology and digitalization.
The new system builds on product design, sales transactions, asset management and risk assessment capabilities to enhance the overall intellectual performance of the industry.
It was felt that while upgrading client service capabilities and innovative products, S&T could also enhance risk preparedness and efficiency in managing for capital.
Zhang Xuyang indicated that while the risk preferences used to locate clients through questionnaires were prone to deviations, the current use of artificial intelligence for user drawings helped to better locate clients and to roll out products in line with their investment preferences and to mitigate risks.
"Alternative big data, such as electricity, space and space data, can help us better carve a region, an industry’s activity, and a landscape."
Zhang Xuyang said that, while addressing risks, big data technology would also help to improve wind control capabilities.
The deepest record of the Chinese railway tunnels has been updated.
After more than 1,200 days of day and night construction on the 27th of September of the Sino-China Social Security Hill, the first well of the Gorlegong Hill Tunnel under the construction of the Grand Railway was completed on 27th, deep in the well.
The 34.5-kilometre-long Grand-Swee Railway Golligan Hill Tunnel, located in Yunnan, crosses the Golligan Mountains from the West Bank and is the longest double-line single-hole tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel runs through 19 fracture zones and is buried at a maximum depth of 1,155 metres, since it covers the undesirable geological and significant risks that may be encountered in the construction of almost all of the tunnels, known as the “Geological Museum” of the tunnel.
The erection of the wells is the most important auxiliary tunnel in the Goligon Hill Tunnel, with the important task of increasing the operational surface to achieve “silence” and later ventilation for railway operations.
The successful excavation of the first rig to the bottom of the well marks the construction of the formal entry-level tunnel at the Goligon Hill Tunnel, which, after the opening of the sub-drill and the replacement of equipment, could add four additional fields of operation to the well and speed up the opening of the tunnel.
“The wells are all over the granite layers, and, because of the fragmentation of the granite layers, they cannot stop the water, they keep flowing from the top to the bottom, and basically the depth of the wells is as high as the water pressure.”
The Chief Engineer of the Dare Railways Project of the Central Iron Tunnels Authority informed journalists that during the construction of the well, there had been a number of dangers, such as mud rushing and collapse, and that the builders had invited experts to take the pulse on site and over 20 discussions had been held on the treatment programme.
“The maximum influx of water in the wells amounts to more than 300 cubic metres per hour and more than 700 metres of the bottom of the well, with water pressure equal to 700 metres of the sea floor.”
"If we don't pump the drain in time, we'll flood the well 10 meters in an hour, we'll spend almost 85% of our time on water treatment, and 15% of our time on digging."
In order to overcome the geological difficulties of vertically controlled development of the rig 1 fence, slurry and water-rich granite, the tunnel construction was carried out using a combination of “exploration, injection and excavation” systems to treat water and reduce the risk of construction.
As a result of numerous improvements, the construction of rig 1 has resulted in mechanized water lines such as an excavator system, a puncture system, a suspension system, a winch lift system, and complete process mechanization operations such as eye beating, bursting, shattering, template installation, concrete construction, etc., which have accelerated the construction process
Ultimately, after more than 1,200 day and night works, the rig successfully completed the excavation at a depth of 762.59 metres.
The Grand Swe Railway, which is 330 kilometres long, is an important part of the international corridor in Central Myanmar and is an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the “one-way” construction.
With the construction of the bus, the travel time between Dalian and Reilly will be reduced from six hours to two hours on the current road, which will significantly improve transport patterns in the Farsi region and facilitate trade and trade cooperation between China and South-East Asian countries.
Lin Jung-seok: As a Chinese, he was proud of his country's achievements.
The Hong Kong press celebrates the 70th anniversary of the National Day.
“The Hong Kong press celebrates the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China”, 27 Hong Kong.
The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Lin Jung-hoon, in his speech at the wine conference, stated that the country ' s achievements over the past 70 years were well known and that we, as Chinese people, were proud.
Mr. Lin, Deputy Director of the Central Government Liaison Office in Hong Kong, Lu Shining, Deputy Special Envoy to the Hong Kong Department of Foreign Affairs, Song Hao An, Deputy Political Member of the Liberation Army Force in Hong Kong, Chen Aden, and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Hong Kong Press Committee for the celebration of the National Day were present at the wine fair and served as a gift.
In his message, Lin Jung-hoon noted that China, as a Chinese nation, is proud to have moved forward over the past 70 years and, even though it has faced many difficult challenges, has managed to overcome its excesses and its achievements are well known to the world.
Hong Kong ' s return to its homeland has been closely linked to the Mainland and has been working together to achieve fruitful results.
It is believed that under the premise of “one country, two systems”, Hong Kong will continue to have the advantage of taking advantage of the opportunities of the “one way” and the Great Bay of Australia in Hong Kong to find a better future for Hong Kong.
She added that over the past few months Hong Kong ' s social disputes had affected every Hong Kong citizen and that journalists faced different challenges.
At this critical juncture, it is to be hoped that friends of the press will continue to face up to the occasion, be professional, provide fair and balanced news coverage for the society and do their part for the future of Hong Kong, and for the community to resume its dialogue on rational communication.
In his message, Chon said that the glorious journey of the new China was also a journey of development, progress, blood ties, honour and dignity for Hong Kong and its motherland.
In particular, since the return of Hong Kong to its homeland, the Central Government has been steadfast in its approach of “one country, two systems”, “the Hong Kong people govern” and a high degree of self-government.
To that end, the Hong Kong press gathered to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China.
He stated that over the past three months, there had been a series of violent acts in flagrant violation of the law and wanton destabilization of society, which had been facilitated by the publication of distorted and false reports by some media outlets.
He called on the media to raise awareness and create a favourable climate for the population to resist violence and uphold the rule of law.
Professional media professionals are required to adhere to professional journalistic norms, use real reporting and responsible speech to guide citizens towards self-awareness and violence, and uphold the fairness and supremacy of the law.
Some 500 people from all walks of life, including the Hong Kong press, attended the wine fair and joined the guest of honour in a toast to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China.
The journalist learned from the Sinning City Council's Advocacy Department that the City of Sinning will be implementing, on 1 October, the Regulation on Promotion of Civility in Sinning City, which will focus on 15 uncivilised acts, such as traffic lights, throwing objects from buildings, and setting out a list of priority governance issues.
Wang Xingbin, Deputy Minister of Communication and Director of the City Civilization Department of the Sinning City Council, introduced the marked improvement in the culture and morality of civil civilization since the city was recognized as the nation ' s civilized city in 2017.
However, uncivil behaviour such as pedestrians crossing the streets, breaking through red lights, non-motorized vehicles not following traffic lights, high-altitude objects, window objects, smoking in public places, walking dogs in public places and allowing local defecation is still prominent and easy to rebound and needs to be addressed as soon as possible.
The regulations, taking into account the realities of Sinning, impose more comprehensive and higher standards on the norms of civilized conduct of individuals and units in a variety of areas, such as public places, public order, public facilities, public sanitation, civilized travel, civilized tourism, civilized Internet access, the building of civilized campuses, the promotion of civilized families, the performance of public duties, the honouring of heroic martyrs, medical services, etc.
“Providing regulations to eliminate blind spots and misperceptions in the field of civilized behaviour, including comprehensive regulations on citizens' conduct, homekeeping, meals, travel, education, tourism, Internet access, green life, wedding funeral rituals, etc., will provide a strong contribution to the normalization of the work of the popular spiritual civilization in Sinning City.

The British tourist car keys fell into the lake, and the whole family was trapped in France for five days.
In recent days, a couple from Wales, England, took two children on vacation to France and accidentally threw the car keys into the lake. The family was forced to wait five days to get the new keys from the car manufacturer.
The couple then left France with the children.
It was reported that on 16 September local time, when the British family was looking at a lake in France, her daughter accidentally knocked over a bag and the keys to the car in it fell into the lake.
But they took hours and couldn't find the keys.
And all their possessions and cash are locked in the car.
Although British tourists purchased insurance prior to their departure, the insurance company refused to help on the grounds that the vehicle was not in danger of being stolen.
They had to hire a trailer to pull it into a garage and store it, and then reorder the keys from the car manufacturer.
A few days later, British tourists finally obtained the key to the formulation and the couple left France with the children.
They were forced to cancel their scheduled journey because of the loss of car keys.
Saudi Arabia officially liberalized tourist visas for 49 countries, including China.
Since that date, the Kingdom has officially liberalized tourist visas for 49 countries, including China, at a total cost of SAR 440 (approximately RMB 836).
Visitors are required to prepare a medical insurance covering Saudi territory and to apply for an address in Saudi territory.
Visitors may apply for landing at the airport after landing, or for electronic signing through the service.visitsaudi.com.
Of these, the electronic signature is multiple entry for one year, allowing tourists to stay for up to 90 days.
For ordinary tourists, Saudi Arabia is the most mysterious country, as it has never issued a tourist visa.
In recent years, Saudi Arabia has promoted the “Vision 2030” plan, led by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with the aim of reducing the country's long-term dependence on oil, with the liberalization of tourism and the development of tourism as important components.
The Deputy Prime Minister of Belarus, Igor Liashenko, undertook a working visit to the province of Hing An, Viet Nam.
During the meeting, the Secretary of the Committee for Hing-an Province, Mr. Duzhing, highlighted the remarkable achievements of Belarus in industrial production and the investment of Belarusian enterprises in Hing-an Province.
The completion of the production and installation of the MAZ ASIA automobiles is an important step in the development of cooperation between enterprises in the two countries and contributes to the promotion of cooperative relations between the province of Hing-Aun and Viet Nam and Belarus.
The Secretary of the Committee for Hing-an Province, Mr. Dujins, stated that Hing-Aan Province had been facilitating Belarusian enterprises investing in the province and hoped that more vigorous measures would be taken in the future to encourage Belarusian enterprises to invest in Hing-an Province and Viet Nam, and to assist in the training of workers in the province and in the transfer of industrial production technology.

Pilot system of notification of commitments in areas such as licensing of food production for low-risk varieties, decentralization of foreign business representation to self-trade zones
On 27 September, the Shanghai Municipal Market Regulatory Authority signed a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Pudong Novi District to introduce 20 market regulatory reform measures, some of which were pilot projects throughout the country.
It was stated that the notification of an undertaking referred to the fact that the administrative authorities, in matters relating to the registration of permits, had informed the applicant in writing of the conditions and requirements set out in the laws and regulations.
Once the applicant has signed a promise, the administrative authorities can do so directly.
According to the memorandum, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority will support the registration of business names in the Pudong New Zone and the Shanghai Free Trade Pilot Area, permit the production of simple, low-risk food varieties, and inform commitment systems in three areas, such as partial metrology equipment type approval, to facilitate business access.
The Shanghai Xin Wan Food Company, 27, obtained on-the-spot Food Production Licences by means of a promise notification, becoming the first company to benefit from the pilot dividend.
The head of the business said that food permits could also be obtained on the spot, and that the “admissibility” approach, which allowed the enterprise to submit part of the information in accordance with the deadline agreed upon in the letter of commitment, was “really perceived as facilitating the reform.”
The Shanghai market regulator indicated that the system of notification of food production licences was a national pilot.
As a result of the reform, the processing process was reduced from six previously “Registration, Reception, On-Site Verification, Sample Examination, Examination of Materials, Approval of Documents” to three “Registration, Reception, Approval of Documents”, with the completion time being reduced from 20 working days prior to the reform to immediate closure.
Taking into account the high outward orientation of the Pudong economy, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority has delegated the registration of permanent representatives of foreign (regional) enterprises to the Shanghai Free Trade Area to facilitate the proximity of enterprises.
Statistics show that the decentralization involved a total of 1,592 permanent representative institutions in the Shanghai Free Trade Area, of which 99 were processed in accordance with the new regulations.
“11” Long-term fake consumer survey: choice of more diversity, tourism first.
The long holidays for the National Day are approaching, and people ' s vacation plans are gradually being finalized.
Nearly 20 feedbacks received from the Daily Securities journalist recently launched a small survey in the circle of friends on the “XI” holiday arrangements show that, while the plans vary, “tourism + consumption” becomes the key word for the “XI” holiday.
Specifically, more than half of the respondents to the Daily Securities Journal chose to travel.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said, “It was planned to take his family to Shanghai during the XI period, and Disney was the first stop and then went to the surrounding cities”; Ms. Lee, who was in Beijing, chose to travel to Taiwan, “a family of three”
A recent report on the trends of residents travelling and travelling on the Golden Week of 2019, published jointly with the same tour, shows a clear upward trend in consumption in the three subsectors of travelling, living and travelling on the Golden Week of the National Day this year.
There has been a steady increase in the penetration rate of aircraft, high-iron travel and an increase in the demand for star hotels and personalized unmarked accommodation.
On 23 September, the United States Mission published a report on trends in tourism consumption on the occasion of the 2019th anniversary, which showed that tourism consumption continued to flourish and showed an upward trend in “live-in” diversification.
More young people travel in favour of high-quality and distinctive experiences, and cultural tourism, night tourism, etc., continue to increase in heat.
In addition to tourism, various types of consumption demand were released centrally during the “XI” period.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the daily Securities Journal reporter, “The main plan of this year’s ‘XI’ is to buy a car.”
The staff of a Beijing car brand 4S shop said to the Daily Securities Reporter that, in general, September and October of each year were referred to as the golden period for the sale of cars.
During the “XI” period, a number of activities will be launched, such as drawings, placements, etc.
A number of brands have also recently introduced new models, and it is expected that the boost to sales of new products will be more visible.
In the context of rising consumption trends, greater attention is being paid to the need to meet the spiritual dimension, and the share of services, such as culture and education, is rising.
Ms. Dou, who lives in Beijing, said that “since the birth of a child, culture, education and consumption have become the bulk of household consumption expenditure.
This year’s ‘11’ is full, going to the ‘Catch Card’ Planetarium, the Children’s Theatre, a few family weekends to camp in tents at the Elk Museum, and some experimental lessons.”
According to the industry, in theory, the population ' s consumption is escalating along the path of subsistence consumption towards developmental consumption and enjoyment, with a large share of the enjoyment consumption falling within the category of service consumption.
As our economy continues to grow and the income level of our population rises, there is an increasing focus on consumption demand at the spiritual level, and tourism and travel are a good way to proceed.
In particular, the long holiday of the Eleventh National Day, which was more than sufficient in time, and the fact that people were more willing to travel and consume, was a reflection of both the spiritual demand for consumption and the rising consumption of the population.
The afternoon began to be lonely and reluctant to go out, and the children have not yet been brought to terms with their absence.
Get a hold of yourself and say to the dog, "Mom took you out."
He wrote a few details about the things he had to do, and the character of type A blood was getting stronger and he felt uncomfortable.
Take the suit, buy the nutrients, pay, buy the raw fish, the Nana snacks.
That's the reason for going out.
On the phone, thanks to the fact that she was in love with her sister, there was no excuse to buy snacks.
They laughed a couple of times and said the kid was on the phone and hung up.
Nana jumps on the sidewalk and falls down honestly. She knows she's sick, scared and unwilling to stay with me.
Her husband, Boo, came back early.
Even the salads of the salmon mixed with butter and fruit are good, and then go to the bedroom and watch TV on the bed.
A glance at the wall, just at 7 p.m., the sun sets early in the sunrise and it is dark.
The month was invented in the circle of friends, and today is Mid-Autumn.
Washed a bunch of grapes from a friend, left half to Boo, and left it in a little flower bowl that I liked and took out to see the moon.
And Nana sat on the ground, and she ate grapes, and she ate skins, and I vomited grape seeds far away.
And the moon is hidden in the clouds, so that they walk away, and the moon will suddenly appear, and the darkness will be dazzled.
The poems about the moon are rife in the brain, and it is only clear to like it: every three or five times a week / a round of clean protection of the jade fence / a round of the sky / a crowd of people looking up their heads.
Perhaps we have given the moon too much emotion. For me now, in fact, the word of God belongs to God, and Caesar to Caesar is the best.
The moon goes to the moon, your emotions go to you.
After eating the grapes, it's cold and cold.
The Nana Regiment snored slightly by its feet, stood up and laid Nana's little blanket over her little house, and Nana was happy to lie on it.
Open the door and shout: "Are the baths burned?
The windows in the bathroom do not look at the moon. They can only feel the moon, turn off the lights in the bathroom and lift the glass.
No mooncakes, no drinks.
A mascot was released at Dubai Expo 2020.
The 2020 Dubai Expo mascot launch ceremony was held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
The mascot consists of six cartoon images, including two Emirates children, three flying robots and a United Arab Emirates bean tree.
The launch presented information on six mascots to the audience through video clips.
A 9-year-old boy, Rashid, and an 8-year-old girl, Latifa, are brothers and sisters, representing the people of the United Arab Emirates.
Three robots correspond to the three sub-themes of the Expo, blue robots for "mobility", green robots for "sustainability", yellow robots for "opportunity".
An ancient bean tree named "Salama" is the "grandmother" of five little boys, symbolizing the ancestors who defended the land.
Ahmad, Chairman of the Dubai High Council of Expo, said that mascots could strengthen emotional ties between large-scale events and participants, “be sure that the mascots of the Dubai Expo will convey the traditional spirit of storytelling, demonstrate the creativity of indigenous talent and express our ambitions and expectations.”

The Dubai Expo will be held in Dubai from 20 October 2020 to 10 April 2021, on the theme “Communicating ideas for a future”.
This will be the first World Expo to be held in the Middle East region.
Starting next year, Chinese students can apply for German undergraduate studies on the basis of a high school exam.
In recent days, the Anabin database of Germany, which is responsible for the assessment and certification of foreign qualifications, announced on the Network that, starting in 2020, Chinese high school graduates can apply directly for undergraduate studies at German universities on the basis of a higher examination, without first having to enrol at domestic universities.
Prior to that, Chinese high school graduates who wanted to apply for German universities had to study one semester (211,985) or three semesters (general undergraduate) in their country, and passed the APS or Testas examination.
The publication of the new regulations may save Chinese students who wish to study in Germany at least six months.
It was informed that the new regulation would enter into force in the second half of 2019.
Applicants are required to complete 12 years of regular compulsory education with a certificate of high school graduation; to take part in the examination, the higher examination, with a score of 70% and above of the total score (up to 525 points if the total score is 750), and to include two language grades and one.
In addition, the requirements for performance in higher examinations vary from one profession to another.
For example, applying for medicine, oral medicine, veterinary medicine, pharmacology, etc., requiring a full score of 80%, and the subject of higher examination must include mathematics, physics, chemistry, at least two in biology, or participation in the science; applying for a legal profession, higher examination.
According to incomplete statistics, several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, have now endorsed China ' s performance in the high examination.
In the United Kingdom, for example, institutions of higher learning such as Cambridge University, Birmingham University and Leicester University accept applications from Chinese students for admission on the basis of a higher examination.
Military "Machine Dogs" will begin with acting classes.
The U.S. Army has funded the development of a "machine dog" for the battlefield, and may be on the circus stage now!
The Sun Circus has recently indicated that it is in contact with Boston Dynamics, which develops robots, to discuss the feasibility of robot applications for circus performances.
In a comprehensive foreign media report, Boston Power Technology published a promotional film entitled "Spot, a four-foot robot" on 24th, which shows that Spot is an agile mobile robot with a 14-kilogram capacity with high mobility for off-road terrain, 360 degrees of shelter, navigation, and distance.
In particular, Spot has exclusive software platforms specifically developed for Spot, and users can customize Spot robotic functions through various applications.
Boston Dynamics published the idea of a machine dog for the first time in 1992, when it caused a great deal of excitement, but it has still not really been put into commercial use.
However, according to Boston Dynamics, Spot is now in the mass production phase, with a majority of buyers predominantly in the construction and energy industries.
In addition, the Sun Circus is currently in contact with Boston Power Technology, which says that the scheme is still in the conceptual stage and is assessing the potential of Spot to be used at the performance site.
The State Council ' s Press Office issued a white paper entitled China and the World in a New Era.
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China, the Press Office of the State Council issued a White Paper entitled " China and the World in a New Era " on 27th.
The Vice-Minister of China and Chief of the Press Office of the State Council said that the White Paper provided a systematic overview of China's development achievements, paths and trends, and provided an in-depth account of China's relations with the world around the issues of “Where China comes from and where it goes” and “What a world China promotes” and “How a developing China can live with the world”.
According to the White Paper, over the past 70 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has undergone dramatic changes that have created a miracle of development unprecedented in human history, especially since the Party ' s eighteenth anniversary, which has witnessed historic achievements and transformations.
Through a wealth of data and facts, the White Paper presents the great achievements, significance and world contribution of China ' s development over the past 70 years.
According to the White Paper, China had spent decades completing the development journey that had been carried out by the developed countries for centuries. The economy was the second largest in the world. Nearly 1.4 billion people had emerged from material shortages and had generally attained a level of well-being and enjoyed unprecedented dignity and rights.
The White Paper emphasized that, for 70 years, the Chinese people had come home with nothing but self-reliance and hard work and had made a new reality; for 70 years, China had developed in its interaction with the world, embraced it, learned it and contributed to it; and for 70 years, China had achieved self-development while contributing to world peace and to the common development of all nations.
The White Paper stated that China ' s development had been successful over the past 70 years because, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people had found the right path to development, the socialism of the Chinese identity, and were steadfast in their pursuit of that path.
The White Paper emphasized that China ' s unique socialist path was a path based on national circumstances, a path that placed the interests of the people first, a path of reform and innovation, a path to common development in openness and a path to a State based on the rule of law in all its aspects.
This path of development in China is in line with China ' s national circumstances and will be adapted to the requirements of the times and will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.
In response to the concerns of the international community with regard to China ' s development, the White Paper stresses that achieving the country ' s prosperity, national revitalization and the well-being of its people is both a dream of the Chinese people and a common dream of all peoples.
The White Paper states that China is the main stabilizer and engine of economic growth in the world. Openness in all its aspects creates more opportunities for development in all countries. China provides the international community with more public goods. China's development provides experience and lessons for other developing countries. China must not follow the path of “big power”.
Faced with the question of “What the world is about, what humanity is about”, the White Paper states that today's world is in the midst of a century of great change and that human society is both hopeful and challenging.
China ' s initiative to build a community of human destinies and to open up new avenues for development that cooperate in win-win and shared development offers new options for human development.
The White Paper called on States to unite in building a new form of international relations, to promote a new globalization of the economy, to preserve the international system with the United Nations at its core, to promote the exchange of ideas among civilizations and to contribute together to building a community of human destinies and a better world.
With the growing development of China, the international community is generally concerned about how developing China can live with the world.
The White Paper states that China cannot develop without the world and that it cannot develop and prosper peacefully.
China has always placed its own development in the system of coordinates of human development. China is committed to cooperation for win-win and common development. China is committed to maintaining and promoting economic globalization. It is committed to developing a global partnership. China is firmly committed to multilateralism. It is committed to international justice and justice. China is committed to building a “one way” of quality development. China is actively involved in leading the reform and building of the system of global governance.
At present, China ' s development has entered a new era.
The White Paper states that China in the new era will not change its determination to follow the path of socialism characterized by China, that it will not change its determination to learn from each other and to work together to win, and that it will not change its determination to work with the world.
The White Paper concluded by stating that the future of nations in today ' s world has never been as closely linked as it is now.
The White Paper " China and the World in a New Era " , consisting of forewords, texts and closing words, contains more than 29,000 words.
The White Paper was published in eight languages: C, E, F, R, D, S, A, D, and D, respectively, by the People ' s Press and the Foreign Press, and was distributed at the National Xinhua Bookshop.
Will Marv be elected to a by-election at a conference in Denver, Joffrey State?
The President of the Ma'am, Mr. Datos Li, said, "The Supreme Council of the National Front is ready to discuss it!"
In the immediate run-up to the Danish-Ai by-election, it was a matter of concern whether Ma Wah, a member of the National Front party, would take up the traditional national seat.
However, following the meeting of the CMC, it was announced that it would be left to the Supreme Council of the National Front to decide whether the traditional Mawar seat would continue to be taken over by the Mawar or by the other members of the party.
On Thursday afternoon, after chairing the meeting of the Madhua Central Committee, he indicated to the media that any by-election would be conducted in accordance with the standard operating procedures (SOP), i.e., only after a meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front.
He said that since the Election Commission would meet only next Monday (1 January) to finalize the By-elections for the Danfumi State Seat, it was expected that the meeting of the Supreme Council of the Fretilin would take place in early October.
“Tomorrow yesterday morning, I also met with the President of the National Front, Dato’s Amalzahi, and we all agreed on the need to regain this seat from the Alliance of Hope.”
“We have finalized a meeting of the leaders of the Special National Front in early October, where the leaders of the three parties of the National Front will determine which of the member parties will take part.”
Asked if Mawar would insist on standing before the Supreme Council of the NFL as a traditional seat, Wei Jiaxiang reiterated that, as Chairman of the GFMD, he must act in accordance with the standard operating procedures and that any decision must therefore be taken by consensus of the NFL.
“In any by-election, it is common for people to be willing to march, for political parties and for parties to think that they should come out.”
“What organization and political alliance do we come from?”
“This is a test of our political union over the years, and we believe that the National Front has come along with some valuable values.”
“In this process, someone may say something, which is not surprising.”
“But once the Supreme Council of the NFL has made a decision, we must all be ready to fight, which is the most valuable.”
In any event, Wei Jiaxiang indicated that Ma Wah would make every effort at three levels, namely, district councils, state boards and the central level, to prepare for the forthcoming by-election for the Danish-Ai seat.
“The district council is headed by the chairman of the district council (Danfrebai) and the state board is headed by the chairman of the council of juju, and the central council is headed by the president of the board of directors of the council of Juju State, and by the director of the board of directors, Mr. Dato'Mahan and the secretary-general, Mr. Zhang.
Last Saturday (21st), Congressman Danfly of the Indigenous Solidarity Party, Nadhu Mohammed Fari, died of heart problems in a government hospital in stupid Jane, 42 years old.
A villager in Paikang County, Hubei, was ordered to “compulsory patrol the mountains” for hunting wildlife.
A villager in Paikang County, Hubei, was sentenced for hunting wildlife and ordered to compensate him for the cost of repairing environmental damage to ecological resources in the amount of 15420 yuan (RMB).
Due to the poverty of the families of the accused, the Public Prosecution Service has introduced alternative forms of labour to compensate for the cost of ecological rehabilitation, which has resulted in an organic harmonization of legal and social effects.
On 27 September, Wang Chong Liang, Deputy Attorney-General of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Prefectural District, explained that, through three months of alternative labour, such as “compulsory cruises”, the accused had established deep feelings with wild monkeys and was deeply responsible for previous hunting of animals.
On 21 June of this year, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the Prefectural District of Paikang filed a civil pro bono lawsuit in the area of ecological resources, which was heard in the district court and handed down in court.
The accused was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment on Monday, four years ' probation and a fine of $3,000, and was ordered to compensate him for the cost of repairing environmental damage to ecological resources in the amount of $15420.
According to the survey, starting in late January 2014, power grids were installed on the cliffs, hunting for more than 20 wildlife species, including falcons, pelicans, fur crown deer, etc.
The falafel is a secondary endangered wildlife conservation animal in the country, and the puppies and fur crowning deer are listed in the National List of Wildlife Conservation on Land.
During the trial, each week confessed to his or her wrongs and conduct and was willing to assume subsidiary civil liability.
However, in view of the poor economic situation of a certain family in the past week, under the coordination of the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the Prefectural District of Paikang, the local village council, the forest station and the three local parties agreed on the cost of the ecological restoration of alternative labour compensation: the provision of care for monkeys in the village reserve for a period of one year through the practice of salvaging monkeys, the compulsory patrol of mountains and the protection of forests.
In response to the prosecutor's recommendation, the Court accepted that the obligation of “alternative labour to compensate for ecological restoration costs” should be actively met while the suspended sentence was imposed on a weekly basis.
At present, Monday has three months of compulsory work in the Monkey Reserve, and the cruises have been positive and performing well.
In recent years, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the Prefectural District of Pavcon has integrated in practice the functions of the public prosecutor and the conduct of social governance, using scientific methods of supervision, such as prosecutorial advice, investigative supervision and procedural supervision, in order to minimize the damage caused to the environment by criminal acts through judicial means.
United Nations award of the Earthguard prize for the ant forest
In a warm round of applause and resounding music, the head of the “Ant Forest” project, Xu Dhai, and the user representative Shen Xiao Liang, went to the podium and received from the moderator the 2019 United Nations “Guardian of the Earth” award.
The Earthguard award ceremony, held in New York, United States of America, in 2019, awarded the “Incentives and Action” award for the ant forest project, a small mobile phone program that engages hundreds of millions of people in environmental action.
A week earlier, the United Nations Environment Programme had announced a list of winners at its headquarters in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, but it was still difficult for those who had attended the ceremony.
In an interview with a Xinhua journalist, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Ingae Anoxen, said that the Ant Forest was an exciting innovation that had mobilized hundreds of millions of people to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans could do about the environment.
It connects people and the environment with technology and allows each individual to participate in actions to protect the planet, which will have a huge impact.
The Ant Forest was launched in August 2016 by the Ants Financial Services Group of China (the " ant gold suit") on the payout platform, where users accumulated "green energy" through low-carbon actions such as recording their daily green travels in the ant forest, online payments for utilities, etc.
Each time a user grows a virtual tree, the ant forest and a public good partner plant a real tree in a deserted area.
As of August of this year, 500 million “ant forest” users have collectively reduced carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in areas of desertification.
In the same day, Costa Rica won an award for national environmental efforts, and Costa Rica's President Carlos Alvarado praised the contribution of the Ant Forest on the spot, “with the impressive ability to inspire so many people to participate in green action.”
The President and Chief Executive Officer of the ants' Golden Clothes said that the Earthguard Award was an affirmation of the Ant Forest project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible to engage in low-carbon life, an honour that belongs to all participants.
According to Ii Kenjung, the ant forest has affected 500 million people over the past three years, and the objective of the ant forest over the next three years is to engage 1 billion people globally in low-carbon action.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to increase farmers ' income from green water in the mountains.
In addition to providing employment through tree planting, it is hoped that farmers will be helped to achieve higher incomes through agricultural development projects, electric power platforms, etc.
The public interest environmental model created by the Ant Forest, based on digital technology, has also been successful in reaching the sea and has been replicated in other countries.
Last June, the largest electronic wallet in the Philippines, GCash, launched the Philippine version of the Ant Forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon livelihoods.
It was stated that GCash, in partnership with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines, the Environmental Public Interest Organization and others, was planning to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the start-up of the project.
The Earthguard Award is the highest United Nations award in the field of environmental protection and is awarded annually.
“Ant Forest” was awarded the “Incentive and Action Award” from China for the third consecutive year of the Green Innovation Project from China, following the construction by China of the Sihan Dam Forest Project and the “Kill Village Demonstration and Village Rehabilitation” project in Zhejiang Province, China.
Trade friction affects the United States economy's “report card”.
The United States “records” of the economy in the second quarter of this year showed a marked slowdown in the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States as compared to the previous quarter, as a result of a significant decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts pointed out that the economic and trade friction and the uncertainty it created were the main causes of the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data published by the United States Department of Commerce on 26 February show that US GDP grew by 2 per cent at annual rates in the second quarter, which is the same as the previously published revised data, but is significantly lower than 3.1 per cent in the first quarter.
The data show that consumer growth is a major factor underpinning the growth of the United States economy in the second quarter.
Individual consumption expenditure, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the total United States economy, increased by 4.6 per cent in the current season, driving economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government spending on consumption and investment boosted economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment declined by 6.3 per cent in the second quarter over the previous quarter, delaying growth by 1.16 percentage points; exports by 5.7 per cent over the previous quarter; and net exports by 0.68 percentage points.
Barry Knapp, managing partner for the macroeconomic consulting firm in Ainside, United States, stated that private sector investment had not kept pace with last year ' s growth, but had declined significantly because of the impact on business confidence caused by economic friction and rising uncertainty.
Knap believes that, under the influence of policy uncertainty, corporate capital spending in the United States is expected to continue to decline in the coming year.
According to analysts, while consumption growth has strongly supported the United States economy in the second quarter, there are increasing signs that economic and trade frictions and the uncertainty that they bring have affected consumer confidence and negatively affected the United States consumption prospects.
The head of the survey, Richard Courting, Professor of Economics at the University of Michigan, had recently stated that, in a recent survey, 38 per cent of consumers had referred spontaneously to the negative impact of tariffs on the United States economy, which was a new high in a year and a half.
For future economic trends in the United States, analysts generally agree that the United States economy will continue to slow down.
However, the view was also expressed that the performance of the United States industrial sector and financial markets would improve if economic friction were eased.
In the future, the United States economy is expected to continue its downward trend since this year, with a much lower rate of growth than in the second quarter.
Moody’s chief economist, Mark Zandy, predicts that the US economy will grow 2.3% this year, further slowing to 1.6% next year, assuming that economic friction will not continue to escalate.
Ellen Hazen, the investment manager of Patnam Investment Corporation, noted that the greatest concern of current enterprises was the economic and trade dispute and the uncertainty it created, which, if resolved, would be significantly reduced and the industrial sector would perform much better than it is today.
According to Matt Melley, the stock strategist of Miller-Tabak Asset Management, trade friction remains a “first issue” and is the main cause of significant volatility in US capital markets this year, and whether it can be properly addressed will be key to influencing the direction of US capital markets for the rest of the year.
The first couple in Ningxia can take 10 days of parental leave per year for children between 0 and 3 years of age.
Guaranteeing the legitimate rights and interests of women is an expression of respect for and protection of human rights and an important sign of the progress of civil society.
On 27 September, at the fifteenth meeting of the twelfth session of the Standing Committee of the Ningxia Autonomous Community, the Regulations on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in the Ningxia Axis Autonomous Region were adopted with a high vote.
This is the local regulation issued by the first province of Ningxia on the comprehensive and systematic defence of the legitimate rights and interests of women, which will be fully implemented as of 1 November 2019.
It is understood that the Regulations adopted on this occasion were amended on the basis of the 2007 Ningxia Measures for the Implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women, and were divided into 9 chapters, 65 articles, including general provisions, political rights, cultural and educational rights and interests, labour and social security rights and interests, property rights and interests, personal rights, rights and interests of the marital family, legal responsibilities and attachments.
In the Ordinance, Ningxia encouraged the exploration of joint parental leave for couples, which was the first in the country.
In April of this year, the Office of the State Council issued guidance on promoting the development of childcare services for children under three years of age.
In the course of the revision of the Ordinance, Ningxia introduced an innovative proposal to “encourage employers to grant 10 days of joint parental leave each year between the ages of 0 and 3 for couples with children in accordance with the law and regulations”.
At the same time, the Ordinance highlights the fight against sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative results in China ' s current civil code on personality rights, and details the constituent elements of sexual harassment, the subjects and mechanisms against sexual harassment, etc.
Section 44 of the Ordinance expressly prohibits the frequent incidence of sexual abuse of girls and requires educational institutions to undertake relevant educational, protective and preventive work as a new standard for the protection of girls in local legislation.
With regard to the right of women to know and dispose of the common property of the matrimonial family, article 35 of the Ordinance clearly establishes the right of women to know the joint property and the obligations of the property register and related entities, and provides a solid institutional support for women ' s rights.
Moreover, in response to the social issue of gender discrimination in employment, article 26 of the Ordinance prohibits not only direct discrimination, but also indirect discrimination, and draws on the latest experience of joint interview practice to strengthen penalties for gender-based discrimination violations and to strengthen the protection of women's legitimate rights and interests.
In recent years, the work of the Ningxia Women ' s Union, the Department of Public Prosecutions and the Civil Administration, among others, in promoting and introducing the participation of social and professional forces in the mediation of marital and family disputes and in the fight against domestic violence has been very effective.
This is summarized and promoted by the Regulations, which, in a number of articles, encourage the mobilization of social forces, the pooling of social resources and the defence of women ' s rights and interests, and require the people ' s governments at and above the county level to provide stable and institutional guarantees and support, including through the purchase of services.
Inner Mongolia, the UNITA Yuanlong Pilgrim Station is resistant to saline rice acre production of a kilogram of rice.
The journalist was informed by the UNITA Administration Administration of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on 27th that the “Saline-resistant rice site at the UNITA Yuan Long Pyre station” recently held by the League had been uploaded with good news that the average acre production of saline rice had reached 1,000 pounds.
A team of six experts from the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences of Heilongjiang Province, Yangzhou University and the Rural Department of Hunan Province conducted on-site sampling and harvesting of “salt series” rice.
According to expert assessment, the average acre production of saline rice amounted to 508.8 kg on a pH value of 8.8 to 9.6, with salt content of 5 to 6 per 1,000.
“We intend to build on this year’s experiments and to innovate, as well as reform, so that salt-resistant rice varieties can be cultivated and optimized again, so that they can be of better quality and yield better.”
“In the absence of any change in the factors of production, I believe that increasing technological efforts will continue, and salt-resistant rice will continue to produce miracles on the saline.”
UNITA is part of a conglomerate of special hardship areas.
In October 2018, Yuan Long Pilgrim worked for UNITA to show up.
Master Yuan has led a team of experts to accelerate the introduction of the newly developed “saline-resistant hybrid rice” varieties and advanced technologies, to build 960 acres of saline rice bases in the right-wing flag of Koryu, to use side-test demonstration, and to promote technology routes to boost the productivity of the local poor
This on-site production of salt-resistant rice not only injects hope into the upgrading of UNITA salt-based low- and medium-yielding fields to middle- and high-yielding fields, but also provides a scientific basis for the cultivation of saline rice under the same conditions in our country.
The new Australian state passed the legalisation of abortion bill on 26 September, local time, after a marathon debate and weeks of protests, as reported by the Australian Network.
It is known that the bill has generated political debate over the past eight weeks and that there have been serious differences within the AFP since the introduction of the bill by an independent member of Parliament, Greenwich.
It was reported that, after nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Australasia Senate passed the legalisation of abortion bill by 26 votes to 14, on the night of 25, making it the third-long bill to be considered by the new State Senate.
In the morning, after a final vote in the House of Representatives of the new Länder, abortion was legalized in the new Länder.
The Act allows a woman to terminate her pregnancy on the 22nd week of pregnancy and, with the consent of two doctors, to have an abortion later in pregnancy.
An amendment was adopted by the Senate on the evening of 25 September whereby doctors can seek advice from the multidisciplinary team of the Hospital Advisory Board before performing an abortion for a woman who is 22 weeks pregnant.
In addition, the amendments adopted by the Senate included the need for doctors to provide appropriate care for babies surviving after termination of pregnancy.
Previously, the Governor of the new state, Beridgeklain, had faced public criticism from conservatives on the bill, and she had intervened on several occasions to secure more time for debate on the bill, but she had not been present at the final vote.
"I need time to run the whole new state."
Congressman Davis of the AFP was known to have been the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, threatened to withdraw from the new state government and claimed that the bill had triggered a “government crisis”.
But then Davis gave in.
Davis said: “The content of the amendment to the bill on the legalization of abortion submitted to the House of Representatives in the morning of 26 actually provides more guarantees for women, doctors.”
At the same time, Bari Laro, leader of the New Australian National Party, said that he was proud to be a member of the Government that legalized abortion.
“What we achieved last night is historic for the new state, which legalizes abortion, which is no longer a crime, nor does it treat abortion women as criminals.”
Three groups of major projects are located on the mainland.
A total of 15 billion yuan has been invested, focusing on the development of oil-smart equipment and the intelligent steel industry.
Today, a signing ceremony for the project was held between the People ' s Government of the city of Changzhou and the Trinity Group.
Three groups have invested $15 billion in industrial projects such as the intelligent steel industry, oil-smart equipment and regional research and development centres (headquarters bases) and the second-hand car market for engineering machinery in Changzhou, where combined production is expected to exceed $200 billion a year.
The Trinity Steel Industry Project, with a total investment of $10 billion, will focus on creating the largest steel and product trading centre throughout the province and in the centre, as well as the Trinity Metal Structures Smart Manufacturing Centre; and the Petroleum Smart Equipment and Regional Research and Development Centre (Headquarters) with a total investment of $5 billion.
At the same time, the Trinity Group will build a second-hand market for engineering machinery at the Carbine Park in Changzhou, where practical cooperation will take place in areas such as smart manufacturing.
The city attaches great importance to cooperation with the Triad Group.
The city listed the cooperation project as “Project 1”, a city-wide call for investment this year, led by Mau Tenfeng, the mayor of Yang Wei, and set up a special coordination group for efficient docking and high-level promotion to provide high-quality and efficient services for the development of the Trinity Group.
Minister of Finance Liu Quin: 67 foreign companies and financial institutions have transferred $8.601 billion from the State to strengthen the Social Security Fund.
The Minister of Finance, Liu Quin, stated on 27 September that, to date, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of part of the State capital enhancement social security fund, totalling approximately 86.1 billion yuan.
Liu Quin made the above statement at the deployment of the National Transfer Fund for the Financing of Social Security, which was co-sponsored by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the National Finance Committee on the same day.
“The transfer of a part of the State-owned capital enhancement fund is an important initiative to reform and improve the basic pension insurance system. It is an adequate reflection of universal access to the results of State-owned enterprise development and the intergenerational equity of the basic old-age insurance system. It is a current and long-term policy measure.”
In 2017, the State Council issued the Programme for the Implementation of the Fund for the Transfer of Partial State Capital for Social Security, which calls for the selection of selected central enterprises and selected provinces for piloting.
According to Liu Qun, the transfer process has yielded positive results.
At the central level, three batches of conversions of 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have been completed, totalling approximately 86.1 billion yuan in State-owned capital.
Of these, the transfer of central financial institutions in which the Ministry of Finance performs the functions of funder has been largely completed.
Central business transfer is already on a certain scale.
At the local level, the pre-transfer of enterprises has been carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, pilot work had been largely completed in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces, transferring State-owned capital of 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, preparatory work has been carried out successively in other provinces to prepare for the next transfer.
According to a joint circular issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the National Finance Committee, the General Tax Administration and the CVM, the central and local transfer of part of the State capital to the SWF was fully opened in 2019 and will be substantially completed by 2020.
The meeting that took place on that day resulted in a concrete deployment of the full roll-out.
The need for a pragmatic and efficient completion of the transfer was emphasized.
“According to the schedule, the transfer is to be substantially completed by 2020.
The transfer time is tight and the task is heavy."
Liu Quin said that the regions and sectors should be well organized and well organized to ensure that the transfer was completed as required; that the work was carried forward in a solid manner to accurately capture the content of the transfer policy; and that communication coordination should be strengthened to resolve difficult issues in a timely manner.
The transfer of state funds to the SWF – from the point of departure of the SWF money bag, the destination is to provide strong support for old-age security.
However, in my view, this is not a simple “physical shift” of equity, but it opens the “mathematical addition”.
On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human and Social Welfare, the National Finance Committee, the General Tax Administration and the CSRC jointly issued the Circular on the Full Transfer of Part of the State Capital for the Work of the Social Security Fund, setting out the timetable for the conversion of the State capital to the Fund, i.e., the central and local transfer of part of the State capital.
Once the documents are published, departments such as the Ministry of Finance are in place very quickly.
On 25 September, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10 per cent of the holdings of business and industry banks and agricultural banks to the Social Security Fund, with a total transfer value of more than $115 billion.
Under the Act, subjects such as the Social Security Foundation, as financial investors, are entitled to the proceeds, dispositions and information assigned to the State shareholdings.
In a public announcement, the trades and farmers stated that the change in interest would not result in a change in the shareholders and actual owners of their own holdings.
In this respect, it is my view that a similar transfer of State entrepreneurship is not a simple change in the attribution of equity, but a “additional calculation” that triggers a range of effects.
The first step of a partial national transfer of funds to social security is a “plus result” that naturally reflects the universal ownership of State-owned enterprises and the sharing of development results.
After many years of reform and development, State enterprises, in particular, are in most of the major sectors and areas of our economy, with greater and more stable overall profitability.
Among them, leading enterprises are more likely to achieve high performance on an ongoing basis.
On 10 July, the Standing Committee of the State Council decided that the transfer of part of the State capital to the SWF would be fully rolled out this year.
The Ministry of Finance then indicated that, in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Committee of the State Council, it would complete the transfer of part of the State capital to the Social Security Fund, fully reflecting the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system and the universal sharing of the results of State enterprise development.
The second step of the transfer, “plus results”, is to enhance the sustainability of our social security fund and further strengthen the foundations of the social security system for old age.
As a result of the ageing of the population, our social security funds are under pressure, and most of the national resources that have been transferred for this time have the capacity to sustain profits and dividends, not only to effectively replenish the social security funds, but also to provide a source of living water for the social security funds.
It has been calculated that for every 3.8 percentage points of State-owned capital transferred, the contribution rate of the enterprise ' s basic pension insurance can be supported by a reduction of one percentage point.
The third step of the transfer, "plus results", is to add stabilizers to capital markets.
The transfer recipient receives the proceeds by "primarily rededicated and operationally supported".
The Social Security Fund, as a financial investor in State-owned capital, is indeed dominated by gains in equity dividends.
However, the Social Security Fund, as a value investor in capital markets, has a relatively strong capital working capacity.
For publicly listed assets of State capital, the participation of the Social Security Fund in the holding of shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, contribute to upgrading the level of business and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the increase in the weight of equity held by the Social Security Fund as a signpost for investment further enhances its influence in the market and acts as a “stabilizer” in the market.
It also facilitates the full realization of the “value discovery” function of institutional investors, leading them to invest rationally and in value.
Karl Hartmann was admitted to the Leipzig School of Music at the age of 18 and was later taught from Webhorn.
After the Nazis came to power, Hartmann first resisted in the form of works not published in Germany and then even stopped writing.
In 1933, he created Miserae and dedicated it to "my long-sleeping friends".
This symphony was inaugurated in Prague in 1935, but was harassed by Nazi bureaucrats.
After that, Hartmann was determined not to play any of his works under Nazi rule.
Hartmann ' s funeral concerto was a violin and string concerto, when the manuscript was stolen from Germany and its premiere was held in Switzerland.
Please listen to the funeral concert of the Berne House Orchestra at Beethoven Music Festival in 2018.
The United States Senate approved Scalia as Minister of Labour, Xinhuanet.
On September 26, Xinhua News, in Washington, D.C., the Senate of the United States Congress voted by President Trump to nominate Eugene Scalia as Minister of Labour.
The result was 53 votes in favour and 44 against, with no Democrats voting in favour of Scalia.
In the view of the Republicans, the curriculum vitae of Scalia makes him very suitable for the position of Minister of Labour.
However, in the view of the Democrats, Scalia has long been in opposition to workers and trade unions in the course of her career as a lawyer.
Scalia will replace Alexander Acosta.
Acosta, then Minister of Labour, resigned in July this year under great pressure from public opinion because he was accused of “massive treatment” of Jeffrey Eppstein, a billionaire in the United States suspected of sexual abuse and trafficking of young girls.
Scalia, aged 56, is a partner in a well-known law firm in the United States. His father is Antonin Scalia, the late Chief Justice of the United States Federal Supreme Court.
The Department of Labor is a cabinet-level department of the United States federal government responsible for labour-related matters, etc.
The White House also issued a statement on the same day that Trump had nominated Peter Guena, Acting Director of the Federal Emergency Measures Agency, to head the agency.
In accordance with the procedure, the nomination of Guéhenno must also be approved by the Senate of the National Assembly.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of the United States Department of Homeland Security, coordinates federal government resources to deal with and follow up on natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other emergencies in the United States.
Since the first military parade on the thirty-fifth anniversary of the National Day, each major military parade has seen the emergence of a strategic missile force with a “big no-man” front line.
“This national day is the first time that a rocket-propelled army has come to light after the ‘military’ turned into a ‘military’.’”
Wang Bo, the commander of the rocket-equipment unit, said.
The missile-visited forces are fully equipped with a particularly bitter, combatable and dedicated spirit, with intensive training, scientific organization and training throughout the course of military parades, reflecting three main features, a good image of strategic forces and a greater focus on hard practice.
During this military parade, both generals and soldiers, strict standards were required to create a culture of aggressiveness and prohibition.
They have also focused on the spirit of the craftsmen, grasping each detail, skill, perseverance and skill, forming the characteristics of “army positions, quick movement, good words” and constantly crafting a martial arts missile array, with a greater focus on scientific and technological innovation.
As a high-tech strategic army, the rocket army is a tradition and an advantage of science and technology and innovation.
This military parade, which builds on past experience, breaks the mindset and breaks the traditional approach of using advanced means such as satellite positioning, laser ranging, high-resolution imaging, real-time speed measurement, to upgrade the level of training and quality efficiency and to ensure that human vehicles are integrated in a single fraction of the size of the vehicle, and that the teams operate in a single second.
The rocket forces were asked to adhere to the same standards and higher requirements as the military parade and launch sites, to hold every gate, to keep an eye on every detail, to keep the troops under fire, and to make the national parade truly a training ground and a test ground to enhance the force ' s ability to fight.
Iran has been confirmed to be developing advanced centrifuges to suspend further the implementation of the Iran nuclear agreement.
According to the “Central News Agency”, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on 26 September that Iran had once again violated its nuclear agreement by using advanced centrifugal mechanisms to enrich uranium.
Iran is reported to be gradually violating the restrictions of the Iran nuclear agreement in response to the withdrawal of United States President Trump from the Iran nuclear agreement in May 2018 and the resumption and strengthening of sanctions against Iran.
Iran suspended two other commitments in July to keep its enriched uranium stock below 300 kg and to keep its enriched uranium purer than 3.67 per cent, and now moves further.
In accordance with the nuclear agreement, Iran has been able to build only about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to accumulate enriched uranium, in addition to allowing Iran to use a small number of more advanced types of aircraft for research, but not to produce enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for use in the manufacture of nuclear bombs.
According to reports, the International Atomic Energy Agency report states: “On 25 September, the Agency confirmed that Iran's advanced centrifuges of type 2, 3 R & D are accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium.”
This report was presented to Member States on 26th by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and a diplomatic official responded: “They are busy at the Natanz enrichment facility.”
The Vietnamese Association of Investors and Entrepreneurs is officially visible.
Chen Hae-ling, President of the Viet Nam Investors and Entrepreneurs Association, said that VKBIA would work together as a bridge to strengthen inter-Korean relations.
The two countries aim to increase trade in both directions to $100 billion by 2020.
Mr. Chen Hae-ling believed that the creation of the Association was an important step towards that goal.
He hoped that the Viet Nam Party, the Government and relevant Korean functional agencies would assist in the future operation of the Association.
Chen Changhui, Deputy Ambassador of Viet Nam to Korea, said that VKBIA would create a good platform for exchanges and sharing of experiences and ideas between Vietnamese and Korean entrepreneurs, with the aim of expanding the space for investment cooperation, mutual assistance and mutual assistance to make a more effective contribution to Viet Nam ' s economic development and integration into international economic endeavours, and contributing to the dynamic development of trade relations in the country.
At the ceremony, VKBIA representatives signed cooperation agreements with representatives of the Viet Nam Association of Farming and Agribusinesses.
VKBIA coincided with the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the strategic partnership between the two countries, and was born in the context of the strengthening of practical cooperation between the two countries in the areas of foreign affairs, defence, security and the promotion of trade and investment cooperation aimed at achieving the goal of $100 billion in trade in both directions by 2020.
The Italian Minister of Education proposed a sugar tax to protect the health of the population.
The new Government of Italy, the Minister of Education of the Cabinet and member of the Five Star movement, Lorenzo Fiolamonti, submitted a motion to Parliament recommending a new tax policy for sugar-rich beverages, snacks and airline tickets to the Italian Government.
According to reports, pursuant to a motion for a bill by the Minister of Education, Fiolamonti, the Italian Government will impose a zero-food tax on dietary products that are harmful to health, such as sugary beverages, snacks, etc., while imposing environmental taxes on airline tickets, a levy of 1 euro on domestic flights and a levy of 1.5 euros on international classes.
Fiolamonti indicated that, through this seemingly small range of tax measures, the Government expected to receive 3 billion euros in tax revenues.
Funds from this tax will be used in the areas of education, health and environmental protection.
In response, Italian Prime Minister Conte stated that he believed that it was a viable option; Italian parliamentarians, European parliamentarians and coalition leader Salvini put it ironicly, asking everyone to hide dessert, biscuits, bread and candy, as the new Government was about to start a snack tax.
It was reported that the zero-food tax refers generally to a special tax on sugary beverages and high-heat foods.
The levy contributes to the benefits of public health.
On the evening of 25 September, local time, the Chinese Embassy in Canada hosted a reception in Ottawa to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China.
On the evening of 25 September, the new Chinese Ambassador to Canada (journalist Yu Shwe-Tun) hosted a reception in Ottawa to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China.
In his message, Tsong Peng Wu stated that, in the 70 years since the establishment of the new China, under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and thanks to the joint efforts of the Chinese people, China ' s special socialist cause has achieved remarkable achievements that have not only profoundly changed China ' s face for the benefit of its own people, but have also produced far-reaching world significance.
In keeping with its own national circumstances, China had opened a path of socialism characterized by China, had expanded the path towards modernization in developing countries and had contributed its wisdom and its programmes to solving human problems.
A photo exhibition on the theme of the 70th anniversary of the New China, co-located with guests, was presented.
As Tsong has stated, China has created rare miracles in the history of human development in the world and has made an important contribution to the promotion of world peace and development.
China adheres to an independent foreign policy of peace and has always advocated the basic norms of international relations, with the five principles of peaceful coexistence at its core, as a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a guardian of the international order.
China ' s development offered new opportunities for development in all countries of the world, including Canada, and benefited all peoples.
It was emphasized that the history of nearly 50 years of development in China and China has shown that it is only by adhering to the principles of equality and mutual respect that relations between the two countries can move forward on the right track.
Conversely, relations between the two countries would be frustrated and the interests of the two countries undermined.
At the present time, China has experienced serious difficulties in its relations, and it is not the responsibility of China.
"Ringer must also be the bell man."
It is hoped that the parties will soon come up with an appropriate solution to the problems highlighted in their bilateral relations in order to create the conditions for the return to normal relations between the two countries.
The reception was attended by more than 700 representatives of Canadian government officials, federal senators, a wide range of friendly personalities, the Ambassador to Côte d ' Ivoire and Chinese non-Chinese, Chinese institutions and students.
Diplomats from the Chinese Embassy in Ghana, such as Chen Myung Jian and the Congcai Xiao Xiao army, participated in the reception.

The reception also featured a special exhibition on the theme of the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which attracted guests to visit.
The first hundred-degree autopilot taxi squads started a test operation.
Yesterday, 100 degrees announced in Changsha that the pilot operation of Robotaxi, an automated taxi team, was officially opened.
The first 45 “Red flag EV” Robotasi vehicles developed jointly by Apollo and a red flag began to operate on a trial basis in the open test section of the Changsha sector.
From this day onward, ordinary Changsha citizens can access the Apollo network to apply for seed users and have an opportunity to experiment with the experience.
One experienced passenger indicated that he was in the back of the vehicle and clicked on the passenger's front screen, opening the autopilot of the vehicle on the first button.
In the vehicle, for the safety of passengers and as required by current policy regulations, the pilot vehicle is equipped with a safety officer in the driver ' s seat to maximize the safety of passengers.
During the course of the journey, vehicles can make intelligent diversions depending on the condition of the road, and they can also determine the condition of the surrounding vehicle and make automatic concessions, such as in the case of close-distance crossings.
Throughout the experience, the passenger area screens show in real time the road conditions of pedestrians, cars and even some of the traditional blind areas on the road.
Even when vehicles are blocked, information such as changes in the front red and green lights and waiting times can be seen in advance, and all traffic conditions are clear.
Unmanned people have heard of it on television before, thinking it's far away from us, but it feels amazing to find it in our lives today.
We expect it to truly enter civilian life in the future.
In June 2019, Apollo obtained 45 human test plates issued by the Changsha municipality.
At present, Changsha's autopilot is testing open roads through the Changsha City Artistic City, Lake May Creek, Lake Ocean, Wangshan, High Shining Zone, all 135 kilometres long, and the demonstration area is 70 square kilometres, the longest and largest road in China.
By the end of 2019, the Apollo Robotaxi convoy is expected to cover approximately 50 kilometres of the pilot road in Changsha, with plans to cover 135 kilometres of the road currently open in Changsha in the first half of 2020.
There's still a problem with the women's platoon winning the game: it's hard to beat a strong team with so many mistakes.
In the afternoon of Beijing time 27, the Chinese women ' s club celebrated the ninth round of the 2019 women ' s World Cup against the strong Dutch women ' s team, which culminated in the victory of the Chinese women ' s platoon 3:1 over the Dutch women ' s team and the nine-time victory of the women ' s World Cup.
However, after the match, the female platoon leader, Mr. Ping, expressed his dissatisfaction with the team's performance in the third round.
“The third round is more aggressive than the other side, and some of us can't hit the ball without it, and we've made a lot of mistakes.”
"To fight with a strong team, you've made so many mistakes, it's hard."
In an interview after Lampingsai, he said:
“We say to the team to focus, and when the story is not in place, we're going to get the reset done, and we're going to fight each other.”
Luang Ping also commented on Zhang Changning ' s performance, stating that she had some difficulties in the attack, was anxious, too eager to kill the ball, and that her movements would be distorted.
Let's hope she's patient, "Let's protect her."
China ' s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge, for the world.
White Paper (New China 70 years): China ' s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge, for the world.
The White Paper states that China ' s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge, for the world.
According to the White Paper, with the rapid rise in China's combined national power and international influence, there are international fears that China will follow the path of “the powerful” and some raise the so-called “China threat doctrine”.
This has ranged from cognitive misunderstandings, deep-rooted prejudices, psychological imbalances brought about by the strength to grow, to deliberate distortions in defence of their vested interests.
Achieving national prosperity, national revitalization and the well-being of the people is both a dream of the Chinese people and a common dream of all peoples.
“China’s development is an opportunity, not a threat and a challenge, for the world.”
The White Paper states that China is the main stabilizer and engine of economic growth in the world, that China is the largest contributor to economic growth in the world, that technological innovation in China has injected new energy into economic growth in the world, and that the role of the stabilizer and the engine of the future Chinese economy is even more evident.
At a time when the world economy is not sufficiently dynamic for growth, a sound Chinese economy is becoming increasingly important to the world.
China ' s economy is moving from high-growth to high-quality development. New forms of industrialization, informationization, urbanization and modernization of agriculture have accelerated, the economy has been restructured in depth, the industry has been continuously upgrading, and new economic growth has emerged.
“A study by the McKinsey Global Institute suggests that by 2040, China’s integration with the rest of the world’s economies is expected to generate an economic value of $22 trillion to $37 trillion, equivalent to 15–26% of the global economy, and that greater cooperation between the rest of the world’s economies and China will create enormous economic value.”
The White Paper emphasized that the Chinese economy and the world economy had undergone structural changes and were deeply integrated.
China, with a more stable economy, a higher quality of growth and promising growth prospects, is a long-term benefit to the world economy.
Considering China's economic development as a “threat” and a “challenge”, trying to “decord” China from global industrial chains, supply chains, and value chains and to “decord” it from the world economy is not feasible and harmful.
According to the White Paper, full-fledged openness creates more opportunities for countries to share the “China dividend”.
China is steadfast in pursuing a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy to achieve greater and higher levels of openness to the outside world. China has the world's most potential consumer markets. China is the most attractive destination for investment.
“Openness should be two-way, mutually beneficial, not one-way, one-sided.
A mutually beneficial two-way approach can last for the long term.”
The White Paper stated that China was committed to sustained expansion of imports, liberalization of market access, improvement of the business environment and enhancement of intellectual property protection, and that other countries should expand their openness and take corresponding initiatives in an effort to improve their business environment.
It is only by working together that an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment can be created, and the “cake” of development can be made bigger and a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests can emerge.
According to the White Paper, China provides the international community with more public goods.
These include the promotion of a high-quality "one-way", the establishment of multilateral platforms for dialogue and cooperation, active participation in international and regional affairs, and active foreign assistance.
“China has benefited from the international community's development, and has always given back to the family of nations in order to provide the international community with more and better public goods.”
The General Manager of the Russian Export Centre, Andrei Slepniov, in a recent written interview with a Xinhua journalist, expressed Russia ' s willingness to strengthen cooperation with China in the economic and trade fields, further optimize its export structure and promote the diversification of Russian exports to China.
Slepniov noted that while the forestry, mechanical and chemical industries account for a significant proportion of Russian exports to China, the export of agricultural products is also important, ranging from fat products, meat products and dairy products to cereals, fish and seafood.
In recent years, Russian exports of non-material and non-energy products to China have also shown good and steady development.
Referring to the optimal Russian export structure to China, Slepniov said that the Russian side had set a mandate to expand exports of high-technology products to meet the demand for high-technology products from countries and regions around the world, including China.
The Russian Federation will then improve its financial and non-financial support measures and promote further growth in the number of high-tech enterprises.
The Russian Federation has expressed its readiness to export construction technology and high-tech construction materials to China and to develop cooperation with China in areas such as medicine and aviation manufacturing.
There is also great potential for cooperation between the Russian and Chinese sides in the area of urban environmental development.
He stressed that Russian products in many areas had “quality advantages and price competitiveness” over similar Western products.
Referring to the two countries ' goal of achieving $200 billion in bilateral trade by 2024, Slepniov said that areas such as agriculture, machinery manufacturing, the chemical industry and forestry would play an important role in achieving that goal.
The Russian side intends to contribute to the diversification of supply in these areas and to the export of highly processed products.
He stressed that the Russian side intended to facilitate the entry of its exporters into the global value-added chain, in which China was one of the directions of development.
Russian manufacturers in the fields of agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas and chemicals are well placed to participate in this process.
At present, there is a need for both countries to continue to deepen business cooperation, “to establish more joint Russian-Chinese ventures and to develop exports to third countries”.
Slepniov indicated that the Russian Export Centre, through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Export-Import Bank, was undertaking a variety of measures and services to support exports of Russian products to China.
At the same time, the Russian Export Centre will continue to deepen its cooperation with the relevant Chinese sectors in order to promote easier access for Russian goods to the Chinese market and to develop new types of exports to China.

The latest “Penton Tracking Special”, published in London on 26 July by the SWIFT, shows a clear trend towards an increase in the number of financial institutions worldwide paying in the renminbi between July 2017 and July 2019.
At the Global Banking Financial Telecommunication Association (SWIFT) annual conference in London 2019, the agency published a special RMB tracking issue called Insighting the RMB from the London Perspective, showing that the number of financial institutions worldwide paying in the RMB increased from July 2017 to July 2017.

At the same time, London plays the lead sheep role in foreign exchange transactions off the coast of the renminbi.
According to the report, in July 2019, London ' s share of the global renminbi offshore foreign exchange transaction was 33.79 per cent, leading the world.
According to the report, London is firmly in the lead in global foreign exchange transactions.
In July 2019, London ' s share of global foreign exchange transactions was 40.14 per cent, the United States 12.93 per cent and France 7.67 per cent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the so-called "diplomatic breakthrough":
In response to Taiwan's recent entry to United Nations Headquarters for meetings on religious issues, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China responded at a regular press conference that such minor moves were ignoble and laughterful.
A question was posed by journalists, who, according to the Taiwanese media, had recently entered United Nations Headquarters for a meeting on religious issues in the United States and called it a “diplomatic breakthrough”.
The meeting to which you referred was a United States side event on the premises of the United Nations, not a United Nations meeting at all.
To say the truth, the people of the Taiwan staged a sneaky, self-defeating, self-proclaimed so-called “diplomatic breakthrough”, which was a disgraceful little move and made a big smile.
He noted that the United Nations side had repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to the issue of Taiwan in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2758 and that the general membership of the United Nations was committed to the one-China principle.

The “China Good Story” database (www.chinastry.cn) is hosted by Xinhua News Agency and hosted by Xinhua News Agency China Search.
This is the scene of the "US-US-US-US-China-Customs" online launch on September 27th.
On that day, an innovative and fundamental outreach platform – the “good Chinese story” database – was officially launched, with the aim of “talking Chinese stories and disseminating Chinese voices” – to present the world with a true, stereo, comprehensive China.
Opening the “China Good Story” database, a distant ink-drawn ink-fish roll has spread, opening up the reader's memory of a new Chinese story that travels through time and time.
The database contains more than 60,000 wonderful stories, ranging from the traditional story of the “good-faithful nation” and the “Jolly to the mountain”, to the story of the new era of the “I will not forget the first heart”, and thousands of good Chinese stories become the expression of the “Chinese spirit” and the “China wisdom”

The authorities have shown a strong crackdown on the president's downfall in Mount Egypt.
Twitter feature tags and social media are strongly advocating that Egyptians take to the streets today to peacefully demand the resignation of President Sessi.
However, the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress it.
Since the military coup of Cessi, then head of the military, which seized power in 2013, the expression of dissent has virtually disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest has become extremely dangerous.
The British newspaper Guardian reported that the Cairo-based non-governmental organization, the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, had stated that more than 1900 people had been arrested since the rare outbreak of protests last weekend demanding the resignation of Sessi.
Allegations of corruption around Cessi and his family ' s wasteful pursuit of vanity have led thousands of people to demonstrate on the streets since the beginning of the 20th day.
The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior firmly stated yesterday that any attempt to destabilize the country would be met with determination and determination.
The city centre of Cairo is already heavily guarded, and riot police, security agency vehicles and plainclothes policemen were seen on the streets around Tahrir Square, where the Egyptian revolution detonated in 2011.
Al-Jazeera reported that security forces detained a number of leading scholars and social sages on 25 days, including Nafa, a professor of political science at Cairo University and a well-known columnist.
“I have no doubt that the continuation of the absolute rule of Cessi will cause disaster”, he wrote in a tweet on 24th.
"It is in Egypt's interest for him to step down immediately."
Prior to Nafa ' s arrest, Hosni, former Chief of Staff of the Egyptian military, was detained as spokesperson for Annan.
Anna was arrested last year after an attempt to win the presidency with Sethi.
The President of the Constitutional Party, Davud, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that, at a time when the economic plight of the poor and the middle class is exacerbated, the silencing of dissidents reflects the instability and fragility of the Government.
The leader of the opposition, Ayman Nour, who fought for the presidency, said: “The arrest highlights the regime’s disregard for the Egyptian people and its own fear.”
“Cessi tried to send a clear message to key leaders and politicians who might replace them, because the economy had been ruined by him, coupled with widespread political repression.”
Noor noted that, in the context of the continuing deterioration of the socio-economic situation, the Government ' s high-handed approach would only increase the population ' s anger.
Since the barrier of fear had been broken, he expected more people to go to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor currently in exile in Spain, was a former construction contractor for the Egyptian military and began to upload a series of films early in the month, claiming to have benefited from the corruption of the Government, which triggered a small wave of demonstrations in different cities last weekend.
Ali stated that his company, Amlake, was able to obtain lucrative contracts without having to go through the required bidding process, emphasizing the corruption of the military and its relatives, including the First Lady, Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply sorry that he had been involved in it.
Ali claims that his assistance to the Fulfilled Palace and the luxury hotel in Sessigue stands in stark contrast to the abject poverty currently being experienced by Egyptians, and that the other party has not yet paid for it.
On Twitter, such thematic labels as " Stand Up You Are Not Alone", "Sessy You Are Dead", "Sexy Rolling" and "Next Friday" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and pushbacks calling for people to go to the streets peacefully.
There are almost 7 million followers on the Twitter of Amarwick, a Hollywood Egyptian male star.
He tweeted yesterday in Arabic: “Cessi is doomed...he is finished, and those who support him are now making a big mistake.”
Hong Kong has introduced a special free training program to help recently economically affected employees get through the crisis.
On 27th day, the HKSAR Government announced the introduction of a free special training scheme for employees affected by recent economic conditions, which allows eligible students to receive a maximum of HK$4,000 per month for training benefits upon completion of the course.
Many fine shops in Hong Kong’s Tsim Shattao seaport have very few customers.
As a result of recent social strife in Hong Kong, there has been a significant decline in the number of visitors to Hong Kong, with the exception of the tourism industry, which has affected the hotel, catering and retail sectors.
The Director-General of the Labour and Welfare Department of the HKSAR Government, Qiu Tenghua, Director of the Department of Commerce and Economic Development, commissioned the Employees Retraining Bureau to conduct a special training programme and to meet with the media on measures to support the tourism industry.
Lo Chi Quang described the challenges facing Hong Kong ' s economy as imminent and should not wait until the situation calmed down.
Therefore, the HKSAR Government has introduced this free training program, “Special? Love Added”.
It was stated that persons who had been unemployed or who had been asked by their employers to take unpaid leave since 1 June had the opportunity to participate in the scheme, provided that the relevant requirements had been met.
The curriculum is extensive, with the most important part being “vocational skills” training, covering 19 industries, including tourism, retail and catering, as well as brand new “innovation technology” courses and cross-industry “general skills” courses.
The Chairman of the Employees Retraining Bureau, Yu Peng Chun, stated that tuition fees were completely free for all courses and that the plan was expected to support some 10,000 people in need.
A special allowance of HK$4,000 per participant per month is payable to participants who complete each full-time or part-time course and attend an attendance rate of 80 per cent.
It was stated that the training course, which lasted two to three months, was provided by some 50 training institutions and was accessible to the public between 3 October and 31 March next year, with up to four courses per person.
In addition, the HKSAR Government has announced a series of measures in support of the tourism industry to assist the industry to overcome its difficulties.
These measures include the easing of allocations to the tourism parliament, the financing of 6,000 additional guided tours and the exemption of travel agents from annual fees.
What's wrong with you?
According to the Russian satellite network, a study of athletes showed signs of fatigue in the brain as a result of high-intensity motion.
This study, led by Mathias Pesigrion, an expert from the Pitié-Sarperture Hospital in France, shows that there is no obvious link between mental and physical labour: both require cognitive control of activities.
Pescion explains that: "You need to control the autonomous process of forcing yourself to stop when muscle and joint pains occur."
The study was launched by the French National Institute for Physical Education and Physical Education (INSEP).
The school specialist is responsible for guiding athletes in their preparations for the Olympic Games.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from excessive training syndrome, i.e. an insufferable sense of fatigue, physical inability to recover and a decline in performance following high-load sports.
INSEP asked the question: Is this disease partly due to nervous fatigue, which is caused by over-intelligent work?
The study was published in the magazine Contemporary Biology.
Today, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Chinese Museum of Fine Arts have opened their veils in a special exhibition designed to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China.

“The great journey, the magnificent scroll — celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China — is a rich and multidimensional demonstration of the great journey and brilliant achievements of the 70 years of the founding of the new China, as well as of the relentless struggle and self-strength of the Chinese people.
The exhibit was divided into one chapter and four chapters.
The exhibition, which is large in scope and famous in character, displays more than 480 works covering various artistic categories such as Chinese paintings, paintings, drawings, sculptures, watercolored water powders, annual drawings, posters, etc., and is based on a collection of classic works from Chinese galleries.

In accordance with the unified arrangements for the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China in Beijing, the opening of the Chinese Gallery of Fine Arts to society was suspended from 28 September to 1 October.
On September 27th, World Tourism Day, the theme of the year was “Tourism and work: building a better future for all”, and the Tourist Board organized a series of events, including the reception of lucky passengers and traditional tray competitions, which were celebrated with residents and passengers.
Also on the same day, a special “World Tourism Day” celebration dinner was held to promote exchanges with the tourism industry, with the participation of the Director of the Department of Social and Cultural Affairs, Tan Jun-Wung, among others, in order to contribute actively to the sustainable development of the tourism industry in Macao.
On the same day, the Director of Tourism, Mr. Wen Hua, and the Deputy Director, Mr. Xu Yuming, among others, arrived at the Macao International Airport to deliver souvenirs to the lucky passengers of World Tourism Day.
A tourist from Thailand, Mr. Wipoosiri and his family, who are lucky visitors this year, say that they come to Macao about four to five times a year and that Macao is a suitable tourist destination for a large and small family, and that they can enjoy Macao's food during weekend holidays, as well as to visit Macau City.
Tourist mascot “Max” robots also come to welcome passengers, and the Visitors' Bureau's Visitors' Information Desk arranges for souvenirs to be delivered to visitors on a full-time basis.
The traditional tray competition was held in the same afternoon, with a collection of close to 180 participants representing more than 29 hotels and restaurants in Macao, on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the establishment of the Macao Special Administrative Region this year. The contestants were given a digital “20” photo in the Grand Tribune before their departure, adding to the event
There are also contestants wearing distinctive costumes that match the theme of return.
Each contestant crosses the streets of “Macao Historic City” with a tray carrying a bottle of “Macao Beer” and sends it safely as quickly as possible to the front of the terminal. The process is intense, attracting a large number of passengers to take photographs and even breathe for the contestants along the way, showing Macao's tourist attraction.
The male champions were won by Warren Obejas Cabada, in the heart of the city of Macau; the female champions were Ye Xiaojin of the Vision Group; and the most special costume winners were Eung-ming and Choi Ji-hoon of the Golden Dragon Hotel of the Vision Group, respectively.

At the same dinner, under the theme “Commonizing the 20th Anniversary of the Macao Special Administrative Region”, Macao singers were scheduled to sing the song “Little of the Lotus” from the original local song, as well as a number of performances by six large tourist enterprises on the theme of return, showing the diversity of tourism and leisure elements in Macao and the number of tour operators.
Since 1980, the World Tourism Organization has designated 27 September of each year as World Tourism Day, with the aim of promoting international awareness of the importance of tourism, in particular its social, cultural, political and economic values.

"Go Out" for Chinese citizens - visit Choi Ai-min, Director of Consular Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Wherever you go, the country is behind you.
On 25 November, the first Ministry of Foreign Affairs had launched a short film on the protection of public goods, which ended with a statement resonance from a wide network of friends.
In an interview with a Xinhua journalist, the Director-General of Consular Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Choi Ai-min, stated that the short film was intended to further make the public feel the love and temperature of “diplomatics for the people” and to make Chinese citizens feel that Chinese diplomats would extend their help, help, strength and hope to them, wherever they may be in any corner of the world.
There's nothing wrong with being out there. There's nothing to worry about.
According to CHOI E-min, the number of Chinese citizens “leaving out” has increased dramatically over the past 70 years, from “less than a million a year” before reform and opening up to more than a billion times a year today; at the same time, Chinese citizens travel abroad in a more secure manner, and consular protection and assistance work has expanded from overseas to overseas Chinese.
According to statistics, since the Party ' s eighteenth birthday, we have organized more than 10 major evacuations or relocations of Chinese citizens abroad, resulting in the safe evacuation of more than 40,000 Chinese citizens from dangerous and volatile areas.
Some 500,000 cases of various kinds of help have been received and coordinated, involving nearly 1 million Chinese citizens.
In times of danger, the country can take you home; it's no longer a dream to have a "go-go-go" trip.
According to Choi E-min, by the end of August this year, China had concluded visa-free mutual agreements with 14 countries covering persons with ordinary passports.
In addition, an increasing number of countries have unilaterally granted Chinese citizens entry facilities such as visa waivers or landing visas.
Forty-two countries and territories, including Thailand, Egypt and others, have unilaterally granted Chinese citizens with ordinary passports land visas, while another 15, such as Indonesia, have unilaterally allowed Chinese citizens with ordinary passports to be exempted from entry.
In addition to arrangements such as waivers, landings, etc., Chinese citizens are becoming easier and easier to apply for visas.
By the end of August, China had concluded visa facilitation agreements or arrangements with 41 countries.
These include reciprocal visas with the United States, Canada, Israel and Argentina for tourism, 10 years of valid multiple visas for business personnel and two years of multiple visa arrangements with the United Kingdom for tourism, commerce and family visits.
The United Kingdom and Belgium jointly introduced a “visa one stop” service, while France, Italy and Singapore reduced visa processing time to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
For business people who often leave the country, the APEC business travel card, which is easily accessible and accessible, is a good option.
According to Choi Aimin, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining multiple visas for more than five years in 16 economies around Asia and the Pacific, and is significant for business people, especially private business personnel, to “go out”.
At present, China ' s effective holding of cards is among the top of the APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, promote visa facilitation measures by more countries for Chinese citizens, translate the results of diplomatic efforts more into welfare initiatives for all citizens, and continuously increase the " gold content " of Chinese passports.
The Fourth of July is approaching.
Yesterday morning, the City Council Secretary, Chai Chi, led a team to examine the safety of production and the availability of the holiday market during the National Day.
He stressed the need to improve political positions, reinforce bottom-line thinking, do everything in a firm manner to ensure the safe functioning of cities and the supply of markets, celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China, and allow citizens to celebrate a happy and safe holiday.

Chai Chi and Chen Jiining scrutinized the operation and safe production of the power supply and asked for important details of the supply security and went into the Movement Control Lobby to report on the safety of the power supply and the air supply during the festival in conjunction with the large screens.
Chai Chi expressed his condolences to the first line of staff and stressed the need to develop bottom-line thinking, catch fire and other tasks, focus more on the scene and at the end, enhance the monitoring of the operation of security risk screening and equipment on a site-by-point basis, and ensure the absolute safety of the supply of electricity and gas.
All kinds of goods in the royal well department store building are full and enjoyable on the occasion of the festival.
The Peace Bureau on the Second Basement, the walls of the Blue Bricks and old shops, such as age-old cinemas, theatres, food shops, old bookstores and other shops, smelled heavily of Beijing.
Chai Chi and Chen Ji Ning are on their way to learn more about the security of the festival by listening to the Hong Kong people's shop in conjunction with the upgrading of the streets and upgrading their businesses, and to report on the supply of the market.

Jiangxi: "Lieutenant" secures the operation of the passenger line.
Journalists have been informed by the Road Transport Authority of Jiangxi Province that, to date, 1334 passenger transport lines have been “longlined” in 11 municipalities and 6 prefectures.
The head of the Road Transport Authority of Jiangxi Province explained that the security situation for road passengers was more serious owing to the formality of the security management of some of the passenger carriers, the failure of business security agents to take responsibility, the excessive speed of passenger vehicles and the tired driving of drivers, among other violations.
In order to further consolidate the responsibility of road passenger companies for the safe production of goods and to ensure the safety of passengers travelling by car, the pilot “Long Line” was started in 2017 in Jiangxi and gradually expanded throughout the province in 2018.
At present, 92 road passenger companies in Jiangxi have implemented a “long line” and selected 1334 line managers, covering 4824 mobile buses.
It was stated that the “head of the line” was typically staffed by personnel designated by road transport passenger carriers, who were specifically responsible for managing the relevant line lines, vehicles, lines, etc., ensuring that the head of the line had complete control over the lines, vehicles, drivers, operating environments, etc., and ensuring the safe operation of the line.

Fortune provincial tax bank, Silver Indigent Tax Paying Platform, officially online - China-New Network
The Hong Kong tax collection platform is officially launched in Fujian province.
On 27 September, in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, the Hong Kong tax collection platform was officially launched in Fuzhou City, Fujian Province.
The journalist was informed that on 26 October 2018, the central branch of Fukuzhou, People ' s Bank of China, jointly signed a tripartite memorandum of cooperation between the State Tax Administration of Fujian Province and the China Silver Union Ltd., which set up a national platform to collect taxes and taxes for the benefit of the provincial tax bank.
After almost a year of construction, the platform is now on-line successfully.
Wang Deok-hye, Director of the Treasury, Central Bank of Fuzhou, People ' s Bank of China, based on the concept of security, universality, convenience, compliance and leadership, with front-end connections to tax, government, banking, non-bank paying agencies and social services, providing mobile phone APP, Weibo Public
According to the information received, the platform brings together a number of projects for the benefit of the population, of which the project for the collection of fees for health care for urban and rural residents has been officially launched.
The project provides services to more than 30 million urban and rural residents in Fujian province and covers 76 per cent of the permanent resident population in Fujian province.
Online payments can be made through “Closing Tax Lines”, “Cunt Flash” and various banks' APPs, micro-Credit Public, etc.; underline payments can be made to tax halls and rural inclusive financial services points in Fujian province in a variety of ways, such as scavenging, swing cards and swipe cards.
The Vice-President of the Fuzhou Central Branch of the People ' s Bank of China, Shidong, stated that the platform ' s success had been brought to the fore and that, while ensuring that government revenues were deposited directly into the bank and that data and information were exchanged in real time, it was possible to provide a safe, efficient, multi-channel and multi-modal household tax service to the public at large.
At present, more than 16,000 inclusive financial services sites across the province have opened up more than 9,000 health-care fees, making it possible for rural residents to make sure that they pay their health-care contributions without being able to reach their villages, giving the public an increasingly strong sense of “access”, “happiness” and “happiness”
According to statistics, in the 20 days since the pre-test operation of the Platform ' s health-care fee collection project for urban and rural residents, the number of service users has reached 840,000, of which 750,000 are on-line and nearly 20,000 are covered by inclusive financial services points.
In addition, the Deputy Director-General of the Fujian Department of Revenue of the State Tax Administration revealed at the event that the platform had pioneered the application of the block chain electronic payment certificate technology throughout the country.
Starting next month, the payer may also download the stamped electronic certificate of contribution directly through his mobile phone after completion of the contribution.
The Fujian tax information network, based on block chain technology, is being built, and the “high-speed road” for private tax payments will be further expanded.
The United States will deploy additional air defence systems and troops in Saudi Arabia.
The United States Department of Defense announced on 26 November that, as a result of the previous attack on Saudi oil facilities, the United States would deploy an additional “patriotic” air defence system, four “Sentry” radar systems and some 200 United States troops in Saudi Arabia.
In a statement on the same day, the Pentagon stated that the deployment would upgrade the anti-aircraft and anti-missile capabilities of key military targets and civilian infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and enhance the United States military presence in the area.
The statement also stated that United States Secretary of Defense Esper had simultaneously approved the inclusion of two “patriotic” air defence systems and a “Sad” ABM system in the preparation deployment sequence.
Some United States defence media questioned the effectiveness of the deployment, arguing that the main targets of the “patriotic” and “Sad” systems for interception were not low-altitude targets such as drones and cruise missiles that the United States claimed attacked Saudi Arabia.
In his address to the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly, Iranian President Rouhani said that Iran could help to maintain “safe Persian Gulf” and ensure the smooth and safe passage of oil transport vessels through the Strait of Hormuz, with equitable rights for all States.
At the same time, he stressed that regional security could be achieved only if United States forces withdrew from the area.
On 14 this month, several drones attacked two Saudi National Oil Company oil installations and set fire to them.
The United States accuses Iran of having perpetrated the attack and of imposing new sanctions on Iran.
The Chairman of the Celes Growth Project completed last year’s call for staff to increase by up to 43%.
On the evening of 25 September, Cyrus (603716.SH) announced that the company ' s de facto controller and chairman, Wen Wei, had increased the company ' s shares by a total of 105.42 million shares, or 0.5139 per cent of the company ' s total stock, through a pool of bid transactions on the Shanghai Stock Exchange,
Prior to the implementation of the plan, Wenwei had a direct holdings of 8.18 per cent of the company's total equity of 8.5 million shares in Celius, and a holding shareholder, Sumi Sumi Scientific Instruments Co. Ltd., Tianjin City (hereinafter referred to as “Sumi Tianjin”) held 8218.35.
It is a matter of concern that this is not the first time that Célis has made a good offer.
Since last September, in a short period of one year, Cyrus has successively introduced measures such as executive growth, head-to-head initiatives, buy-back shares and equity incentives.
On 18 September last year, Cyrus announced that the seven planned top executives of the company, Liu Wenhouse, had accumulated 394,300 shares (0.1922 per cent of the company ' s total stock stock), bringing the total increase to $7,02.29 million.
Shortly thereafter, the Chairman and the realist, Wenwei, initiated an initiative to increase corporate equity for their employees and promised that they would be compensated for their losses.
The increase covers the period from 19 October to 31 October 2018, with a total ceiling of 150 million yuan for the addition of the company ' s stock, which is subject to continuous holding of the company ' s stock for a period of more than 12 months and is not subject to reduction, and the employee is on board at the time the increase is compensated.
Journalist combing found that the minimum share price for the above-mentioned initiative staff was $14.02 and up to $16.44 during the period of the increase in staff, and that the maximum surplus was 42.80 per cent on 25 September, when Cyrus collected $20.02.
On 21 January of this year, Cyrus again adopted the Repurchase Company Equity Programme, in which it was announced that the total amount of funds to be used for the repurchase of shares was not less than 160 million yuan yuan and not more than 280 million yuan yuan.
On 8 August of this year, the company issued a draft of the Cyprus Restricted Stock Incentives Plan 2019 and set high performance conditions.
According to the bulletin, equity incentives were based on operating income in 2018, with growth rates of not less than 30 per cent, 70 per cent, 120 per cent and 185 per cent for the four fiscal years 2019-2022, respectively.
In terms of Celius ' performance in the first half of the year, the company maintained high growth and exceeded the 30 per cent performance growth unlocked this year.
In the first half of the year, operating income was 842 million yuan, an increase of 46.50 per cent in the same year; the net profit attributable to shareholders in listed companies was 56,23.24 million yuan, an increase of 16.46 per cent in the same year.
And since mid-2018, Cyrus has grown by more than 38% on a year-on-year basis over five consecutive reporting periods, reaching a maximum of 59%.
In 2018, the company established a two-nuclear-driven and coordinated development strategy based on an intensive operation service for medical testing (IVD operations) and a breakthrough between the intensive operation service for medical consumption (SPD operations) and the regional testing centres, with an iterative upgrade based on the consolidation of the advantages of the former IVD operations.
Céles-related sources told journalists that the three main operations of Célis were moving steadily towards rapid expansion in response to the general trend towards medical reform.
In the area of SPD operations, in January this year, Cyrus announced the signing of a cooperation agreement with the People ' s Hospital of the City of Lingwu and the Central Hospital of the City of Lingwu on the construction and day-to-day operation of an intensive operating platform for medical consumption, for a period of three years.
“In fact, Cyrus is expanding its SPD operations to provide health-care institutions with sophisticated operating services such as centralized procurement, warehousing management, distribution and settlement for long-term income.”
According to the above-mentioned persons.
On 17 September, on the basis of the Zhejiang Government Procurement Network ' s Government Procurement Services Information Platform (GAP) bulletin, Célis was awarded the “Provision of Logistics Extension Services in the Institute of Medical Waste (Incl. Reagents)” of the Zhejiang University Medical School, a subsidiary of Zhejiang University.
According to medical industry analysts, this winning target is very gold-bearing, and the JCI is the first public hospital in mainland China, and the successful implementation of the project in the future is an important development opportunity for the hospital.
According to its analysis, the operational map largely completed the operational area coverage of the country ' s provincial areas through regional outreach, national strategic cooperation and through M&As.
Today, in Zhejiang's next city, the successful hospital should continue to replicate the model in different hospitals and enhance the company's competitiveness in the East China market.
In addition, this year Célis has also laid out new and emerging areas such as industrial cannabis, block chain technology and others.
In Beijing, 78,000 volunteers travelled for the National Day.
In order to guarantee the smooth running of the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China, more than 78,000 volunteers from the country ' s transportation civilization will be officially placed on duty on the 28th and will volunteer at various points in the city until 8 October.
Prior to that, the Beijing City leadership group for the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People ' s Republic of China had set up a special volunteer command, which had been set up in the preceding period and had recruited and trained more than 160,000 highly qualified volunteers for higher education institutions, communities, businesses and all sectors of society.
Of these, more than 78,000 volunteers from transportation civilizations.
High-level guests: Between 28 September and 8 October, 78,266 traffic civilized volunteers from the capital city conducted traffic facilitation and traffic guidance at 1700 traffic points and 308 subway stations in Beijing, including more than 300 major traffic hubs.
Two months after being held by Iran, the British tanker “Stanner Empire” was finally released and departed from the Iranian port of Abbas in the morning for international waters.
In the middle of last month, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory released an Iranian tanker that had been detained for more than a month.
According to the news agency of the Islamic Republic of Iran, at 9 a.m. local time 27 a.m., the British tanker “Stanner Empire” departed from the port of Abbas for international waters in the Persian Gulf.
The Iranian Port and Shipping Organization of Hormuzgan Province confirmed that the commander and crew of the vessel had made a formal and written commitment and that, despite their arrest, they had no claim.
The Swedish owner of the “Stanner Empire” tanker, Stena Bulk, also indicated that it was sailing from the port of Abbas.
In addition, vessel tracking data from Refinitiv found that the tanker had begun to move and left Abbas port in 27 days.
The British-flagged tanker, Stena Impero, was seized by Iran in July this year.
The company ' s spokesperson said that the tanker was preparing to leave the port of Abbas.
Two weeks after the British seized an Iranian tanker in the waters of Gibraltar, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards detained the tanker, Steena Impero, on the Strait of Hormuz.
The vessel was released in August.
Earlier this week, the spokesman for the Iranian Government stated that all the legal procedures required for the release of the “Stanner Empire” had been completed.
However, the Iranian side indicated that the investigation was still ongoing.
Several Iranian media outlets also posted videos of the tanker's departure.
On 19 July, the IRGC Navy detained a British tanker, the Stanna Empire, in Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz, and then transported it to the port of Abbas.
The Iranian tanker, Grace I, was seized from the sea off Gibraltar.
In addition, on 4 July, the Gibraltar authorities of the British Overseas Territory seized the “Grace I” tanker carrying Iranian crude oil in the Strait of Gibraltar on the suspicion of transporting oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions.
More than a month later, on 15 August, the Gibraltar authorities announced the release of “Grace I”.
This afternoon, a conference was held in Changsha on the theme of education review and rehabilitation at undergraduate universities throughout the province.
The Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Council, Ulan, stressed the need to improve political positions, strengthen political commitment, take a critical look at the problems, and promote quality development in the construction, political thinking and reform of institutions of higher learning with a view to the effectiveness of thematic education.
Ulan is fully cognizant of the initial results of the second series of thematic education by undergraduate and higher education institutions.
She noted that education on the theme “Don't forget your mind, don't remember your mission” was a major deployment of the Party's centrality, and that undergraduate schools were required to follow up on the important messages of the General Secretary of Xi Jinping on the theme “Don't forget your mind, remember your mission”.
From the promotion of the "four consciousnesss" to the "two preservations", to the political height of the original mission, to the careful completion of the various provisions of the thematic education, especially the set of issues that have been carefully adapted, to the integration of all aspects of the reform and development of schools, to the "two promotions"
Uran stressed the need to keep the blade inside, to keep the problem under review, to find the right questions about the markers, to ask for advice from teachers and students, parents and all sectors of society, and to take them seriously and intellectually, in accordance with the requirements of the "Four Comparisons" and "Four Find One"
The word “change” should be applied in practice by maintaining precision, strengthening real change.
It is important to combine thematic education with the work of the “Leeds Trees” in order to make a difference in responsibility and ensure that the problem remains unsettled, and that it becomes more effective.
It is important to adhere to both the symptoms and the root causes, improve the long-term mechanisms, weave the cages of the penitentiary system, strengthen the rigidity of the system, ensure that the work is regulated, regulated and truly managed by the institution.
In keeping with the above, the leading cadres take the lead in strengthening the theoretical force, taking a serious look at the changes, taking the lead at times and playing the role of “critical minority” as a model, in an effort to accomplish the tasks of thematic education and reform.
Comrades from five institutions of higher learning, including Hunan University, were given a speech.
Two major high-pressure projects are being delivered on a "one-on-one" basis.
On 26 June, the direct transmission of electricity from the east to the south of the country at 1100 kV and the Sotoon 1,000 kV exchange at the GIL complex were delivered.
Both of these projects, which account for the current highs in each of the world ' s transmission technologies, will lead to a significant increase in the optimal configuration of the country ' s energy resources on a large scale.
The General Economist of the National Energy Agency, Guo Ji, stated that proximate east to Xiangnan was the transmission project with the largest power delivery capacity and the most distant transmission in the world.
Their delivery is important for promoting the development of the Xinjiang energy base and securing electricity supply in the East China region.
GIL, a closed transmission line for gas-insulated metals.
The Sutong Concourse project, which created a record of the highest global voltage and transmission capacity of the GIL project, achieved the combined operation of the `interchange two-ring net' of the highest voltage level of the Chinese backbone grid.
According to the National Electricity Network Corporation, the distance of power transmission from the North-East to the south-east was 3324 kilometres.
When conventional technologies are used, more than 15 per cent of electricity will be lost in transit, and the project has been developed and developed through closures, raising the economic transport distance significantly to more than 3,000 kilometres.
After delivery, 100 million degrees of electrical power can be delivered every 8 hours and 20 minutes after delivery to Xinnan, which can help to disrupt the depletion of the new energy sources available in Xinjiang.
According to full load estimates, the annual electricity delivery of this line alone will reach between 60 and 85 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh), which will meet more than half of Shanghai ' s electricity use throughout the year.
The Sutong GIL Integrated Chrysotile Project is the control work of the ultra-high pressure communication ring network across the Yangtze.
The use of conventional empty lines across the river would require the installation of two giant towers of over 450 metres above the Yangtze River and the construction of an artificial island of over four football fields for each tower.
In response, the national electricity grid was boldly innovative, producing compact super-voltage exchange technologies for GIL transmission, crossing the river from the water through tunnels and avoiding the impact on the gold channel.
Two projects have contributed to a new leap in the capacity of our electricians to manufacture their equipment.
At present, the national grid has built cumulatively a “10-to-11” super-high voltage project, with a “4-to-3” in progress.
Foreign Exchange Office: our external debt structure continues to be optimized and external debt stability enhanced
“In general, the external debt structure of the country continues to be optimized, and external debt stability has increased.”
The press spokesman for the National Foreign Exchange Administration, Wang Chun Ying, the chief economist, stated on 27 September that the main indicators of our external debt were within the internationally recognized security line and that external debt risk was generally manageable.
Wang Chun-Ying made this statement in response to a question from journalists when the Foreign Exchange Bureau published external debt data for the end of June 2019.
The data show that, as of the end of June 2019, our external debt balance at full calibre (including this foreign currency) stood at US$ 1998 billion, an increase of US$ 26.3 billion, or 1.3 per cent, over the end of March 2019, largely due to the growth in the debt stock balance.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70 per cent of our full-calibre external debt growth was driven by the purchase by non-residents of in-country renminbi bonds, mainly by medium- and long-term investors such as central banks.
At the end of June 2019, the share of medium- and long-term external debt rose by 3 percentage points compared to the end of March 2019, and the share of foreign debt in this currency rose by 1 percentage point compared to the end of March 2019.
Wang Chun Ying stated that, with the incorporation of renminbi bonds into the Bloombergaclé Global Aggregate Index in April 2019 in our country, the recognition of Chinese bond markets by international investors has increased further, with a sustained increase in domestic renminbi bonds.
“Our balance of payments is generally balanced and external debt risks are manageable.”
The journalist learned from the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences on 27 September that the Yunnan meadows are now effectively protected against widespread outbreaks of violence and have achieved phased results.
In January of this year, the city of Jiangcheng County, Yunnan Pumang City, discovered for the first time that night moths had been moved from abroad, and subsequently confirmed their occurrence in 129 counties in Yunnan, as well as the gradual spread of night moths from Yunnan to the interior of China, posing a direct threat to Chinese food production.
Grassland night moths, an important agricultural pest derived from the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas with a multi-edible long-range migration, are a major migratory pest of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) global warning, characterized by “internationality, migration, outbreak, destruction”.
The pest endangers more than 80 crops, including maize, sugar cane and sorghum, and can cause up to 70 per cent of production losses.
Control is difficult and there are no registered pesticides in China to control the disease.
The Yunnan Department of Agricultural Sciences has selected Eidung Fellows to lead the Yunnan Department of Agricultural Sciences on cross-border harmful organisms in agriculture in coordination with the Green Prevention and Control Department innovation team on the first line, field research, sample collection and technical guidance and demonstration.
The team has acquired initial knowledge of the stock characteristics of night moths in the Yunnan meadows, the resources of natural trichlorfon, the characteristics of the source of off-shore insects, the trajectories of the population, the toxic effects of the agents and the effects of field control.
They are actively engaged in research and application of green control technologies and have achieved more than 90 per cent control in demonstration areas through the implementation of new green control technologies such as stock monitoring, pest traps, scientific medicines and agronomy measures, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting the natural enemy resources and the ecological environment and providing protection for Yunnan.
At present, night moths from the Yunnan meadows have been effectively protected from large-scale outbreaks and phased results have been achieved.
As a next step, the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on ecological mechanisms for the invasion of populations, breaking through the biocontrol and green control technology systems.
At the same time, cross-border international cooperation has been actively promoted with a view to establishing joint priority laboratories and joint monitoring networks and demonstration areas outside the country to enhance the full range of monitoring and early warning capabilities for night moths in Yunnan.
According to the website of the People ' s Bank of China, on 30 September 2019, the People ' s Bank of China is scheduled to issue the Chinese International Import Expo panda plus the silver and gold medals.
This set of silver and gold coins consists of two pieces, of which one is gold and one is silver and is the legal currency of the People ' s Republic of China.
It was reported that the positive picture of the silver and gold medals was a pavilion of the Beijing altar and that the names of the countries, the year number and the words “China International Import Fair” were published in Chinese.
The image of the back of the 8-gram circle gold medallion is a picture of the mother and the panda and is published in the words “8g Au.999” and “China International Import Fair” in English and in the square.
A picture of the back of the 30-gram circle silver memorized currency is given by the mother and panda and is published in the words “30g Ag.999” and “International Import Fair of China” in English and in the square.
The 8-gram circle gold memorized coin is described as a universal currency containing 8-gram pure gold, 22-mm diameter, 100-dollar face, 99.9-per-cent colour, with a maximum circulation of 10,000.
The 30-gram circle silver memorized currency is a universal currency containing 30-gram silver, 40-mm diameter, 10-dollar, 99.9-per-cent colour, with a maximum circulation of 20,000.
The silver and gold coins were forged by Shenyang Co. Ltd. and sold by China Gold General.
White paper: China moving out of a country-specific development path
On September 27, China News Agency Beijing launched the White Paper " China and the World in a New Era " by the Press Office of the State Council of China.
According to the White Paper, over the past 70 years, the Chinese people have struggled to explore and move forward, successfully opening the path of socialism of the Chinese identity and achieving world-renowned development achievements.
According to the White Paper, China ' s development depends on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development has been driven by the spirit of “800 million shirts for a Boeing”, which has kept up for generations and continued its struggles, giving people the hard work and sweat they can't imagine; and by the spirit of “takes on their own”, whether it be good or bad, no.
The White Paper stated that China had developed in its interaction with the world, that China ' s development had injected positive energy into world peace and development, and that China ' s roads were in line with China ' s national circumstances and the requirements of the times.
China is taking practical action to preserve world peace.
For 70 years, China had not initiated any war or conflict and had not appropriated an inch of another country ' s land.
The White Paper states that China ' s development has been a great success over the past 70 years, and that the fundamental reason is to find the right path to development, the socialism of China ' s identity, and to follow that path with determination.
It is a path that is based on national circumstances, that puts the interests of the people first, that is, reform and innovation, that seeks common development in openness and that is fully governed by the rule of law.
China, with its enormous size and complex national circumstances, its difficult governance is rare. Without a united and strong leadership, China will move towards division and disintegration, bringing disaster to the world.
The White Paper stated that over the past 70 years, China had overcome risks and challenges and created another world-renowned Chinese miracle.
In particular, since the 18th year of the Communist Party of China, China has achieved historic achievements and made historic changes, and the Chinese nation has taken a great leap from standing up to being rich to being strong, closer than ever before to the great goal of national renaissance.
This path of development in China will increasingly show bright prospects for development as the times move forward.

Taiwan scholars have argued that the “indeterminate times” players need to keep up with the mainstream industries on the continent.
The “2019 Business Innovative Business Models Forum” was held in Taipei on 26, 27 days a day or two.
The event invited a number of representatives of broadcasters and scholars to share their experiences on business transformation, innovation, succession and market development.
The Forum was hosted by the Taipei Institute of Business Management and co-sponsored by such organizations as Goldstone Securities and the Alliance of Outstanding Continental Trade Unions.
The two days were divided into workshops on transition and upgrading models, business strategies, etc., which were attended by more than 100 participants.
Chen Ming-hoon, President of the Taipei Institute of Business Management, stated that trade frictions between China and the United States persisted and that customers faced “undefined times”.
In his view, it was necessary to keep pace with the times and keep pace with the mainstream industries developing on the continent, with particular attention to innovative products related to science and technology, culture, tourism and health.
"Once upon a time, the operator valued quality, effectiveness and delivery. "
According to Chen Mingjian, these conditions alone are no longer sufficient at this time.
He referred to the need for firms to combine speed and services, speed up supply chains, and focus on extension and product services.
In addition, “service value added” is a new area where businesses can significantly develop.
A statement was made by the representative of Taiwan, who, in his capacity as Chairman of the Taiwan Trader Ame Electronics Company Ltd., Guangdong, introduced Xu Wen Chamber, who had described the business difficulties caused by the sharp decline in orders, and the group had begun to improve its operations through various orientations, such as structural adjustments and living assets.

The General Manager of Solar God (Beyond) Electronics Co. Ltd., Shih Hung, suggested that if it was difficult to develop new customers, it would be preferable to focus on the original customers to provide a “one-stop” service.
The replacement of a customer is not unique to the factors of poor service delivery, high price, low quality, slow delivery, low variety and integrity, which, together with the timely adaptation of production lines and the expansion of product lines, make the enterprise itself an irreplaceable supplier for the client.
The ceremony of the 2019 Outstanding Continental Dealers Award, also hosted by the Taipei Business Management Institute, was held in Taipei on 27 November.
According to the Taiwan Daily Journal of the Economy, the General Manager of Golden Land Corporation, which operates in Shanghai, was awarded the “Order of Excellence and Cross-Strait Contribution Award”.
New regulations for consultation: qualification for access to rural land by social capital
Qualified access to rural land by social capital
Public consultation on the rural land transfer management scheme to regulate the transfer of social capital to land rights, such as business enterprises
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development published an open notice for comments on the Management of Rural Land Administration Transfers (Revised Draft Comments) (hereinafter referred to as the Draft Views), which increased the regulation and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital to land, such as business enterprises.
The Draft Opinion is now open to public consultation.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, in order to implement the newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act, to further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, to deepen the reform of the rural land system and to implement the “triple power-sharing” system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has amended the Rural Land Contracting Transfer Management System.
The Beijing Young News journalist was informed of several important changes to the first publication of the Draft Opinion.
The newly amended Rural Land Contracting Act defines the scope of land transfer and implements the concept of “triple-ownership”, with separate sections on “the right to land contracting” and “the right to land management”, the transfer of land contracting rights, swaps and the transfer of land administration rights (rents, leases)
In this Draft Opinion, in order to give effect to the concept of the “triple division of powers” and to respond effectively to the thrust of the amendments to the Rural Land Contracting Act, and taking into account the significant differences between the transfer of land and the exchange of land contracting rights, the transfer of such rights in terms of parties, procedures, regulations, etc., the present revision is intended to change the flow.
Transfers and swaps of land contracting rights will be regulated separately.
According to the Draft Opinion, in the context of the “three-power division”, farmers are only entitled to land ownership for a limited period of time.
Theoretically, even in the event of liquidation, farmers only run the risk of losing the right to operate for a certain period of time, thus providing for the return of the contracting land to the original contractor is no longer legally necessary and in conflict with the Bankruptcy Act.
In order to protect farmers against the risk of land loss, priority shares, first-to-rent, buy-back, etc., have been developed in practice.
Taking into account that priority shares already have more mature theoretical explorations of company law, it is suggested that they be used as advocacy provisions to protect against the risk of loss of access.

Stars emit light and heat because energy is generated when hydrogen atoms are combined (or fusion) to form heavier elements.
Scientists are currently working to build a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
However, it's a difficult question to solve. It takes years for us to see a functional fusion reactor built.
As a result of surface tension, steel needles can float over the water.
Surface tension occurs because water molecules on the surface are strongly attracted to each other, and the gravity between them is more attractive than between water molecules and air molecules above them.
The water molecules form an invisible layer of skin on the surface of the water that allows things like needles to float over the water.
The edges of modern skates are double-edged, with a hole between the blades and the blades. They have a better grip on the ice (even when tilted).
The edge of the knife, which was in contact with the ice, was bent when it leaned towards one of the sides because of the bending of the base of the blade.
So the skaters can turn around. The skaters lean to the right, the skaters turn to the right. The skaters lean to the left, the skaters turn to the left.
They must eliminate excess energy from light in order to return to the previous level of energy.
They do so by launching a tiny photoparticle known as a photon.
Scientists refer to this process as “accidental radiation” because atoms are stimulated by strong light, triggering the launch of photons, which is also a form of radiation.
The next picture shows the atomic emission of the photon. Of course, the photon is actually much smaller than the image.
Photons are even smaller than the substances that make up the atoms!
After several hundred hours of use, the lamps were eventually burned and the bulbs were not on.
The light bulbs need to be replaced. The light bulbs must be replaced with care.
First, it is important to close the switch on the lighting or to break the cable connection.
This is because when there is still a part of the bulb that is connected to the plug, when you come into contact with the inside of the plug or the metal base of the bulb, the current flows into the plug (the link to the base of the bulb metal) and makes you severely electrocuted.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which transports blood.
The blood flows out of the heart through the pipe known as the arteries, and then through the pipe known as the veins, back to the heart. The smallest pipe is called the hair vessels.
Triangular dragons have teeth that bite not only leaves, but also very hard branches and roots.
According to some scientists, the triceratops feed on iron, which is a common plant in the white age.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown made of nailed sharp leaves.
Before eating the trunk, the Triceratops will strip the leaves with its powerful beak.
Other scientists believe that these plants are toxic, so dinosaurs are less likely to eat them, even now that lazy and other animals, such as parrots (the offspring of dinosaurs), can eat toxic leaves or fruits.
What does Io's gravity do to me? If you stand on the surface of Io, you'll weigh less than you do on Earth.
A man who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth, weighs about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. Gravity, of course, gives you a smaller pull.
The sun does not stand above the Earth's crust. The whole sun is made of gas, fire and plasma.
The further you get to the center of the sun, the thinner the gas.
The outside of the sun that we see is called the light sphere, meaning the ball of light.
Some 3,000 years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used telescopes to observe objects and found that Venus had a position consistent with the Moon.
Discrepancies occur because Venus (or the moon) is only seen on one side of the Sun. Venus variations support Copernicus's theory that planets rotate around the Sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, a British astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a Venus Day.
England has gone through a long period of peace following the reconquerment of the Danish Law Area (Danelaw).

Sanskrit is a vast and sophisticated language and the origin of many modern Hindis, just as Latin is the origin of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the end of the fight against the law, Germany began preparations for the invasion of Britain.
Germany designated the attack as Operation Sea Lion. British forces lost most of their heavy weapons and supplies when they withdrew from Dunkirk, causing heavy damage.
However, the Royal Navy was much better than the German Navy (“Kriegsmarine”) and could destroy any invading fleet across the English Channel.
However, few Royal Navy vessels are stationed near potential intrusion routes, as the Admirals fear that the ships will be sunk by German air.
Let's start by explaining Italy's plan. Italy is basically a little brother of Germany and Japan.
Both the army and the navy were weak, although they built four new ships shortly before the war began.
The main objective of Italy is African countries, which, in order to seize them, need an army base so that they can cross the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
To that end, they had to withdraw their British bases and ships in Egypt. Apart from these actions, Italian warships should not have acted.
Now come to Japan. Like the United Kingdom, Japan is an island nation.
The submarines were designed to operate under water and remained under water for a long period of time.
Submarines were used during the First World War and the Second World War, when they were slow and very limited in range.
At the beginning of the war, most of them sailed over the sea, but as radar development and accuracy increased, submarines were forced into the water to avoid detection.
German submarines are called U-boats. Germans are very good at navigation and operating submarines.
Because of the success of the Germans in submarines, they were not entrusted with large numbers of submarines after the war.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes also known as the “Tout King” or the “Juvenile King”, is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings of modern times.
Interestingly, he was not considered an important figure in ancient times and was not recorded on the list of most ancient kings.
However, his grave was discovered in 1922, making him a celebrity. Although many past graves were stolen, it was almost undamaged.
Most of Tutankhamun ' s accompanies are well preserved, including thousands of items made of precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of the irradiated wheels made the Assyrians ' combat vehicles lighter and faster, and could travel more easily than soldiers and other combat vehicles.
They shoot arrows out of a deadly crossbow, piercing the armor of the enemy. Around 1,000 B.C., Assyrians used the first cavalry.
Cavalry is the army that fights on the back of a horse. The saddle was not invented at the time, so Assyrian cavalry fights on the back of a bare horse.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists, and artists. The most famous person in Greek culture may be Homer, the legendary poet of the blind. He created two masterpieces of Greek literature: Iliat and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes remain popular playwrights whose drama is considered to be one of the greatest works in world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, whose most famous achievement has been the presentation of a well-known theorem of the cross-sectional relationship between the rectangular triangles.
The number of people speaking Hindi is different. Hindi is estimated to be the second to fourth most commonly spoken language in the world.
The number of mother tongues depends on whether closely related dialects are counted.
It is estimated that the number of people who speak this language ranges from 340 to 500 million, while the number of people who understand it amounts to 800 million.
The Hindu and Urdu languages have similar terms, but the scripts are written differently; in daily dialogue, the two languages are usually interchangeable.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was heavily influenced by German culture.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to their own people, so they invented the Estonian language.
It adds the letter "" to the alphabet in German.
Over time, many German foreign words are combined with the original vocabulary. This is the beginning of the Enlightenment movement.
Traditionally, heirs to the throne have been recruited directly upon completion of their studies.
However, Charles entered the Trinity College of Cambridge University, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later in history, where he obtained a degree of 2:2 (second degree).
Charles was the first British Crown member to obtain a degree.
The part of Turkey located in Europe (eastern Thrace or Rumilia in the Balkans) accounts for 3 per cent of its territory.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 miles) and 800 kilometres (500 miles) wide, roughly rectangular.
Turkey has an area (including lakes) of 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 square miles) are located in South-West Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174)
Turkey is 37th in the world, roughly the sum of metropolitan France and the United Kingdom.
Turkey is surrounded by three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but only became independent in 1839.
Some parts of today's Belgium used to belong to Luxembourg, but were classified in Belgium after the Belgian revolution of the 19th and 30th centuries.
Luxembourg had always tried to become a neutral State, but it had been occupied by Germany during the First World War and the Second World War.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of an organization now known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong, a destroyed fortress and Buddhist temple, is located in the upper part of the Paro district (in Fonde village).
Zabdrung nawang Namgyel is said to have built this fortress in 1649 in memory of his victory over the Tibetan army.
In 1951, a fire left only one trace in Fort Dukaye, such as the statue of Zabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
In the aftermath of the fire, the fortress was maintained and protected as one of Bhutan ' s most visible attractions.
Cambodia in the 18th century was caught between two strong neighbours, Thailand and Viet Nam.
Thais invaded Cambodia many times in the 18th century and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.
In the last few years of the 18th century, Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen per cent of Venezuelans are unemployed, while the majority of those employed are employed in the informal economy.
This is how two thirds of Venezuelans work in the service industry, nearly one quarter in industry and one fifth in agriculture.
Venezuela is a net exporter of oil, and although only 1 per cent of the population works in the oil industry, the oil industry remains an important industry in the country.
In the early years of the country's independence, the Botanical Garden of Singapore helped the island to become a tropical “garden city”, using its professional director.
In 1981, Cheuk Jin Wandelan was chosen as the national flower of the country. It's a hybrid of orchids.
Every year, around 10 months, approximately 1.5 million herbivores travel from the northern mountainous regions across the Mara River to the rain-rich southern plains.
Then, after the rainy season of around April, they returned from the west to the north, once again crossing the Mara River.
The Serengeti area includes Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Nature Reserve in Tanzania, Maswa Wildlife Reserve and Maasai in Kenya
Learning to produce interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools acquired in interactive courses ( storyboard production, audio and video editing, story plot design, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to re-evaluate assumptions about media production and learn to think non-linear.
The interactive design requires that the various components of the project are interlinked, but can also exist as an independent entity.
The disadvantage of the focal lens is that, in order to achieve a certain focus range, the number of focus complexes and lens components required is much greater than the number of focal lenses.
This is no longer a problem as camera manufacturers reach higher standards in camera production.
This makes it possible to take pictures comparable to the mass of the fixed focus lens.
Another disadvantage of the focal lens is that the maximum halo (speed) of the lens is usually smaller.
This makes it difficult for cheap focal lenses to be used in weak light conditions without flashlights.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a film into a DVD format is overscanning.
Most television programmes are produced for the entertainment of the general public.
For that reason, the frame you saw on television, including the top, the bottom and the side, was cut.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It's called "overscan."
Unfortunately, when you produce DVDs, its borders are likely to be cut off, and if the subtitles in the video are too close to the bottom, the subtitles will also show incompleteness.
This traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination and brought to mind images of horse spears, feasts and the spirit of King Arthur.
Even standing in the ruins of the millennium, it is easy to recall the sound and smell of war that has long passed away and to hear the sound of horseshoes collapsing on pebbles and to smell the fear that comes out of the dungeon pits.
But is there a real basis for our imagination? Why build castles in the first place? How are they designed and built?
As a typical building for that period, the Castle of Muxloe was more a reinforced house than a real castle.
Its big glass windows and thin walls could not withstand a determined attack for a long time.
In the 1980s, when Lord Hastings began to build this castle, the country was relatively peaceful and only needed to defend itself against a small group of wandering looters.
The balance of power is the system in which European countries seek to preserve the national sovereignty of all European countries.
The idea is that all European countries must try to prevent a country/region from becoming strong on its own, so that Governments often change allies in order to maintain balance.
The Spanish war on inheritance marked the first war with a balance of power at its core.
This marks an important change, because Europe’s major powers will no longer be able to justify religious wars. So three decades of war will be the last one to be labelled as religious wars.
On July 21, 356 B.C., the arson of Herostatus caused the destruction of the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus.
According to the story, this man is willing to show his face at any cost. The outraged Ephesus declared the name of Herostartus to be inexhaustible.
The Greek historian Strabo later mentioned the name, which we know today. The temple was destroyed on the night Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander the Great proposed to rebuild the temple, but his proposal was rejected. Then, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.
Make sure your hands are as relaxed as possible, while still striking all notes correctly - and not doing too much extraneous action with your fingers.
So you can save your strength as much as you can. Remember, you don't have to push it up as hard as you do on the piano.
In order to increase the volume of accordion, the windbox can be pulled harder or faster.
Mysticism seeks to communicate with the ultimate reality, God, spiritual truth or God's sense of identity or consciousness.
The faithful seek a direct experience, intuition or an epiphany of sacred reality/gods or gods.
Followers pursue a way of life or practices designed to nurture these experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship because it emphasizes the direct experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially a peaceful, perceptive, happy and even eccentric state of consciousness.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region in the 15th century and came from intra-sect divisions in Hindu traditions.
Sikhs believe that they believe in a religion different from Hinduism, although they recognize that Sikhism originates from Hinduism and encompasses Hindu traditions.
The Sikhs refer to their religion as Gurmat, meaning in Punjabi “the road of Gulu.” Gulu is an essential part of all Indian religions, but is particularly high in Sikhism and is at the heart of Sikhism.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Gulu Nanak (1469-1539), followed by nine Gulu.
However, in June 1956, the commitment of Khrushchev was put to the test when Polish workers protested against the food shortage and the loss of wages that turned into a protest against the communist system itself.
Although in the end, Khrushchev sent tanks to restore order, he made concessions on a number of economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wadislaw Gomulka as the new Prime Minister.
The Indus Basin civilization, which is a bronze-era civilization, is located on the north-west subcontinent of India and covers most of modern Pakistan, as well as parts of north-west India and north-eastern Afghanistan.
The civilization of the Indus River basin has flourished, and that civilization is therefore well known.
Although some scholars assume that, given that this civilization also exists in today's dried-up Salaswati basin, it is only appropriate to call it “Industrial-Salaswati civilization”, although some refer to it as “Harapa civilization” in the region in the 20th century.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire has contributed to the advancement and development of medicine.
Emperor Augustus began recruiting doctors and even formed the first Roman medical team for post-war medical treatment.
Surgeons have knowledge of a variety of sedatives, including morphine extracted from poppy seeds and east platinum extracted from thorium seeds.
In addition to using tourniquets and arteries to stop the flow of blood, they have been skilled in saving victims of gangrene by amputation.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has achieved great results in the field of medicine, constituting most of the knowledge that we know today.
The rule of limitation in the case of a compact paper is that it can only be folded once at a time, that it is not permissible to fold a more complex action in reverse, and that all folding positions must be simple and clear.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced or inexperienced or less capable people.
When a child is young, he or she becomes aware of racial and ethnic stereotypes that affect his or her behaviour.
If, for example, children of a particular ethnic minority are assumed to perform poorly in school, they tend to behave poorly in school once they understand the stereotypes of their ethnicity.
MySpace, the third most popular site in the United States, currently has 54 million registered accounts.
These websites have received much attention, particularly in the field of education.
These sites also have benefits, such as the ease with which to create a class page containing blogs, videos, photos, etc.
You can easily access the page by providing a web site. This is easier to remember, and easier to enter, for students who do not have keyboards or spelling difficulties.
It can be personalized for reading and can use more or less colours according to demand.
“Access-deficiency” is a neurological syndrome, with three typical defined symptoms including impulses, distractions, hyperactivity or excess energy.
This is not a loss of learning capacity; it is a learning disability; it “impacts 3 per cent to 5 per cent of children across the United States, and may be up to 2 million”.
It is difficult for children with ADs to focus their efforts, such as doing homework, but they are able to concentrate on what they like, such as playing games, watching favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without signs.
These kids often get into a lot of trouble. Because normal ways don't stimulate their brains, they do "dangerous behavior, fight, challenge authority."
Attention Deficiencies (ADD) can affect the relationship between a sick child and his or her peers, as other children cannot understand why patients behave and spell and why their maturity is different.
When the ability to acquire knowledge and learn changes as described above, the basic rate of access to knowledge changes accordingly.
Access to information varies. Pressure no longer exists in personal memories, but the ability to remember texts becomes more important.
The Renaissance has fundamentally changed the way in which learning and knowledge are disseminated.
The difference between primitive humans and other primates is that they no longer move their bodies with their hands, lift their weights and wander in the woods.
The size and length of chimpanzee hands and feet are similar, reflecting the fact that hands are used to bear the weight in their fingers and back walks.
Man's hands are shorter than his feet, and his fingers are sharper.
Two million to three million years ago, the fossils of the handbones showed a change in hand, from the way they moved to the way they operated.
Some believe that often artificially induced and clear dreams are exhausted.
This is due mainly to the fact that a clear dream lengthens the time lag between rapid eye movement.
The shorter the night-time rapid eye movement (REM) and the less time it takes to get a good night's sleep and regain its strength, the more physical problems may arise.
It's as exhausting as waking up to TV every 20 or 30 minutes.
The effect depends on the frequency of your brain's sober dreams every night.
The situation of Italians in North Africa was hardly ideal from the very beginning. Less than a week after Italy declared war on June 10, 1940, the 11th light cavalry of the United Kingdom occupied Capuzburg in Libya.
In an ambush east of Batia, British forces captured General Latussi, the commander of the engineering unit of the Tenth Italian Army.
On June 28, the Governor of Libya and successor to Mussolini, Marshal Ital Itallo Balbo, was killed by friendly fire while landing in Tobruk.
There are several levels of modern sword-fighting: the level of initial studies for university students, the level of specialization and Olympic competition.
The campaign was conducted mainly in the form of a standoff, in which one sculptor fought against another.
Golf is a game of players hitting the ball into a hole with a club.
Eighteen holes in the regular round, usually from the first hole in the field until the end of the eighteenth hole.
Winners who finish the game with a minimum number of hits or swings.
The game was on the grass, and the grass around the cave was cut shorter, known as the ridge.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is also what most people think of it: leisure tourism.
This means that people go to a place that is very different from their daily lives for relaxation and recreation.
Beaches, thematic parks and camps are often the most frequent destinations for leisure tourists.
This type of tourism is referred to as cultural tourism if the purpose of a person ' s visit to a particular place is to understand its history and culture.
Tourists may visit different landmarks in a given country or concentrate on only one area.
In view of such activities, the colonizers had also asked for reinforcements.
The forces supporting the forward positions included the 200-strong New Hampshire 1 and the 3rd Regiment, under the command of Colonel John Stark and Colonel James Reid, who later became generals.
Stark ' s soldiers followed the defensive fence at the north end of the colonial position.
As the tide retreated, a gap was opened by the mysterious river running along the north-eastern part of the peninsula, which quickly built a short stone wall and extended it to the small beach on the north shore.
Gridley or Stark placed a stake 100 feet (30 metres) in front of the fence and ordered that no fire be opened before the regular army passed.
The United States plans to launch a coordinated attack in three different directions.
General John Kadwad will launch an attack on the British garrison in the town of Boden, diverting the enemy's attention from any reinforcements.
General James Ewing, with 700 militiamen crossing the river at the Trenton crossing, seized the bridge on the Gulf of Assempic and blocked the escape route of the enemy forces.
The 2400 main forces will cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and will then be divided into two groups, one under the command of Greene and one under the command of Sullivan, in order to launch the attack before dawn.
Moving from a quarter mile to a half mile race, the speed becomes less important, and durability becomes an absolutely important factor.
Of course, to be a first-class half-mile runner (finished in two minutes), it has to be fast enough and sustained at all costs.
The exercise of cross-country travel during the winter, coupled with the exercise of the upper part of the body, is well prepared for the running season.
Proper nutrition practices alone are not sufficient to produce excellence, but this can significantly affect the overall health status of young athletes.
Keeping a healthy energy balance, adhering to the practice of effectively replenishing water and understanding the various aspects of rational use of nutrient supplements can help athletes improve their performance and increase sports pleasure.
Long- and medium-runs are a relatively inexpensive exercise; however, there is much misunderstanding among the participants about the few items of equipment required.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most of them have little real impact on performance.
Athletes may think that they prefer a product, even if it is of no use.
Atoms can be considered as one of the basic building blocks of the whole substance.
According to the simplified Bor model, this is a very complex entity, containing a central atomic core surrounded by electrons, which are sort of like planets orbiting the sun. See figure 1.1 for details.
The atomic core consists of two particles, neutron and proton.
Protons have positive electricity, neutrons don't have electricity. Electronics have negative power.
In order to examine the victims, you must first survey the site to ensure your own safety.
When approaching the victim, attention needs to be paid to his position and to any unwittingly dangerous signals.
If you want to help someone else, you'll only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear and distressing feelings act as intermediaries in the pain and disability of patients with back pains.
Only the impact of worrying thinking, rather than frustration and fear, can be conditional on regular weekly physical exercise.
Those involved in regular training need more support in the passive perception of pain to help them distinguish between chronic pain and discomfort and normal physical activity.
The ability to see or see depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, i.e. the eyes.
There are many kinds of eye formations, the complexity of which depends on the needs of organisms.
Different configurations have different functions, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different agility. They also need different treatments to understand inputs and require different numbers of inputs to achieve optimal results.
Stock refers to a concentration of specific species of organisms within a given geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are identical on a particular tabular form, this is called a single form.
When individuals display several variants of a certain form, they are multi-morphological.
The marching and nesting of ants are also at different stages.
During the migration phase, ants travel at night and stop and camp during the day.
When the food available is reduced, the colony moves. At this stage, the colony builds temporary nests that are replaced every day.
This nomadic skirmishes will continue every time for about 17 days.
What are cells? The word “cells” is derived from the Latin word “cella”, meaning “small rooms”, originally created by microscopic scientists who observe the structure of the softwood.
Cells are the basic constituent units of all organisms, all of which are made up of one or more cells.
In fact, cells have such a fundamental and crucial place in biological research that they are often referred to as the “fundamental unit of life”.
The nervous system maintains the internal balance by sending a nerve pulse to the body to keep the blood flow smooth.
These nerve pulses can be transmitted to the whole body very quickly, in order to protect the body from any potential threat.
Compared to other violent storms, tornadoes strike smaller areas, but can destroy everything that passes.
The tornado pulls trees up, rips wood from the building, throws cars into the sky. Two percent of the tornado is the strongest and continues to rage for more than three hours.
These monster storms have wind speeds of up to 480 kilometres per hour (133 m/s; 300 mph).
Human beings have been producing and using magnifying glasses for thousands of years.
However, the first real telescope was made in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes use a combination of two lenses, making distant objects look close and large.
Greed and selfishness are always with us. The essence of cooperation is that short-term selfishness always brings more benefits when most people benefit.
It was to be hoped that most people would realize that working with others was the best option in the long run.
Many dream that humankind can migrate to other planets one day to explore other worlds. Some want to know what the universe has; some believe that there may be aliens or other life on other planets.
But if this happens, it's probably not going to happen again for a long time. These stars are very dispersed, and the “neighbour” stars are hundreds of billions of miles apart.
Perhaps one day, your children will live in the outer world, wondering what kind of life their ancient ancestors had at that time.
Animals are made up of many cells. Animals eat food and digest it in their bodies. Most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (but not all animals, e.g. jellyfish have no brains).
There are animals in every corner of the planet. They dig holes in the ground, they swim in the ocean, they fly in the sky.
Cells are the smallest structural and functional units of any type of organism.
The word Cell is derived from Latin conella (meaning small rooms).
In the microscope, you look at organisms and you find them made up of little squares or balls.
The British biologist Robert Hooke saw microscopes of little squares hidden in the cork.
They look like rooms. He was the first to observe death cells.
Elements and compounds can change the physical state in the event of chemical change.
The gas nitrogen is still the same as liquid nitrogen. The density of liquid nitrogen is greater, but the molecules are the same.
Another example is water. The compound water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Whether it is gas, liquid or solid, its molecular structure is the same.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains unchanged.
Time is around us, affecting everything we do, but it is difficult to understand.
For thousands of years, time has been the subject of research by religious, philosophical and scientific scholars.
The time we have been going through is a series of events that have never come to the present or to the past.
Time is also the way we compare the duration of events.
You can record the passage of time by observing repeated cyclical events. A cyclical event is what happens regularly over and over again.
Today, we use computers to process pictures and videos.
Complex animations can be built on computers, and this type of animation is increasingly being applied to television and film.
The recording of music is often handled by sophisticated computers and combines voices.
For a long time in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the first inhabitants of New Zealand were thought to be Māori, who hunted a large bird known as a birdy bird.
The doctrine then established the view that Maori had moved from Polynesia on a “big boat” and had taken New Zealand from the Moriolis, creating an agricultural society.
However, there is new evidence that the Maori belong to the mainland Maori community and that they have moved from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands to develop their own unique culture of peace.
There is another tribe in the Chatham Islands, who are Māori immigrants from New Zealand.
They call themselves the Moriori. There's been a little conflict, and the Moriori were wiped out.
Those who have participated for decades have helped us to recognize our strengths and passions, while at the same time frankly assessing the difficulties and even failures.
In listening to people who share their personal, family and organizational stories, we have a valuable understanding of the past and of those who have had a good or bad influence on the organizational culture.
While understanding history does not mean understanding culture, at least it helps people to understand their place in the history of the organization.
In summing up successes and failures, individuals and all participants will have a deeper understanding of the values, mission and drivers of the organization.
In this context, looking back at previous entrepreneurial behaviour and successes can help to keep people open about new changes and directions in local churches.
Such success stories reduce the fear of change and create positive tendencies for future change.
The mode of condensing thinking is the technique of finding solutions by combining different ideas or fields.
This mindset places emphasis on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as on the screening of facts, the re-application of existing technologies and the collection of information.
The most important element of this mindset is that there is only one answer. You just have to think about two answers, right or wrong.
This pattern of thinking is not irrelevant to certain scientific or standard procedures.
This type of thinking is logical, remembering patterns, solving problems and performing scientific tests.
So far, human beings have been the best at reading the minds of others.
This means that we can successfully predict the perceptions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge or desires of others.
In these capabilities, it is essential to understand the intentions of others. We can use this ability to understand the ambiguity that may be expressed by physical behaviour.
For example, if you see someone breaking a window, you probably think this guy's stealing a stranger's car.
If he had lost the keys to his car and tried to open the door to his own car, that might be something else.
Magnetic resonance imaging is based on a physical phenomenon called NMR, discovered in the 1930s by Felix Broch and Edward Purcell.
In this resonance, magnetic fields and radio waves cause atoms to send weak radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a doctor of medicine and research scientist, discovered the rationale for using magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent, the first in the world to be granted in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance, was approved.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the manufacture of the first “whole body” MRI scanner, which he referred to as “irresistance”.
It gives people time to reflect on and respond to the reactions of others.
This enables students to learn at their own pace and to control the rhythm of teaching messages.
In addition, there are fewer time limits due to the possibility of flexible working hours (Bremer, 1998).
Learners have ready access to information on the Internet and the World Wide Web.
Students can also submit questions to teachers at any time of the day and can expect a quick response within a reasonable time, without waiting until the next interview.
Post-modernist learning gives people absolute freedom. There is no good learning.
In fact, there is nothing to learn. When a learner experiences knowledge, it happens.
This is illustrated by our current experience with all DEYs, displays of information and learning-based television programmes.
Many of us find that television programmes we watch are telling us some sort of process or experience, but we will never participate in or apply that knowledge.
We will never make major repairs to our cars, we will not build fountains in our backyards, we will not go to Peru to visit ancient monuments and we will not rehabilitate the houses of our neighbours.
Thanks to submarine fibre cables and broadband satellites connected to Europe, the Greenland network is well connected and 93 per cent of the population has access to the Internet.
All settlements have a cyber café or a public wifi.
As noted above, while the term “Eskimo” is still acceptable in the United States, many non-Americans in the Arctic, particularly Canadians, find it derogatory.
Although you may hear local Greenlanders use the term, foreigners should refrain from using it.
In Canada, indigenous Greenlanders refer to themselves as Inuit and in Greenland as Kalaalleq (complex number Kalaallit), meaning “Greenlanders”.
In Greenland, crimes and malicious acts against foreigners are generally almost unknown, and even in towns there are no “high-crime zones”.
The cold may be the only real danger that unprepared people will face.
If you visit Greenland during the cold season (remember that the more you go north, the more cold you go), you must bring enough warm clothes.
Long summer days can lead to inadequate sleep and related health problems.
In the summer, attention is also paid to the Nordic mosquitoes. Although these mosquitoes do not spread any disease, they may cause discomfort.
The economy of San Francisco is linked to the fact that it is a world-class tourist destination, but the economy of San Francisco is diversified.
The sectors with the highest employment include professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
It often appears in music, film, literature and popular culture, making the city and its landmarks famous.
San Francisco has developed a large tourism infrastructure with hotels, restaurants and first-class conference facilities.
San Francisco is also a good destination for other Asian foods such as Korean food, Thai food, Indian food and Japanese food in the United States.
For many American families, travelling to Disneyland is a big event.
This “typical” exercise involves flying to Orlando International Airport, travelling by car to the Disney Park Hotel for about a week at Disneyland, and then going home.
Disney's play is numerous, but for most people, that's what it means to go to Disneyland.
Many of the tickets sold on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used for multiple days.
While this was a common practice, Disney prohibited it: tickets were not transferable.
Camping permits are required for camping below the edge of the Grand Canyon.
In order to protect the Grand Canyon, the permit is limited.
Therefore, if the departure date is May, the field camping permit will be issued on 1 January.
The most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel camp near Phantom Ranch, usually receive full booking applications on the first day of opening the reservation.
For unannounced visits, the number of permits reserved is limited and permits are granted on a first-come, first-served basis.
Southern Africa is well placed to travel by car, where tourists can enjoy all the beauty of the region and reach areas outside the regular tourism route.
With careful planning, ordinary cars can be used, but it is strongly recommended that four-drive vehicles be used, and in many places only four-wheel-drive vehicles are allowed to pass.
During the planning period, bear in mind that while Southern Africa is in a stable state, not all neighbouring countries are in the same position.
Visa requirements and fees vary from country to country/area and will be affected by your nationality.
Each country/region has a specific law that regulates emergency items that must be placed in vehicles.
Victoria Falls is a small town in western Zimbabwe, bordering Livings, Zambia, near Botswana.
The town is close to the waterfalls, which are the main attractions, but the popular tourist destination offers many opportunities for explorers and tourists to live in.
During the rainy season (November-March), the amount of water will be higher and the waterfalls more acute.
If you cross a bridge or follow a trail near a waterfall, you'll get wet.
On the other hand, because of the amount of water, the sight will be blocked by the water and the whole waterfall will not be seen!
The Tutankhamun Tomb (KV62). KV62 is probably the most famous burial in the valley. Howard Carter discovered the young king's near-complete royal burial in 1922.
However, compared to most other royal mausoleums, the Tutankhamun mausoleum is hardly worth visiting, as it is much smaller and poorly decorated.
If anyone wanted to see the mummy be damaged when it was removed from the coffin, they would be disappointed, because one could only see the head and shoulders of the mummy.
The vast wealth of the ancient tombs is no longer in the tombs, but has been transferred to the Egyptian museum in Cairo.
Tourists with limited time are encouraged to choose other destinations.
The Temple of Grom is located 12 km south-west of Siem Reap City. It was built at the end of the 9th century under the King of Losing Zones.
The dark atmosphere of the temple and the view of Tonle Sap make it worthwhile to climb to the top of the mountain.
When visiting the site, the lake can also be travelled by boat.
An Angkor tickets are needed to enter the temple, so don't forget your passport when you go to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and the largest city, although most other countries/regions and the United Nations do not recognize it as the capital of Israel.
This ancient city, which sits on Judean Hills, has been a success for thousands of years.
The city is a sacred place for the three main monotheistic religions — Judaism, Christianity and Islam — and a true spiritual, religious and cultural centre.
The religious significance of Jerusalem, especially of many sites in the old city, makes it one of Israel ' s main tourist destinations.
Not only are there many historical, archaeological and cultural sites in Jerusalem, but there are also vibrant shopping centres, cafés and restaurants.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to receive invitations before entering Ecuador through international airports or border crossings.
The letter must be approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador and meet certain requirements.
These requirements were designed to achieve orderly migration between the two countries.
Cuban citizens holding United States green cards should visit the Ecuadorian consulate to obtain the exemption requested.
The date of departure for your passport should be at least six months and a round-trip/joint ticket is required to prove the duration of your stay.
Travel is cheaper for a larger group of travelers. If you travel alone or with a friend, try to meet someone else, form a group of four to six people, so that you can get a more favourable per capita price.
However, there is also a matter of concern, as tourists are often transported in order to fill their cars.
This is actually more like a way of deceiving people to think that they have to pay more.
This steep mountain peak, which is high above the north end of Machu Picchu, often serves as a background for photographs of many sites.
It's a little scary down there, and it's a steep and difficult uphill, but most people in good health should be able to do it in 45 minutes.
Most sections of the path are paved with stone steps; in the steeper part, there are steel cables to support them.
The situation is said to be very dangerous and to be cautious in steep places, especially when the weather is damp.
It has to go through a very small, very narrow hole close to the top.
The best way to visit Galapagos is by boat. Charles Darwin travelled by boat in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships travel regularly to and from Galapagos waters - the size of these cruise ships ranges from 8 to 100 people.
Most people have pre-positioned early (as ships are usually full during the season).
It is important to ensure that the agent for your scheduled trip is an expert in Galapagos, who has extensive knowledge of ships.
This ensures that some of your interests and/or conditions of restraint match those of the ships best suited to them.
Before the arrival of the 16th century Spaniards, the northern part of Chile was ruled by Inca, while the indigenous Araucanians (the Mapuche) lived in the centre and south of Chile.
The Mapuche were also one of the last indigenous American tribes to be independent. It was not until Chile became independent that it was completely under the Spanish-speaking system.
Despite Chile ' s declaration of independence in 1810 (the absence of a functioning central Government for several years during the Napoleon war), it was not until 1818 that a decisive victory was achieved for Spain.
Dominican Republic (Spanish: República dominicana) is a Caribbean country located in the eastern half of Ispaniola, which is divided into Dominica and Haiti.
In addition to having white sand beaches and mountain landscapes, the country is home to one of the oldest European-style cities in the American region and is now part of Santo Domingo.
Taínos and Caribes are the first to settle on this island. The Caribbean are the Arawak-speaking people who came here in about 10000 B.C.
In just a few years after the arrival of European explorers, the Spanish conquerors cut down the population of Tenos.
According to the “Fray Bartolomé de las Casas” (Tratado de las Indias), between 1492 and 1498 Spanish aggressors killed about 100,000 Tinos.
The Union Garden (Jardín de la Unión). This used to be the middle of a 17th century monastery, where the San Diego shrine was the only existing building.
Now it's a central square, full of day and night.
There are many restaurants around the garden, and free concerts are often held in the midday and evenings at the central cooling booths.
Callejon del Beso (kissing alleys). The two balconys are only 69 centimetres apart.
Just give a little money and you can get some kids to tell the story.
Pao Yung Island is a suitable human destination for one-day or weekend trips, where tourism projects and services such as canals, foot trips, shops, restaurants, etc. are provided.
This truly community is located in Hao Bay, near Vancouver, and can easily arrive in regular water taxis from Granville Island, downtown Vancouver.
For those who like outdoors, there's always a way to walk on Sea to Sky.
As a result of the 2010 Winter Olympics, the price of Whistler (1.5 hours from Vancouver) was high but well known.
In winter, enjoy some of the best skiing grounds in North America; in summer, try some real mountain bicycles.
You must have a permit to spend the night in Selina.
La Leona, San Pedro and Los Patos provide only camping and no catering services.
You can get permission to enter the park directly from Puerto Jiménez, but you can't use a credit card.
The Parks Authority only issues park permits within one month of the expected date of the visit.
CafeNet El Sol offers appointment services at a fee of $30, compared to $10 per day; for more information, please see its Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands is an island country, a free association area of New Zealand and situated in Polynesia in the central South Pacific.
It is an archipelago of 15 islands spread over 2.2 million square kilometres of the sea.
Since they are in the same time zone as Hawaii, these islands are sometimes considered to be “Wiana in the South”.
Although small in size, it reminded some of the older tourists of Hawaii before the state, when there were not so many large tourist hotels and other development projects.
The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In today ' s developed countries, the provision of luxury accommodation has risen to a form of art.
In high-end markets, it is clear that a group of B&B companies compete mainly in two areas: bedmaking and breakfast.
In such an excellent place, people often find the most luxurious bedding, perhaps a hand-made blanket or an old bed.
Breakfast may include local foods or specials provided by the owner.
The scene could be an ancient and historic building with ancient and palatable furniture, a well-cut floor and a swimming pool.
There is in itself a simple, pure appeal to get into your car and start a long road trip.
Unlike large cars, you may already be familiar with driving your own car and know its limitations.
Tentage on private property or in small towns of any size can easily attract unnecessary attention.
In short, driving is a great way of travelling, but it is not in itself a good fit for “camping”.
If you have a bigger minivan, a sports van, a sedan or a travel car, and the seat is flat, then you can go to a car camp.
The origins of some hotels can be traced back to the golden age of steam trains and ocean ships: before the Second World War, in the 19th or early 20th centuries.
These hotels were the home of the rich and famous at the time, and usually had high-end restaurants and night places.
Traditional equipment, lack of up-to-date facilities and age-sensitive elegance are also features.
While they are usually privately owned, they also sometimes provide accommodation for visiting Heads of State and other dignitaries.
A long-term passenger may consider travelling around the world by air and continue to live in many such hotels during the journey.
The Food and Accommodation Exchange Network is an organization that connects passengers with local residents in the cities of their destination.
Joining such an organization usually requires only one online form; although some organizations provide or request additional validation.
A paper-based and/or online version of the list will then be made available, listing the landlords with available accommodation and sometimes identifying references and evaluation information for other passengers.
Sofa surfing was founded in January 2004. Until then, computer programmer Casey Fenton had found cheap flights to Iceland but had no residence.
After sending an e-mail to local university students, he arrived with an invitation to provide free accommodation.
Hostels provide services primarily to young people, who are typically their clients at the age of 20, but where you can often meet relatively old people.
Although very few families with children, some hostels allow them to live in single rooms.
Beijing, China, will be the host city of the 2022 Winter Olympics, and this will be the first city to hold both summer and winter Olympics.
The opening, closing and indoor skates competition will be held in Beijing.
Other skiing events will take place at the Prince Zhang's Ski Field, some 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most temples have annual festivals, which vary from the end of November to the end of mid-May.
Most temple festivals are held to celebrate the anniversary of the temples and to host such temple events as the God's birthday.
The festival of temples in Kerala is extremely interesting, usually with decorative elephant marches, temple orchestras and other celebrations.
The World Exposition (commonly known as the Universal Exposition, World Expo) is an international show of art and science.
The participating countries organize exhibitions of art and education in national galleries to showcase world problems or the culture and history of the country.
The World Horticultural Fair is a display of flowers, botanical gardens and everything related to plants.
While the theory is that the Expo can be held annually (as long as it is held in different countries), this is not the case in practice.
The duration of these projects usually ranges from three to six months and takes place in sites of no less than 50 hectares.
Over the years, people have used a lot of different film formats. Standard 35mm film (36x24mm negative) is the most common.
When film is used, it can usually be easily refilled with a resolution that is roughly identical to the current digital monocameral camera.
Some medium-painted film cameras use 6x6cm and, more accurately, 56x56mm negatives.
As a result, the resolution is almost four times as high as the 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 versus 864).
For photographers, wildlife is one of the hardest to shoot. Good luck, patience, experience, perfect equipment.
Many people are accustomed to wildlife photography, but like ordinary photography, one photo is more than a thousand words.
It is common for wildlife to be shot with long lenses, but other shots are needed for objects such as birds or microorganisms.
Many rare animals are hard to find and there are sometimes regulations for commercial photography in parks.
Wild animals are either afraid of people or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or bad.
There are more than 5,000 different languages in the world, 20 of which have more than 50 million users.
Moreover, the written text is often easier to understand than the oral text. This is particularly true when describing an address, as it is often difficult to pronounce a pronunciation.
In many countries/regions, English is spoken fluently throughout the country, while in more countries/regions English is known slightly, especially among young people.
Imagine, if you wish, a Manchester, a Boston, a Jamaican and a Sydney man sitting around a restaurant in Toronto for dinner.
They tell the story of their homeland in their own unique accents and local native languages and make each other happy.
Buying food at supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to fill a stomach.
There is a growing variety of finished foods in supermarkets. Some even provide microwaves or other methods for heating foods.
In some countries or in some types of shops, the cost of at least one restaurant (usually informal) is fairly favourable.
Copy details of your insurance policy and insurance company contact details and carry them with you.
In order to obtain advice, authorization and compensation, they were required to present the insurance company ' s mailbox address and international telephone numbers.
A copy is kept in the luggage and a copy is stored online (by e-mail attachments to yourself, or stored in the “cloud end”).
When travelling with a laptop or tablet, a copy is stored in memory or diskette (accessible without the need for a web).
At the same time, copies of insurance contracts/contacts are given to travelers and relatives and friends who are willing to help.
Moose (also known as moose) are not inherently offensive, but they also defend themselves if they feel threatened.
Some do not regard moose as a potential danger and may be too close to put themselves at risk.
Drink alcohol properly. Alcohol affects everyone differently. It's important to know the limits of your drinking.
Overdoses can lead to long-term health problems, such as liver damage, and even blindness and death.
Illicit alcohol may contain dangerous impurities, including methanol, even at small doses leading to blindness or death.
Glasses may be cheaper abroad, especially in low-income countries, where labour costs are lower.
Consideration could be given to making eye examinations in the home country (in particular where health insurance is reimbursable), and the prescription could then be taken to another place for the goggles.
There may be two problems with the high-end brand racks purchased in these areas: some may be fake, and the real import racks may be more expensive than domestic purchases.
Coffee is one of the most traded commodities in the world, and it is likely that you will be able to buy a wide variety of coffees in your home country.
Nevertheless, there are many unique ways of drinking coffee in the world, all of which deserve to be experienced.
The stream falls into the bottom of the canyon, which can be dried up or have very deep water.
The streamfall combines elements of swimming, climbing and jumping - but requires relatively little training and physical infrastructure to enter (as compared to rock climbing, water lung diving, high mountain skiing, etc.).
A hike is an outdoor activity that walks in the natural environment (usually on a hikewalk).
One-day hiking is a journey that is completed within a day and can be at least one mile lower.
It is almost impossible to be prepared to travel a day by way of a flat path, and anyone can enjoy the pleasure of hiking as long as his body is not bad.
Families with children may need to be more prepared, but even with infants and pre-school children, it is not difficult to stay outside for a day.
There are nearly 200 running tourism organizations worldwide, most of which operate independently.
Go Running Tours, a successor to Global Running Tours, connects dozens of tour operators on four continents.
Founded in Barcelona, the Running Tours Barcelona and the Running Copenhagen in Copenhagen, shortly after Prague, the Running Tours Prague.
You have to take many aspects into account before you leave and during the journey.
When you travel, do not expect everything to be like “home” – rituals, laws, diets, transportation, accommodation, standards, language, etc. will be different from where you live.
This is something you need to always remember so as to avoid disappointment or even disgust at local practices.
Travel agencies have existed since the nineteenth century. Travel agencies are generally a good option if, during a journey, travellers are not familiar with the nature, culture and language of their destination, or they plan to travel to low-income countries.
While most travel agencies are willing to accept most of the routine appointments, there are many travel agencies that specialize in travel operations of a particular type, budget scope or destination.
Better find an agent who's always booked like your trip.
See what tourism products are promoted by travel agencies and can be found on the website or in shop windows.
If you want the least money to see the world, there are some ways to help you do it, whether it is necessary to change lifestyles or to challenge yourself.
Basically, they can be divided into two categories: either working on the side of travel or minimizing expenses. The article focuses on the latter.
For tourists who are willing to sacrifice comfort and time, prefer a trip full of surprises and reduce their costs to close to zero, see Minimum Budget Travel Strategy.
The assumption assumes that travellers will not steal, trespass, participate in the illegal market, beg or exploit others for their own benefit.
The entry checkpoint is usually the first stop through which an aircraft, ship or other means of transport are taken.
Some cross-border train checks are carried out on the vehicle; when boarding the cross-border train, valid identification documents should be carried.
In night-bed trains, in order not to affect the sleep of passengers, the captain may receive passports in advance.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you must register your presence and address with the local government.
This may require a visit to the local police station to fill out the form or to the immigration office.
In many countries where such laws exist, local hotels can be registered (it is important to be clear).
In other cases, only persons living outside tourist accommodation need to be registered.
Architecture is a discipline in architectural design and construction. A local building is often a tourist destination itself.
Many buildings have a beautiful look, whether from a high-rise or from a delicate window.
There is considerable overlap in the areas of architecture and urban planning, civil engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.
Given the very remote nature of many Pwebros, you have to travel to Albuquerque or Santa Fe to enjoy a rich night life.
However, almost all of the casinos listed above supply beverages, some of which also provide well-known recreational activities (mainly large casinos in the immediate vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Note: For tourists from other states, the town bar here is not always a good place to wander.
First, there are serious drinking and driving problems in northern New Mexico, and a high proportion of drivers drive around small town bars.
Unauthorised murals or sketches are called graffiti.
Although this is by no means a modern phenomenon, most people are likely to link it to the use of paint sprays by young people to destroy public and private property.
However, there are now mature graffiti artists, graffiti activities, and “legal” graffiti walls. Paintings of graffiti in this context are often more similar to art than identifying labels.
The throwing of darts is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn to throw an echo dart so that it can fly back into your hands, you must use a suitable dart that can fly back.
In fact, most of the darts in the Australian market don't fly back. It's better not for the beginners to try to throw the darts in the wind.
Hangi refers to kerosene.
The pits are heated by stones burned by fire and, in some cases, by geothermal heating of the ground.
Rock and fire pots are often used to cook traditional barbecues.
Rotorwa has several locations where geothermal kilns (hangi) are provided, while other practices of Maori kilns can also be tasted in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail carriages in and around Cape Town have two levels: MetroPlus (also known as first class) and Metro (also known as third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded, but it's a little more expensive, even if it's cheaper than normal subway tickets in Europe.
Every train has MetroPlus and Metro cars; the former are always at the end of the train near Cape Town.
Carrying things for others — never let your luggage out of your sight, especially when entering or leaving the country.
You might find yourself being exploited and an unwitting drug dealer, which would put you in a lot of trouble.
This includes waiting in queues, as drug dogs may be used at any time without prior notice.
Some countries/regions may even impose extremely severe penalties on first-time offenders; the penalties may include imprisonment for more than 10 years or the death penalty.
Unattended bags are not only targeted by thieves, but are also used as bomb threats that draw the attention and attention of the authorities.
At home, because of frequent exposure to local germs, you are extremely susceptible to immunisation.
But in other parts of the world that have never experienced bacteria, you are much more likely to experience problems.
Moreover, in a warm climate, bacteria can both reproduce quickly and survive longer in vitro.
As a result, scourges such as “Delhi diarrhoea”, “Pharaoh's curse” and “Montezumar's revenge” emerged.
Just as cold climates are prone to respiratory problems, hot climates are also extremely prone to intestinal problems. In most cases, intestinal problems can cause significant discomfort, but they are not very dangerous.
If you travel for the first time to a developing country or to a strange place, do not underestimate the potential cultural impact.
Many stable and capable travellers have been deterred by new problems of travel in developing countries, where there is a need to adapt quickly to the many subtle cultural differences that follow.
Especially in the early days, you can consider spending more money on Western-style and high-quality hotels, food and services to help you adapt to the environment.
Do not sleep on mattresses or mats on the ground in areas where there is no knowledge of the local fauna.
If you are going to camp, please bring camping beds or hammocks to avoid hazards such as snakes and scorpions.
At home in the early mornings, they enjoy strong coffee, and at night they make relaxing chamomile tea.
The family is on vacation and has more time at hand to spend a little more time in order to get a special drink for themselves.
If you want to update something strange, you can use this opportunity to squeeze some juice or make a mix of milk shakes:
Maybe you'll find a simple drink that you can make at breakfast when you return to normal daily life.
If you live in cities with a variety of drinking cultures, go to bars or taverns in neighbourhoods you don't usually go to.
For those who are not familiar with medical terminology, the terms “infective” and “tactile” have very different meanings.
Infectious diseases are diseases caused by pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and other parasitic organisms.
Infectious diseases are a category of diseases that are highly contagious in the vicinity of the infected person.
Many Governments require in-country visitors or departing residents to be vaccinated against a range of diseases.
These requirements usually depend on the country to which the traveller has visited or intends to visit.
One of the advantages of Charlotte, North Carolina, is that it provides families with many high-quality options.
Households from other regions often praise family friendship as the main reason for their migration, and tourists find it very pleasant to visit the city with their children.
Over the past 20 years, child-friendly facilities in Upper Charlotte have grown exponentially.
Families living in Charlotte do not use taxis except in exceptional circumstances.
Over 2 passengers are subject to additional fees, so this option may be more expensive and unnecessary.
Antarctica, surrounded by Antarctica, is the coldest place on Earth.
Travel costs and physical requirements are high and can only be made in the summer of November to February of the following year, with tours limited mainly to the Peninsula, the Islands and the Ross Sea.
During the summer, more than 40 bases here will host thousands of staff, most of whom are based in the area; a small number of people remain in the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a barren highland covered by 2 to 3 kilometers of ice.
Occasionally, dedicated air travel missions travel inland, participate in mountain climbing or travel to large bases in the South Arctic.
The South Pole Trade (or highway) of the Antarctic began at the McMurdo Station in the Rose Sea with a direct link to the Antarctic site, which is 1600 kilometres long.
The snow is compacted and the cracks are filled and marked with flags. Only special tractors and sleighs equipped with fuel and supplies can pass.
The car was not very flexible, so it had to travel across the Antarctic mountains to reach the plateau with a long, large bend.
The most common causes of accidents in winter are the wetness of roads and surfaces (walks), especially steps.
At least you need the right shoes on the soles of your shoes. Summer shoes are usually slippery on ice, and even some winter boots aren't enough.
Shoe tattoos should be sufficiently deep and 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more; materials should be sufficiently soft at low temperatures.
Some boots have shoe nails; there are also extended equipment designed for wet slide surfaces with shoe nails, which are suitable for most shoes and boots, which can be kept up in their shoes or on the soles of their heels and shoes at the same time.
The heels should be low and wide. The roads often throw sand, sand, or salt particles (calcium chloride) to increase friction.
Avalanche is not an anomaly; the amount of snow available on steep slopes is limited and the excess snow falls in the form of an avalanche.
The problem is that the snow is highly sticky. Some triggers are needed for snow to fall, and a little snow falls may also trigger other snowfalls.
Sometimes the initial trigger is the warming of the snow by the sun, sometimes by more snowfall and sometimes by other natural events, but more frequently by human factors.
The tornado is an extremely low-pressure rotor that inhales the surrounding air inward and upward.
A tornado produces strong winds (often 100-200 miles per hour) that can throw heavy objects into the air and hold them forward.
At the outset, the funnel clouds stretched down from the thunderstorm clouds, turning into “ tornadoes” when they came into contact with the ground.
The personal VPN (virtual private network) program is an excellent tool to circumvent political censorship and commercial IP geographic filtering.
They are superior to web agents for the following reasons: they reroute all Internet traffic, not just the text transfer protocol (http) content.
They usually provide higher bandwidth and higher quality services. They are encrypted and more difficult to monitor.
Media companies have routinely lied to conceal their purpose, claiming that it was to “prevent piracy”.
In fact, the area code has nothing to do with illegal reproduction; a copy of a desk-by-desk disk can be played smoothly on any device that can play the original disk.
The aim is in fact to give these companies better control over their markets; everything is for money.
Because calls are made via the Internet, you do not have to use a call company located in your place of residence or travel.
Whether to obtain a local number in the community in which you live is not required; you can get a satellite Internet connection in the field of Alaska King and then choose a number that shows you are located in the sunny state of Arizona.
In many cases, you have to buy a single number that you can use globally in order to listen to calls from the PSTN. The source of the number has a strong influence on the main caller.
Real-time text translation application: an application that automatically converts the entire text from one language to another.
Some of these applications even allow users to use smartphones against symbols or other objects in the real world to translate foreign language words on them.
Significant improvements have been made in the translation engines, which now often provide more or less correct translations (and, more often, little nonsense), but it is important to note that they may still be completely mistaken.
One of the most outstanding applications is Google Translation. After downloading the required language data, it can be translated offline.
When travelling abroad, navigation applications using smartphone GPS may be the easiest and convenient way of navigation.
It would be cheaper to buy enough maps or stand-alone GPS equipment to carry GPS, or to rent one from a car rental company.
If your cell phone has no data connection or is out of service, the performance of the cell phone may be limited or the cell phone cannot be used.
Each street shop has a row of fancy prepaid telephone cards, which can be used either for public pay-as-you-go telephones or for ordinary telephones.
Although most of the cards are suitable for calling anywhere, some of them are particularly favourable when dialing calls from specific countries.
These services are usually available by calling a telephone number, and most telephone calls are free of charge.
The rules governing routine photography also apply to video recordings and may even be more applicable.
If you can't even take a picture, you don't have to take a video.
If drones are used, please carefully confirm in advance what can be filmed and what permits or additional plates are required.
It is a bad idea to operate drones in the vicinity of the airport or in crowded areas, even if this is not illegal in your area.
Few people now book tickets directly through airlines without first searching and comparing prices.
In some cases, the prices of the same flight may vary considerably from one information-gathering site to another, and it would be useful to compare the results of the search prior to booking and to look at the airline ' s own website.
Although visas are not required for travel or business on short-term visits to certain countries, students who stay there usually spend longer periods than leisure tourists.
Often, a longer stay in a foreign country requires an advance visa.
Students ' visas are usually subject to different requirements and application procedures compared to ordinary tourist or business visas.
In most countries, you need a letter of admission to the school you wish to attend, as well as a document proving that you have the funds needed for at least the first year of the course.
The consultation school and the immigration authorities of the country in which you wish to study are informed of the detailed requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, it is generally necessary to pay income tax to the country/area in which you are working overseas.
The structure of income tax varies from country to country, and there are significant differences in tax rates and tariff scales.
Some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, impose federal and local income taxes, so that rates and ratings may vary from region to region.
When returning to the country, there is usually no need to carry out an entry check or merely a formality, but passing through customs can be cumbersome.
(c) Ensure that they know what they can carry, what they cannot carry, and declare any items that go beyond what is permitted by law.
The simplest way to start travel writing is to sharpen your skills on a senior travel blog site.
You can create your own website when you're familiar with online layout and editing.
Volunteering in travel is a different approach, but it is not simply a matter of giving.
Living abroad and being a volunteer are good ways to understand different cultures, to get new friends, to know oneself, to exercise the right judgement, and even to acquire new skills.
This is also a good way to save the budget and to spend more time somewhere, as many volunteers work to provide food and accommodation and some work with a small salary.
The Vikings use Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Some of these routes are still accessible.
The Bering Strait is connected to the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea via Lake Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, most of which are connected to rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga, so it may be possible to reach it from the Caspian Sea via Russia.
Don't worry, when you get to the dock, everything will be fine. You'll meet someone else who wants to take a ride, and they'll share information with you.
Basically, you can post a sign that you can help, walk back and forth at the docks, contact people who are cleaning yachts or sailors in bars, etc.
Try talking to as many people as possible. In a while, everyone will know you, and they'll tell you which boat you're looking for.
You have to be careful in choosing the "Flyer" airline in the Alliance.
While it may be natural for you to think that it is natural for you to be a member of any airline with the highest number of flights, you should know that airlines often offer different interests and that other airlines under the same alliance may give more regular passenger credits.
Divisions such as Emirates Airlines, Attihad Airlines, Qatar Airlines and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their services to Africa, providing routes to many major cities in Africa at prices that are more competitive than those of other European airlines.
Since 2014, Turkish Airlines has been able to reach 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have more than enough travel time, please see the total fare to Africa compared to the worldwide fare.
For all regions outside Africa, it is important not to forget to add additional visa fees, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc.
If you only want to fly around the world in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flight and destination is very limited, as there are few trans-ocean routes.
There is no single air union route in the southern hemisphere that can cross all three oceans (the TAC does not even have a trans-ocean route).
However, the Federation covers all routes around the globe, with the exception of the South-East Pacific route from Santiago, Chile, to Tahiti, a South American Airlines (LATAM) airline.
If you don't want to go through the South Pacific and the West Coast of South America, there's another alternative to this flight. (See below.)
In 1994, the Armenian-Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan launched a war against Azerbaijanis.
A new republic was born with the support of Armenia. However, it was not officially recognized by any country, including Armenia.
Diplomatic disputes in the region continue to lead to the deterioration of relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The canal area (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is a well-known old 17-century town around Binnstad, Amsterdam.
Because of its unique cultural and historical values, the entire region is classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and the region has one of the highest property values in the country.
Cinque Terre, originally meant as five plots of land, consisting of five small coastal villages, Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Mon, located in the Liguria area of Italy
They are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
For centuries, ladder fields have been carefully constructed on the rugged terrain, and these slopes have extended to cliff cliffs overlooking the sea.
Part of its charm is that there is no obvious business development. Villages are connected by roads, trains and boats, and they cannot drive from the outside to these villages.
The French languages used in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from French in France, although very similar and interoperable.
In particular, the French language spoken in Belgium and Switzerland has some minor peculiarities in the digital system, unlike French, and the pronunciation of some words is slightly different.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss are taught standard French in schools, so even if you use the standard French measurement system, they can understand it.
In many parts of the world, waving is a friendly expression, meaning “Hello”.
However, in Malaysia, at least among the Malays in rural areas, this gesture is similar to that of “come here” in some Western countries, when they move towards their bodies with an index finger, and is used only to indicate that.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs have feathers — a theory that has been widely circulated — but also provides details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as colours and three-dimensional sequences.
Scientists indicate that the feathers of this animal have chestnuts at the top and light or carrots at the bottom.
This finding also contributed to a better understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
The feathers of the dinosaurs do not have a well-developed backbone — which is called “feat axes”, but there are other features of the feathers, such as plums and plums, which researchers assume may have evolved later than these others.
The feather structure shows that they are not used to fly, but to regulate temperature or display. Researchers argue that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature feathers, not the feathers of a cub.
According to researchers, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers rather than the feathers of a young dragon.

A bomb exploded outside the Governor ' s office.
Within two hours, three more bombs exploded in the vicinity of the Government building.
According to some reports, the number of officially declared deaths was 8, while according to official reports, as many as 30 people were injured; however, the final figure has not yet been determined.
Cyanic acid and melamine were found in urine samples of pets who died after eating contaminated pet food.
Researchers at the University indicated that crystals formed by the interaction of the two compounds could cause renal dysfunction.
Researchers observed crystallization in cat urine following the addition of melamine and cyanide.
A comparison from the infrared spectrum (FTIR) shows that the composition of these crystals matches the crystal composition found in the urine of the affected pets.
I don't know if you realize that most of the goods imported from Central America into the country are duty-free.
However, 80 per cent of our commodities are subject to customs duties in Central American countries ... we treat you.
I find this unjustified; it is clearly unfair.
I say to people, "What do we do to you, you do to us."
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California signed a bill prohibiting the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The Act provides that violent video games sold in California must be labelled “18” and that a seller is fined US$ 1,000 for every illegal sale to a minor.
The Attorney-General and Queen's Counsel, Kier Starmer, issued a statement this morning announcing the indictment against Huna and Price.
Huna has resigned, and his position in the cabinet will be replaced by Congressman Ed Davey. Congressman Norman Lamb is expected to replace David as Minister of Commerce.
Huna and Price will appear before the Westminster Magistrates Court on February 16.
The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old.
Edgar Veguilla was injured in the arm and chin, while Christopher Schneider needed facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon failed when pointing at the head of the fifth person. Schneider was in pain, one eye was blind, one skull was missing, and the titanium was used to reconstruct his face.
Schneider testified via video link at the United States Air Force (USAF) base in his home country.
In addition to the Wednesday competition, Carpanedo participated in two individual competitions in the tournament.
Her first project was an obstacle to skiing and ended the first round with an "unfinished" result. Thirty-six of the 116 participants in the competition had the same result.
Her other game was a big turn, with a total score of 4:41.30 minutes in the women's stand group, 10 minutes slower than the top Austrian player, Claudia Rosch, 2:11.60 minutes later than the ninth Hungarian player, Jackie.
Four skiers from the women's sitting group failed to finish the race, and 45 of the 117 candidates from the Giant Slalom were not on the list.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptops and cell phones.
According to D. K. Arya, Deputy Chief Inspector General, “we arrested five of the perpetrators of the rape of the Swiss woman and found her cell phone and laptop”.
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The Chief of Police, Chandra Shekal Soranki, said that the accused had been blindfolded in his appearance before the court.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver was severely hit in the head.
In the event of an accident, the road was temporarily closed and the emergency rescue crew rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was taken to the James Pageet hospital in Grand Yamouth for medical treatment.
He was then transferred to Adenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Subsequently, Adekya was charged with the murder of her son and tried before the Edinburgh Magistrate ' s Court.
She was detained pending prosecution and trial; however, any witness evidence could be negatively affected, as her image had been widely publicized.
This is common elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the judicial system in Scotland is different, and the court considered that the publication of photographs could cause potential harm.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee pointed out that “journalists do appear to be dangerous if they publish information such as photographs of suspects”.
The Crown Prosecution Service, the main authority responsible for the prosecution, indicated to journalists that further statements would not be made at least before the prosecution.
It was revealed that the document would refer to the border dispute and that Palestine wished to build on the pre-1967 borders in the Middle East.
Other topics discussed were reported to include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel calls for the deployment of a military force in the valley for 10 years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian National Authority has agreed to retain it for only five years.
The rangers closely monitor the shooters involved in the supplemental tests for pest control, as the tests are monitored and their effects assessed.

Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in by the 9-member new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth time in four years that Martelli has been elected to the Haitian Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Commission was a response from Martelly to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, these protests have been triggered by the failure of some elections to take place as scheduled, sometimes escalating into violence.
Some 60 iPod malfunctions and overheating were reported, resulting in a total of 6 fires and 4 minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) indicated that they had noticed 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) announced that Apple had informed the sector of an additional 34 accidents caused by overheating, although it had stated that they were “not serious”.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry responded that the delay in issuing the report was “very regrettable”.
The Marianas were hit by an earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. Greenwich Time).
According to the Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office, no disaster losses were reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (Also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center) indicated that no signs of tsunami had been detected.
A former police officer from the Philippines seized a tourist bus from the capital, Manila, and took Hong Kong tourists in the car hostage.
Rolando Mendoza mounted his M16 rifle and strafed the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have now been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, and those Filipino photographers were released early.
The two photographers then replaced an old woman who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was killed.
Liggins followed his father's footsteps and started a doctor's career.
He has been trained as an obstetrician and has worked at the National Women ' s Hospital in Auckland since 1959.
Liggins started studying premature births in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His research shows that the use of hormones accelerates the maturity of the baby ' s lungs.
Xinhua reported that Government investigators discovered two “black box” flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Chase said, "Luna was the first Queen, my first manager. Luna died on a bimonthly night. It was as special as she was. She was a strong woman."
Dustin Runnels commented: “Luna is as elusive as I am and she may be more difficult to understand I love her and I want her to go to a better place.”
A survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted prior to the 2010 federal elections, and the number of respondents opposing Australia as a republic has increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gilad stated that she believed that Australia should be a republic after Queen Elizabeth II had resigned.
Thirty-four per cent of the respondents unanimously expressed the hope that Queen Elizabeth II would become Australia ' s last monarch.
There was a polarization in the vote, with 29 per cent of respondents arguing that Australia should have a republic as soon as possible and 31 per cent that Australia should never have a republic.
The Olympic gold medal winner should have participated in the three relays of the 100 m and 200 m free swim and the Commonwealth Games, but his state of health has been questioned as a result of his complaints.
He has been unable to use medication to relieve pain, as the contestants are prohibited from taking these drugs.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the Central University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known numbers to date on 25 January.
In early February, several people validated the discovery using different hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water and organic matter on Earth that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists want to know how planets have been formed since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago, and in particular how the planet has been formed.
The current year, 53-year-old Cuomo, had been Governor since the beginning of the year and had signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriages last month.
He referred to the rumours as “political fragmentation and folly”.
It is assumed that he will run for the presidency in 2016.
According to the United States Federal Aviation Office (FAA), a new generation of air transport systems (NextGen) can reduce aircraft flight routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology rather than old ground radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and to provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transportation was provided, and the train on the ground was stopped at Wembley, and there were no parking lots or parking-for-flight facilities on the ground.
Fear of lack of transportation may force the competition to take place behind closed doors without team supporters.
On Thursday, a study published in Science magazine reported that a new bird was formed in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved for only two generations, although it was thought that the process would take longer, as a result of the breeding between the gallows of the local Darwin sparrows and the outside cactus peacocks.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be curled into small shapes.
It can be tangled and tangled. It can also be stunned or crushed.
It can be very thin, glued to other metals and, by reaching such thinness, can sometimes be used to decorate hand drawings in books known as “colored handcriptures”.
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can use the red glycerine to make the indicator.
The colour of cabbage juice will vary according to the acidity of the chemical substance.
The pH value is expressed in the number of hydrogen (H) ions in the measured chemical.
The hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost the electron (because the hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron).
Mobilize the two dry powders and mix them up into a ball with clean wet hands.
The water in your hand reacts to the outer layer, which creates a shell-like layer, which is very interesting.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro have flush toilets in almost every household, which are linked to a sophisticated sewage treatment system.
Sites of sewage systems were found in houses on the Greek island of Crete and in the city of Santorinimenos.
There are toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets are sometimes part of mixed public bathrooms.
You call people thousands of miles away, you use satellites.
Satellites in space received telephone calls and almost immediately reflected them back.
Satellites are launched from rockets into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts certain light and vision.
To send a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheels have changed the world in an incredible way. The wheels have contributed most to us by making our traffic easier.
With it, we have trains, cars and many other means of transport.
Below them are more mid-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Ultimately, there are many small cats (including stray cats) that feed on much larger quantities of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of profit, with each cat taking on a special job to prevent them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the cats with the most visible consummation and live in large groups known as lions.
The lions consist of one to three adult males with only kinship, as well as up to 30 females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters in the extended family, females are usually close to each other.
The behaviour of the lions is very similar to that of wolves or dogs. These animals behave in an alarmingly similar manner to that of the lions (but unlike other large cats), and they are also very lethal to their prey.
A tiger is an all-powerful athlete who climbs (though not very strong), swims, jumps, pulls up to five times the strength of a human Hercules.
Tigers are of the same type as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four big cats are the only cats that can scream.
Tigers do not growl as deep as lions, but more like an angry scream.
Leopard cats like to eat small animals. If conditions permit, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Panther cats have much smaller prey than themselves.
Scientists believe that leopard cats track and search for predators by smelling and sniffing their prey on the ground.
Their night vision is strong, they can see clearly in the dark, and their actions are hidden. The way they hunt is when they fit into the surroundings and then jump into the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) are separated from their primary stocks (e.g. they cross mountains and rivers, or they reach a new island so easily that it is not possible to return), they usually find themselves in a different environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new stocks will need different characteristics or adaptive capacity to become a strong competitor rather than what they needed before.
The original stocks have not changed at all, and they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
Over time, new stocks have begun to adapt to new environments and have become less and less similar to other stocks.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two stocks will ultimately appear to be so different that they cannot be described as the same species.
We call this process “species formation”, which is the formation of new species. The formation of species is an inevitable consequence of evolution and an extremely important link in evolution.
Plants can produce oxygen inhaled by humans and absorb carbon dioxide from humans.
Plants get nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make houses with plants, we make clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals can't survive.
The dragon was the top predator of that time, and there was nothing to fear except the same.
Its long jaws are covered with more than 70 razor-shaped teeth, and there's a row on it. That means there's no way out of anything that meets it.
Its tongue may be fork in, and we're not sure about it. Its food includes turtles, large fish, other dragons, even humans.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus are not its rivals.
Although most of the food of the Romans is common to us, they do have some strange or unusual dinner dishes, including boars, peacocks, snails and a rodent called a sleeping mouse.
Another difference is that the poor and women sit on chairs for dinner, while the rich like to come together for dinner and eat side by side.
Food coming into Europe from America or Asia several centuries later is unlikely to appear in the ancient Roman diet.
For example, they had no maize, tomatoes, potatoes and cocoa, nor had any ancient Romans ever eaten turkey.
The people of Babylon built for each of them a master's house as their dwelling place.
Sacrifice will be given to God, and priests will meet God's needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner house accessible only to priests.
Some of the special towers are in the shape of pyramids, known as pyramids, built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is God's special holy place.
Houses are not so important in a warm climate in the Middle East.
The Hebrew family spends most of its life outdoors.
Women cook in the yard; the store is an open counter to the streets. They build houses with stones.
There are no large forests in Canaan, so timber is very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely smoked. According to the Nordic epic Sharjah, the Redbeard Eric was expelled from Iceland for murder, and he sailed west and found the land and named it Greenland.
But whatever he did not find, the Eskimo were already living there.
Although all belong to Scandinavia, there are many differences between the population, kings, customs and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the film National Treasure, you might think the Declaration of Independence will have a treasure map on its back.
But that is not the case. Although there is something written on the back of this document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words “Orginal Declaration of Independence formulated 4th July 1776 (original Declaration of Independence, 4 July 1776)” are written in the document.
Although no one can determine who the author is, this large parchment document (size 293⁄4 inches multiplied by 241⁄2 inches) is said to have been rolled up and stored at the time of writing.
Therefore, it is likely that the symbol has only been added as a label.
The Normandy landing and the ensuing fighting liberated the north of France, but the south has still not been liberated.
It was ruled by the French “Visque” who had reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940, not against the aggressors, but in cooperation with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies entered the south of France and this attack was known as Operation Dragon Cavalry.
In just two weeks, the United States and the Free France forces liberated the south of France and turned to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by the people (society) who live together and work cooperatively.
The term “civilization” is derived from Latin “civilis” (meaning “citizen”), which is related to Latin “civis” (meaning “citizen”) and “civitas” (meaning “city” or “city State”), and which in some way defines the size of society.
Townships are the forebears of the nation. Cultures of civilization mean the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the preservation of cultural footprints, and the fair dissemination of culture.
Minority cultures often disappear without pertinent historical evidence and are not treated as decent civilizations.
During the war of independence, thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Federal Regulations (the National Assembly is its only component).
Congress does not have the power to tax, and because there is no executive or judicial branch of the State, it relies on state governments to enforce all bills, which often fail to cooperate.
Nor does it have the power to overturn tax laws and customs duties between states.
These provisions can only be amended with the unanimous consent of all states, which are so slow in their approach to the central government that their state representatives are often absent.
The Italian National Football Team and the German National Football Team were the second most successful teams in the world, winning the World Cup championship in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, waterball, swords, rugby, bicycles, hockey, roll hockey and formula one.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, where Italians participate in international and Olympic competitions.
The fact that Japan has nearly 7000 islands (the largest is the island of Japan) makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's large island population, Japan is often referred to as the “Island” from a geological point of view.
Western knowledge of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century. The passing European sailor named the island Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful islands.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Corporation established a base in south-west Taiwan and began to change the way indigenous people produce food and hired Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, the Great Qing Empire announced the construction of a Taiwan province.
In 1895, following the defeat of the Midday War (1894-1895), the Qing Government signed the Maquang Treaty, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The ancient city of Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the temple of the Sun and the three-window house.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed in order to provide visitors with a better understanding of the original features of the complex.
By 1976, 30 per cent of Machu Picchu had been repaired and the work continued until today.
For example, the most common static image-phototype format in the world is 35 mm format, which is the dominant film size at the end of the film age.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its width ratio is applied to the format of the digital camera image sensor.
The actual size of the 35 mm format is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is a somewhat confusing format.
Therefore, the width ratio of this format ( divided by the simplest integer ratio of 12) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format series) are the same or quite close to this width ratio.
The dichotomy, which is often abused and mocked, is a simple method of guidance in the creation of dynamics and allows the image to remain orderly.
It notes that the most effective position for the subject is the cross-point of the line that divides the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see examples).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church has been closely monitored.
Despite the diversity of languages and customs among European countries, Christianity has linked them together for more than a thousand years.
From the king to the civilians, its forces spread across the 10 corners affect everyone.
One of the main tenets of Christianity was that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, for which the Church's monetary funds had been created.
The concentration of power and money, which had existed in Rome for over a thousand years, had led many to question whether they had complied with that doctrine.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to impose a maritime blockade on Germany.
They cut off vital military and civilian supplies. This strategy has proved to be effective, despite the fact that the blockade has violated international law that has been universally accepted under several international agreements over the past two centuries.
British mines in international waters prevent any vessel from entering the entire sea and even pose a threat to the ships of neutral States.
Given the limited response to this strategy, Germany expects a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 20th and 20th centuries, the dominant attitude of most citizens was pacifist, separatist.
Having witnessed the atrocities of the First World War, all countries are eager to avoid repeating their mistakes.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job from Edison, New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had four cents on his body, a poem collection and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the manager of his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
The different periods of the ancient Chinese era have their own characteristics; every time in China or every family in power is a distinct dynasty.
By the same token, the period of change has been a time of instability in which small countries have been divided. The most famous of these has been the 60-year period of the three countries, which was between the Han Jin generation and the other generation.
During these turbulent times, war rages over the throne in the various halls of the land.
The three countries are one of the bloodiest times in China ' s ancient history. Thousands of people have died fighting for the supreme power of the Xianhua Palace.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of units of measurement, the transition from dictatorship to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the State is not the sole ruler but the people.
In addition, after the revolution, official positions were open to all men, giving the most aspiring and successful people a chance to fly.
The same is true for the military, whose rank is no longer based on rank but on merit.
The French Revolution also encouraged the oppressed working class in many other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was very interested in things other than life in the world. He used to go to the mountains of Noor to meditate in a cave called Sheila.
The cave itself has not only survived the test of time but has also created a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
The cave was located on a hilltop north of Macca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even knowing that it exists is not easy to find. Once you enter a cave, you are completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Nothing can be seen except the clear and beautiful sky and the mountains around it. In the caves, you can hardly see and hear the images and sounds of the outside world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only building of the seven wonders that still stands.
The Great Pyramid, the masterpiece of the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of the many large pyramids that paid tribute to the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau (the “Giza Pyramids”) of the Egyptian Valley of Death consists of several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small graves, several temples and large lion faces.
The Great Pyramid was built to honour the memory of Huff Pharaoh, and a number of smaller pyramids, graves and temples were built to honour the memory of Huff ' s wife and family members.
The " upper bow" symbol is the letter V, the "down bow" symbol is like a nail or missing a square at the bottom.
Upwards refer to pushing the bow from the top and downwards to pulling the bow from the roots (i.e. the place where the bow is held in hand).
The upper bow usually makes a softer voice, while the lower bow makes a stronger and stronger voice.
Make your own mark with pencils of your own free will, but remember, the notes that are printed are musical, so they should normally be respected.
On October 6th, 1789, frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antoinette and their two children (11-year-old Mary Teresa and 4-year-old Louis Charles) and the King's sister, Mrs Elizabeth, were killed.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, and a group surrounded them and threatened the King and the Queen by shouting.
The mob forced the King and the Queen to open the windows of the carriage completely.
In the presence of the frightened Queen, a thug once waved the head of a royal guard who was killed in the palace of Versailles.
The war expenses of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were borne by the people of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States colonial regime to pay most of their expenses, as well as interest on bonds issued through Wall Street Bank on behalf of the Government of the Philippines.
Of course, the high profits earned by the long-term exploitation of the people of the Philippines constitute the basic gain of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context in which the Order was established.
The time of the events was often referred to as the medieval peaks of European history, i.e. the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1,000-1300 A.D.).
The Middle Ages predates the early medieval era, followed by the late medieval era, where it has been agreed that the late medieval era ends around 1500 years or so.
The doctrine of technical decisions is a term that covers many ideas in practice, including technology pushers, technology imperatives, and a strict definition — human destiny is driven by the logic behind the laws of science and their performance in technology.
Most interpretations of technical determinism include two general ideas: first, that the development of technology itself goes far beyond cultural or political influences, and second, that technology in turn has an inherent “impact” on society that is not constrained by social conditions.
One might say, for example, that automobiles necessarily contribute to the development of roads.
However, the installation of a national road network for only a few vehicles is not economically feasible and new production methods should be developed in order to reduce the cost of car ownership.
High levels of mass motor vehicle ownership will also lead to higher rates of road traffic accidents, which will facilitate the development of new medical technologies for the repair of injuries.
Romanticism has a strong cultural determinism. It comes from writers like Goethe, Fihit and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time geo-related customs and cultures have emerged, which are much better integrated with the local harmony in which society finds itself than laws arbitrarily imposed.
Constantinople is considered a fashion capital of the European feudal era, just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury goods began around 400 years A.D. and continued until about 1100 A.D.
Its position declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the gifts brought by the Crusades upon their return, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine market.
It was at that time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style peaked in the 10th to 11th century to 14th century.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow cultural exchange, Western fashion may be 25 to 30 years behind.
As the Middle Ages moved to the end, the people of Western Europe evolved their style. One of the greatest advances at the time was that, after the Crusades, people began to tie their clothes with buttons.
Self-supporting agriculture is an agricultural activity for the production of food that only meets the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often organic system that maximizes yields by using local seeds stored in the ecoregion, combined with crop rotations or other relatively simple technologies.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agricultural production. This is still the case in many developing countries today.
The subculture unites like-minded individuals who feel that they are ignored by social standards and that subculture fosters a sense of identity among them.
Subcultures may be unique, given the age, race, class, location and/or gender differences of members.
The characteristics that make subculture distinct may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography or multiple factors.
Members of sub-cultural communities often make symbolic use of a unique style of conduct to indicate their membership, including fashion clothing, behaviour and bad words.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take advantage of the few cases of unfortunate children who, as a result of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, are not brought up to be socialized with the help of adults.
In some cases, children are abandoned because parents refuse to accept a child's severe mental or physical impairment.
Wild children may experience severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or leaving their homes.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some live alone in the wild.
If a wolf child is raised entirely by a non-human animal, his/her behaviour (to the extent that his/her physical condition permits) is very similar to that animal, for example, by displaying fear or indifference towards human beings.
While the project learning approach should make learning easier and more interesting, the back-to-back learning approach goes further.
Stand-by teaching is not a learning method, but a means of assisting those who are learning to use new computer programs or start new projects.
Stand-by teaching can be done online or under the line, in other words, a teacher is a form of stand-by teaching, like a echo needle helper in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in software to question, alert and explain processes that may be difficult for students to handle alone.
Children were placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an uneducated, unloved and uneducated environment, but against expectations.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable medical care.
The foster care system should provide for all the necessities that are lacking in the original family.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet add additional dimensions in terms of their use and means of satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “interconnection” are considered to be important motivations for the use of the Internet (James and others, 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “continuing relationships” were also cited as new motivation in the study of the audience's response to the website by Emmet and McDeer (1998).
The use of the video has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions (face movements lasting several milliseconds).
Specifically, it is said that it is possible to judge whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his paper, The President's Speech, that those who could not understand language because of brain damage were still able to judge accurately the sincerity of the person who spoke.
He even suggested that this ability to understand human behaviour might be shared by animals such as family dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variability: explicit and hidden.
The mutation adds new genetic mutations, and the selection removes the mutation from the expressed gene variant pool.
As a result of separation and reorganization, variations vary from generation to generation between two banks.
In the savannahs, primates have human-like digestive systems and existing plant resources are difficult to meet the amino acid demand of primates.
Moreover, failure to do so would have serious consequences: stunting growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources should be proteins in leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for primates like ours to digest such proteins unless they are cooked.
By contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the necessary amino acids.
In conclusion, we should not be surprised if our ancestors' approach to the “protein problem” is the same as that used by chimpanzees on today's savannahs.
Sleep interruption refers to the process of conscious awakening during normal sleep and sleeping after a short period (10-60 minutes).
It is easy to use relatively quiet alarm clocks to wake you up without being fully awakened.
If you find that you will reset the alarm clock while sleeping, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room and force yourself out of bed to close the alarm clock.
Other biological rules-based options include extensive pre-sleep drinking of liquids (especially water or tea — well known pro-urbation effects) and forcing oneself to pee.
The degree of calm within a person is contrary to the level of physical and mental tension.
The less stress, the more active life is. Everyone is likely to find absolute calm and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach an enlightened horizon, and the only obstacle to its realization is our own sense of tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha ' s teachings, but has been expanded through the universal love of Buddhism and many techniques of yoga in India.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Quindalini yoga, meditation and universal love.
In Quindalini yoga, Quindalini energy (inventive energy) is awakened through yoga positions, breathing exercises, speech and visual images.
The core activity of Tibet's meditation is Sky-Yuga. By projecting different gods, purging energy channels, activating the rims and thus reaching the threshold of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy of all countries during World War II, which facilitated cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, institutional, procedural and cultural conflicts divided the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies are now enemies and the cold war began.
The war lasted 40 years, when the proxy army fought real-life battles on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish line had been breached, and the only hope left was to withdraw and reconfigure the army along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were abandoned almost overnight and, following the invasion of the eastern part of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet Treaty of Non-Aggression between Poland and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered the country and established positions in Belarus and Ukraine.
To date, shipping has been the most effective means of transporting large numbers of people and cargo across the sea.
Traditionally, the task of the navy is to ensure that the State retains the capacity to transport persons and goods while interfering with the ability of the enemy to transport its personnel and goods.
One of the most noteworthy modern examples is the North Atlantic War during World War II. Americans try to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which is predominantly a U-boat, attempted to intercept the shipment.
If the Allied Powers had failed at that time, Germany could have conquered the United Kingdom just as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
The goats seem to have been domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them and consume and use their milk, meat, fur and skin.
The goats are usually grazed by herds on mountains or in other pastoral areas, usually under the care of goatherders (mostly children or adolescents), who are similar to the more widely known shepherds.
The United Kingdom built the driveway as early as the 16th century.
Although the Malala orbital vehicles were made up of parallel wooden plates, at that time, in terms of slightly bumpy roads, they allowed the pullers to run faster and more.
Long ago, a pillow was introduced for the stationing of the tracks. But there was a growing realization that the tracks would be more solid and effective if they were placed on the tracks.
This has become a common practice, but iron blades can add to the wear and tear of wooden cart wheels.
Eventually, the wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron track came to life.
The first mode of transport known is walking. Two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus, meaning straight people, human beings started walking straight.
Their ancestors, ancient southern apes, have no habit of walking straight.
Two-foot specializations were found in the South ' s ancient ape fossils of 4.2 million to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus of Chad could have gone with their legs 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly environment, join environmental movements, and even become environmental activists, to some extent reducing future disasters.
In many cases this is very similar to symptomatic therapy. But if we want more than just a temporary solution, then we should find the root causes of the problem and eradicate it completely.
It is clear that the world has changed considerably as a result of the scientific and technological progress of humankind, which is exacerbated by overpopulation and the luxury of human lifestyles.
The handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary-General Charles Thomson, was approved by the Continental Parliament on 4 July and subsequently sent to the John Dunlap printing house a few blocks away for printing.
150 to 200 copies were printed overnight, now known as Dunlap Broadside.
This document was read out publicly for the first time by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on 8 July.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July and was read to his army in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The remaining 25 copies of the single-sided version of the paper (Dunlap Broadsides) are the earliest available versions of the document. The manuscript could not be retained.
Many ancient biologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and have survived to this day, what we call “birds”.
Many people think they're not dinosaurs because they have feathers and they fly.
But birds still have a lot like dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs and walk with two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus.
Today, almost all of the computers in use are based on the processing of binary coded information.
Binary numbers can only account for one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, which is referred to as binary numbers, i.e. “bits” in computer terms.
In vitro poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are common and therefore cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The most powerful indicator of ingestion may be the container that was opened at the site, containing pharmaceutical or household toxic chemicals.
Check the labels on the poison and get a specific first aid guide.
Insect scientists use the word “bug” to officially refer to this category of insects.
This term stems from the familiarity with bugs, which are highly adapted to human parasites.
Both thugs and bugs are nested insects, adapted to live in host ' s nests or houses.
In all regions of the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which has become the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed of the brain, spinal cord and visual nerve).
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis (MS) as men.
A couple may decide not to have children because of their own interests or in the interests of their children.
These couples may have an adoption plan for their children.
During the adoption process, the biological parents terminated their parental rights so that the other couple could raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through scientific methods, which, in practice, can guide most scientific research.
Experiments are experiments that are used to eliminate one or more scenarios, but experiments are not the only method.
Naturalists and philosophers are concerned with classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were taken into account.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West has moved away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the physiological and behavioural rhythms observed by researchers often depend, to a large extent, on the internal life cycles and their existence through biological bells.
The cyclical rhythm is not just a simple response to external cycle signals. It is recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological bells are self-sustaining swinging devices that, even without external alerts, continue for a period of time to function freely.
The experiments of Hershey and Chase are one of the main indications that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used fungi or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, one with the DNA of the phosphorus and one with the protein of the venom.
A mutation has a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cell is a reproductive cell.
Only mutations in reproductive cells are passed on to children, while mutations in other cells lead to cell death or cancer.
The natural wind tourism industry attracts tourists interested in natural areas who come to watch natural landscapes, including wildlife.
Field activities included hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visits to parks and researching ecosystems.
In Borneo, for example, visits, photographs and knowledge of the chimpanzees.
Every morning, people leave small towns to work in cars, and the place of work of those who pass by on their way is exactly where they leave.
In this dynamic traffic shuttle, everyone is connected in some way to, and supports, a private vehicle-based transport system.
Today, science has shown that this large carbon economy can no longer stabilize the biosphere that has supported human evolution over the past 2 million years.
Everyone's part of society, they use the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or about similar levels of the collapse of bridges.
Why do traffic systems cause such complaints? Why do they fail every day? Is it an incompetence of traffic engineers? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flows study the movement of drivers and vehicles between the two points and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, it was difficult to study traffic flows, since 100 per cent predictions of driver behaviour could not be made.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable degree of consistency; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable degree of consistency, which can be expressed roughly in mathematical terms.
In order to better represent traffic flows, a relationship is established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships contribute to the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects are the first animals to fly back into the air. The ability to fly makes it easier for them to avoid their enemies and to find food and spouse more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings backwards along their bodies.
This gives them more space to escape predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and thugs.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Ali Stacks said that the solar system was spinning around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but there are also many who disagree; they think that the solar system functions around the Earth and the sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable because the Earth doesn't feel itself moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second largest and largest river in the world, with more than eight times the size of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, some of which have a width of up to six miles.
The Amazon River accounts for 20 per cent of the flow of all the world's rivers into the sea.
The Amazon flows 6387 km long (3980 miles). The water comes from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of the Stone Pyramid continued until the end of the ancient kingdom, the vast size of the Pyramid and the high construction technology of the Pyramid were never exceeded.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom were horrified by the monuments of their predecessors, which had been in history for more than a thousand years.
Vatican City has about 800 people. It's the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest country in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and regulations and in its official correspondence.
Italian is also the language most of the people working in the country use on a daily basis, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since time immemorial, as they can be found in natural form and are more easily mined using primary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle put forward the theory that everything is made up of one or more of the four elements of soil, water, air and fire.
It's more like four states of matter (not breaking up in order): solids, liquids, gases and plasmas, but he also put forward the theory that they can be transformed into new substances that make up what we see.
Alloys are basically made of two or more metals. Don't forget, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium, potassium and, of course, silver and gold are metals.
There are also alloys containing small quantities of non-metal elements (e.g. carbon).
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all of which is made up of tiny particles known as atoms.
Atoms are so small that the end of the sentence can accommodate trillions of atoms.
As a result, a pencil becomes a good heart for many as soon as it is born.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, pencils have become less and less used.
People now write on computer screens and never have to touch a pencil knife.
One can only guess what happens when a newer product appears.
The working principles of the fission atomic bomb are as follows: bringing together an atomic core and many protons and neutrons requires energy.
It's kind of like pushing a bumpy little pusher up the hill. Breaking the atomic core again and releasing some energy.
Some atoms contain unstable atomic nuclei, which means that they are likely to split with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometres thick on the immediate side and about 100 kilometres thick on the far side.
The crust below the dark side is thinner and the crust under the high ground thicker.
Because the crust is thinner, there may be more darkness on the near side, and lava is more likely to rise to the surface.
At the heart of the content doctrine is the search for an identity or an interest.
These theories show that certain needs and/or desires are internalized when people mature to some degree of adulthood.
These theoretical studies examine why certain people want to do what they do and what is in their environment that they do or do not do something.
The two popular content theories are Maslow ' s demand-level theory and Hetsberg ' s twin-factor theory, respectively.
In general, there are two types of behaviour when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. In one case, they try to maintain a “close relationship” with the members of the team.
This type of manager has difficulty in making unpopular decisions and in enforcing disciplinary measures, performance assessment, allocation of responsibility and accountability.
In another extreme case, the person would become a very different individual, feeling that he/she would have to change what the team did and appropriate the results.
After all, leaders are ultimately responsible for the team ' s success or failure.
Such behaviour often leads to divisions between the leadership and other members of the team.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are minor differences.
Virtual team members often serve as contact points for their counterparts on-line teams.
They tend to have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams may schedule meeting times for different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a truly “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
“Invisible team” means the management team to which each member reports. It sets standards for all members.
Why does an organization take so long to build a learning organization? One of the objectives of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity occur when all available resources are used effectively between the functional units of an organization.
As a result, in working together to overcome obstacles, an organization often brings new and innovative processes to meet the needs of its clients.
Before organizations can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge and organize learning.
Angel (2006) interprets the continuum programme as a way to help the organization reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiology data provide physical evidence of theoretical methods of cognitive research. It therefore narrows the scope of research and makes it more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour can support the research of scientists.
We have long known that different types of brain damage, trauma, pathologies and tumours can affect human behaviour and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies has enabled us to see and study the structure and work processes of the brain, which have never been seen before.
This provides us with a great deal of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in which the brain works.
Artificial intelligence has a strong science fictional colour, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science, studying machine behaviour, learning and intellectual adaptation.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research involves manufacturing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behaviour.
Examples include control, planning and movement control, the ability to respond to client diagnosis and client questions, and handwriting recognition, voice and face functions.
All of these have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, and some home computer and video game software applications already have built-in artificial intelligence systems.
Field visits are an important part of any teaching activity.
Virtual field trips are a high-tech solution.
The virtual sharing of field visits is also a good way to review travel and share experiences with subsequent classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their state capitals every year. The website is redesigned every year, but the old version is kept online and used as a clipboard.
Blogs can also help students improve their ability to write. Although students often use strong syntax and spelling when they start blogging, the presence of readers usually changes the situation.
Students tend to be the most critical readers, so bloggers start working to improve their writing skills and avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging “will force students to be more visible about the world around them.” To meet the interest of the audience, students are encouraged to become intelligent and interesting.
Blog writing is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to extend their learning beyond traditional schools.
"The proper use of blogs" can make students more analytical and critical; by responding positively to web material, students can find their own positions in the context of other people's articles and can offer their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, the capital of Canada, is attractive and bilingual, with a series of art galleries and museums showing Canada ' s past and present.
To the south, Niagara Falls, to the north, the Muskoka River and the undeveloped natural beauty across the river.
All of these make Ontario a typical Canadian image of outsiders.
The vast areas to the north are sparsely populated, and some are deserted.
A comparison of an alarming set of population data: African Americans living in the United States outnumber Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island and an independent continent for wildlife.
The smaller islands, most of which are independent States or belong to France, are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs had also brought Islam to the land, a doctrine that prevailed in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The effects and colonialism of Europe began in the fifteenth century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Town route from Europe to India.
The north is bordered by the Sahel region; the south and west are bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
Female: It is recommended that all female tourists, regardless of their actual marital status, should declare themselves married.
It'll help if you wear a ring. But don't wear a ring that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to what they perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed, etc.
Refusal of men must be firm and not afraid to hold on to their positions (reject with determination, regardless of cultural differences).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C. and used as a strategic port by Phoenicians, Romans and Marinides (Merenid), known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca until the earthquake of 1755, when they abandoned it.
The city was rebuilt in Morocco by the Sudan as Daru l-Badya, where Spanish businessmen established a trading base and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping places in Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old city of Medina, stores selling traditional Moroccan goods such as pots, pots, leatherware, water smokes, etc., are visible, but they are aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the easternmost part of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the town's streets, especially in the centre.
Although Goma is safe, it should be investigated in advance to any place outside Goma in order to ascertain whether the ongoing fighting in North Kivu has subsided.
The city is also the base of the Nyiragongo volcano and the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking project in Africa.
You can visit Goma in the Boda-Boda (rented motorcycle). The normal (local) fare is 500 Congolese francs.
Also because of its relative remoteness, “Timbaktu” is used as a metaphor for distant and alien countries.
Today, although Timbuktu's reputation has made it a tourist destination and there is an airport, it is a poor town.
In 1990, due to the threat of deserts, it was placed on the List of Endangered World Heritage Sites.
This is Henry Louis Gates, an important part of the American Public Broadcasting Corporation's Miracle of the African World special.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in north-eastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and Crocodile River in the south.
Parks cover 19,500 square kilometres and are divided into 14 different eco-regions that support different species of wild fauna and flora.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered to be the main attraction of the South African National Park System (SANPARKs).
As in all South African national parks, the park receives daily maintenance fees and ticket fees.
There's a lot to buy a Wild Card. With this card, you can go to some or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong is a noun for Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The many buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline are like a flashy strip that is particularly visible in the waters of Port Victoria.
If you wish to enjoy Hong Kong's beauty from the best angle, you can leave the island and go to the Kowloon Seafront opposite it.
Most urban development in Hong Kong is concentrated on the north shore.
This is the place occupied by British colonists, so if you want to find evidence of the colonial history of this territory, it is a good starting point.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove belt in the world, with a forest belt of 80 km (50 miles) extending from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This forest in India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps, but also the remains of huge jungles that used to be full of Ganges plains.
Sundebens has an area of 3850 square kilometres, of which about one third are waters/wetlands.
Sundelbens has been a wildlife reserve since 1966. It is estimated that there are currently 400 royal Bengali tigers and about 30,000 deer.
Bus are available throughout the day from the inter-urban bus station (cross the river), but most of the buses, especially to the east and to Jacar/Bumtun, range between 0630 and 0730.
It is recommended that tickets be purchased a few days in advance, in view of the frequent number of buses in the area.
Most of the area has access to a comfortable, strong Japanese Coaster minibus.
To travel to nearby locations such as Nu 150 and Pu 200, sharing taxis is a quick and comfortable way.
The Oyapok River Bridge is a tilted bridge across the Oyapok River, connecting Oyapok, Brazil, and St. George ' s, French Guiana.
Two towers are 83 metres tall, the bridge is 378 metres long and there are two 3.50 metres wide lanes.
The project was completed in August 2011 but did not start until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
Guaraní (Guarání) are the most important indigenous groups living in the current region of eastern Paraguay, living in semi-nomadic hunting and engaging in self-sufficient agricultural activities.
The Chaco area is home to other indigenous tribes such as Guaycuru and Payagua, which depend on hunting, gathering and fishing for their livelihood.
Paraguay of the 16th century, once known as the Indian Province, was the product of encounters between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups in the region.
The Spanish began a three-century colonial period.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve many of the city ' s native features and characteristics.
Argentina is well known for its top polo team and players in the world.
The largest annual tournament was held in December at the Las Cañitas polo court.
In other days of the year, smaller championships and games can also be seen here.
For news about the tournament and how to buy tickets to the polo game, please consult the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound sterling, which is equal to the pound sterling.
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is generally common everywhere on the island, and payments can often be made by credit cards and in United States dollars in Stanley.
On the outer islands, credit cards may not be available, but they may be available in British and United States currency; please contact the landlord in advance to confirm the acceptable mode of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the island and therefore to do so before leaving the island.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so it is summer in winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; during summer months temperatures often exceed 30°C.
Winter may appear colder than it looks: the temperature is rarely below zero, but when the wind and humidity combines, it makes you feel colder than the temperature indicated by the thermometer.
There are no specific “drought” and “dry” seasons: rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in parks are common to humans, wildlife is, after all, wildlife and we should not feed or disturb them.
Park managers say that a distance of at least 100 yards/m from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/m from all other wildlife needs to be maintained!
Regardless of how gentle it looks, almost all large animals, such as bison, moose, moose, bear, are likely to attack humans.
Dozens of tourists are injured each year by not keeping the right distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so leave some room for them.
In addition, attention should be paid to the fact that odours attract bears and other wildlife, thus avoiding carrying or cooking odour-distributed foods and keeping camps clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 19th and 50th centuries and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The Gulf was the scene of an infamous naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the Gulf.
With the exception of a British cruiser, the rest sank. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In a struggle organized by the Maoist movement for independence, a peaceful assembly in the town killed the Grand Chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Oakland crosses two ports, so there are lots of beaches. The most popular of these beaches are located in three regions.
The North Shore Beach (in the North Port region) is located in the Pacific Ocean, extending from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It's almost all sandy, it's safe to swim, and most of it has shades of New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Whitemata Harbour, Central Auckland, on Mission Bay and St. Hellers.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with families on vacation, and the coasts are surrounded by a variety of shops, and it's safe to swim.
The main local beer is the "No. 1" beer. It's not complicated, but it's good, it's good. Another local beer is called the "Manta."
A lot of French wine can be bought here, but wine from New Zealand and Australia may be more affordable for long-distance transport.
Local tap water can well be used for safe drinking, but it can easily be bought if you are still worried.
For Australians, the concept of "coffee" coffee is relatively new. A small cup of black coffee is "concentrated coffee" and cappuccino's butter (not foam) is high, while tea is not accompanied by milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Juice is expensive, but of good quality.
The Great Barrier Reef has been visited by a large number of people throughout the year, and there have been very few injuries due to participation in any of the above-mentioned activities in the Great Barrier Reef.
Nevertheless, it is important to follow the advice of the authorities, observe all signs and pay close attention to security warnings.
The box jellyfish will appear on the beaches and estuaries of 1770 town between October and April of each year. They can occasionally be found at other points.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and swim.
The main habitat of the brackish crocodiles is not the ocean, but the estuary of the Rockhampton north.
An advance reservation would reassure the traveller that there would be a place to spend the night upon arrival at the destination.
Although travel agencies may book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, they usually work with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually provide packages that include breakfast, airport shuttles, or even flights and hotel accommodations.
If you need time to consider whether the price is appropriate or if you need to obtain other documents (e.g. visas) to your destination, they can keep a reservation for you.
If any changes or requests are required, they should be handled first through the travel agent rather than directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of participants chose to camp on site, and most participants considered this to be an extremely important part of the festival experience.
If you want to watch the show at close range, you need to get there early and get the camp close to the stage.
Remember, while music on the main stage may be over, the rest of the festival may continue to play music until late in the night.
Some festivals set up special camps for families with children.
If we cross the northern Baltic during the winter, we have to check the location of the cabins, because sailing on the ice can cause very terrible noise to those most affected.
Cruise ships in St. Petersburg include in-city tours.
Casinos usually try to spend as much time and money as they can.
They usually provide special food, drinks and recreational activities to keep their guests happy and stay at the casinos.
There are places where alcoholic beverages are provided free of charge. However, drunkenness weakens people’s judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Any person driving or crossing a mountain point at high latitudes should take into account the possibility of snowfalls, ice freezes or freezes of temperature.
On the ice and snow cover, there's very little friction. You can't drive like a light tar road.
Snowstorms, very short enough to trap you.
Snowfall, snowfall, water beads on windows or ice freezes may also block sights.
On the other hand, ice and snow weather are common in many countries and transport is almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Hunting is perhaps the most attractive tourist activity in Africa and is also the highlight of many tourist trips.
The term “safari” is commonly used to refer to African wildlife, especially on the savannahs, who travel by land to view the impressive wildlife of Africa.
Some animals (e.g. elephants and giraffes) tend to be close to cars, and standard equipment can be better appreciated.
Lions, leopards and leopards are sometimes afraid of people, and you can see better with binoculars.
Travel on foot (also called jungle walks, hikes, or hikes) is mainly by foot, usually for hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to hold two summer Olympics, the first in 1964.

The ironing of damp clothes helps them dry. Even if there are no ironings and ironing boards in the room, many hotels provide loan services.
If you don't like ironing, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try with a wind dryer (if any).
Be careful not to make clothes too hot (which may cause contractions and, in extreme cases, burning).
There are many methods of water purification and some are more effective for specific pollution.
In some areas, one minute of boiling is sufficient, and in others it takes a few minutes.
The filters have different effects, and if there is some concern about them, you should consider buying sealed bottled water produced by reputable companies.
Travellers may encounter harmful animals that are not common in their home countries.
Pests destroy food, cause irritant reactions, cause allergies in more serious cases, and spread venoms or infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can kill and maim humans through violence, are usually not among the pests.

Indonesia has 17,000 islands, so Indonesian food is only a generic term, which covers a wide range of local dishes throughout the country.
However, if there are no more qualifiers, the term often refers to food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now, Java food is available everywhere on the islands, with a variety of simple spices, while the main spices that the Javans like are peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Java coconut sugar) and various spices.
The horse is hanging on both sides of the saddle to support the rider ' s feet.
They provide better stability for riders, but there are also security risks, as their feet may be stuck.
If the rider is thrown from the horse immediately, but has a foot stuck on the horse, the horse may drag him away while running. In order to minimize this risk, some precautions can be taken.
First, most horse jockeys wear belts and boots, and the soles are smooth and quite narrow.
Secondly, some saddles — especially the British one — are equipped with safety buttons, and if the fallen rider pulls back, the horseskin belt will fall off the saddle.
Chile's preferred mountain destination, the Cochamó Valley, is known as Yosemite of South America, with a variety of granite walls and cliffs.

Mountain skiing, which includes regular skiing and snowboard skiing, is a very popular sport in which skiboards or skiboards are fixed on your feet and slide from the snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is the main tourist activity of many skiers, sometimes referred to as “skikers”, who plan to ski in one place for the entire holiday.
The idea of skiing has been going on for a long time -- painting cave murals with skiers, dating back to 5,000 B.C.!
As a sport, mountain skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, when Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia in 1861.
Free skiing: The event is also called a field trip, a ski trip or a ski trip.
These activities are related to Alps skiing or mountain climbing, but usually do not take place. Both activities are carried out on steep terrain and require harder skiboards and boots.
Think of the ski route as a sort of hiking route.
When conditions are good, you can go further than on foot — but only in very few cases will you be able to get the same speed at which you can ski across the country without carrying a heavy backpack and on a flat track.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. As a rule, travelling across a number of countries means having to undergo multiple visa applications and passport checks.
In this regard, however, the Schengen area is somewhat like a country.
As long as you reside in this area, you can usually pass directly through the border without being re-checked by passport checkpoints.
By the same token, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply separately to each Schengen Member State, thus saving time, money and formalities.
There is no uniform definition of which items are processed. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.

Any person planning to travel to a country that may be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
Searching the Internet for the course on responding to the hostile environment may lead to the location of the local company providing the training.
This course usually covers all the issues discussed here and is often in-depth in the form of practical experience.
Course training usually lasts two to five days and will involve role-playing, first aid training and sometimes armed training.
Books and magazines on survival in the field are common, but there are few publications on survival in the war zone.
Travellers who plan sex reassignment surgery abroad must carry valid documents at the time of their return.
Governments differ in their willingness to issue passports that do not specify sex (X) or to change documents in order to match the desired name and sex.
The degree of recognition of these documents by foreign Governments also varies widely.
In the post-11 September 2001 era, searches at security checkpoints have also become more disturbing.
Transsexuals who have not yet undergone surgery are forced to disclose their privacy when passing scanners and cannot guarantee their dignity.
Offshore flows are the quick return of waves from beaches to the sea, usually in reefs or similar locations.
Underwater topography results in return flows being concentrated in a few deeper areas, where there may be an acute flow to deep water.
Most of the deaths are caused by reverse currents, which are not likely to be successful in swimming against currents.
It won't be so hard to swim back when you're out of the current.
Try to swim to a place where you will not be trapped again, or wait for help (depending on your skills and whether you have been found).

When you return home after a period of time living abroad, you will find yourself adapting to a new culture and losing some of the customs of home culture.
When you first leave the country, people may be patient and understanding you, because they know that travellers come to a new country and need to adapt.
It may not be expected that travellers will also need patience and understanding in their return journeys.

The coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough to accommodate any yacht, although smaller vessels, even can provide different experiences.
Rowing is a national recreational activity in Finland, with one ship in every seven or eight persons.
A similar situation exists in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in other respects it is unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the figure is one to forty).
Most of the typical Baltic cruise ships stay in St. Petersburg, Russia, for a long period of time.
This means that there will be a few full days to visit this long-standing city and then go back to bed on the boat at night.
A separate visa is not required for landing only on a cruise (as of 2009).
Some ships use Berlin as a highlight in their brochures. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, and cruise prices do not include the cost of visiting the city.
For people of all ages and backgrounds, air travel can be a terrible experience, especially when there has been no previous flight or painful experience.
This is not a shame: it is no different from the fear and aversion many have towards other things.
For some, understanding the workings of aircraft and flight procedures may be helpful if the fears arising from unknown or uncontrollable conditions are to be overcome.
In many cases, time is important for business documents, commodities, or spare parts for emergency maintenance.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but there are problems with other routes and small companies.

The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to spend a great deal of money on this privilege (or, better, to get your company to pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: according to rough estimates, business class fares may be four times as high as ordinary economy class and 11 times as high as first class!
As a general rule, there is no need to find discounted tickets for business class or first-class air travel from A-ground to B-ground.
Airlines are well aware that some of the core passengers are willing to spend high prices on the privilege of moving quickly and comfortably, so that they will charge a corresponding fee.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict led to the establishment of the Transnistrian Republic in the eastern part of Moldova, which had its own Government and currency, but was not endorsed by any of the States Members of the United Nations.
