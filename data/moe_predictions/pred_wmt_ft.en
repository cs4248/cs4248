Is there any way to punish him
So that this doesn't happen again

Student singing at the annual conference of Xi University of Medicine, the results of the research opened the brain hole
Using air to wash hands, to smell diseases, to search accurately for sources of fog, a series of academic achievements were recognized at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year of Zhejiang University last night.
The main researchers of these results are students, whose research covers a wide range of fields, including environmental, mechanical, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities, and education, and they start from a curious point of view and create many high-end inventions with applied value, some of which have already been developed in the field of human resources.
Biosensors: Your Family Physician
Dr. Zhang Dian, PhD, PhD, from the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on the site of a smartphone terminal, only half the size of a smartphone.
You just need to breathe a little, and this instrument can test your health from the gas you breathe.
Zhang Dian said that the sensor is connected to the smartphone and after exhausting the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart rings that can detect health status on the market, usually detecting physical parameters such as temperature, pulse.
The biofilters use graphene, a new material that targets chemical elements, and a sharp sense of smell allows it to reflect physical health more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgical Lamp: Doctor's High Energy Eye
In addition to smart phones, smart operating lamps are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver prize at the 44th Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions in Switzerland this year.
The team of Dr. Julin Yuseng, Ph.D. student at the College of Optical and Electrical Sciences and Engineering, opened a new way of thinking about the flaws of traditional operating lamps and invented the intelligent LED operating light without reflectors.
Many diseases are not detected early and can not be removed, and are related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room.
Shen Junfei said that if doctors can't check all tumor tissue in time, for example, when cancer is examined early, cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This smart surgical lamp has four discs, which enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the procedure, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color homogeneity and shadelessness of the spot at any time, depending on the needs of the operation and individual habits.
This smart surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Zhejiang University Medical School affiliated with the Zhejiang University Medical School affiliated with the Children's Hospital and received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: Save water and cool
The average person washes their hands with water, soap, and rubbing, while Li Cha Chao and others invent a vacuum air handwashing device.
As long as we stand on the equipment's washing machine, our weight can compress the air.
The pump is like a balloon.
The compressed air forms a liquid at the water tap and joins with the water.
This way, we can wash our hands clean!
The colour response and bacterial residue experiments showed that the effect of handwashing using this method is the same as the usual method of handwashing.
The device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the drive, which can both guarantee cleanliness and save 90% of water, and the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, the invention stood out among many of the world's top universities, winning the only gold medal.
Please arrange for my return as soon as possible, thx
Please cancel the order and return the cash, do not score, and no more use of #PRS_ORG#!
Bone and broths are not suitable for children to eat
If so, please order as soon as possible.
Not for a while, thank you.
He asked me to tell you where he was.
I can't wait to cancel my order
I bought #PRS_ORG#, but I wrote the address wrong.
Can we change that?
Or cancel the order
Okay, trouble is coming.
A certificate that I think is meaningful
This is one of the skills certificates that I think is important beyond driving licence!
The popularity of emergency measures is that they are emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is still some time left in the process of arriving the ambulance after the accident, but this is the most crucial time.
This is the moment when emergency assistance is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, a brain hemorrhage, a breathing stop, then our window of life is only four minutes, four minutes of gold!
So people around you know how important emergency aid is!
When someone falls down around us, we can save him with our expertise instead of standing there and doing nothing, and this feeling of helplessness is terrifying.
In China, our official data shows that three million people die each year from sudden deaths, the most dangerous of which is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% of people can be rescued.
In Las Vegas, 78% of casinos could be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%.
This is what the founder of First Response, Lu Lu, said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, you have no role in the person's heartbeat.
It is necessary to breathe artificially, and pressing outside the chest can save a person.
I found that few of us today would have the awareness to learn emergency medicine, but when it does not come, I still urge everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in a timely manner in the face of emergencies.
It is possible to save a life!
The Emergency Certificate can be registered at the Red Cross Training Center in your country, and I am registered at the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai.
PS: The last chart is a record of the goals you have to accomplish before the age of 25, and adding an emergency certificate to the target list was a few months ago, but it is indeed done!
Then I went to check other certificates I wanted to test, and I wanted to test a diving certificate, and before I saw a diving emergency certificate in Little Red Book, the test looked like there was an emergency certificate to be examined, so it was actually useful.
I ordered ##NUMBER#
One of those 13 yuan is a ton!
I haven't tried.
Why didn't you write #NAME#?
One for 13 bucks?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed the delivery, this time a chicken gave me something to eat!
Because it's clear that I saw it worked when I entered code before.
To conclude, I personally think that the Tai Chi is a complete mess, in all senses.
But you have to say that the film is not a bright spot or not, and that it is not at least a good soundtrack.
There are many different kinds of scenes that make you sleep in a movie theater, and one that makes you look angry afterwards. The beach is like a crow on a mountain, and it can be used in many ways.
In insulting the audience, Han Kham is truly a genius.
The most painful thing about this film is that it is as if it were a creation of a classic novel, difficult to name, and as vulnerable as the cloak on the little boy.
Even after watching it, you might doubt whether there is a metaphor for the director, but when you think about it carefully, you find that it is a real one.
To begin with, I have some stories that are difficult to understand.
The man's residence should be on a small island in the far south, where his grandmother lives.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot was set up to send her to the northeast to see the snow.
Older people are sitting in a van from the south to the northeast to watch the snow.
He and his mother are very confident about this.
Then the old man was no longer in context.
How did the wife and brother get a business license after opening a hotel on an abandoned ferry?
Why is it that the island's flying car party is so mixed up that it can easily and easily block a mountain road?
Then the truck that was sending steel straws in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and the truck driver was not found for the whole week.
This sense of prop is also very obvious.
Why would a party with a bad sign and suspected illegal traffic jam become an assistant police officer?
Faced with the lack of police reporting to the Galy loan, the police in the film also specifically asked if there was a problem.
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to open a door with a room card in a hotel, then forced to arrange not to find the hotel owner and sit outside the door and sleep for a night?
This uncanny plot is rife throughout the film, and it makes me feel painful when I remember it because it is too out of sync.
Apart from the plot, the film's theme, or even the film's notion, is a disgustingly bizarre combination.
At the beginning of the film, you think he wants to make a comedy film, and after 20 minutes, you guess it might be an inspiration, and halfway through the movie you think it might be a drama about the difficult lives of small town youth, and you're just going to get the hang of it.
For most people, the plot of the film is very familiar, for example, if you want to shoot a motorcycle driver, then you can do an incentive + comedy and tell the audience how a talented bird steps towards success.
If you want to make a love film, you are talking about the bitter conflict between the young people of the small town who like to ride motorcycles and the waitress sisters.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot appear in the way that the normal world does.
(For example, the new motorcycle that was playing was burned and the singing part was still playing), it is impossible to open some brain holes that even Kennedy has seen.
As for Missing in Action, which is not as weak as a 5-year-old child in some ways, I really don't know if this is the reason for acting or the director's demand.
And one thing I'm not sure about is why Han Han is so keen on adding a crash scene to his own film as a racing driver.
Is this kind of film arranged in the Spring Festival archives to add to the crowd?

Chongqing Secondary School Pilot Modern Apprenticeship Admission is Enterprise Ready Employees
Yesterday, the journalist learned from the City Education Commission that from this year, I will be teaching modern apprenticeship and talent training models in 60 secondary schools pilot, students who receive pilot training will have the status of apprenticeship and will be accepted by the pilot company after admission.
The City Education Commission requested that the regulations for admission to secondary schools and business procedures be specified, and that the dual identity of the apprentices as secondary school students and enterprise-level employees be clarified, and that the apprentices, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement in accordance with the principle of two-way selection.
Pilot schools are encouraged to use the modern apprenticeship form to train and retrain employees in enterprises in collaboration with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools need to reform the model of talent development.
The schools and enterprises co-designed the talent training program, co-developed the professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise teacher training standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation programs.
The pilot was conducted in a training cycle, with students taking internships in enterprises based on professional talent training programs, and the top-level internships are generally six months.
In business practice, a business classroom management model should be implemented, depending on the characteristics of the different professions, one classroom can bring 2 or 5 apprentices and form a learning group to ensure that students master the skills required for each training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, three batches of I City identified 60 city-level secondary modern apprenticeship pilot, each pilot numbering about 50 people, and in total trained about 3,000 students.
Following the principles of the first pilot and gradually advancing from point to point, exploring the long-term mechanism of establishing joint admission, joint training and integration of school administrators, real improvement of student position skills, improvement of student employment rate and quality of employment.

South African doctor: Although the transmission of omega-3 fatty acids is strong, it is more mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Bidarta variant of the disease caused by the Omechromycin variant of the novel coronavirus is milder, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spread in South Africa, a group of doctors composed of more than 5,000 doctors in Hauden Province, South Africa, reported that the symptoms of the new corona patients they are currently treating were relatively mild, such as physical pain and
Dr Unben Pillay, director of the organization, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but no patients need to be hospitalized yet.
Pile said: "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation".
He said this included elderly patients and those with health problems, who would have been more likely to get seriously ill from coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the previous Delta outbreak, the new coronavirus patients he treated had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days.
Within two weeks of the first report of the variant strain of the Omicron in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it takes weeks to collect enough data, the doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of new corona patients hospitalized in recent weeks were seriously ill, half the proportion of the severity of the previous wave; the average stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; the recent new corona
William Hanekom, director of the Institute of Health in Africa, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports: "At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a milder disease".
He also said: "Well, it's early, we need to get the data later".
Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, and we only entered the epidemic in two weeks.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's leading strain of the novel coronavirus, cases of Oxygen are emerging in dozens of countries, including South Africa, where the outbreak is centered.
According to health officials, the new cases detected in Hauden province in the first week of December increased by 400% and tests showed that the case of the variant of the omicron represents more than 90% of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Time Review: What is the basis for saving abducted children?
If the analogy of a bull without buying and selling is not a famous public-benefit advertising slogan that kills bulls, then in a good environment where there is no demand for bulls, crowd control, public backlash, making the smuggling behavior unprofitable, risky and costly, it is not possible to get rid of the bulls without buying and selling.
Recently, the Ministry of Public Security Criminal Investigation Office launched an emergency release platform for the information about missing children who were abducted and developed.
This is an Internet information platform for setting up an authority channel to publish missing children information and to find children who have been abducted in a timely manner.
Heard that the app is called "The Unified", and it feels warm enough.
New technology means not only name the art of the arts, but also informatization is used correctly, practical and effective.
The primary goal of abducted children is to protect their safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be summarized in many words.
But before the trafficking case is solved, the safety of the victims should be given priority.
The matter is urgently urgent and under the urgent search for rescue, such as whether children should be trafficked and the death penalty should be imposed, and the larger controversial topics can be suspended and carefully discussed; but rescue of children abducted and so on.
Based on the experience of detecting such cases, traffickers are used to getting away from the scene as soon as possible after they are caught.
The more the kidnapping operation takes a minute, the more the child may be a step away from the parent, and the more difficult it is to detect the case.
In this case, the development of a platform like the Yulia Yuli platform that directly helps to detect cases and find effective ways to get the child back is indeed a pragmatic action.
After all, the curve is a big task that needs to be done to run the entire legal system.
To combat crime, safeguard the rights of children and parents, from the perfection of the legislation to judicial protection and the strictness of the law, there is no need to carry out the care of the child and the child.
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be done better, from family to society.
For example, a common case is that a family of three is resting at a train station, the parents are asleep and wake up to find that the child is missing.
One cannot expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of young children, one should have at least a considerable awareness of protection.
Routine resting or placing children under stable protection is the least possible way to prevent kidnapping.
From the other side of police fighting trafficking crimes, the purchase of kidnapped children should also be taken into consideration and punished.
Individual wrongdoing is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the penal code of China, the statutory penalty for child trafficking is five years; the plot is particularly serious, punishable by death and confiscation of property.
The maximum penalty is high, and the trafficking of children is clearly a more serious crime in the light of the trend of reduced sentences.
But so far, there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It is clear that some people are behind in their ideas about raising children and their legal awareness is weak.
Legal education for this part of the population should be followed simultaneously.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it is not possible to rely solely on strict enforcement by the authorities.
If the market for smuggling is widespread, if the traffickers are willing and able to engage in smuggling, constantly innovating the means of smuggling, and forming a legal battle with law enforcement, the smuggling operation will inevitably fall into the mud of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking down backward ideas and spreading common sense of the law also helps root out child trafficking and child trafficking.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two major categories, namely Virgin Olive Oil and refined Olive Oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil).
Primitive olive oil, or natural olive oil, is oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruit after mechanical freezing, filtration, and treatment of the extracts.
The difference in acidity can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin: The highest quality olive oil, the highest quality, is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, the flavor of the tea bean is plant-based, the acidity is no more than 1%.
Fine Virgin: The acidity is slightly higher, but not more than 2%, the taste is pure and fragrant.
Ordinary Virgin: The taste and flavor are still good, the acidity is no more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil obtained after refining the first olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or becoming a secondary olive oil.
The refining of olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Ordinary Olive Oil: refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of primary olive oil to match the flavor and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, and a transparent pale yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: is olive oil extracted from oil residue by dissolving and refining it.
If you have looked at the grading, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
It should be noted that olive oil, like grapes made from fermented wine, comes from different regions and varieties of olive oil, and produces different standards.
The best place to grow olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for growing olive oil, such as temperature, sunlight, humidity and rainfall.
Other areas besides the Mediterranean coast can only grow snails in habitable zones.
The main production areas in the Mediterranean:
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc. Argentina, which is far south, has similar climates.
The month of olive oil harvesting:
Every year from 3 to June, the olive oil tree blooms and bears fruit, and from 7 to October the fruit begins to develop and mature, and the fruit transitions from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February of the following year is the fruit harvesting season. The freshness of olive oil is important.
The nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, i.e. oleic and oleic acids, amethylamine acids, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most nutritious oil among the fats discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit is over, and Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out
The Summit for Democracy, an online democracy summit convened by President Biden and attended by leaders of governments in 110 countries around the world, as well as civil society and private sector leaders, closed on Friday, December 10.
Biden said in his closing remarks that the fire of freedom burns in everyone's heart and that authoritarian regimes will never put it out.
He also said that the second Global Summit on Democracy is planned for next year.
Representatives of the Taiwanese government, State Councillor Dong-chan and Hong Kong democratic rights activist Rohun-chong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the job is to put before us.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because I have said before, as this summit showed, the democratic world is everywhere.
The dictatorship will never put out the microfire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world.
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of society as a whole.
He said: "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the shield of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, better resist the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to stand barefoot before the public interest".
The theme of the second day of the Democratic Summit was defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with the International Human Rights Day.
In his opening speech, UN Secretary-General Guterres also said that the democratic cause faces challenges globally, especially the challenges posed by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "It is time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, indigenism and extremism, including all the tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democratic rights activist Rohun Shong spoke to the summit through pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and the Chinese minorities such as Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "The world has been directly raised by China for a long time, but no mechanism has been established to hold it accountable.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use all the resources we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our priority.
Rohun Chow also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Well, maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't realize the threat that the CCP poses to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
This is also why we have to change.
Taiwan's Administrative Council's State Department member, Tao Tao, during the roundtable discussion on the fight against digital dictatorship and affirming the values of democracy, issued a state declaration via video, stressing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience of how to fight the coronavirus outbreak through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At the time of the Democratic Party of Taiwan, we have always been determined to stand at the forefront of global opposition to authoritarianism and to play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere have justified human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy is showing signs of a setback.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down cities to control the epidemic, and we don't have to get out to beat false information.
Just as the second day of the Democratic Summit was underway, the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, who were identified as serious human rights violators, while also imposing sanctions against a person who was identified as assisting in human rights violations using surveillance technology.
I have already photographed and uploaded to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying delivery times
It turns out #NUMBER#
I didn't call at all.
I didn't eat.
I will complain.
You can't send, why don't you tell me sooner?
Wait for you so long
No, I didn't get the call.
Please inform him to send him back to our company
I don't want to wait any longer.
A meal and a half hour wait
#PRS_ORG# has not been sent
I want to cancel the order
Why not cancel it?
Hello, the hot water bottle sent by the restaurant is fresh.
I wanted to try tennis, but I was afraid I wouldn't be able to keep going, so I wanted to find a practicing player for a price that was more or less the same.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices are often in line with the degree of friendliness, and if you can't tell, then normal conditions are more expensive than cheap batting, which is actually industrial garbage.
They are very low in intensity, the ball hits the beat, the vibration is very high, the hard ball cannot hold the top, and the high players are difficult to drive.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that playing tennis is so hard, knowing that you won't learn, and knowing that you can't afford to buy expensive, make a cheap thing mess with you, you play twice, and you won't play again, so this beat is cheap, and you can't play it again.
So you can really tell the difference between good and bad, and show that you've made progress, and when you come back to buy expensive things, I'll make two bucks.
It is recommended to spend similar prices, buy a second hand ball shot, choose Prince or Pump, both brands are not famous enough, so good balls are not sold for more money, new ones are good, 500 or 600, second hand.
They are friendly to newcomers, but they are shy after the newcomer stage, but most people, especially girls, are not able to go through the newcomer stage.
Orders have been delayed delivery times
Can you help me follow up?
Delayed
Thank you.
I mean, I actually have credit already?
Should I reapply next? Did I not need to take that one?
Hello, I have tasted the food in this restaurant, but there is a lot missing in the food delivered, and the mouthwash is also fresh.
#PRS_ORG# No reason to say that I should take it myself, trouble please cancel
I just asked for the shipment, and I didn't take it at all.

In fact, there is a lot of discussion about how fat girls dress together.
The necklace of fat girls can't be too short or too long, and it's almost on the knee, just where the fat legs can be covered.
The short neck will reveal the fatness of the legs.
Too long can make you feel short and fat.
If you go out and divide the upper and lower three sections, it seems that you are naturally elevated, and the upper body, the upper body and the upper body are in different colors, and it seems to create a sense of healing.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the hallmark of fat girls - the authors deeply appreciate this - and dark colors are also a good way to mask your body fat, and elegant black shorts are also the preferred choice for fat girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially black shorts, will make you feel thinner.
If your legs are fat, don't wear your collar and shoes too noticeably.
The more popular the better, the less bright the color.
So that people don't feel fat when they pay attention to your legs and feet.
For girls who are slightly fat, it is necessary to talk about the appropriate dress and makeup.
Fat girls should not wear tight shorts, and also not wear shorts too short or stuck in the collar, which will make people look uncomfortable, if the legs are rough, wear black long silk or mesh shorts (the kind of shorts that are fine),
Of course, the fat little girls are also smart about wearing shorts.
Fat girls wear shorts and should choose a shirt that matches the color of the shorts, so that you can increase the height of fatness.
A short shoe with high heels can make your legs look bigger, but this is the most IN shoe in summer!
If you are fat but have thin legs, I recommend choosing a luxurious shorts.
Not only can it cover your big belly, but it can showcase your strengths.
A word short will be thin, more suitable for fat girls, and the coat will be tighter, forming a layered feeling will be thinner.
Simple simple white T-shirts with short skirts and fat MMs can also be tried.
The slim fat girls are also able to wear a sense of fashion.
As long as they can master the rules of dress and attire, the fat girls will also be the focus of attention.
After the change in dress matching, there will also be more exercise in life, striving to get rid of the label of a fat girl the first day.

The girl was given a donation for her sister when she was arrowheaded: "It would be good to think that it was a skin wound". - Xinhua Net
A girl in Hangzhou's Wooling Square stands in front of a large wooden board with a man-made meatball on it, and the words "one arrow" are written in the shape of a ten yuan.
Yesterday morning, a young Hangzhou girl who was photographed by a younger sister who was donating money to her sister's charity, blew up her circle.
The photo shows a girl standing in Hangzhou's Wooling Square in front of a slightly taller wooden board with a man-made meatball, a ten-yuan arrow-like text, and a bow-shooting after the passenger pays.
The behavior sparked a heated debate among netizens.
Last night, the head of the Public Security Department of Hangzhou confirmed to the journalist that the girl had taken such an extreme step to raise money for her sister, but this behavior is not worth advocating.
Girls on the streets arrowing and arrowing for donations
In the image, a tall-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board with a black ink on it, writing on it a black-headed meatloaf, a ten-yun-one-arrow-barrow word, and her bank on another board in front of her.
The image sparked controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believe that this is a begging act of the Gambling Eye, and many netizens have expressed condolences about this.
"We found the situation when we patrolled to the square around 10am on the 23rd, when the crowd was already around".
The local police, who interviewed the local media, said that two girls in the stands, aged about 20, dressed in youthful clothes.
Among them, the girl who was making a chicken and chicken chicken was crying and asking the passers-by to play the game; another girl was helping the chicken and said that her friend's sister had leukemia and now urgently needs surgery, please help.
We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was donating money for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the head of the Public Security Department of Hangzhou City told the New Jing newspaper that the girl, named Gijari, had raised money for her sister Gijari.
But since the treatment still required over 300,000 costs, the act was made when there was no good way to raise funds.
He said that during the whole process, two girls, one as a duck, one responsible for the handshake, but did not participate in it, and during the whole process no arrows were found, only someone circled and took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
Police later identified the arrows used by the security department as not subject to regulation.
The official said that Liu did not advocate for this kind of crowdfunding.
After sending a warning to the people, she has left the post.
Heat dissipation effect: good, lightweight: convenient exterior material: satisfactory. The price of the macrocon has always been high.
The new machine is very good.
Performance stable, four exhaust heat exchangers are fine, and worth recommending
This magnificent dark fantasy game is good, and it's a good tool for the brand!

Personally, I think the Macro Dark Knight Dragon is really good, the game effect: the game effect is comfortable, you can play most games, my eating is very high** steady, very fluid, lol is even more in the absence of words, CSgo is also easy to handle, most of the game is very easy.
Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation effect is good, the fan is powerful, the work is quiet, the game effect is full fan open or not small.
External material: The look is cool, the gamebook has a pulling effect. The screen is clear, playing the game 1080 is enough.
It's really nice to buy laptops, mostly designed for a high price, lighter than you think, and better than you think. Red on the ass is a very good-looking wine color, there is no such thing.
Two years ago I started contacting the Dark Knight of the Moon, and it took two years to get the sex ratio higher and the quality too hard!
I recommend that friends around me buy this product too!
So far, three machines in this series have been purchased!
The look is beautiful and the configuration is good.

What's the hottest in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only the Olympic Games kids can win prizes?
The article on the Olympic project where the project manager can hit the gold medal is hot, and it mentions that project managers on many projects can definitely be on the move, traveling, sleeping at night is the best way to get ahead.
An article that seemed to be a joke, but also revealed the daily bitterness of project managers, which was behind the lack of effort in managing the current project.
People who work in project management also gradually choose to get out of the workplace by taking some actions.
From the year-on-year increase in the number of applicants for PMP (the qualification for internationally certified project management professionals), more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the China Project Management Twentieth Decade Development Report (1999-2019): As of September 2019, the cumulative PMP® examination number nationwide was nearly 600,000, about 420,000 people passed the PMP® certification, and about 300,000 people were validly certified, and the number of people who took the PMP® examination was about 400,000.
The increase in the number of PMPs holding witnesses every year in the last decade shows that more and more project managers realize that simply moving past past past experiences and experiences to do things is impossible, and the changing work environment tells us that we need to learn and stand up for science.
However, can PMPs ensure that project management work is smoothly conducted?
Many project management beginners say that by learning relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master relevant knowledge such as the top 10 areas of project management and the top five process groups, but it is still a fog when it comes to actually doing project management work.
Many project managers often have the following questions: Project management is not cognitive, relies solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, does not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, failure to land in work, project estimation.
Therefore, the focus on product innovation and R&D management has helped many excellent enterprises to develop a large number of key talent in R&D and product managers and project managers, and to acquire the R&D and management talent of China's leading enterprises.
The R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp on-line course is an online method of learning fragments chemistry, which combines real-world cases, tools and methods from numerous R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard moves for project managers to get started.
This is also an opportunity for businesses to use lower costs and less investment, facilitate the process of training project managers, and bring efficient operational results to the enterprise.
It is worth noting that we can see how other students evaluate the course: the course is not only developed by the team of experts from China and China (Huawei Research and Development Management Team), but also by combining advanced project management methodology and many well-known companies.
It will also provide scientifically practical management tools and methods, rich templates and forms to help students translate their learning content after class to specific work.
One order of a banana only one?
Why are there six copywriters?
On the eve of the 12th of July, the company advises consumers on rational consumption - Economic Observation Network - Professional financial news website
This year, the total amount of transactions in the national network of payments business reached 1.77 trillion yuan, which is relatively high compared to the previous year.
The abundance of red bags, the live broadcast of people's eyes, once again brought great benefits to consumers, and this consumption boom is one way to admire the strength of national consumption, and on the other hand, we should not be cool to think about consumption.
On the eve of the arrival of the Chinese government, Jiaxing Consumer Financial Limited (Jiaxing) issued a rational consumption initiative, reminding the general public, especially young people, to establish good consumer awareness and consumption habits, rejecting blindness.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People's Bank this year, the Consumer Financial Literacy Index is 66.81 and is 2.04 higher than in 2019.
Overall, the population of China performs well in terms of financial consumption, but there is a large disparity in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and there is a need to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of older people and adolescents is relatively low, and the elderly and young people will continue to be the focus of ongoing attention in financial education; the report on the state of China's youth debt issued by Nielsen and the report on China's youth debt issued by China Financial Services 2019-2020
As a licensed consumer financial institution, JSC has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with quality and attentive services, advocating for consumers to establish a good and correct consumer perspective, and actively responding to the call of regulation to improve consumption with practical action.
Over the past several years, JSC has been conducting a wide range of financial knowledge outreach activities aimed at young people, including university students, and has been implicitly empowering young people in various forms, such as innovation practice competitions, by working with top institutions in the country.
As the Twelve arrived, JSC reminded all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumer awareness and the right money perspective, to boycott blind consumption and overconsumption, and to avoid the consumer borrowing fallacy so as not to affect personal signage and the future.
When consuming, it is necessary to plan ahead and pay back on time.
If the overdue records are recorded in the personal credit report, it may have a negative impact on the economic life of the future, such as buying cars and buying houses.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose the regular institutions and channels and pay attention to verify whether the relevant institutions have the operational qualifications.
In the future, JSC will continue to serve consumers more appropriately and diversified, with its mature, reliable consumer financial system and its constantly updated financial products, continuously helping the public to raise their financial knowledge level and help consumers.
I'm not going.
I'm on order
No one ever contacted me for an hour, and it was basically an online scam.
You think this is the first time I've called out?
After the investigation, you said the same thing! I checked the address several times before I ordered, and the letter was just down.
Okay, thank you! How many days was that?
Vietnamese People's Daily Network - Gulf Cooperation Commission responds to common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first visit by Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, which led to the diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
In the midst of the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties to Iran.
Foreign tensions have severely affected the internal unity of the Haitian League, and have had a negative impact on the economy of the country in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land and sea routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when Gulf states signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to promote solidarity and stability.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Arab states of the Gulf resolve their differences and resolve common challenges, based on the demands that they must unite to restore relations with Qatar in order to stabilize their interests and the region.
During the visit of the Saudi crown prince to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
The 725 km long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the travel and integration of the supply chain for citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two companies have signed 13 Memoranda of Understanding for Cooperation worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincides with Iran and the world's major powers rescuing the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a competitor and have seen Iran's nuclear program as a threat to regional security.
Gulf states believe that failure to solve Iran's missile problem and not take action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
Saudi Arabia has been in direct negotiations with Iran in the context of the failure of the Gulf states to meet the wishes of the major powers in nuclear negotiations with Iran.
The goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that has slowed the Gulf Cooperation Council's national economic growth.
The upcoming summit will be the first summit of the Hague countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Commission to reassess the diplomatic results of its contribution to the restoration of the unification of the Gulf Cooperation Council, while also proposing measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.
From 7pm to 9:30pm, orders have not yet been delivered, and orders must be refunded and cancelled
Good.
The biggest exhaust noise in the New Mountain Zone!
This car that our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It was Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model, the Aventador LP700-4!
If the price is almost two million yuan, the road tax is tens of thousands yuan a year, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is to have 700 horses?
Even though the minority didn't know, the data says that the 0-100 km/h acceleration takes only 2.9 seconds, probably because the minority's myvi is going to reach 30 km/h and the family will reach 100 km/h, so it is possible that the minority will reach 30 km/h.
The short body, the tight cutting doors, the huge entrance gate that runs around the body and the glass next to the unlimited 6.5 v12 engine perfectly interpret Lamborghini's style.
It's not necessary to say too much about the description of the car, Google itself is good, and the author has compiled some explanations that Google does not necessarily give!
It's so much fun, and it's not easy to go wherever you look!
1km of oil costs about RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all)
Practice the posture of getting up and down the car, otherwise you will be a little embarrassed (because you will not be able to climb out of the car seat and get stuck halfway).
The engine is too loud and you'll be deaf after you get off the car.
The car is too big to stop in the normal parking lot and it is too narrow to be knocked when the door is opened by the next car!
A little lonely, because there are no opponents on the road (the narrator himself said, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, this video of the superrun is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for your car are welcome to contact us!

Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua Net
The so-called university spirit, which refers to a series of office ideas and value pursuits that a university has built up over the course of its development, is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been vital to the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has taken on a unique mission unlike any other social organization, and for our university, which arose in the autumn of national crisis, its spirit is more deeply influenced by traditional culture and changing times, advocating for the establishment of a better understanding of the world.
At present, the information technology and internationalization trends in higher education are becoming increasingly evident, the global education competition, the competition in science and technology, the competition in talent is increasing, the higher education sector is an important supply side, and structural reforms are facing unprecedented opportunities and opportunities.
In particular, the proposal of the Joint Plan for the Promotion of World-class Universities and First Class Faculties, which demonstrates the confidence and determination of our country to move from a higher education power to a higher education power, also poses higher updated requirements for the development of universities.
How can we work to become world No. 1 in a shorter period of time, accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a group of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and achieve the tunnel supercar?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence and capacity confidence, universities should also fully exploit three advantages: first, the backward advantage, learning to draw on the advanced experience of world-class universities by continuously bringing outstanding academic talent abroad, achieving academic level and achieving the best possible results.
It is important to realize that building world-class universities cannot be done in one direction, and that each school must show its individuality and characteristics while playing its part.
The characteristics of the office should have Chinese characteristics in common, but also reflect their unique target positioning, office traditions and resource allocation.
For Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three aspects of the office: one is highlighting the characteristics of developing innovative entrepreneurship, building a fusion of disciplines, building an integrated environment of parenthood that combines university enterprises, and forming a whole chain of entrepreneurial education students.
In this process, it is especially important to always stick to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university resonates with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the goal is to teach innovative courses, learn about yoga, logic, ethics, understanding, and practice the common values of yoga, and to build the common values of the Zhejiang River, the Enlightenment, the open mind, and the state of Zhejiang.
This is an important guarantee that the school adheres to the right direction of instruction, constantly accumulating cultural heights, consolidating spiritual strength, rich in meaning and meaning.
Among them, Liu Heinajiang emphasized the spirit of openness and inclusion, reflecting the spirit of bravery that I used to use for my talent in the underworld, and demonstrating the quality concept of educators who draw from world-renowned schools; Liu Heisenhoang emphasized the need for truth.
This series of spiritual ideas and values pursued is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 year office.
The wise hear silently, the wise see the unformed.
Chinese universities will further establish the overall characteristic socialist cause of China, and deepen their historical mission of understanding the timeline and responsibilities of higher education in China, accelerating the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adhering to human caring and independent freedom, let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times and the national spirit interact with each other, thus providing the inexhaustible impetus for achieving the national wealth and national revitalization and achieving the common ideals of humanity.

With the NFT's fireworks coming out, the crypto community has come up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity Games had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents losing their jobs due to the pandemic starting to earn steady income from the game.
Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based pet-breeding game that brings together a variety of games, including NFTs, and is the highest-trading NFT project to date, with over $3 billion in transactions.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity earned more than $8.2 million for the day, directly challenging the King's Glory.
On August 6, Axie Infinity officially announced that its day users have exceeded 1 million.
The heat of the Axie Infinity game is passing a new gameplay mode to more people, and with the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role, except to enjoy and gain economic benefits from the game.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game makers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing the news about the price of friends shares, my biggest touch was the choice of companies on the track, that is, the choice of industries to invest in, first to choose an industry with a large space for growth, at least a market size of over 100 billion; second, to choose a future growth.
The width of the track indicates the size of the market, the length of the track indicates the development stage of the industry, and the flatness or ruggedness of the track indicates the competitive landscape of the industry.
Fuel for the right track!
The first thing to do in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to do the things right, that is, to do things right.
Strategy is about doing the right thing, that is, doing the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about landing, and most tactical thinking has room for strategic thinking.
For example, thinking about how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking) can be thought of as continuous deepening or horizontal extension of the current area (strategic thinking); for example, thinking about how to improve customer retention rate (tactical thinking) can be thought of as enhancing core customers.
Bitcoin, 12 years old, has set several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador declared Bitcoin legal tender, the first time that Bitcoin became legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12, the SEC approved ProShares' launch of Bitcoin ETFs for the first time in eight years and it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to enter the U.S. capital market, and crypto is a key component of the newly-created ETF.
Bitcoin is not a main player from the perspective of blockchain technology development.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called Taproot's Snap, which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data load on transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American groups complained about discrimination in admission to three Ivy League schools, including Yale.
News Agency Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Chengmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups filed complaints with the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23 protesting against three famous schools of common cold: Liu Liu, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth.
The Asian-Asian Education Union, which filed the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Chairman of the group, Yu Yu-Yung, said at the conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the requirements for admission to American universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asian students in these three American universities has remained basically the same.
Many studies have shown that these universities have long-term persistence and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants in the so-called "comprehensive assessment" process.
According to Yu-ka, a 2014 study by scholars such as Sanders showed that the relative number of applicants in these three universities is the lowest among all ethnic groups.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also showed that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Liu told Xinhua that they expected the U.S. Department of Education and Justice to open an investigation after filing the complaint and take steps to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after the fact was established.
They also expect the universities complained about to take an active role in changing the admissions policy for Asians.
At present, the three universities complained about have not responded.
The Asian American Education Union was founded in 2015 when it filed a complaint about discrimination in admission to Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education declined to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese American groups, Indian American, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani educational groups participated in the complaint.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a house broker about a factory in Yuwu-Yun-Ting Town in Zhejiang, and after several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu consulted with Lin Liu, the family of the homeowner, about the details of the purchase of the factory and made a settlement of 200,000 yuan through bank transfer on the same day.
Lin Mao signed the receiver clause on the purchase and sale of fixed-income receipts in the factory, which states that if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the fixed-income return to the seller, if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the fixed-income return will be doubled
However, afterwards, the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of sales of the factory and the method of payment, which led to the delay in signing the contract of sale of the house.
Given the fact that the parties failed to reach consensus on the contents of the contract, after a few days, Lin Mao returned the 200,000 yuan fixed sum to Mr. Lu.
The house that was not easy to see, the money was delivered, the rent was ready, and the contract was almost signed, but the seller did not sell, which angered Mr. Lu.
For this reason, Mr. Lu has filed a complaint against Mr. Lin in the People's Court of Yuzhou City.
The court's review concluded that the parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, and that the defendant cannot be solely blamed for this, and should reasonably be presumed that the consultation was not completed, so the fine should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not be held liable for the default of the double refund of the fixed amount.
After the verdict of the first trial, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original verdict.
Liu's lawyer reminded him to exercise the necessary due diligence in the transaction process.
At the same time as signing the contract, the buyer must exercise the necessary prudent attention obligations, such as verifying information about the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, and specifying in the contract the specific time and place of delivery, in case the two parties perform simultaneously
(German Voice Chinese Net) After the end of the "Democracy Summit" on Friday, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry said in a conversation on Saturday (December 11) that the United States was hosting the "Leader Democracy Summit" as "an ideological outline to instrumentalise democracy".
The Chinese government believes that "the United States has long imposed its own political system and values on people, pushing for 'democratic transformation', unilateral sanctions, and staging a 'color revolution' with disastrous consequences".
Democracy has long been a "mass lethal weapon" for US interference in other countries.
This summit was Biden's act to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held via video format and leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited to attend, including Taiwanese leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States over the issue of America's own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also questions at the international and domestic levels, such as criticism of invited leaders including authoritarian dictatorships, such as those in the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and doubts about the Biden administration's true intentions not for democracy but for the sake of democracy.
The newly appointed German Prime Minister Scholtz also attended the Video Democracy Summit.
"Today's American democratic pathology is becoming more evident, with problems such as money politics, identity politics, political party antagonisms, political polarization, social rift, racial contradictions, wealth disparity, etc. increasingly increasing", the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Saturday.
President Biden said in his speech, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the shield of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, and better resist the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and the forces that are responsible for the fight against the dictatorship".
He stressed that democracy is not a matter of course, "We must update it continuously from generation to generation, and in my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our time".
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need a fighter to defend democracy in the face of ongoing and worrying challenges".
The U.S. pledged to launch a one-year campaign following the Democratic Summit, which includes a $4244 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States wants countries to make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical democracy summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
"Let all of us implement our commitments and report on our progress next year", Biden said.
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.

What is the law of red card whiskey?
Everyone's hobbies are different, some people like collecting, some people like food, and of course, some people like wine. Red card whiskey is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in different countries, and red card whiskey has won international beer competitions.
Each bottle of red card whiskey has a unique flavor, but if you don't know how to taste it, it's not going to spoil the aroma.
So how about red card whiskey?
The first section is a brief introduction.
Red card whiskey:
The red-certified Scotch whisky is a blend of about 35 varieties of Scotch whisky, with a rich aroma and characteristics of traditional Scotch whisky, and a sweet and smoky flavor in the rich aroma.
The intake of the alcohol is fresh, slightly flavored with bananas and bitter tobacco dough.
The wine can be added directly to ice drinks or mixed with favorite drinks.
Red card whiskey entered the country and, in order to suit the tastes of the country, bubble drinks such as red card whiskey + cola or snowflake or new chicks became a perennial fad.
These sweet drinks, in addition to being moderate and sour, visually bring pleasure, adding to the drink, and have the effect of changing the taste of the sparkling wine.
Red card whiskey + slices of cinnamon + sugar (and sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink.
The original red wine has a slightly acidic flavor, adding sugar to the acidic flavor, which gives the wine a fresh aroma, and of course, the sweetness can be adjusted according to the taste of the individual.
The three types above are the best ways to drink red card whiskey, and we can try them as a reference, hoping that the introduction of the book will help you.
Educational thinking: How university exams can make students learn to read and write
Three students from Lanzhou Transport University wrote letters to the school leadership reflecting their confusion about the university examination and proposed improving the difficulty of the examination and changing the test subject to make the examination truly reflect the demands of the students' actual level.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a hot topic.
On the university campus, students come from the five lakes and four lakes, with varying levels of ability, and the level of learning is different.
There are different feelings about the group with such diverse characteristics to be evaluated, and this is inevitable.
Of course, if the test subject is single, repetitive, and the subject is too simple, it will inevitably cause another feeling.
Students who do not use kung-fu may be able to focus on the task before the exam, if they think about other methods, they can achieve half the results.
In this way, there is a school standard that can pass or even get high marks; students never miss class, work and notes look good, and the exam is not very high.
So it seems that students who grew up in Lanzhou reflected the problems that existed in university exams, and believe that this situation does not exist only in Lanzhou.
In this sense, the students who wrote the letters directly to Chen should be commended.
In fact, those who have gone to university know that it is not uncommon to take the exam, think of all kinds of ways to take the exam from the teachers, try to draw the exam scope, ask for the exam prior to the exam, and even take the exam with a small hand.
In my opinion, as a guide to evaluating the quality of teaching, the measurement of whether a university exam is passed or not is more about the teacher's comprehensive understanding of teaching and learning and the scientific propositions on which it is based.
The professional division began after entering the undergraduate phase of the university, and many professional courses were based on basic knowledge.
I doubt whether comprehensive knowledge of the basic knowledge of a subject is the content of the university examination.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common knowledge of the subject, and from the point of view of knowledge, the space for change is not large, it is basically fixed.
As some teachers say, the basic knowledge of mathematics at university 20 years ago is still in school, and it is still the focus.
But the knowledge points remain essentially the same, and do not represent a single test subject type, repetition of the test.
In many universities, the examinations are usually grouped into a set of subjects, followed by a test book composed of a group of senior teachers in the subject, and the test book is also taken by the entire teacher of the department, so that the repetition of the test can be overcome to some extent.
But to develop a set of practical test subjects that are consistent with teaching and learning, the test subjects are difficult to distribute normally according to the overall situation of students' learning, and comprehensive mastery of the teaching situation is also required, so that the degree of student learning is fully analyzed, so that the test propositions are dynamic for the difficulty and the type of test.
The exam is the guiding rod of university education, and what kind of exam students will have is the corresponding supplementary exam program, which will affect the results of university education in the long run.
The recommendation letter from students is highly valued by the school board of Lanzhou University and has been implemented in all schools.
Requires teachers from organizing teaching units to conduct research and course-conclusion examination self-checks, develop test paper propositions and related systems, while strengthening supervision and inspection of test paper propositions and review sections, and fine-tuning results evaluation
From the mechanism, solving problems such as single type of test, repetition of the test is a topic that university examinations need to face, and of course, a corresponding system needs to be introduced, but it is worthwhile in everyday life, and it requires teachers to have a complete mastery of the teaching situation, not just to eat through the teaching.
If I can't change the location of my branch, can I change it to an outsourcing?
So I don't have to give you more money, right?
The colleagues' orders have been sent.
It's not finished.
GPS? It's not there.
Ms. Kim's wedding photo (South Street store) has not yet had a branch
Before the shoot, we had to change the time twice because we didn't have the time, and consultant Lan Lan was patient with us.
Later, I chose a weather-friendly weekend.
Ms. Kim's staff, whether they are consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are highly appreciated.
It was my first formal makeup in my life, and I can't believe that one day I will look so good, haha.
Xiaojie and another sister (sorry I can't remember the name) make-up super are patient, and make-up is natural.
The view was taken in the city of Jiang Bay, and thankfully the weather was nice, it didn't feel too cold, and the makeup artist occasionally noticed our clothes and headgear when they took pictures, and a little bit of badness immediately helped us to clean up.
The photographer was also very humorous and was happy to take pictures the next day.
When choosing photos, because I saw a lot of cases online, I didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we chose photos, really, it didn't mean anything to add photos, 24 of them in the direct package, none of them added to the list.
Today the photo was fixed and Ranlan sent it to me, and I saw two that didn't feel good, and they immediately helped me repair it.
I think our photos are really satisfying, just fresh, and that's the style I want.
I would highly recommend that you go and announce that Mrs. Hankin is taking her wedding photo!
The price of the set is 3999 yuan.
Thank you, Ms. Kim, and wish you happiness and happiness.
How much is this set?
What conditions are there to use the $32?
That's fine, no refunds needed.
Your rider said he couldn't find it.
Can't find it
But I still don't understand his English.

Shabana 3200 newborn babies without birth certificate for special anti-counterfeiting paper
(Appei 11th) The Sabah National Registry said that due to the special anti-counterfeiting paper storage light, it was not possible to issue birth certificates to first-born babies since the beginning of October, and the total number of affected people has accumulated to date to 3,200.
However, the director of the agency, Keru Aminuz, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system and will be returned when counterfeit papers are delivered next week.
He explained at a press conference that a media outlet had reported on the issue of printing Shaba newspaper's birth certificate for up to 10 months.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
One of the reasons for this is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeit paper have been affected by the epidemic, which has caused delays in shipping to China.
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used by Shaba newspaper is different from other regions and therefore cannot be used to borrow stocks from other states.
Keru Aminos revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on 8th to do some printing work.
The Bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to collect the goods and return to Shaba immediately for the final stage of printing, estimated that two more working days (20 December) can be delivered to the applicant.
We will notify the applicants to go to the various branches to get the birth certificate.
He added that Shaba had issued a total of 24,801 newspapers so far this year.
From 7pm until now
Is that fast?
I mean food.
I was in front of #PRS_ORG# and so on.
All right, thank you, because the restaurant says it's ready.

Education news: Beijing compresses the percentage of special students entering secondary school in early 2016 - Xinhua Net
On 21 and 22 October, the special examination for the first-year primary school teacher in Beijing was carried out by the Unified Committee of the Regions.
This year, the number of students enrolled in special education in Beijing has been reduced, and the competition for special education has become more intense.
For example, in the East City district, the total number of primary and secondary school students entering primary and secondary school this year is not more than 5% of the total number of district admissions programs, the number of planned admissions is 380, and the school-to-school ratio is not more than 10% of the number of school admissions programs.
Students with sports, arts and technology specialties and who are registered online are eligible to take the special student entrance exam.
To facilitate students to take part in the examination, the East City district continued the examination arrangement last year, setting up one or two examination sites in each school district, for a total of 13 examination sites.
The examination is divided by the exam area, divided by the hourly unit of time, and the examination day students will take the exam within the examination area.
On May 23, the District Education Admissions Examination Center published the list of students who passed the examination online, and students can query the results of the examination online.

48 hours of nuclear acid negative, setting up buffer zone, and the Joint Defense Joint Control Mechanism of the State Council issued a request to strengthen the control of epidemics in port cities - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 11, Press release (Reporter Dong Rifeng, Guo Tianqing) The Joint Defense and Joint Control Mechanism of the State Council issued a notice on the strengthening of the work on the control of the epidemic of novel coronavirus in port cities, requiring the recent departure from the land border port cities with the
According to the notification, the timeframe for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port city scope by the provincial municipalities to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notification also proposed that conditional port cities could study setting up epidemic control buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
The relevant head of the National Health and Health Commission's Office of Disease Prevention and Control explained that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the area and people from both sides visit frequently.
Implementing a policy of differentiation management of the subdivision, transforming from one controlled outflow line to two lines of defense, hopes to achieve the front door move, compress outflow risk, achieve maximum effectiveness in the control of epidemics with minimal social impact and minimum social cost.
There have been several domestic cluster outbreaks in China in recent years, both foreign outbreaks were imported through port cities.
The above notice noted that this exposed the inadequacy of the warning of the monitoring of epidemics in some places, the failure to implement the closed loop management of high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing in the form, the elimination of all links of cold chain items, the management of centralized quarantine sites.
The notification requested to focus on nine aspects, from improving the epidemic control mechanism in port cities, to strengthening the epidemic surveillance and alert system, to implementing border control measures, to accelerate the completion of the shortcomings of the port city control board, without relaxation, scientific precision to do
The notification stressed that port cities should simultaneously study and deploy, publish and broadcast the hotline for life-saving activities in the field of epidemic prevention and life-saving work, regularly check the risks of basic life-saving supplies and prices, and solve them in a timely manner.
According to the notification, the port cities referred to include open land, water, air port cities, districts, flags, cities, states and jurisdictions, with specific scope for each province, autonomous region, jurisdiction.

Oil pipeline video begins with the truth about 20 years of bloodthirsty killing by the US military - Xinhua Net
(Video source: Oil pipeline)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "The Turtle Killing Machine Turtle" from the oil pipeline platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States waging the war in Afghanistan under the name of counterterrorism, forcing American democracy through war, 20 years of poor soldiers fighting, bloodthirsty adultery, abusing innocent people, committing crimes against humanity.
Abuse of civilian spaces such as hospitals, schools, and drone airstrikes, human distortion, and the formation of a kill group.
In 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up a black prison to torture and humiliate suspects.
One crime against humanity has sparked more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the US-led war against terrorism is going on against Vietnamese terrorism.
War has not brought peaceful democracy, prosperity, a country full of eyes and countless massacres to the Afghan people.
Let's come together to uncover the truth of the bloody killing of America, known as the anti-terrorist propaganda, and the fake face of American democracy!
I didn't mean to see the following article, from a commercial perspective and from a conservation perspective, about why this customer wants to make the logistics company in the tax zone, although the logistics belongs to the deep processing and not the business scope of the tax logistics company, here.
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the bags and the milk powder they are made of are the same raw materials, without any difference.
So you're probably asking: why is the shelf life of bags one year and the shelf life of hearing bags two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price of hearing aids and bags so different?
In fact, many consumers, or even those with a higher level of confidence, think that this is because the raw materials are different and so the quality will be much better.
In fact, just like raw materials, only the expensive is good.
Some consumers reacted to this mentality after eating and said that the taste or taste of the dress was different!
Now let me tell you why you are so expensive, where are you?
Why is the price of the same raw materials so different?
Because when manufacturers price, most consider that if the price of bags is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are low, or if there is no profit, what does the manufacturer depend on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the price of their hearing aids to secure their profit space.
So most manufacturers are focusing on hearing, not bagging.
Or do you think that so many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even billions of dollars each year on advertising?
Everyone knows.
So, with the development of society, the costs of market promotion, such as the promotion of the market, the cost of presentation of the market, the cost of gifting products, advertising costs, etc. are also increasing.
So manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and the price of the product is also constantly rising, which is actually new products that come with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, but the cost of increasing their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
Some brands, in order to promote their products, unopposedly, link to doctors in hospitals, who assist in the promotion of their products, and make profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan from the hearing.
The relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow this method of operation, which is actually harmful to consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder in a bag with a bag at home, so that you can save costs and increase the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, and there is no effect on young children.
And we should not think that the shelf life of the bag is longer than the bag, if the shelf life of the bag is the same as the one of the bag, just say that it is not easy to save after the bag is unpacked and is easily deformed by the tide.
Delivery was late, the food was cold, it was cold and dry and hard, there was no way to eat it.

Don't scare people at the start line - Xinhua Net
When the book market is open, you can often feel the firebomb of successful school books.
Today's successful academic books, many of which are promoted as the best principles of yoga, are assuming or implying that you can do yoga, and then telling you what you need to do yoga.
It's like saying that you've gone beyond how to do this, the most important and fundamental link.
And because of this, the books have one thing in common: either you do your best with a drum and bass, or you just don't do anything; either it's 100 or it's 0; or you climb Mt. Tai, or you just do it.
This is the best principle. Anyone who sees it will admit that it is correct, but 99% of people will be scared before the start line.
Because this theory is promoted as a path to a 180-degree transformation where you have to be determined to be human again, which is a deadly weakness for many people.
For those who stick to the rules and refuse to change because they stick to the old one, you tend to shout in his ear "You want to change".
The vast majority of people are afraid, unable to stand up and be determined when they see the word "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "turn" or "tur

The biggest problem with the best principles of the door is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limits of the ability of ordinary people, causing the vast majority of people to stare at the door.
Perhaps, the principle of the "good" is the only way that more ordinary people can take the path of relative success.
The core of the principle of the "good times" rule is that the "good times" rule reduces the threshold. The "good times" rule encourages a theory of cumulative small victory as a big victory rule, that if you do not get to 100, you can only get to 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you do not climb Mount Tai, you can only get to 1 because 1 is always greater than 0 and 1 is not equal to 1 because 1 is less than 100 and 1 is less than 100 and 1 is less than 100 because 1 is less than 10 and 1 is less than 10 and 1 is less than 10 because 1 is less than 10 and 1 is less than 10 than 10 and 1 is less than 10 than 10 because 1 is less than 10 and 1 is less than 10 than 10 than 10 than 10 than the average.
In short, as long as you do something, it's always better than not doing it.
The threshold has been significantly lowered, so there is more possibility of making the average person persevere, and the probability of success increases as long as everything persists.
But following the path of success of the good principles of the good principles of the good principles is a little longer.
In short, the best principle of yoga, despite the flag that makes everyone successful on the surface, is ultimately motivating, in fact, a minority; and the best principle of yoga, which can effectively motivate more people and make as many people as possible suffer.

The total amount of raw ore in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tonnes this year.
Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency reported on December 11 that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserve of raw raw materials in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tonnes this year compared to last year, reaching 10.
The naked shark, commonly known as the shark shark, is a valuable fish species unique to the Qinghai lake, and plays a significant role in maintaining the water-fish-bird shark ecological chain safety and biodiversity of the Qinghai lake watershed.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked salmon in Qinghai Lake decreased due to factors such as the massive killing of humans, the increasing degradation of the aquatic environment for the reproduction of the naked salmon. In 2002, the reserve of the naked salmon resources in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Chinese Red List of species in China listed the naked catfish of Qinghai Lake as endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the lake fishery ban, prohibiting any unit, collective and individual from fishing for naked catches in the main rivers and streams of Qinghai Lake and Lake District, and prohibiting the sale of naked catches and their products.
At the same time, measures such as artificial propagation and release flows, cleaning of the main river channels into the lake and designing scientifically sound fish passageways continue to increase the protection capacity, and the reserve of the bare sea resources in the lake increases year after year.
Zhang Lin, deputy director of the Agricultural and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, explained that as of now, Qinghai Lake Naked Chicken has cumulatively implemented nearly 180 million artificial reproductive flows, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of Qinghai Lake Naked Chicken resources.
The Qinghai Three Rivers source region is an important ecological barrier and water resource area in China and Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the desertification of the west and spreads to the east.
To protect the ecological environment of the Yangtze River basin and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and preserve the biodiversity of the Tibetan plateau, Qinghai has issued a notice to ban fishing in the main waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since this year.

The restaurant gave me just one bag to put in the bag, it was cold.
I would like to ask, is the sale in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I wonder if it was leaked or if someone took it from us.
It's been an hour and they haven't sent it yet.
It was too long to see a fake article.
I'll give you a little bit of cop to the unknown man.
Most girls experience their first case break suddenly at some point between the ages of 13 and 15, and close their menstrual cycle around the age of 50.
After that, the physical health is assumed to be more regularly visited once a month.
But it's not the rule to accurately predict, the gap is about a week, and it takes preparation in advance, and sometimes bad luck will overtake the car (suddenly a few days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, and pain level vary from person to person, some for three days, some for a week; some for less blood flow, some for a massive blood clot; some for no reaction, some for an ambulance, and pain will change over time.
The menstrual cycle is uncontrollable, and bleeding 24 hours a day from start to finish can only be done with a towel or a sanitary cotton pad to prevent the flow of blood to the clothing chair.
The pain is mainly due to the secretion of prostate gland, and the period of the physiology is not yet ready for pain.
Before menstruation, the uterus fills with blood and releases too much prostatectin, making it easy to pull the belly.
If it's about to get to the cycle, it's not surprising that it's going to be a long period, basically in two days.
The best thing to do is to replace the towel every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, eliminate sleep time, the worst case is to replace it six times a day, seven days a month, that is 42 pieces, if you add the pre-prepared portion, there may be 50 pieces, not every one.
(If you modify here, the sanitary cotton does not have to be changed regularly, about 5-6 hours can be changed once, up to 8 hours)
The menstrual hormone cycle may be more violent, and the ovulation period may be unstable due to hormonal changes in the body, which is very unstable, and the body gives itself a clutch.
But official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control emotions is still high and will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
The flow is not just blood, it contains the falling out of the uterus.
The inner lining of the uterus is thinner after the end of the menstrual period, and then slowly thickens, and can be understood as a house, every month building a house (the inner lining thickens) ready to welcome guests, guests do not come, all removed (the menstrual discharge) next month and
Menstruation is uncomfortable, for decades, and 24 hours a day every month, bleeding, and back pain, who would?
But a person can be born because his mother came during the menstrual period, and the menstrual period is to prepare you for the 10 months you will be living in the house when you first come to this world, and everyone should thank their mother for the healthy menstrual period.
Many things were suppressed for women in the past, society called brainwashing women dirty and shameful, and people thought it was, but the times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is sickening, that women's bodies are sickening of preparing for life, they should not say in front of the audience in the courtroom, girls stand up, don't think that anymore, never have experienced it, this child will not experience it, and they will not be able to do it again.
Finally, sisters, try the hygiene pads, they really work.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and it's disappointing to make mistakes.

I hope that the shop will be busy and check the product.
Is the foot bathtub bubble and foot sprain leaking?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in health care, and today the Kingdom of Heaven American Writers will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
As people's health awareness increases, the foot bath basin is becoming increasingly popular among consumers, and a large number of different products have emerged in the market, ranging from over one hundred yuan to thousands of yuan.
On the relevant data surface, healthcare households like the foot bath basin sell hot flashes compared to traditional household appliances, but the foot bath basin does not have specialized industry standards, so there are certain safety hazards.
It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electrical water!
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath to give his father as a birthday present, but he felt numbness when he rubbed his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought that the vibration function of the foot bath basin was caused, but he did not think about switching off the vibration function, and his father felt numbness to the bottom of his feet.
Mr. Li tried using an electrical pen, and the pen was lit, and Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the bathtub was electric.
Later, he contacted the businessman, and the businessman's attitude was good, and although he withdrew his bathtub, Mr. Li was still unhappy.
Because he found that this long-popular foot bath is now without a clear industry regulation on setting the highest temperature, which groups of people to use, which materials to guarantee harmlessness, etc.
But in general, the bathtub would not have electricity problems, but it also excludes a few products that are not strictly closed when they go out of production.
So when buying, choose a separate bathtub.
Hydroelectricity is separated, there is no security hazard.
At the same time, you can take the electrical pen at will.
The 13th Provincial Tea Fair opens - Viewpoint headline - The Huangnam Daily Net - China Voice online
The Hunan Daily newspaper reported on December 10th. Full media journalist Zhang Shanwu Hu Hope and correspondent Liu Xiaoping Photographer Li Keen) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Fair will be held in the lake.
Hu Shungli, deputy director of the Council of the China National General Agency for Supply and Sales Cooperation, and Yang Red-Peng, deputy director of the Provincial People's Committee, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Tchaohua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, presented the opening ceremony with a solemnity: the source of the Red Lake is being renewed, and red tea is rising to give new energy to the Chinese tea.
In recent years, the provincial committee and the provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoting the construction of the 100 billion tonnes of tea industry, and forming the development pattern of the Three Three Four Water Color Tea Tea.
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, the main tea-type shift power, such as green tea, black tea, red tea, and the main tea-producing regions have promoted the integration of tea groups, driving a large tea farming increase.
The wind turning and red tea coming back.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after green tea, red tea, black tea, tea farmers have earned revenue in the fourth quarter of the year, and the value of tea gardens production has risen in line.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leadership granted licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises that were granted the right to use the brand name of the Red Tea brand in Yunnan, China, and innovated the source of the Red Tea brand in Yunnan.
In the new Red Tea Showroom, Fujian tea merchants saw one of the high-end teas called "Hong Kong Ice Li" and ordered immediately.
The Secretary General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association Wang Prapra said with pleasure that factors such as the current epidemic more or less affected the tea market, but from the tea fair site, the bright spot was visible.
The innovation of red tea has been a red one, injecting the essence of tea culture, popularity, trade fire, and the tea industry welcomes the new spring.
So if these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I didn't want to, because he couldn't park below, he couldn't get up.

DIN: Congratulations to my friend.
I would like to thank you very much for the humanitarian assistance provided by your friends over the 30+ years since our loved ones were killed, especially since I personally appealed to my friends at home and abroad in early 1994 and until now.
Today, the vast majority of victims' parents are deceased and the orphans have grown up in the family business.
It is your kindness to help these families through the most difficult times.
The coronavirus outbreak is raging globally and most of the donors have retired by the end of the year.
Therefore, I urge you to stop humanitarian donations to the motherhood community of Tian'an, which should have been the perfect slogan for this humanitarian rescue campaign.
I will always remember your love and I firmly believe that your righteous actions will be remembered in history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wish in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
TAO: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32 years of humanitarian relief by the All American Scholarship Federation (IFCSS) and the China Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in Minnesota.
In the process of humanitarian relief, All American Scholars is affiliated with the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation, two organizations that are parallel and project executives often cross paths.

Rescue aid is often not able to reach the six or four people in difficult hands.
In 1994, the teacher suggested that the special group was set up by Mother Liu, who collected and distributed humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "Sixteen orphans education fund", which was implemented 11 years later, and in 2009, after all six orphans graduated from university, the MCDF subsequently established the "Sixteen orphans special needs rescue fund", which has been implemented until
The funding for these projects came mainly from campus and community contributions for the six-year period, generous donations from individuals, and support from the Foundation for Democracy at Brothers College.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Foundation for Labor Research.
It wasn't until last year, 31 years later, that the Six Four finally received a portion of the donation from Hong Kong that year in the name of Six Four.
During this time, the Chinese Human Rights Watch also independently implemented their humanitarian rescue projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding stopped donating for donors, and we are indeed retired elderly people, and income is not as abundant as before retirement, and we thank our dear friend Yang Yang for this letter.
We will respect the decision of the disabled to terminate the project within two years and resume immediately when needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those who have been so generous and courageous for years and who risked delivering humanitarian aid.

The price of the set: 1000 yuan
Thanks to the criticism of the monkey, it was also said that rejecting antique wind is not suitable for antique wind, I didn't think the finished product was just too beautiful.
Thanks to Dandan's recognition, your satisfaction will keep us full of electricity and we will continue to refuel!
This photography studio is really great and I highly recommend all the little partners to come!
There is no challenge from reception, make-up, clothing, lighting, photography to the later.
Makeup artists are especially delicate and will match your style with the one that suits your appearance and make-up.
It is not necessary to say that photography is a fairly professional profession.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere and two kittens are playing with them.
We are working in Beijing, and the movie theaters in Beijing need to line up for the first half of the year, and colleagues have been shooting in Beijing, and watching the finished film feels just so so.
I especially sought this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expressions are poorly managed, and I think this is the short version for most people, and the photographer's brother will grab the picture and record the natural wonders of the moment.
Make-up artists, photographers, later designers, an excellent team.
The film was praised by us and those around us.
Honey has been recommended in the past, and Honey was just as happy to see the ending.
Hopefully, such a studio will not be buried, and more people will discover the ta and take it out in their own style instead of a thousand lines.
Thank you very much for the five star reviews, both of you are very thoughtful and creative newcomers, we are the creative studio, and as long as customers like us we do our best to complete it.
Sweet and caring assistant, and a lively and cheerful photographer teacher, and everyone on the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shot, it was a memorable experience, and the effects of the shoot were much better than I imagined.
Thanks for the comments, it's a blessing to meet you, and our trust is that we have travelled thousands of kilometers from Ho and Phuket to Pyongyang.
How do I get the money?

Now the restaurant staff calls me.
A programming minor who wants to share personal experiences.
If you want to get into this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training, but if you don't have the idea, it's better to learn on your own, after all, training costs a lot of money and takes six months to learn.
But training is indeed a very good option if you are going to get into the industry, especially for those who are self-sufficient and weak.
If you have a stronger self-control, you can choose to learn yourself, but it will be more difficult.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, if we look at the teacher training capacity of this institution, it is meaningless if the teacher training capacity is not strong enough, and of course some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Second, before choosing the training institution, it is best to check out the students who came out of the institution, after all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like, whether the course is good or bad.
Well, actually, I don't know how to answer your question, because there is no definite introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, the profession, age, language you want to learn, and even the city in which you want to study, all have to do with the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and you have not graduated yet, or you have already graduated in computer science, then if there is enough time I personally recommend self-study, which is the least efficient and costly, and many of the online training institutions now are actually good, but it is learning.
But if these were the situations I'm talking about, it would be convenient to learn on your own, and now many learning resources on the web are free, or there are many training resources on site b, and if you can't find resources, you can contact me through a directory to get free resources, or
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video-comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can also pay for some money and time costs of learning, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn, so that learning does not require much effort, teachers explain in detail, and there are questions that are answered specifically, in addition to learning planning or
And now many training institutions sign employment agreements, have internal nominations, recommend to companies after studying, so that the interview link for finding a job can save a lot.
These are some of my views, which I said before because I don't understand your situation, so it's probably not very detailed, and if you have other questions, you can contact me anytime for communication.
I said I arrived before 1am and I saw it on the app.

Since there is no escape, it is better to face it openly.
The more you are afraid, the more difficult it will be to overcome; if you face the problem, the problem will eventually be solved.
Chinese curators are working together to host Saudi Arabia's first Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary Art - Xinhua Net
Saudi Arabia's first Biennial of Contemporary Art, the Xiang Dileier Biennial Exhibition, was held on 11 December in Dilei, northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
The biennial exhibition was co-organized by the Saudi Diary Biennial Exhibition Foundation and the UCCA Yulens Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Tadeo Yu, the curator of the UCCA Yulens Center for Contemporary Art in China, as artistic director.
According to the curator team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Touch the Stone and Cross the River", which metaphorizes the reform strategy taken during the period of socio-economic transformation and reflects the current situation in Saudi socio-cultural development.
The exhibition covers almost 12,000 square meters and the exhibition hall is presented in six units: "Touch the stone across the river".
Among them, the work of 27 Saudi artists accounts for more than a quarter of the total exhibition, encompassing various forms of painting, installation art and performance art; the work of 12 Chinese artists is also of great interest, some artists using recycled materials in a novel way.
Barclay, CEO of the Diary Biennial Foundation, said he hopes the biennial will create international dialogue and give global audiences an opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industry and creative community and strengthen interaction.
Tan Yu said: "The dual objective of the biennial exhibition is to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art".
It is understood that during the opening week of the biennial event, a series of lectures will be held, and artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Unified rules for rural public-benefit job management - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Qingming December 12, 2020 (Reporter Linh Li) To continue to work to help the poverty-stricken population in employment, consolidate the expansion of the achievements of the poverty-stricken struggle, Yunnan Province has launched a policy to promote rural revitalization and rural public benefit positions management, and help
The relevant officials of Yunnan Provincial People's Chamber explained that at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 44.83 million rural public benefit jobs to accommodate rural hard-working groups such as the poverty-free labour force, helping the poverty-free population achieve employment growth.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments, including Yunnan People's Association, Rural Rejuvenation and Finance, and are mainly unified in terms of the scope of objects, fund management, job development, job management, and other aspects of recruiting rural public service personnel at grassroots levels.
In terms of position development settings, the new regulations clarify, according to the principle of person-defined, dynamic management, total control, who develops, who uses, who is responsible for the development and the development of the platform, voluntary publicity, and unified management.
The recruitment process must be conducted in accordance with the announcement, declaration, audit, disclosure, hiring, pre-apprenticeship training and appointment arrangements.
In addition, the new regulations clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development sector for rural public service jobs, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public service jobs, and stipulate that each rural public service job development sector should be placed in rural public service jobs.
The address is wrong.
Hello, my name is
Cancellation of orders
I reordered
Has it been cancelled?
Second, although the right has a long history, it is not long, so short because the sun shines brightly and the water is sweaty when the child drinks a little; a little bit of a desire to look at the eye and be struck with a blow will disappear.
But the reality is that the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right in ending the standards of truth defined by culture, developing the economy and improving technology, and promoting political institutionalization and human rights protection should not be denied.
Third, as for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Wei Dong's statements, I care about him and respect him very much; because he is serious, he is serious about China and he is serious about China's social issues.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, and I think that revolution is against necessity, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, loss of life, political groups being thrown into the mud and the foreigners are taking advantage of it.
Fourth, to change or improve China requires patience and responsibility for the country and its people. Political speculation is trying to take the chaste out of the fire, it is not the right, it is a jerk.
We'll talk again.
The left is a band of the era and politics.
If the right has positive meaning for society and the Communist Party will listen to the right when needed and analyze their ideas, then the left is not made up, because the left wants the crap the Communist Party throws away!
Five, recently seeing some friends with their feedback, throwing left and right, and it's still very real, I feel like it's not necessary.
Don't try to talk about the abuse and the left-wing, they are all a mystery, it is pointless.
And don't try to prove us right, and don't think about getting feedback and leftists to admit it.
I told my friends: when feedback curses you, when the leftist curses your right dog, it just proves that our middle way is right!
Many people have ideals when they are young, and when they get older, they forget the ideal or pursue the ideal, but become paranoid.
Ideals are gradually moving away, and even the killer boy eventually becomes a villain.
On the one hand, I think that generally refers to constraints and freedom, and the Chinese culture should be left-leaning because of the inherent genes in China from historical culture.
The right-wing in the country is free, focusing on efficiency and development, the left is strengthening regulation, and more focus on fairness and security.
Now society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness, while China and the US are fighting, the left is positive, and estimates are that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, the compliment is over.
And I didn't say that flowers are the meaning of war.
In recent years, the blockade and siege of Huawei's chips by the US government has not only plunged Huawei into unprecedented difficulty, but also caused huge losses for the Chinese-American chip company.
Meithi pressured the Chinese chip industry, demanding that its own companies and allied companies simultaneously block Chinese chip industry, and the direct consequence was that orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, causing chip production companies to lose their business.
Today, the lack of chips has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies, mobile phones, and almost all industries that use chips are severely affected.
To gain the autonomy of silicon chips, tech giants in more and more countries are starting to take the road to silicon.
To firmly control global semiconductor control, curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, recently the US has been acting frequently, and hosted the Xi'an Chip Summit; and invited 64 national giants to form a semiconductor alliance and withdraw funds to support the United States.
While most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on the power grid, and it was likely to steal the power grid's steam bowl.
This is so certain because Intel, as the tech giant of the old MeT brand, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, with a large team of talent and technical reserves, must rise quickly in the short term and beat the Taiwan Electricity.
However, the decision by Intel was not taken lightly by Taipei Electric founder Zhang Zhengshi.
At the 2021 Masters Think Tank Forum held in April, Zhang Zhengqi spoke surprisingly, and he was clear about Intel's move to invest in the Wave Factory.
Zhang Zhengjiang's dislike of Intel's wave of advances is because Zhang Zhengjiang's complaint about the power grid and Intel more than 30 years ago is still alive.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the jewel in the manufacturing industry, the global peak, and the dominant player in the world semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chips were held by a small minority of powerful people.
The semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips from design, manufacture to sealing were made by a factory, Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has left some small businesses burdened, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face the enormous cost of building production lines.
Under the guise of market demand, after the 1980s, the phenomenon of division of labor cooperation began to appear in the chip industry. In 1984, Zhang Zhengqi heard that there were companies that specialized in designing chips, and thought that since there was specialized design, then a special one could be created for wavelength systems.
Soon after, Zhang Zheng's vision became reality and the electricity was born.
Taichung Electric focused its main business on the single link of the wafer processing chain, not on design, but on providing substitutes for wafer manufacturing.
The newly created Taiyu Electric was a small one in front of the giant Intel.
Zhang Zhengjiajie sought investment from Intel to gain capital support, but when Intel heard that TC was only a manufacturing link in the chip industry, it was obvious that some people were too self-assured to look at TC, and decidedly rejected it.
Zhang Zhenghua also said that Intel was a low-cost wavelength system service at the time.
I didn't think that the giant of wafer manufacturing services would not look like it at the time, but now they will also start doing wafer substitution.
So Zhang Zhenghui felt that it was ironic that Intel entered the Wave of Transformation.
Today, the market value of the electricity is more than Intel.
In the face of the massive attack of the Taipei Electricity, Intel naturally does not dare to stand firm.
Today, congestion is now on the rise for 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
Trying to catch up is not easy.
I can't wait.
By 19:06, it's two hours before the order.
Today we're going to see some weird hot flashes.
What is normal ambiguity?
Randomly select three hot searches: February's Dragon Rise, the Good Friendship Price, the Lan Lanella event, the spread of the sentiment forms a wave peak, then the index of the fluid decreases.
They look very different from the model of evolution of the web-based situation that the Internet Trust Office has shown.
What is an abnormal mood?
Randomly selected six hot searches from the same event, which showed solitary peaked, concave, and cliff-like peaks.
The single peak heat is heat-up by humans, quickly boiling the heat, which generates public attention; the single peak heat is periodic heating, ensuring the topic plate is hot; the single cliff heat is collective evacuation, which plays the full function of the heat.
In Figure 9, the heatwave of one event is the wave valley of another event, and the time is not too short, it must be the unified batch of Marines that gets the task and starts a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches are listed simultaneously, which attract attention, which are responsible for the COP, which are the driving forces, which shift views, which affect cognition, which mislead judgments, which are the main reasons for the change.
Communication is a science, and all subjective factors of attitude and emotion are left out, and nothing can be shaped by objective data and black public relations.
Anyone who passes must leave a mark, and such a mark, we dig together.
Data source: Hot search time machine.
Cases of infection with the Omicron strain were first detected in countries such as Mauritius - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency Beijing on December 12 reported that the first cases of infection with the coronavirus variant, the Omicron strain, were reported in Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently.
Mauritius reported two cases of infection with the Omicron strain for the first time on 10th.
According to Maor Health Minister Kaleysh Jagutpal, one infected person was traveling from South Africa to Mauritius on November 27; another infected person was a local resident of Mauritius who had recently travelled with a man.
After hospital isolation, the results of the nucleic acid tests of the two infected people turned negative and have now returned to their respective residences.
The Ministry of Health announced on 10th that three cases of infection with the Omicron strain were confirmed for the first time in the country.
The three were students, who returned from a trip abroad earlier this month, and were not admitted to hospital due to their mild condition.
The Serbian government has stepped up its efforts to prevent the spread of the Olympic strain of the drug.
Passengers aged 12 and over who enter the country by plane will have to pay for a nuclear acid test at the airport after they are blocked from December 6 to January 10 next year.
The Ministry of Health also announced on 10th that the vaccine against coronavirus will be started for children aged 5 to 11 years in the country.
Malawi's Health Minister Kunbize Chibanda said on 9th that the country has detected three cases of infection with the Omic acid strain for the first time.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing on 12 new coronavirus positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found the three cases of infection.

Receiving is a money stomach
The order is a claw.
Okay, the phone is #PHONENUMBER#
Do I need to stay in the dialogue?
I called your staff and explained it.
Your riders told me the address was too far away.
360 integrated home furnishings
Address: Happy Home, 156 South Street, 12th floor
Initially, it was introduced by friends because of the trust, so I chose to look at my budget at the beginning of 70,000 for basic repairs.
They came to the store and started a series of tricks.
I first went to the store and just showed them my layout, they didn't go to the field and measure the house, and they could give me an offer that my 135 houses, 70,000, could be arranged, and probably show me their materials and I don't know what they are doing.
Their second trick is that you'll drag your money back as long as you get to the store, and once you've given it back, you're never going to get out unless you have enough experience to fight them theoretically.
When I hesitate to deposit, they invite their manager to tell you how much we can give you if you deposit today.
This is a big crater, and I am the example of someone who was deceived alive and paid over 10,000 dollars when his mind was pulled.
He offered me a lot of questions, 70,000 not including hydroelectric conversion, not including any doors and cabinets, bathrooms, and these three are the main cost of basic equipment.
In addition to these services, their fees are higher than other companies.
I lost confidence in the company and nothing was clear at the beginning, so I signed the contract.
When I went to get them back, they looked very experienced and had a small team to deal with you.
They are absolutely innocent of the fact that the customer's problem is that they will bite to death anyway.
The various responsibilities of removal, and many details, without mentioning anything else, are not to be chosen, because my friends found the house they repaired is also of poor quality, and the end result will cost you everything.
The craters, which were the headpieces of the crooks, have now been transformed into great beauty, as if they were closed and turned into something else.
So don't choose a repair company like this.
Then, when you choose, check out these tips and advice because the repair is not cheap.
To ask the businessman, please register or register first.
It is strictly forbidden to publish any form of business criticism, please see the details of the business collector statement
The Qumming Decorative Design Channel provides you with the latest business information such as the address, phone, business hours of 360 integrated homes in the United States, find the decoration company and find the decoration company.
It's so terrifying, if you don't get there in 30 minutes, cancel your order!
Is there no other way, like changing the address?
Okay, then you don't cancel this conversation, and if you don't return my money in 5 to 10 days, you must be held accountable.
I asked if it could be cancelled in less than 15 minutes.
The mouthwash should be ripe, but the meat is still raw and cannot be eaten.
The meteor shower of the constellation of Jupiter and Jupiter is expected to be a huge event on the 14th day.
News Agency Tianjin December 12th, "Journalist Zhou Zhen" Astronomical Cooperation expert introduced that as the last large meteor shower of the year, the twin meteor shower, one of the three largest meteor shower in the Northern Hemisphere, will be launched on December 14th.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast An Kuok shot the twin meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most meteor showers are periodic comets, but the twin meteor showers are the asteroid Fae, a Apollo asteroid.
The twin meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not to be conceived by a comet.
The director of the Astronomical Society of Tianjin, Astronomical Cooperative expert Zhu Liang, explained that, like the big movie of the year, the twin meteor showers usually appear at the end of the year.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and together with the meteor shower and the meteor shower of the equator, the meteor shower of the northern hemisphere is known as the three largest meteor shower.
A notable feature of the meteor shower is that the meteor body is slow, colorful, and flaming, and is suitable for both the naked eye and beginners in astronomical photography.
The twin meteor shower was shot in Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's meteor shower in the Twin Cities will be extremely large, extremely large at around 15:00 on December 14, ZHR. Under ideal observation conditions, the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiation point is located just above the top of the head is ideal.
The chart of the Gemini meteor shower recommendation index.
Last year, the twin meteor shower that fell in the last few pounds left people impressed, but this year's twin meteor shower will be interrupted by moonlight and the magnificence will be a bit discounted.
On November 11, the moon is relatively convex, and bright moonlight interferes with observation, so the moon will fall at midnight, when the radiation point of the meteor shower will rise much higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe the moon during the last half of the night, but be careful to keep warm.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city, so you can choose a high altitude, light-small, northeast-facing viewpoint in the suburbs or rural areas, and wait patiently until the moon falls, so you can observe.
It is worth noting that the flow of meteor showers in each direction is large, so that the observation does not have to look at the radiation points of the meteor showers.
Friends who like photography want to shoot beautiful meteor shower shots. It is best to choose wide angle, large lens, using high ISO and maximum lens when shooting.
Based on stability and sustainability considerations, tripod, spare battery and fast gate line are also essential.
He warned that the people of the country should not be allowed to go to the polls.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV that the subject is talking about should refer to LCD TV, while laser TV and LCD TV differ in market positioning mainly in the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the big screen market.
Laser TV is clearly more focused on the big screen market than the fully open market position of LCD TV, or laser TV itself is a product of the big screen.
Currently, mainstream LCD TV sizes range from 55 inches to 65 inches, while laser TV sizes are generally over 75 inches, with the largest being over 100 inches, which fully satisfy the user's demand for large screen coloring power.
In recent years, the share of laser TVs in global shipments and sales has been increasing, accounting for over 60% of total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to China Tech's forecast, the laser TV market will grow by more than 140% in 2020, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason for such good performance in the big screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in the field of eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV long reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly shine into the eye, compared to the back light source of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation produced by the eye is more.
Experts in ophthalmology at the Chinese Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization, Sai Si Laboratory and Beijing Association Hospital, conducted rigorous comparison tests of laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions as the population, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms: Laser TVs do have strong eye protection properties and even have some improvement in certain aspects.
In a time when vision health is increasingly valued, laser TV has not only attracted more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opened another breakthrough in the color electricity market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the constantly declining price of LCD TVs, the market price of laser TVs currently sold is over 10,000 yuan, and the price gradually rises with the upgrading of size and light source.
Why is laser TV selling so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
With the constant development of light sources and technical levels, laser TV has many advantages that neither liquid crystal TV nor projection can achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, laser TVs have shorter projection distances compared to traditional projection equipment, can achieve a 100-inch screen experience within short distances, the space required is small, and the host is small, occupying a lot of space.
In terms of brightness, the big brand laser TV can reach more than 2,000 flashes.
In addition, the heat is lower, the equipment is less wasteful, and the TV has a longer service life.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with real 4K ultra-high resolution imaging quality, artificial intelligence systems, life-imaging screens and many other cutting-edge technologies that can bring a more shocking visual and audio experience to users.
It is not about fake demand, but about products that are segmented by demand, about the quality of painting and the output input, laser TV is not the dish of the video player, want to take care of the big screen and watch the environment is not enough, can try, everything is good and bad, weighing and judging yourself.
Simply put, ultra-wide angle close-focus projection machines - laser TVs - had to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors to close to the canvas, which did not match the best optical design.
To shield some of the ambient light, finer canvases with a microstructure are expensive, and the 80-inch price can basically replace a 65-inch liquid crystal.
And one thing I especially hate about projectors is that they take a good reflection on the eyes, and that's the point of sale. Please, the light on the canvas that the eye can see is direct light for the eyes. You reflect it to the ceiling, and the eyes can see.
And if the projection screen wasn't a reflection, it wouldn't be like this at all.
It is difficult to see the effect of high-increased-screen cloth heat spots, which reflects a large amount of light to the eyes from one angle.
The VMA photography studio has a superior quality store, but there is no branch yet.
In addition to the date of the appointment, Miss Sissy sent me a selectable schedule to respond to the information in a timely manner.
I went to see the shops before, and more of them were outdoor wedding dresses, and the pictures were beautiful, and there were many different styles involved.
After that day, she and Miss Siss simply shared her ideas, and very patiently helped me try on two sets of styles I had tangled up, finally finishing up the makeup pattern.
But maybe because I didn't share specific ideas, it wasn't the style I wanted, but it should be good looking.
After the shoot, the photographer will help pick the photos, communicate the style of the later, and feel very careful.
The repair takes about half a month and the effect is sitting.
For the second time, the main part of the clothes of the whole house, which included the photographic category of the Yang Wang dinner event, could be chosen for one shot.
Finally, choose a black shade and experience different styles.
The whole shooting process took about 2 hours, make-up + took place, and the photographer responsible for shooting was the brother after 95, feeling a little more favorable, hoping to give more advice later on in terms of guiding the customers to shoot the action.
The VHB Photography Gallery selected quality shop reply
It's on the front page, and come and see Queen.
The first thing to do is fill out the name and phone, then choose the dress, wedding dress can be chosen, change three or four sets of clothes is still very patient, make-up after selection is long, service attitude is good, and later photography will teach you how to shape, which is to shoot.
The overall environmental impact of the pump is good.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are almost three makeup locations, and there is a camera shed inside.
The service was enthusiastic and careful.
The fashion designer is very patient.
The photographer will also take your moves seriously.
Not satisfied, the photographers will also actively submit sub-shots.
The experience molding may have gone a bit overboard, and the two-eyed skin was attached to the three-eyed skin.
The eyebrows were shaved, and it was a bit embarrassing not to paint the eyebrows every day.
The photos were given ten days ago, but the Pt effect was not satisfactory, and the feeling of the eyelids being glued to them was still evident.
Because it was not clear which style to try, two sets were chosen and picked or the black dress was chosen.
After choosing the right clothes, I started to get hairstyled. The hairdresser and the makeup artist's sister were super patient and were very happy with the result.
After getting my hair done, I started taking pictures, and the photographers were all over the place, directing me to pose.
After filming, the four favorite ones were chosen carefully, and when the film was finished, the younger brother said that the final 15 were very satisfying.
I haven't responded for 3 days... I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee scheme because your system can't recognize my credit card!
The strangest thing is that every time I pay, I use the same credit card.
I now have to pay for shipping every time.
Can I get an exemption before you can charge me for my monthly fee after the investigation?
The little rainbow bought insurance, is it reliable?
Small Rainbow is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the setting conditions: According to the regulations of the regulatory body of the insurance brokerage company of Liang (revised in 2015) Liang tips to become an insurance brokerage company must meet three key words: shareholders, issuers have no major violation record in the last 3 years, the minimum limit is $50
These three things are really demanding, and in conclusion, it is necessary to have strength, to be approved by the national authority of the national insurance company, to regulate the national insurance company, to banking, to have good behavior as a small insurance broker.
In this respect, it is good and worth trusting.
From the insurance product perspective: Small Rainbow Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' star health insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest up-and-coming and Thai Super Mario 5 health insurance, claimants and guarantors are both and
From the payment model: products of the Internet platform, because of the lower operating costs of business websites, and the cost of wages for business employees, Internet products are generally priced higher, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payments.
This is still very good.
We can consider.
From the perspective of the professionalism of the businessman: this is especially important because insurance is a very strong industry that requires specialization, and many customers of Internet products can insure themselves, there are many mistakes in health information and profession.
I myself have been selling insurance phones at Tencent Micro Insurance (and like Little Rainbow, which is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is true and reliable, and it is not reliable, the Internet channel has no professional practitioners and there are many sales misguided.
For example, 1 yuan insurance policy, 6 million yuan insurance policy, buying insurance to send mobile phones, free of charge to receive 60,000 pounds of sickness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoiding weight is light, and will not tell investors that 1 yuan in January and next month need to be received according to normal income.
In order to spend a penny, the insurance company lost 6 million dollars.
Free delivery of mobile phones is the last ticket number, such as 6666, 8888, and if the prize message is sent, no one is reminded of it.
(This is another pit for the insurer) to get 60,000 pounds of health insurance free, is short term, if only this, without other business risks, if serious illness occurs, 60,000 can do, solve the problem, and life afterwards begins to run barefoot.
The country is also struggling to crack down on misguided Internet insurance sales.
So overall, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the professionalism and professional practice of the business staff.
The suggestion is that the subject matter should be considered carefully, in fact, many of the products of online insurance brokers are broader, customers have more opportunities and products to choose from, and some products have a better price than Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet clients to guarantee the products under the line, saving 2000-3000 yuan per year for each person.
If you have any questions, welcome to communicate and exchange with me.
I am a Minia insurance broker, with 3 years of enterprise management training experience, serving nearly 1,000 enterprise users, collaborating with more than 100 insurance companies, and I will start from the customer's needs before investing in insurance.
Growing up with each client for life.
I hope my answer helps the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance is insurance business where the insurer can independently complete all insurance processes by clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, nor does the insurance advisor need to sign, and all the steps can be done by the insurer independently.
Although the Internet insurance policy has little ritual feel, and perhaps even no paper contracts in printed form, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of electronic contracts.
This model is somewhat similar to the flow line operation of selling pumps, but so buying insurance can also be a fatal problem, which is that the service that follows the pump may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades, and when we buy insurance, we should think seriously about whether this medium we choose is one that can accompany us for a long time and will provide us with it many years later.

The refund code is available.
No problem, remember that there is no need to arrange for a return, I bought another one and I don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of contempt and slander, and I cannot accept such acts of physical assault.
In a civilized society, we can include everything, but only to suppress this villain.
This is an uncivilized approach that should be first resisted if we do not look at political parties and factions.
From the time you started sending Facebook friend requests, to posting compelling posts, to trying to post what I call my home and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-response attitude.
You have become more and more aggressive not only by the frequency of six meals a day, but also by talking about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, and talking about some of the hidden, humiliating remarks about me, my appearance, my looks, my good looks, my life and my life.
I later received comments from friends about your Facebook friend account that uploaded a photo of you and sexual harassment ingredients.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't keep my mouth shut anymore.
After I uploaded the news of the police, you are completely out of the loop, but you are more and more excited.
I don't care what political background you have or what status you have, in our society, it is a matter of bi-gender respect.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of conniving, concealing, humiliating, insulting talk, you can continue to say that you just care and care about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your idea or you can continue to publish all the attacks.
No, I can't, and I have no power to stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and I don't need your judgement on my appearance and personality.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to let others humiliate themselves so much to make a name for themselves.
A friend asked me, is it okay?
I said good, and you wouldn't believe it either.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like this.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who lack even basic qualities will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the human heart.
I cut off some of the comments for everyone to comment on.
You should not be allowed to pretend to be your own poster.
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization.
I'll smile with my heart

The most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-layered pro-China media multi-layered report: China-US relations latest news: the latest satellite images show that three US carriers are gathering around China; US media also reported that the Chinese
According to China's think tank, the Strategic Situation Perception Platform in the South China Sea, on January 9, the satellite discovered the USS Carl Vinson, a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, near the Strait of Barabakh.
The Barabakh Strait connects the South Sea and the Suez Sea, and is a strategic point on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform expects the tanker, the Junker Vinson, to go to South Sea deployment.
This was the first deployment of the Jenkins Vinson-class aircraft carrier with F-35C fighter aircraft and CMV-22 Jenkins-class cargo carriers.
The U.S. military aircraft carrier, now floating up the Pacific, in addition to the USS Carl Vinson, is also the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3.
The Lincoln class also carried the F-35C carrier squadron, which was affiliated with the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers, the US Navy currently deploys the USS Ronald Reagan, a cargo ship based in Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the Jump-class cruiser, the Jump-class cruiser, and the Jump-class destroyer, the Jump-class Stokdar.
The most powerful aircraft carrier is rarely seen around China. On January 17, 2022, the Strategic Situation Perception Platform for the South China Sea released the latest satellite images showing three U.S. carriers are gathering around China.
(WBTO@South China Strategic Situation Understanding) US carriers have assembled the most powerful weapons around China rare visit Guam on January 17, 2022, the US military cargo transport aircraft CMV-22B flight route.
(Weebly@South Sea Strategic Situation Understanding) According to the US cable news network CNN, on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam over the weekend.
The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US Naval Base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The US-based carrier, which is gathering the most powerful weapons around China, rarely visits Guam. Analysis says this sends a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The US-based carrier is gathering the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam. China has built a large military facility in the Nansa Islands in recent years.
It is a permanent summer island in the Nansa Islands of China.
(South Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the USS Naval Warfare, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine, strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region during this visit to Guam, demonstrating the capabilities, flexibility, and readiness of the United States, and the importance of India.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as the Thunderbolt submarine, or Boomer submarine.
The whereabouts of 14 lightning-powered submarines in the US Navy are generally kept strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding the ballistic missile submarine makes the Thunderbird submarine the most important survival weapon in the nuclear fusion triad, which also includes launch-well ballistic missiles in the U.S. mainland, and portable nuclear weapons such as the B-2 and B-52.
Speaking to friends about the recent 26 percent drop in Meta, the market value evaporated by $251 billion, Zuckerberg replied, "Facing unprecedented competition", why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, whose revenue comes mainly from advertising, and the advertising company that makes money today is itself a channel for traffic.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc., whatever the feature positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest ad league, with many apps outsourcing Meta ads, and Meta's advertising platform is transforming.
But the times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta has difficulty retrieving user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is user friendly and will clearly indicate whether users allow the App to access their information, and most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google does a little more, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened.
Everyone knows that Meta does not have a business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China each year, mainly from companies that do maritime business in China.
Meta has about a hundred people in its Hong Kong office, and several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets, and Meta is a bypassed advertising channel, and most of the burning money is given to Meta.
Interestingly, TT bytes are now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta has been making a lot of money from bytes for the past two years.
Across the country, agents are going to Meta to advertise bytes, and Meta's performance in Greater China is good.
I haven't been specifically educated lately, but it certainly won't be better than before.
The stage of large-scale money burning by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of the new traffic channels is not going well.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in revenue, but the lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets look not only at middle income, but more importantly at what the future expects.
It is clear that Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg spoke about the myth of the microcosm.
The ex-universe should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the ex-universe's realization cycle is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a more difficult time for Meta.
Facebook is now very stylish, with annual revenues of $100 billion to $20 billion, and Facebook is in fact very crisis-sensitive, and there is nothing safe about it compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although some of his social software is now more dynamic and mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook has no confidence in the rapid development of tiktok, and the disruption is a blink of an eye.
The idea of the superuniverse, which is so promising and so unattainable, has no hope of success in a short time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and is the fundamental reason for constantly looking for new tracks, but I think that the company is very different from the company that we know today.
