A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead this week in the stairwell of a local shopping mall.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, and said that everything was finally fine.
The San Francisco Coroner's Office said the body found Wednesday morning in the Sitta shopping center confirmed the identity of Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old San Francisco resident.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled his death and an investigation is underway.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a tap cook in Boston, had found the ideal job as a tap cook at Sons & Daughters in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were shocked by Frank's death.
The spokesperson said, "We are a small team of people who are close together like a family and we will miss him very much".
At this sad moment, we express our deepest condolences and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially lived in the inn, but recently everything has finally been fine.
Louis Galicia told KGO: Frank found an apartment while dating a girl.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to hurt his brother.
Frank has a kind heart and a broad heart.
Louis Galicia: "Frank often cooks dinner for his family".
He never wants to argue with his family.
He is a man who follows everyone's opinions.
Louis Galicia said: "Everything in the world can go wrong, but Frank describes himself as a man who shines out every day".
Those with clues can call the San Francisco Police Department at 415-575-4444.
Strike of primary doctors: Call for new labor action
Primary doctors representatives called on the union to approve its new labor action against new contract disputes.
The Board of Primary Doctors of the British Medical Association will ask all its members to start supporting more labour movements from the beginning of September.
The Primary Doctors Committee said that the ministers had not addressed concerns about the contract.
Primary doctors and medical students voted in July to boycott the contract deal with the British Medical Association.
Among the members who participated in the vote, 58% opposed the contract deal.
Ellen McCourt, chair of the Primary Physicians Committee, said in a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday night that the government has always remained silent on the issue of causing contracts to be boycotted.
She said: "In light of this, the Executive Committee of the Primary Physicians Committee has voted unanimously to reject the proposed new contract and called for a formal consultation on all concerns again".
In response to the government's silence, the Executive Committee of the Primary Physicians' Committee has formally requested today that the British Medical Association Council convene a special meeting to approve a long-term plan to upgrade labour action starting in early September.
The dispute has led to six strikes by primary doctors this year, including the first full strike in the history of the UK's national healthcare system.
Dr Johann Malawana, leader of the British Medical Association's primary physician, resigned after a vote boycotted the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the British Medical Association.
In a meeting before the 54,000 primary doctors and medical students voted, he told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be mandatory for healthcare workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: Does the Hungarian Gendarmerie not join the alliance?
One gesture ends a crisis.
Russia met with the Turkish leaders on Tuesday, where they shook hands and officially announced the end of the eight-month-long war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin met the Turkish president in the Golden Hall of the St Petersburg Palace, I had a strong feeling that this reconciliation was what Ankara wanted to see.
Yes, both sides did shake hands.
However, even by Mr. Putin's one-sided guilt criteria, Putin smiled and barely expressed his enthusiasm.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan reportedly mentioned his good friend, Mr. Putin, five times.
I don't remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia will return to the level before the crisis, and even higher.
The next day, a newspaper wrote that Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
But I think his enthusiasm suggests something quite opposite.
However, Mr. Putin's continued coldness shows that he has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in the opening credits was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was fierce at the time.
Mr. Putin lashed out at the incident, accusing Ankara of plotting Moscow behind it.
Attacks from so-called friends make it harder to accept.
It is difficult, even impossible, for both sides to rebuild true trust.
Since November, Russian public opinion has also been reversed.
For months, government-controlled media have carried out a shocking full-scale attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
The most serious of these was allegations from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's family profited from illegal oil transactions in the so-called Islamic State-controlled Syrian region.
He has firmly denied this claim.
However, the news from St Petersburg shows that it is time to look ahead.
After all, the premise of this meeting was that Putin received an apology from Turkish President Erdogan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the truce are obvious.
First, Erdogan was in danger of being ousted after the failed coup last month, so he needs the support of all his friends.
The relentless terrorist attacks have obviously caused a huge blow to him.
At the same time, there are economic motives.
Russian sanctions are a major blow to Turkey, especially banning the charter service that can transport millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
This figure has dropped sharply by almost 90%.
As flights resume, Russian travel agencies and charter companies will be relaxed.
They will be the launching pad for Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
The national TV station even predicted this week that the prices of fruits and vegetables would fall once Turkish agricultural imports were reopened.
A report in Moscow newspaper Vedemosti said: "The tourists have gone, the tomatoes have returned".
For Moscow, this visit has added political value.
Ankara is angry at the weak reaction of the Western world to the intention to take over.
In addition, Ankara was unhappy with the slow progress in joining the EU negotiations and Putin's long-term interference, and Putin was keen to exploit political coldness and weaken Turkey's relations with the Western world.
The Russian leaders will surely get Ankara's share because they supported the elected authorities after the coup failed.
Note that this is a gift to Moscow, which has always had a deep-seated fear of the regime.
Thus, the meeting held in this golden seaside palace made Russia and Turkey allies of two countries rejected and abused by the Western world, which one analyst described as a non-aligned country.
However, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors. Moscow has recently played a role in Syria, while Russia and Turkey support the opposite faction.
It can be predicted that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said at the conference that they had not yet discussed the topic.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided the issue of differences between the two sides, while Putin emphasized.
The two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to seek consensus on the Syrian issue.
It is certainly a good thing for leaders of both countries to resume dialogue once again, given the possibility of months of public hostility brought about by the downing of Russian warplanes by Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the possibility of causing a major disaster.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank will be simplified into a logistics department.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC's Scotland branch that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand was committed to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago, he was facing bankruptcy and had to accept rescue and from that moment on, he gave up pursuing that.
During that time, brand strategists used the RBS brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds to sponsor international sporting events in ways such as Rugby Six Nations and Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right thing to do is to let more national brands come forward.
Royal Bank of Scotland will use it for Scottish customers, but not as original.
In England and Wales, all the tiff outside the headquarters and securities trading will be changed to National West Bengal Bank.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used by customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that stand out, such as Guo Capital Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a visit by clients and staff in Invernessshire.
He told the BBC's Scotland branch: "The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and one of the employee brands, because in a larger sense we are now a bank with many brands".
As the bank itself became an international brand, RBS became a global brand.
For now, what I want to say is that we no longer focus on the global, we have turned our eyes to the domestic.
Each brand represents a different industry, and our employees serve customers through different brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championship; at the same time, efforts have been made to raise the image of different brands sponsoring sporting events.
"It's time to become a multi-brand bank because privately we've been exploring how to become a bank that better serves customers", the CEO said.
If we were to become a large bank with many brands three years ago, we would be ridiculed.
We are focusing on customer needs now, and I am sure you have noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands, and now is the right time.
DeTuri has won 3,000 career victories with Predilection in Newmarket.
Newmarket's two wins helped Daytree win 3,000 career wins, after which he splashed champagne to celebrate
On Friday, professional rider Frankie Dettori took his 3,000th win at Newmarket.
He was able to get his Predilection on the track, which was a practice by John Gosden, and he won two races that night, bringing his career to 3,000 wins.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional rider to achieve this milestone in the field of flat-land racing.
The top five are: Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
"It's special", said Daituri, the three-time champion rider who won the Ghayyar earlier.
I was excited because my family was also there.
I am happy with my achievements at Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
This is not a large-scale race, nor is it Royal Ascot, but it is just a regular Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I am happy and humble.
DeTuri came to Predilection after winning, which caused a stir.
In the field of obstacle racing, two riders achieved this feat, the champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, with over 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Berge is a nine-time German champion, having won a total of 4,493 games in his career
DeTourie is one of the greatest riders of his time, so it is no wonder that he achieved this milestone, and few people have achieved this before him.
He is fashionable and fit, but what really made him stand out in the weight room was his tactical rationalness.
He is an amazing ambassador for horse racing, and his passion and charm for the sport has attracted a large fan base over the years.
A few weeks ago, I told DairyTuri at Epsom that if he hadn't just had a weekend with the racing driver, he should have won 6,000 races already!
To be honest, it is very important that DeTourie is the best British horse winner in 30 years.
He is lively, which is good for British racehorses, but beyond that, he is an incredible rider.
DeTuri celebrates this milestone with his iconic jump and horse action
From the jump line to the jump horse, for two decades, DeTourney has been a typical representative of the British flat racing scene.
His career was like riding a mountain bike.
He won several races, including the famous win at the Royal Scottish Rally Championship in 1996, but he also suffered a crash and was banned from racing for taking a banned substance.
Three years ago, when he returned to the field after a six-month ban, he was once very hard-working. However, he showed amazing personality strength and finally returned to the top, giving a first shot to those who were skeptical.
He may not be able to do it for too long, as Dundee Turley had said before, that he hopes to compete at least until he is 50.
Russian President Putin removed Sergey Ivanov from office as director
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly removed Sergei Ivanov from his position as Director of the Presidential Office.
For years, Mr Ivanov has been part of the core group that Mr Putin trusts deeply.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr. Putin had announced the removal of Ivanov from the office of the Russian president, but gave no reason.
Anton Vaino, who started as Mr Ivanov's deputy in 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. Waino is 44 years old and a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he managed the draft of the president and government employees, the Kremlin website says.
After his appointment, he said to Mr. Putin: "Thank you for your trust.
I think the most important task of this government is to support the heads of state in drafting laws and implementing control orders.
Mr. Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself had asked to resign and recommended Mr. Waino to take over.
Is this kind of smile convincing?
Moscow is not comfortable with this move.
Sergey Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest aides, and like Putin, he worked in the KGB.
As the director of the office, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin broadcast on national television, both claimed that the director of the office had asked for his resignation.
Despite the smile on his face, almost no one convinced him, especially in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
So, is this a result of a defeat in a power struggle?
We have not yet learned.
However, the official statement that the electorate who was considered a presidential candidate suddenly chose to rule Russia's environmental policy has raised many doubts.
The Kremlin website quotes Mr Ivanov's conversation with Mr Putin, saying, "Yes, I asked you in one conversation in early 2012 to give me this difficult, even troublesome position, a four-year term".
"The result is that I have been the director of the Presidential Office for four years and eight months".
Mr Ivanov took up this position in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Security Council of Russia and, like Mr. Putin, a former member of the National Security Agency.
In the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin became the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Agency), Mr. Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
After Mr. Putin took office, he named Mr. Ivanov as one of his five most trusted people.
The outside world once thought that Mr Ivanov might become President of Russia after Mr Putin's second term ended, because three reelections were unconstitutional.
But the position eventually fell to Dmitry Medvedev, another close aide of Putin.
Mr. Putin served as Prime Minister of Russia for a while before being reappointed as President after three and a half years.
The mysterious fish surprised Banff, a garden
A resident of Banff discovered fish in his garden and then sent for help.
Kevin Bain believes that the 75 fish may have been sands washed by sea tornadoes.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the ocean, posted a video of this strange scene on Periscope hoping someone would explain to him why these two-inch fish would appear.
The Queensferry Bridge now runs to Fave
The £1.35bn project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north side of the Queensferry Crossing with the high rise bridge, which means that the bridge now runs to Fave.
The four bridges near the three bridge headquarters of each bridge are now close to construction, and the project is the first bridge in the complex.
The bridge, which started in Faf, is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 hectares.
It used 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 slides.
The project, which will cost £1.35 billion, is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and became one of the first people to climb the bridge.
"This is a historic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge", he said.
We have all witnessed the engineering work on such a grand project, and this section of the bridge used more than 30,000 hectares of concrete and steel.
Although the bridge is huge in size and weight, the connection between the high-rise bridge and the bridge surface requires precise work and very precise assembly.
Overall, almost 79% of the total bridge surface has been installed and the final concrete bridge section is now in Rosyth, meaning that all the bridge surfaces are ready for use.
Michael Martin, project director of the Queensferry Bridge Construction Company, said: "Whatever the bridge project, the first bridge is a major milestone".
As for the amazing project, this collaboration demonstrates the cutting edge of civil engineering technology.
After installing the last section of the road panel and connecting it to the expanded North Bridgeburg road panel, the remaining gaps on the north side or near the land side will need to be completed.
To complete this task, the northern tower bridge had to be moved 700 millimeters south.
This is a huge task, but also a very detailed task.
He said it was huge because the high-rise bridge is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 hectares, and it takes about 3% slope to pull out.
It is accurate because the engineering team needs to ensure that the deviation is very small, only a few millimeters on each side.
It is a joy that everything is going well.
Simon Bales took the women's gymnastics all-around championship
Forget about the pressure.
Forget the joke.
Simone Biles was not affected by all this.
The horse jumps are full of energy.
Balancing the wood upside edge is over.
Free exercise is amazing.
The overall performance was very good.
Now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the all-around title on Thursday, fully demonstrating her talent at the Olympic Games to lead the world in gymnastics.
She won the silver medal with a total of 62.198 points, along with finalist Ali Raisman and Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Bales from the United States performed a balance wood performance on Thursday in the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Byers helped Team USA win four consecutive Olympic medals in women's individual gymnastics, and she won five medals in the Olympics, further proving that she is the generation and perhaps the best gymnasts ever.
By the moment she saw her total score, Bales could not stand the flow of water. She finally ended this long journey.
The Bears thus rose to the rank of athletes for decades, as did Michael Phelps, who took their sporting projects to new heights in their respective fields:
For the past three years, Bayles has been calling the field a gymnasium, winning a total of 15 World Championship medals, including 10 gold medals. She strives to train every day to achieve greater accuracy. Mary Lou Retton, Olympic champion in 1984, said: "Buyles is the greatest gymnast I have ever seen".
There is still one final match in Brazil, but this match is not a competition between Biles and other gymnasts, but rather a battle between her own and the enormous pressure of expectations.
If Bayles didn't return to her home in Spring, Texas, with a gold medal, you would be very disappointed.
Simon Bairns (left) from the United States hugged Lesman, who won gold and silver medals respectively in the women's individual all-around final in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, August.
Bayles won their first gold medal on Tuesday and gave a surprise tribute to retired national team coach Martha Karolyi.
Although Bairns insists that he has no plans for the future during his tenure as the champion, this is not exactly the case.
One of Bales' free gymnastics performances included her iconic swinging sequence, accompanied by Latin music, which she often heard in the one-street quarters of the Rio Olympic venue.
This is no coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a baby and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother while on a field trip to the gym, has now grown into a force to be reckoned with.
Bairns hasn't lost an all-around game since the summer of 2013, and she will win as long as she wants to win.
Mustafina's slightly ahead after two turns was just an illusion.
Bairns, the defending world champion in both the equilibria and the free gymnastics events, is waiting to be buried.
She scored 15,433 points in her balance of wood and 15,933 points in her free gymnastics.
While waiting for the final score, Lesman hugged Biles gently. When Biles learned that he had achieved his dream goal, he left tears.
Lesman's performance was a bit of a revenge for four years ago, when she was tied for third, but lost to Mustafina in the final.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, who is being played by Americans as "Grandma Grandma", is far ahead.
She kissed the crowd after free gymnastics and announced her return, but such a return sometimes seemed questionable before.
Byers is only 19 years old. Since earlier this week, the news has spread viral on Twitter. For Byers, his life has been given a whole new meaning.
Mahaj Brown, 6, who was charged with murder, survived the shooting in Philadelphia.
Police said a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old to be shot in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child who was shot was Mahaj Brown.
Brown's abdomen, legs, thighs and abdomen were heavily gunned down, but the child was awake on the way to the hospital, they said.
He was convicted of numerous crimes, and his body was hit by thousands of holes, his grandmother Delores Melendez told the television station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition and has undergone several operations.
His family told the TV station that the child is expected to recover.
He was supposed to start his first grade in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Two of the three others who were shot were 29 and one was 32.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the victims, a 29-year-old, is in critical condition; the other two victims are stable.
According to the TV station, the child and the 29-year-old victim were found in the front seat of the car.
The other two victims were not in the vehicle, and police are investigating whether there was a gunman among the wounded.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like several gunmen had opened fire.
The scene revealed numerous charges against offensive weapons, which suggests that they used different offensive weapons.
Judging from this, it is undoubtedly a continuing battle.
There are charges on both sides of the street.
So, it shows that many armed personnel were in a state of radicalization at the time, Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the TV station.
There are many houses and vehicles damaged in the area.
The arrest operation has not yet been carried out, and police are said to be watching surveillance videos.
On Tuesday, a 6-year-old girl was shot dead while playing at her door in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is currently recovering and police are still chasing the suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabriel and Laurie?
This is how I evaluate the women's Olympic gymnastics team this year, for more than one reason.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, but the United States has never held such a dominant position.
Second, the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The team makes everyone proud, as it includes Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian.
This team finally looks like the American team.
It also cemented the top position of black and Latino women in the movement.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been non-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabriel were first and second.
This is so great.
At the last Olympics, Gabriel Douglas unexpectedly became Olympic champion, which made the United States cheerful.
Today, the world can witness the amazing performance of three-time world champions Simon Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who have become divine through the practice of regular gymnastics skills.
On Thursday, Simon helped Team USA win four straight titles in the women's individual all-around program.
Her teammate Ali Lesman won the silver medal.
We have reached the pinnacle of the sport, but this is not the case in all American gymnastics classes.
Simon, Gabriel and Laurie have made the Olympic team the same way Ali and Madison did.
They are the Final Five, as the next Olympic gymnastics team will be made up of four gymnasts, which is Marta Karolyi's final year as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly sport, with gymnasts training mainly in private gym clubs, and their parents paying for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotel fees (including coaching and gymnasts and their families) and the list of fees is growing.
Most gym clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can provide support for the industry.
All gymnasts training is done at these clubs, which is a costly and expensive long-term expense for gymnasts' families.
Baylor coach Aimee Boorman and Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have coached the two gymnasts since they started practicing.
We must bring more affordable, more accessible gymnastics training to countless young girls who have been deeply influenced by Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie.
20 years ago, I started my own gym foundation.
In my organization, we provide free, inexpensive gymnastics to over 15,000 urban youths in black residential areas - mostly black and Hispanic Americans - and cultivate national and even world champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my hometown, to provide high-quality gymnastics to the young people who deserve this opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic Games.
Physical exercise helps to develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, and helps to develop a spirit of hard work, self-discipline and determination.
These can bring lifelong benefits to a person's health, academic and work success.
It's really great that thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, inspired by this team.
Participation in sports is important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting moment.
I thank Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabriela and Madison for the strength of the young girls who have demonstrated their greatness in winning Olympic group gold medals, and I thank them for inspiring young girls from so many backgrounds to open up the path to health, strength and success.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunter's proposal, primary doctors plan to strike further
The ministers initially hoped to end the dispute caused by the change by accepting a contract modified by the British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58% of the 37,000 primary doctors who participated in the vote were against the contract.
In July, Mr Hunter revealed plans to force the contract into effect, saying that the NHS is currently in a vacuum zone, and that a slight delay would harm the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract first mentioned modifying the practice of working overnight and on weekends for primary doctors to improve the care situation for abnormal working hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Primary Physicians Committee, said in a statement last night that the primary doctors remained seriously concerned about the proposed contract, especially the concern that it would exacerbate the current labor crisis and not treat all doctors fairly.
We have only eight weeks left before the first doctors sign the new contract, and we need to make progress, not much time.
The BMA tried to resolve disputes through negotiations, but people were not willing to participate, and sometimes the government responded silently.
Nevertheless, last month we got the promise of Jeremy Hunter, who said his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunter needs to act now to abolish enforcement and address the concerns of primary care physicians.
If he doesn't, the primary doctors make it clear that they are ready to take further labor action.
The last strike took place in late April, resulting in nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 cases delayed due to nurses and clinicians covering up for doctors on the line of duty.
The ministers initially hoped to end the dispute caused by the change by accepting the modified BMA contract.
BMA hopes to get better weekend salaries for the 54,000 primary doctors involved in the contract.
NHS Employers CEO Daniel Mortimer called on primary doctors not to go on any more strikes.
Mr Mortimer said that the labor actions were not very effective, but instead put pressure on the teams and services that already put their best efforts, causing anxiety, anxiety and confusion for patients, caregivers and their families.
Over the past two months, we have been in continuous negotiations with the Primary Physicians Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other departments, have actively responded to their concerns about the role of caregivers and the reporting.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics such as deployment, flexibility in training, other training for those who have recovered from career interruptions, training costs, shared cognition of the curriculum outline, and gender pay gaps in the field of rehabilitation and medicine, which show how much importance the employer, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health attach to the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
2 pounds of medication a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Officials suggested that a £2 per day drug be promoted to more patients and that the duration of the drug be extended so that thousands of heart patients would benefit from the drug.
Anticoagulants like teagrelor can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in heart patients.
The drug is taken for 12 months after a heart attack and can reduce the risk of a stroke or heart attack again.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE), the regulatory body under the NHS, recommends that patients continue taking the drug for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now, NHS regulator NICE recommends that patients continue taking the drug for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease every year, and a quarter of them will continue to have a recurrence of heart disease or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty substances deposited in the arterial walls to form plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it causes a blood clot, which prevents blood flow to the heart, leading to heart attack.
If the blood clot moves, it enters the bloodstream, blocking blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
Patients who have had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another heart attack.
The Cagre is manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and marketed as Brilica, which reduces the risk of disease by reducing the formation of blood clots.
The draft NICE guidance published today recommends patients take 90 mg of Cagre for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of Cagre and two aspirin daily for the next three years.
Prof Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "Despite effective second-level preventive treatment, up to a quarter of patients with a history of heart attacks will get another stroke or stroke, which usually has serious consequences".
The fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that taking Cagre together with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence and stroke in patients who have had heart attacks.
We are very pleased that the temporary recommendation for Cagrey will provide more treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it.
Due to limited information about the efficacy and safety of Cartagena after three years, and in particular the risk of bleeding, the draft guideline does not recommend continued treatment after this period.
Computer culture has made voter fraud prevalent in Muslim areas
Lutfur Rahman, former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was dismissed last year due to corruption, prompting the publication of a government report.
Political correctness and corrupt culture have made the election fraud that is prevalent in the Muslim community invisible, a deadly government report reveals today.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles accused the police, election regulators and the city hall of ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of their oversensitivity to racial and religious issues.
The former Minister of Community Affairs, who is now an anti-corruption official, said that the practice of intimidating voters with religious positions was badly affected and that the police should be allowed to set a line of vigil outside the polling station to protect the fearful voters.
He suggested that voters carry their identity cards when voting to confirm their identity.
Currently, voters are only required to state their name and address.
The report even recommended that the voters' fingers be painted with unflashed ink to prevent a second vote.
Sir Eric said that the protection of whistleblowers should be increased.
He called for increased media awareness of the meeting documents and the way in which decisions are made by non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but to protect local governments from the toxic effects of a widespread culture of corruption and financial fraud closely linked to it", Liu said.
The report was released at Downing Street's request after the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that a series of corruption and violations of law existed in the mayor's office, Rahman, and should be removed from office.
The court found that Rahman had ridiculed the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and had not spoken out against the accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman Khan is said to have declared his vote as a religious obligation for loyal Muslims during the campaign.
Up to 300 ballots are suspected, and voters may have faked voting for others.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of electoral fraud in the country.
He specifically warned of mail fraud, allegedly by senior members of the Muslim community who put pressure on voters to vote for their designated candidates.
Sir Eric (pictured) made several suggestions on clearing voting mechanisms, including bringing an ID card to confirm his identity.
He said in the report: "There is evidence that senior members, especially senior members in Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds communities, put pressure on some vulnerable groups in minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote as they please".
Because of their oversensitivity to racial segregation and religious correctness, they fear that state institutions will ignore such behavior.
Sir Eric proposed 50 clearing mechanisms for elections, including a strict ban on political activists handling mail ballot papers to prevent polling stations from harvesting votes.
The report also called for strict checks on registration information to prevent voter registration from being used for immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa May is also considering the report.
These recommendations include requiring voters to present their identity documents before voting.
After the vote, the ink on the voters' fingers is not erased, preventing people from voting a second time.
The ethnicity of the voters is systematically verified to ensure their voting rights.
The validity of automatic mail voting requests will be limited to three years.
Prohibit political activists and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal voting envelopes.
Authorizing the police to set a vigil around the polling station.
Amend the legal provisions to make it easier to prosecute the persons concerned for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
It is illegal to take pictures at polling stations.
The rules state that English is the only language used in polling stations except in Wales.
Strengthen training and ensure that staff strictly enforces the rules that electors go to the polling station separately.
Sir Eric has been critical of Metropolitan Police, saying that they have not filed any criminal charges since the Tower Hamlets incident, and that the truth is surprising.
Rahman and his election agents were corrupt and illegal, and were therefore disqualified from the electoral court, Liu said.
According to the criteria of criminal evidence, he is undoubtedly guilty in many respects.
He also criticized the fact that the municipal election registration department checks the virtual ballot box.
Sir Eric said: "The court's verdict against Tower Hamlets last year sounded the alarm.
Our country has a proud tradition of parliamentary democracy, but the fraudulent conduct of some institutions and the subsequent public disregard for election truths are worrisome and threaten this good reputation.
Cyclists and other celebrities who look like Princess Kate's bikers and face-offs are in demand at the Rio Olympics.
This week, French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevot, who looks like Princess Kate at the 2016 Rio Olympics, was highly sought after by the audience.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is not the only gold medallist to face celebrities at the Summer Olympics, at least social media does not believe so.
So, in memory of the Rio Olympics and all the faces of celebrities who appeared on screen at the time, FEMAIL compiled a list of Olympic star-crossed Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: American men's archer Brady Ellison (left) From childhood he was compared to Leonardo DiCaprio
In addition to the cyclist who bumped Kate in the face on the bike track, many netizens soon discovered that one of the archer players was Leonardo DiCaprio's half-brother.
Since his photo of the Wolf of Wall Street starring in the title role was revealed on Twitter, American men's archery team member Brady Ellison caused a huge stir on social media.
In fact, the archer noticed the hype of social media and admitted that when he was a kid, some people said he looked like Little Li.
"I don't think I look much like him except the net", Bladdy told Huffington Post.
He is a very aggressive son of a flower boy, so I think this is a compliment to me.
One of the most popular rivalries at the 2012 London Olympics will undoubtedly find more similarities this year: British long jumper Greg Rutherford looks like the famous actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, who has two large eyes, is said to resemble Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
In the pool, for years, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison, the lead singer of the Glee Choir.
Changed: The user thinks that Nathan Adrian is the game version of the Inception actor.
Another pair compared to tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, whose eyebrows and lips look very similar.
The silver medal-winning Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova and actress Annalynne McCord share the same bronze skin and blond hair, while the American team's star was compared to Joseph Gorgon Levitt in the sports version of the game.
Female: Soccer star Hope Solo (left) and bloodthirsty forensic doctor Dexter (right) actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar faces and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was happy to find that others saw the similarities.
The theory of propagation: According to this user, this couple looks like there may be a reason.
A Twitter user recently happily claimed online that other netizens also think Hop Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look the same.
Indeed, the American football star and the bloodthirsty forensic doctor have a very similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh Jennings, whose smile is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney; and Gold Medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose beautiful and brilliant smile is a blend of the smile of the "Bring It On" star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologized for commenting on Chinese swimmers who were slow as pigs
On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald's comments about 14-year-old General Ayrawi, who won fourth place in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay, angered viewers watching live broadcasts of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Olympic Games.
A commentator for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer swam faster than the stinking air when he started the race, but eventually swam slowly like a pig, after which CBC was forced to apologize.
Interviewer Byron McDonald expressed some of his views at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final, when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
Byron, who was a colorful eyewear commentator for the CBC comment team, told the audience: "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake".
It was so excited that it started to swim faster than the smell of air, but later it was as slow as a pig head.
And it's really thanks to her.
Chinese swimmer Ai Weiwei, 14, was the second batting champion, with a time of 1:57.79 seconds behind Taylor Ruck, who was 1.61 seconds behind Canada, which narrowed the gap with China.
The whole of Canada was amazed by the tone and wording of the narrator, and they quickly reacted online.
Emmett Macfarlane: "What did the CBC commentator say about the Chinese 14-year-old swimmer who was slow as a pig?"
This idiot didn't realize that it was live.
Chinese junior general Ai Weiwei, who competed in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final, was described as saying: "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake".
Criticism of Byron McDonald on Twitter quickly broke through Twitter, and many demanded his withdrawal.
Twitter users didn't stop when they heard that Byron McDonald was slow to react to this.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Oh #Byron McDonner.
You represent CBC and Canada, and your words make us all sound like a bunch of racists.
Shortly afterwards, CBC broadcaster Scott Russel apologized for Byron's remarks on live broadcast, saying: "Oh, we apologize for the comments on live swimming players.
"We are sorry for this timeless wording.
CBC apologized more than 90 times to Twitter users who responded to the remarks.
Another commentator, Scott Russel, also apologized on behalf of Byron.
CBC then posted a copy of their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users protesting Byron's comments.
The channel also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We are sorry for saying this and for broadcasting it live.
Last night, we took swift action and apologized to the audience who watched our live broadcast and who watched our social media.
It should be noted that Byron's comment was directed at the performance of the swimmer, but not at her personally.
That is, the wording is indeed inappropriate, and Byron apologizes deeply for this.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized in a live broadcast saying that his words were not meant to be half-human attacks and that he was trying to defend himself.
I wanted to take some time to apologize for my comments last night after the women's relay, and I said yes on the CBC Olympic broadcast.
I am only commenting on the performance of the swimmer, not on his individual.
"Of course, I don't mean disrespectfully, I'm sorry".
Primark customers expressed anger at a woman who shamelessly tried to wear a hat in the center of the store
A woman was stripping in a Primark store in the center of the store, and customers inside the store didn't know where to look.
Worse, she also considered what she would look like after wearing it, then took off her cabinet and put it back on the shelf.
She continued browsing the shelves and eventually tried wearing four cabinets in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The woman tried to put on the cabinets in the Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone before putting them back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson (a mother of two) also said that after trying on her underwear, the mysterious woman dressed again and then left the store without buying anything.
"Everyone can't believe what they see", she said.
She stood in the middle of the store, took a cabinet off the shelf, took off her tight pants and cabinet, and dressed like this.
She didn't try to find a hidden place to try to dress up, she just stood there, it was rude.
When she took off her cabinet again, everyone was shocked and stunned. Obviously, she was still unhappy because she put her cabinet back on the shelf.
After that, she tried three more like this, and found out that none of them were her favorite, and then dressed again and went out of the store.
She didn't seem to care that anyone was watching her or who would eventually buy her cabinet she tried to pass through.
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "It makes me sick to think that someone will buy a cabinet that someone else has passed through and hasn't been cleaned.
This happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: "The shopkeeper obviously has to take care of the cabinets after she leaves, and fortunately so".
I hate buying a new cabinet back home, but I found another woman tried to go through it and it wasn't cleaned.
A Primark spokesperson said: "Primark already knows what happened in our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9th".
All the problem goods have been removed.
How to use horse magic to protect yourself in gun attacks
This world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com may give you a sense of security.
We ask the master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, Rhon Mizrachi, to learn how to approach gun-handed killers from close range.
Whether he comes to you from the front or the back, the video will teach you how to win and lose.
Mizrachi said that if the gunman approaches you from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and clear the fire line.
Then, hold the gun with your forearm and shoulder and then hit the attacker's face with your elbow.
Then, with his knee above his belly, he turned the gun in his hand, hit him in the face with a gun barrel and backup gun, keeping the weapon pointed at him as the attacker was crawling down his neck from pain.
If the gunman approaches from the front, similar techniques are used to keep your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and turn the gun hook so that the gunman cannot fire.
Meanwhile, the gun was pressed with weight and hit the attacker's chest, and the gun was turned from his hand, then the gun was pointed at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video and see what Mizrachi does.
But remember, if you are not a master of horse-racing, the safest way to escape the robbery is to hand over gold.
A family of teens destroyed a cheap rental house in Soltasch, Cornwall, before they were evicted
A family of strangers who were evicted for intimidating neighbors destroyed their cheap rented house before leaving, causing £50,000 in damage.
After a series of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their cheap rented house in Soltasch, Cornwall.
After being forced to leave the residence, Housing Association officials were surprised to find that the house was severely damaged.
The walls are all holes, the floors are broken, the garbage is all thrown away, the walls are painted in a mess.
The family has been moving since their expulsion and is said to be living in private residence.
Donna McEvoy, home manager at Cornwall Housing Association, said she was concerned that the house could not be saved.
"For the people who live here, this is a nightmare, I don't think people can live like this", she said.
There are many things to weigh in now, as this house is likely to be a bad element in Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and their names are notorious as well.
The couple have three sons, and they live here from time to time. Police said the family's terrorist acts included using baseball bats in the street, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug trafficking, shouting, quarreling and cursing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant, Skeldon, received an antisocial behavior resolution.
Many rooms in the house that may have been demolished are filled with long-term trash.
The floor was raised in a room that was once a drug deal.
Neighbors said they were often seen fighting in the streets and were often alerted.
After giving them an 11-week extension to move voluntarily, the Cornwall Housing Association forced her and her husband to leave the home this week.
Neighbors who finally relaxed their voices were applauding the move, saying that their previous lives were just human hell.
A neighbor said: "Oh, they don't care about anyone".
We have lived next door to them for 20 years and it has been so bad.
We have seen police entering the door countless times.
"We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up early because it was so quiet here that we weren't used to it!
They finally left, and it's great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive manager of the Cornwall Housing Association, said the family was not well-connected with local government.
The family lived in the house for 20 years and police visited them often.
Garbage and old toys were thrown on the side of the cheap rented house.
He added: "It is regrettable that the host did not take any responsibility for her behavior with her family and the eviction was the last thing the Cornwall Housing Association considered".
This is a very difficult case to deal with because their behavior is extremely extreme and their actions must have scared the neighbors.
I thank my team for the work they have done, and I also thank the Devonshire and Cornwall Police and the members of the community who have bravely provided us with information.
I hope this will bring some comfort to our neighbors and send a message that we will never tolerate antisocial behavior.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that their three sons lived in the house at different times, but also said that they were all in their 20s.
After they were evicted, a dirty mattress was thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms.
Housing union workers quickly cleaned up the garbage pile around the house.
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 ounces of cannabis, as well as a tin tin foil, drug paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of Class B drugs and intent to traffick them.
She claimed that the money was used to buy the tombstone for Lee Skeldon, his son who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is reported that after being homeless, Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of the multi-room rooms of the apartment are painted with graffiti.
Police said they would expel tenants who violate the tenant rules.
Angela Crow, from the Devon and Cornwall Sheriff's Office, said the eviction issued a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate tenant rules.
The warning is aimed at those who believe that their actions will not be blamed and those who are devastated by these actions, she said.
Devonshire and Cornwall Police are not tolerant of crime and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work together as partners to protect our community.
Read: Hillary will nominate Galdard to the Supreme Court if elected president
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he was confident that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton were elected president, she would nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have been blocking confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated Garland in March.
Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader, said the next president would select him to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reed said in a conference call on Thursday that he predicted Hillary would choose some credible Galland.
A spokeswoman for Reed later said that Reed had not nominated Gallagher directly for a conversation with Hillary, saying he was just speculating.
He added his appreciation for Galdand and said that Hillary's team did not want to be frustrated by the new recruit.
Gald is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reed said the Republican who stopped Galland's nomination was the cheerleader and cheerleader of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit to be president.
TREATS TREATS TREATS: Naked diaries TREATS are loved by both men and women.
Treats magazine will work with photographer David Bellemere to capture a collection of inspirations from Pirelli's 2017 calendar from the 1970s.
This time, they plan to look for a new generation of top models, not famous nudists, for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that they were using a magazine that focused on nudity, unlike the old-fashioned "pink" magazine, because the latter was aimed at men.
We are looking to women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar group is the same.
"We need to show the eternal and classic nudity that makes women and men feel comfortable, and this is exactly what inspired us", Shaw said at a calendar presentation conference.
Women will be happy to take part in this shoot, because it is a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit photo applications online or in person to public recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.
Video reports show that the small sleeping squirrel is the longest living vertebrate animal
Scientists say the Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate on Earth.
Julius Nielsen, who has been studying sharks, said that according to the sources, one female female sleeper head is estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old, with a body length of up to five meters.
French court rejected petition to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court rejected the request of the Government of Galway to demolish dozens of temporarily built shops and restaurants in the Jungle Jungle refugee camp, which currently houses thousands of refugees.
At the court's hearing this week, the government of Gallay argued that the French government should have the right to demolish a total of 72 temporary stores in the refugee camp. People sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks in these stores, hair services, tea for 50 cents and 40 pence or basic meals for several euros in temporary restaurants.
The Governor's Office in Gale believes that these places should be demolished because they are a tax-free parallel economy and there are fire and sanitation hazards.
Humanitarian groups said the shops and restaurants were of great importance to the court because free food provided by state-supported associations and other groups could not meet the growing needs of the refugee camp.
They said that these temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
A Riel court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of the 72 operators of the temporary stores, but said that the Governor Gale's concerns were fully understandable.
Judge Jean François Molla said that the role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants is much more than simply providing food to refugees who are living in extremely dangerous conditions.
He said that these places are a peaceful meeting point between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition is the Jungle Book Kids Cafe in the refugee camp, a small nonprofit that offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and offers shelter to hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian newspaper, the closure of the cafe would be a major disaster for these children (many of whom are only eight years old).
Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, charities, estimated Friday that the number of refugees in jungle refugee camps had surpassed 9000, the highest since the summer surge in refugees.
The 5,000 yuan grant has helped me to clear my eyebrows.
The Gujarati county governor of Li countryside, Mi-Mim village, poor and poor, Li-Kaku girl Zhofen received a letter of admission from the University of South China.
Just as she was grieving for the tuition fees, on August 9, the Regiment County Commission gave her a timely grant of 5,000 yuan.
On the same day, the relevant departments of the county also implemented 283.8 million yuan in scholarships for more than 690 poor college students.
At the same time, the family's economic situation is particularly difficult and helps them complete their education through organizing social donation grants and other forms.
Gujagi this year integrated scholarship funds of more than 18.5 million yuan, and financing of more than 2.5 million yuan, which were entered by the finance department in the real name bank cards of poor students within the prescribed time limit.
She said gratefully: "Oh, I thought my father had died, my brother and I didn't go to college, and I didn't think the county would solve the problems for us in time.
As of August 8, the Gujarat has implemented more than 21 million yuan in various rescue funds for 13,140 poor students in the first half of this year.
All the poor students in the county have been given the necessary help.
Journalists saw a large truck head moving on the highway under police command, the truck box fell into the greenway, and a hole 2 centimeters deep was dug along the way.
According to Xinhua, the Australian state government announced on 11th that it will spend A$200 million (about $154 million) to carry out the largest renovation since the famous Sydney Opera House was built.
The New South Wales government said the renovation would not change the shell-like appearance of the opera house.
The Sydney Opera House is one of Sydney's landmark buildings, designed by Danish architect Jon Utson and completed in 1973, receiving about 8 million visitors annually.
The Sydney Symphony Orchestra's general manager Rory Jeffs believes that the Sydney Opera House will use this transformation to turn a blind eye to becoming one of the best concert halls in the world for sound effects.
Non-Jewish citizens who have lived in Beijing for more than six months and who meet one of the conditions for legal stable employment, legal stable residence and continuing education in Beijing can apply for a residence permit.
Recently, Beijing Hong Kong Provisional Residence Permit Regulations and Implementation Rules were introduced, which means Hong Kong Provisional Residence Permits will be upgraded to Hong Kong Residence Permits.
The head of the relevant department said that the shift from the temporary visa waiver to the residence permit waiver meant Beijing would shift from the visa management waiver to multi-faceted services for non-Chinese permanent residents.
The journalist learned from the National Taxation Directorate today that as of the end of June this year, tax authorities at all levels have published 2470 cases of tax violations and blacklisting.
It is understood that in July 2014, the National Taxation Office took a step forward in the functional sector of the central government, and in conjunction with the Tax Credit Management Mechanism, the National Tax Administration released the way to disclose information about major tax violations.
Not only will the facts of the violations, the legal basis, and the handling of the punishment in these cases be published, but the basic information about the parties to the violations and the person responsible for the relevant intermediary bodies will also be included in the blacklist and exposed.
Government departments such as quality control, finance and customs have also taken appropriate corrective measures against blacklisted parties.
The credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and the entire social credit system, which marks the continuous development and maturity of the construction of our social credit system.
Environmental problems are reflected in air, water and soil pollution, but the roots are still in the production lifestyle.
For example, Jiangsu province had a land development rate of 21% in 2015, the highest in the country.
Therefore, the problems of high pollution, large energy and large land holdings have not yet been fundamentally addressed from the transformation of production lifestyles.
On the one hand, the result of creating ecological environments at all levels in Jiangsu province is the absolute advantage of being the first in the country; but on the other hand, the resource environment bears a lot of pressure.
Strong promotion of ecological environmental protection and governance requires fundamental promotion of transformation of production lifestyles to promote transformation of the people and society in order to build ecological civilization.
On 11th, 42 wind turbine-filled vessels produced by National Electric Group are ready to be exported to South Africa at the port port of Jun Jun.
Since last year, the National Electric Group has completed 163 wind projects in succession from Port Jun Jun, South Africa.
The O commission commissioned a third party company to produce the flag -- a non-Chinese company -- in São Paulo state, Brazil, about 75 kilometers from São Paulo.
To urge the manufacturers to finish the work as soon as possible, experts organized by the Chinese Consulate General in São Paulo rushed to the factory and worked in depth.
After 30 hours of extra work, the manufacturer finally completed the production and installation of the Chinese flag and completed the task that was supposed to take 4-5 working days.
The flag is expected to be shipped to Rio on the 11th, and the Olympic Committee will send it to the Olympic venues after receiving the flag, and the entire process will be completed under the supervision of the Chinese Consulate in Brazil.
On 10th, the Nanjing Municipal Government held a discussion on cooperation in the Yangtze Industry in Shanghai International Conference Center, and more than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate in the signing of the project on the ground of the Yangtze Industrial Connection project worth more than RMB 2 billion.
The 20 projects under the centralised agreement have invested a total of 8063 billion yuan, covering various sectors such as new energy, new materials and modern services.
Qingdao is the 12th pilot city in the country and the first city in Shandong province to pay for the use and trade of pollution rights.
On the 11th, several enterprises came to the Pyongyang City Cleaning Rights Trading Center to submit a cleaning rights application, and after receiving the application, they will pay a paid usage fee.
The upcoming transaction forecasts the official start of the pilot of the Pyongyang Ponzi scheme, which will be the first Ponzi scheme in the province and the first Ponzi scheme at the national city level.
On the morning of the 11th, the general manager of Qingdao Dupe Perch Fine Chemicals Group Limited, Liu Shengping, came to the Qingdao City Cleaning Rights Trading Center to submit a cleaning rights application.
The enterprise is located in the factory area of the Old Town of Qingdao, and at the end of last year, it completely stopped production and moved to a new factory area with environmental protection.
After the materials such as the application form and the environmental impact report of the construction project were submitted by Liu Shiping, the Center for Reservation and Trading of Pollution Rights of the City of Qingdao began the preliminary examination of the application materials.
According to the collection criteria established by the departments of prices and finance, the initial estimated cost of the use of the pollution control is about 6412 thousand yuan, and the staff will complete the approval within seven working days.
The upcoming transaction forecasts the official start of the pilot of the Pyongyang Pollution Rights Trading, which will be the first Pollution Rights Trading across the province and the first Pollution Rights Trading at the national city level.
Liu Xiaoping said that the amount of investments in environmental protection of enterprises is 400 billion, but it has a big impact on the concept of business management and social benefits of enterprises, and also opens up space for business innovation management.
On the same day, Ningxia Zhizhou Bus Accessories Limited, located in Qingdao, came to claim the clearance rights for the 4200 high-speed rail and motor vehicle group interior accessories project produced annually.
The project belongs to a machinery processing enterprise and the initial clearance claim is for chemical oxygen requirements (COD) 0.514 tonnes/year, ammonia (NOX) 0.052 tonnes/year.
The right to pollute air pollutants is paid for and traded for by industrial enterprises that focus on electricity and heat generation throughout the city.
Existing sewage disposal units that have received environmental reviews before January 1, 2016 are not charged for a fee.
The right to pollution for payment is not the same as the right to pollution illegally, and pollution cannot be released arbitrarily.
Han Redong, deputy director of the Environmental Protection Agency of Qingdao City, explained that if illegal pollution and over-excess pollution still have to be punished in accordance with the relevant regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises to avoid the punishment by buying the pollution rights.
That is, through legal means, to crack down on environmental violations and to severely punish the excessive pollution of enterprises, thus protecting the environment and safeguarding public health.
Now, for their own benefit, companies have increased their motivation to clean up pollution, cherish limited pollution rights and reduce pollution emissions.
Driven by economic interests, reducing emissions of pollutants will transform from government enforcement to business-conscious market behaviour, thus achieving the true purpose of protecting the environment, protecting nature and protecting public health.
The right to release pollutants, also known as the right to release pollutants, refers to the right of the emitter to release pollutants into the environment within the limits allocated by the government.
This right is essentially the right of polluters to own, use and profit from environmental capacity resources.
The next step is to exchange the amount of pollutants between the sources of internal pollution by exchanging currency, provided that the total amount of pollutant emissions does not exceed the permitted amount.
Since the 1968 proposal by American economist Dale, the clearance rights trade has been applied in the United States since the 1970s to the management of air and river pollution sources.
China has been conducting the pilot since 2007, and 14 provinces, districts and cities such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and others are already fully implemented.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, several Russian warplanes have been supporting the takeoff from the Syrian air base of Khamimim to assist the six strategic bombers in carrying out air strikes against the Islamic State's target inside Syria.
On February 22, the United States and Russia reached a ceasefire agreement on all sides of the Syrian conflict, which began to be implemented on February 27.
Under the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes against terrorist organizations identified by the UN Security Council, such as the Islamic State-backed front.
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of Russian soldiers will be guaranteed accordingly.
He also said that if extremist forces are not attacked, they will spread to Russia.
While Russia and the West have not reached an agreement on jointly fighting extremist forces in Syria, Russia will strengthen cooperation with Syria, Iran, Iraq and others in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia responded to the invitation of the Syrian government to begin a military strike against extremist forces in Syria.
On March 15, Russia's main military forces in Syria began to evacuate, but Russia promised to continue to maintain the air base in Khmeimim and the naval base in Taltus.
In the case of newborn and successful village founders, Hubei has been a good example: inheriting a hundred-year-old house, while also telling the story of the inheritance of a piece of land.
Today, on average, 100,000 people gather every year to the summit of the mountain, either to bring a variety of ideas or to seek inner peace.
In fact, the relationship between rural and urban should be mutually accompanied, like a mother and child, without strength and weakness, without the need for someone to rule who, should be warm.
There is no fixed model for rural development, but it is difficult to change the country by itself, and the most important thing should be to get the right people to the country.
The Shanghai Yangtze district traffic authority recently used electronic police to fix drivers driving mobile phones, and more than 30 searches were made in a week.
With the popularity of smartphones, mobile phones are becoming more fun, browsing, tweeting and even playing games and games, it seems that many people have to keep their phones open and even stop when driving.
The Road Traffic Safety Act prohibits driving with mobile phones and defines it as "an act that hinders safe driving".
Unfortunately, due to the number of violators, the difficulty in obtaining evidence, etc., this phenomenon is not punished properly, and the legal provisions are almost set.
If the authorities can decide to declare war on mobile phone driving behavior and normalize this measure, this violation of law will certainly be curbed.
The strict management of household records should be done, electronic and paper archives should be established for the registration of the account of persons without household records, one by one, to ensure that the file information is fully valid.
The public security authority should take care of the account registration of persons without accounts and inform the relevant departments in a timely manner.
A comprehensive cleanup of policy measures that are inconsistent with the spirit of this implementation opinion will be carried out, a serious revision of the amendment, a firm repeal of the repeal.
In the collective shed in the village of East Ling in Taizhou City, Wang Shefeng, 48, was carrying workers to spray pear trees with pesticides.
150 apple orchards and more than 10 tree species are located in the village, and only 12 workers and one technical engineer are needed.
Last year, $50,000 in total, at my age, would not have been possible if I had worked in a factory.
Last year, the income of the village of East Ling reached 22 million yuan, of which almost half of the total income from agriculture.
Village Secretary Suzifan: The per capita land area is growing every year, starting at 50 tonnes, now it is over 100 tonnes; the per capita yield is increasing every year, and the income of professional farmers is growing every year.
The biggest highlight of the collective economic reform of Sun Village, which quantifies the share of each village, is the clear ownership of the collective operational assets of the village and exploration of the separation of administrations.
In July 2015, 14 Rural Economic Cooperation Organizations in the Ansan Town Street of Sichuan District of Wuxi City were jointly administered by the Village Committee, the Village Committee implemented the rural public affairs management, and the Cooperation Organization mainly operated.
The two institutions, which are not boundaries, prevented the corruption of village staff from participating in collective asset management.
Jiangsu Provincial Agriculture Commission Deputy Director Sheng Baping said Jiangsu will continue to push forward the reform of the community share cooperation system, encourage the joint development of farmers and establish a mechanism for democratic exercise of power at village level.
Congratulations to the President: To further advance reforms, to engage community partnerships, to quantify assets to members of the community, to fix them to farmers, to form clear ownership rights.
The implementation of his right to know, the right to participate in decision-making and the right to supervise democratic governance, and the three rights that farmers have, through the Internet+, have made it a normative operating mechanism for share cooperation.
Currently, the new collective economy of Sun's rural areas mainly forms the four development models: asset leasing, enterprise share type, agricultural development type, and co-development type.

Zhang Zhang: The handsome, handsome Yang started shooting roadside career after several years of reversal.
Zhang Dong Red, from Dong Park Village in Xiamen Xiang An District, just changed his old 29-inch TV from his home to a 65-inch TV.
The daughter of a common farmer, she won silver for China in the women's 50m rifle three-man final at the Rio Olympics late on the 11th.
On the night of the 11th, just before this new TV, Zhang Dong Red and dozens of close relatives and friends witnessed their daughter's struggle to keep up, and the miraculous process from almost elimination to almost reversal.
In the match of the day, Zhang Yang once slipped out of the rankings, and it seemed that the distance from the final was very far.
But parents and friends didn't give up, continuously browsing live, seeing that as the other players finished the game, Zhang Chang'an rose one step at a time, finally locking up a final seat, and his home moment exploded from a moment of cheer.
In the final, Zhang Yi was once again behind the ranking, the last few shots were more stable, and he won silver with only 0.2 laps behind the champion.
Zhang, who is 27 years old this year, has almost wrestled with the difficult silver medal several times in his 16-year shooting career.
Zhang Xiaolong, her mother, told reporters that while they were hesitating, Zhang found several Chinese novelists from the same village.
The guest of the novel are the same village children who were recommended to the training at the same time, including Zhang's cousin.
Shortly after joining the team, Zhang Xiaoxun moved back to school in Xi'an for reasons such as family difficulties.
But after his coach Zhang Ajie repeatedly worked, Zhang Chang returned to the team.
After joining the provincial team, Zhang Liu was late to the national team, and once again returned home because he could not see hope.
This time, not only Zhang Ajie, the head coach and coach of the Shenzhen Shooting Arrows Training Center and the Fujian Provincial Team came home, finally persuading Zhang Yang to return to the provincial team.
Just like yesterday's match, the girl made a reversal on the shooting path with her persistence.
"Every coach selects team members differently, and when I saw how handsome the coach was, I was surprised".
Zhang Dong Red recalled that her daughter's performance in the training test was not the best, but the rings were stable, which is also an important reason for Zhang's attraction to the coach.
Zhang Aje was most impressed by the contribution of this farmer girl during her training.
He recalled that Zhang Liu entered the Venzhen firing squad more than a year later, and the team conducted a long-term shooting training, requiring the team members to be unable to move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter was always a quiet and resourceful child, and from childhood she loved to draw and make handmade toys.
I used to make clothes and make supplements at home, and I used to make dolls in some corner.
She said that her daughter often makes her own handmade toys, and that she is good at painting, and from the five senses of dolls to the costumes, she can always do it like a living.
As an athlete, Zhang and his family gather less and less, and only return home on holidays, usually by phone.
The parents said that whether it was meeting or calling, Zhang said little about his hard work, but rather about having fun with his parents.
They often do not see their daughter, and the parents carefully store their childhood paintings and the honours of their years at home.
Zhang Xiaolong showed her daughter's cartoons to reporters, and she should continue to paint the manga if she is not a shooting athlete.
In Zhang's second floor living room, there was a cabinet full of medals, medals and certificates she had received.
Zhang Dong Red placed the medals and medals in order, and the certificates were put together in the folder, which are the honors that have been changed for decades.
Recently, the Hebei Province's Chiki Shia Foundation sent 16,000 yuan of condolences to the families of six families who lost relatives in villages such as Chiki, Taipei, and Guizong in the province of Hebei.
This is another consolation and caring action that the fund has sent to society in search of the children and lonely elderly who lost their lives in the 7.19 flood.
7.19 heavy rains have caused damage in many areas of Hebei Province, causing flooding disasters in parts of the province, and deaths and disappearances of personnel.
The impressive work of Good Man Man Man Man Iron Man, who left behind a 2-year-old and a 6-year-old wife, touched the entire province.
On August 4, the staff of the Hebei Province's Chikiyoshi Foundation and volunteers of the Hebei Brand Association came to the home of the well-known Chinese Chinese Chinese, and handed over 3,200 yuan to the family of the Chinese Chinese.
When the Vice President of the brand Yelli learned about the situation of the family of the brand Yelli, he immediately decided to conduct a love-hate selling campaign among the business members of the brand Yelli, to help the family of the brand Yelli share the difficulty.
The Hebei Provincial Charitable Fund, fully known as the Hebei Provincial Volunteer Service Foundation, was launched by the Hebei Branding Association Planning Commission and established in August 2015.
According to Hong Kong's Hong Kong Oriental Daily on August 12, there are currently three main problems with the sale of continental diamonds, including the net worth of false diamonds pushing the price up, the weight of false diamonds and the lack of security after the sale.
Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers, and the local artisans' diamond cutting technology is well known. The diamonds sold have been rigorously identified and are highly appreciated by the ladies of the mainland.
With a small cloth bag, a hand held in her heart, a small slice of light cloth, worth nearly one million yuan, a Chinese woman who participated in the purchase of diamonds described her experience in Antwerp in June this year to mainland media.
She pointed out that she hid the diamond in her underwear, went to the bathroom for several days, took a shower with her, and went to sleep in a very stressful way.
She said the diamonds purchased in Antwerp cost about $55,000 per kilo, and the same quality diamonds are sold at the gate for about 111,000 yuan.
She bought the diamond for two percent and sold it all, once over 200,000 yuan.
According to the customs regulations of the mainland, diamonds are not goods or necessities of travel for travellers, therefore belonging to the category of goods, and must be declared at the time of entry, otherwise it is classified as smuggling, the situation can be seriously sentenced to prison.
According to foreign media reports, on 10th local time, the British Prime Minister's Office announced in Downing Street: British Prime Minister Theresa May will be in Switzerland for her summer vacation, but did not disclose specific holiday location.
According to media reports, after the Brexit referendum, the new British prime minister chose to go on a neutral Swiss holiday to the European continent, with some political symbolism.
The British newspaper Guardian commented that the symbolism represented by Switzerland, a neutral country, played a role in the choice of the UK Prime Minister's first holiday destination.
The Daily Telegraph commented that Theresa May chose to go on holiday in Switzerland, the first time a British prime minister has gone on holiday in Switzerland since Mrs. Thatcher.
The choice of the two female prime ministers and the choice of the two male prime ministers Blair and Cameron to go on holiday to hotter places formed the opposite.
It is reported that the new British Prime Minister, Theresa May, will return to London on August 24, after which a series of important works and activities await her.
The British Parliament will meet again on September 5th, and the debate will include the online demand for a second Brexit referendum.
The UK referendum decided to leave on 23 June, but the new British prime minister refused to launch Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on member states leaving before the end of the year.
There are 1,325 existing non-material cultural heritage projects in Huangshan City, ranking first in the province in both type and quantity.

China's Mars program has arrived
Our mission to Mars is to orbit, land and patrol, a form that has never been done abroad.
Our mission to launch Mars is to go around, land and patrol, and this task is quite difficult.
Because Mars probes take 26 months to meet a time window, experts are working hard on an engineering plan to launch our first Mars probes in 2020.
According to Shuo Daze, although China's aircraft have entered deep space, it is still essential to complete the Mars exploration mission, and the exploration of Mars means that China has entered the era of deep space exploration in a real sense.
Every two or three years, Mars has the opportunity to be nearest to Earth, and launching a Mars probe at this point is the most energy-saving option for launching rockets.
Taking into account the quality of the Mars probe, the launch mission will be completed by the Chinese Commander's Mission 5 carrying rockets.
Our mission to Mars is to achieve one orbit, landing, and patrolling, a form that has never been done outside the country.
There are many technical fields involved in Mars detection, and the special thing is that although Mars is a space probe, it has distinctive features compared to ordinary space probes.
That is, the Mars detector must have the ability to determine the route and detect obstacles that are dangerous.
According to Pyongyang, a researcher at the Chinese Space Science Group's Five Institute, the reason humans are so favored with exploring Mars is because exploring Mars has important scientific, technological and other aspects that are relevant to the future of mankind.
Mars is now the planet with the highest level of human research outside of Earth, and the history of human exploration using space probes has spanned almost the entire history of human space exploration.
Therefore, humanity hopes to one day establish a habitat on Mars and eventually migrate to Mars to make it a second home for humans.
There are also signs that Mars was likely to be like the Earth today, but it evolved over billions of years to become thin, temperature lower, and water resources depleted.
Therefore, exploration or manned landings on Mars could provide a preliminary plan to prevent the Earth from becoming a second Mars that is difficult for humans to survive.
As of June 2016, 114 lunar and 43 martian missions have been conducted worldwide.
However, from the 1990s to the present, humans have conducted 18 Mars explorations, while lunar explorations have only been conducted 14 times.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rover vehicles in operation, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are in operation.
The world's space powers have developed a Mars system-targeted exploration program, which shows that Mars exploration is hotter than lunar exploration today.
On November 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars probe, Mangariyan, becoming the first country in Asia to successfully explore Mars.
Mangariyanite is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars, and to explore whether there is methane and signs of life on Mars.
The most difficult part of the mission was that the spacecraft had only one chance to enter the Martian atmosphere after the airborne shape and the descent of the hydrogen.
According to Sun Zhejiang, the chief designer of the Mars detector at the China Space Science Group's five-star corporate headquarters, the Mars detection mission faces many technical challenges.
The atmospheric pressure on Mars is low, only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on the Earth's surface, with high uncertainty.
Scientists are not fully aware of factors such as its changes and storm characteristics.
Mars often forms dust storms similar to Earth's dust weather in summer, which causes a sharp decrease in the solar energy received by Mars vehicles, and must design a hibernation mode for Mars vehicles to wait patiently for the dust to pass.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere also reduces the effect of sunlight, which poses a challenge to the energy supply of Mars exploration.
This requires a larger solar wing area for the probe, and constant adjustments to work toward the sun.
Also, the gravity of Mars' surface is only 38% of Earth's, but it is much more than the surface of the Moon, so the probe needs more power.
The most central and difficult part of this mission is the process of the probe entering the atmosphere of Mars after the air deformation and the descent of hydrogen.
Sun Jae-ju said that because the Earth is far away from Mars and the entire process cannot be controlled by ground real time, it must be done on its own with the detector.
Since there are not so many propellants to offset such high speeds, the deceleration depends on the action of the Martian atmosphere when landing on Mars, but the Martian atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground.
In general, the way to explore Mars is similar to the way to explore the moon, and it also orbits, lands, rounds, and turns, ultimately achieving the goal of manned landings on Mars.
Since Mars is farther from Earth than the Moon, exploring Mars requires a series of more complex technical challenges.
According to Taiwanese media reports, Taipei's executive director, Zhang Lin, announced yesterday morning that the Taipei political party and its affiliated organizations have been unlawfully granted property treatment regulations that come into effect from today.
The vice chairman of the National Party, Jan Jaha said that a more than 100 year old National Party with a commitment and responsibility to society would not collapse like this.
Lin stressed that if a party, affiliated organization or trustee violates the provisions of regulations that prohibit execution, the committee will investigate the powers of the office and punish the execution and punishment in accordance with the law.
Lin also announced the election of the vice-chairman of the Party Production Committee, who will be held by Liu Hong, deputy director of Taiwan's Ministry of Integrity.
He said that the committee was elected by the Chairman of the Committee on Unfair Party Products by Qui Lixiong, and that the experience of Hong Baekgang's past investigation of significant cases related to the investigation will be used as the basis for the committee's investigation of the relevant unfair party products.
Jan-Jao said that no one will give you social contributions today as long as there is Party product, and if the whole Party product is taken away, the National Party can only ask for social support and sponsorship, and today there really is no opportunity to ask for it.
Jan-Ehwah also stressed that even after the incorrect party product regulations are in place, the products of the National Party have not been fully publicised and confiscated, and the rest will still be donated according to the promise, so that the party product license is zero, the party should start from zero.

Yesterday afternoon, the Hainan court ruled against the case, finding that Wang Xiaong and Microman did not constitute an infringement, and rejected all claims of Lanvietfeng.
In early 2014, a Central Television reporter Wang Xiaong's investigation found that despite the fact that Ranhwen-Peng, who sat in the hospital corridor for more than 600 days, was shaped by the media as a sad hero who was oppressed by the institution, there was a lot of false information in these reports.
On March 29, 2014, the Doctor of the Corridor program produced by the Central Television News Survey aired.
The various alleged overtreatment reports that Ranviet Peong reported to the media are not supported by evidence.
Wang Xiang also described in a tweet authenticated by his real name that the reason for reaching this stage was his personality and his obvious personality bias.
Ranviet Peong asked Wang Xiang to remove Weibo, apologise to him and compensate him for the spiritual damage of 100,000 yuan.
During the court hearing, both sides argued vigorously whether Wang Xiang had violated the reputation of Ran Vietfeng.
Check out on the 12th: China's athletics team is busy, women's soccer is racing four bikes hoping to break through
The bike is expected to achieve a zero-breakthrough Olympic gold medal, while the girls in women's football will challenge the two-time world champion German team, looking forward to a cold rush to the top four.
Wang Town has been in the spotlight for almost two seasons, winning silver at the Beijing Athletics World Championships last year and being promoted to individual event champion at the World Team Championships in May this year.
According to foreign media reports, 27-year-old South Korean archer Zhang Huijian won gold in the women's individual archery event, and won gold at the Olympics after the group stage, becoming the double champion.
Zhang Huijian, considered a latecomer, who regretted not winning the entry ticket to the London Olympics last year, now stands proudly on the podium of the Rio Olympics.
Zhang Hui-Jin won the gold medal in the women's individual javelin throw final at Rio Zamba Arena in Brazil, defeating Germany's Lisa Unru by a score of 6-2.
She first shot in the fourth grade in elementary school and won her first individual gold medal at the World Cup in 2014 at the age of 27.
Zhang Huijian recalled that there was no level before the secondary school in Yangon that could not participate in the national competition.
Zhang Hui-Jin only finished fourth in the qualifying tournament for the London Olympics four years ago, and regretfully lost his Olympic ticket, only to win two gold medals while sitting down with his colleague and good friend.
Zhang Huijian spoke about his message of winning gold after the ceremony of the women's individual archery competition, and he was happy to shoot archery as far as possible, and it may have brought good results.
The 28-year-old Korean archer, who won gold at the London Olympics in individual archery, won bronze.
Chihuahua lost to Zhang Huijian in the semi-final and faced Mexico's Alia Hendra Valencia for the bronze medal.
Chi Chi Chi is known for his silent gold-digging burden of securing the bronze medal after the match.
First, the coaching staff has accumulated rich experience in continuous research, and second, the scientific training methods, all of which need to be accumulated over a long period of time.
The archery team uses military training and nighttime crossing of cemeteries to help the team focus and maintain a normal mind.
Although it has not been confirmed, many sources have said that Apple's fall 2016 launch will be held in September and the iPhone 7 is coming.
Although Apple has not responded, there have been reports of the new iPhone's features and configurations, and even images of the iPhone 7's real-time models have been posted online.
The new generation of iPhones can be said to be a popular look, hot, compact, cheap... If you want to buy the right product for the first time, you have to choose a good channel, for example, Sunning.
This exacerbates the disappointment of people with the new phone, and the fact that it is bigger, but it cannot project holographic images at all!
The iPhone 7 is like any other iPhone, and comes with countless secrets before birth.
In addition, several sources claim that the new generation of iPhones will eliminate the 3.5mm headphone interface and use Bluetooth connectivity and charging interfaces, which will allow Apple to add a second speaker.
Another evidence that can confirm this news is that Apple already allowed headphone manufacturers to produce headphone products connected through a charging interface in 2014.
Whether the news is true or false, the answers will not be revealed until Apple's autumn 2016 launch.
But this does not prevent people from seeing the prospects of the iPhone 7, and many believe that the iPhone 7 will likely be the last major upgrade of Apple's iPhone series.
Although the data released by the market research agency IDC recently showed that the iPhone's market share has declined.
Among them, Goldman Sachs maintains Apple's stock rating of "buying" and "buying" while analysts at BMO believe the iPhone 7 will have a historic sales record.
At the same time, Boutron CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple's future revenue growth is likely to exceed 20%, which is entirely due to the launch of the iPhone 7.
7% of respondents said they plan to buy an iPhone 7, compared to just 4% two years ago.
It is understood that 20% of users who currently own iPhone 6 or 6Plus plan to buy iPhone 7, a fairly high proportion.
Second, according to expert analysis, most apple trees prefer to replace their iPhone phones one after another.
According to statistics, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for two years, or almost 120 million users have used their phones for two years.
Some media reported that Taiwan experienced several earthquakes during the production of the iPhone 7, the extent of the damage to the production facilities of Taipei exceeded expectations, and could have an impact on the initial supply of the iPhone 7.
The supply and demand contradictions affect the average user, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time to get the good iPhone 7 at a low price.
According to sources, in recent years, the Sunning senior leadership has met with Apple frequently in order to prepare adequate supplies.
The operator has already talked to Suning, and it can be predicted that with the deeper cooperation between the two parties, it will inevitably bring lower prices and more attentive services to users.
At the lowest price, consumers can earn only 7 yuan a day to buy an iPhone 7.
The abundance of supplies and the variety of offers will make buying the iPhone 7 no longer a stressful mountain, while the logistics of Suning will make this good into a more intuitive experience.
Maybe you'll get a phone call in the middle of the night, hello, Sunny is easy to buy, your iPhone 7 has arrived.
The organizers hope that through the cultural exhibition, the local people will get to know more about the historical Chinese culture, thus enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the two countries.
The Art Gallery of Barcelona is part of the European Tour, which will run until the beginning of October.

The rural flower industry, which is both spectacular, relaxing and economically beneficial, is a highlight of the development of the new rural area.
According to foreign media reports, the event of the Rio Olympics in Rio has recently received much attention from the outside world as the water of the swimming pool has turned from blue to green.
However, on the morning of the 10th, the water of the water polo pool next to the swimming pool turned green.
The Australian water polo player said that his eyes were stinging after the game and he wanted to shed tears.
Earlier, Rio Olympic officials confirmed that the pool water turned green and said that the change in color was due to the weakening of the elasticity and would not affect the physical health of the athletes.
But the Australian athlete said he had a stinging eye after winning the match against Japan's national team in the water polo pool.
The organizers first worked overtime on the problem of dealing with the pool after the pool turned green on the evening of the 9th, but on the morning of the 10th, they found that the color of the pool changed quickly.
The Australian team and Japan played a slowly deteriorating environment in the pool, but the officials stressed that they will restore the water quality of the two pools to their original colour on the 11th.
Rio Olympic spokesman Mario Andrada said: "Yesterday afternoon, the water level in the swimming pool first weakened.
We understand a range of causes that could cause the water in the pond to change color and the concentration of water quality.
The Centre for Water Sports conducted a series of water quality tests, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the pool to determine the standard water quality conditions.
Well, these days we've been going through normal procedures, but we may have ignored the impact athletes can have on water quality.
The change in water colour is certainly not affecting physical health, especially for athletes.
The independent team confirmed our assessment and confirmed the measures we have taken to restore the pool to its normal color and chemical state.
"We wish the pool could return to its normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery has been affected by the rain".
According to Taiwan's Xinhua Central Agency, an explosion occurred last night in a prison on the outskirts of Manila, injuring the jail director, killing 10 prisoners, including two Chinese.
ABS-CBN TV reported that the incident happened at around 9pm yesterday in the Paranaque City Jail, but the police did not make an initial statement until 2am today.
Police said that the 10 prisoners had asked the warden to move their prison, but neither side speculated, and the prisoner threw grenades, which led to the explosion.
The prison has not released the names of the dead prisoners, but GMA TV reported that two Chinese were among them.
As of 8 a.m., the prison had not provided detailed explanations, including how the prisoners obtained the grenade.
Yesterday, Central Philippine police entered the Leyte Province prison and shot down one prisoner who tried to attack the police station.
Urumqi regulates the order of operation of the tourist retail market and travel agencies must sign contracts with tourists
Now that Xinjiang has entered the tourism boom season, the regulatory authority of the tourist retail market operates order, the law enforcement authority of the Unified City Transport Administration Branch of the Urumqi City Tourism Law enforcement Branch yesterday investigated the non-regulation of tourist vehicles in the retail market, the low contract rate signed by travel agencies with tourists.
At 8am yesterday, about 10 buses full of tourists stopped around the Kevinski Hotel, most of which were a group of strangers heading for the day trip to the Tianjing Lake.
Hello, I am from the Urumqi City Tourism Board, and you signed a contract with this travel agency?
Staff of the Law Enforcement Branch of the Urumqi Municipal Transport Administration explained: "The tourist vehicles and buses operating tourist transport projects in Urumqi market are not qualified to practice.
The over-the-counter operation is fined between three and 100,000 yuan for this penalty, and the driver without a certificate of professional qualification is fined 2,000 yuan.
It is understood that the tourism enforcement department of the city of Urumqi has previously inspected places where tourists are concentrated, such as West Park and Red Mountain.
In the two inspections, the deputy captain of the tourism enforcement branch of the city of Urumqi said: "The first is safety, the second is regulation, the tourist vehicles are small things, and once the problem arises, the crowd dies".
"We and the transportation management jointly continue to inspect the market and regulate the use of vehicles by travel agencies to ensure the safety of tourists".
On the morning of August 12, the State Department Press Office held a press conference on the state of the national economy in July 2016.
The spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, Head of the National Economy Comprehensive Statistics Department, Sheng Liang, said that in July, the growth rate of some indicators of the national economy slowed down but still operated within a reasonable range.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics shows that the growth rate of fixed asset investments and total imports in July have declined.
In July, I would like to borrow a phrase from the Prime Minister about the state of the national economy, which is fluctuating and still going well, which can better summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July.
He explained that the volatility of the slope indicates that some economic indicators did decline in July.
Because the domestic and foreign economy was still in the midst of a deep adjustment in July, the international situation was complex and changing, and the recovery of the world economy was not as expected, export pressure was still relatively high.
From the domestic situation, the entire economy is still in the critical phase of adjustment, adjustment pain is being released, and the economy is facing a lot of downward pressure, so some indicators are fluctuating.
Sheng Liang pointed out that there was also a special situation in July, where the flood disaster was more severe and the hot and hot weather had some impact on production operations in some areas.
According to a recent report by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people were affected and direct economic losses exceeded 200 billion yuan.
The different levels of impact on these regions are seen in the indicators related to industry, investment and transport.
The weekly freight traffic growth in July fell by 3.6 percentage points from the previous month, and flood disasters have had some impact on traffic in these areas.
In view of these factors, some of the indicators fluctuated in July and it was normal and expected.
He said that the momentum is still good and that despite the slowdown in economic growth, the overall economic operation is stable, stable and stable.
The CPI rose 1.8 percent in July, 0.2 percent in the ring ratio, and 2.1 percent in July, so the overall price situation is stable.
According to the Chongqing City Meteorological Office portal for high temperature weather statistics for each district county, other than Yang, the rest of our city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance.
At least 28 provinces have already defined the standard for allowances, but the standard for allowances in each province and city is not the same, and Chongqing is a way of getting a high-temperature allowance in accordance with the high-temperature working day allowance.
The 35°C and below 37°C standard per person is not less than 10 yuan per day; the 37°C standard per person is not less than 15 yuan per day.
Workers at high temperatures above 40°C can receive a maximum monthly allowance of 20 yuan/day (except for workers who already enjoy allowances for high-temperature work positions according to the law).
According to this standard, the highest temperature temperatures in the last month were 330 yuan, the lowest in the city was 80 yuan, and there was no heat allowance due to the high temperature temperature in Yangon.
In the past, many units used cooling drinks to reach the high temperature allowance, and the city security watchdog said this behavior is not in line with the current method.
Due to the high temperature, work is stopped and working hours are reduced, the employee unit cannot deduct or reduce workers' wages.
The city's Public Works Administration said that employees who work in high temperatures and do not receive high-temperature allowances can seek legal rights through the labor dispute mediation agency in the enterprise, or call 12333 complaints.
If a person's unit refuses to issue a high-temperature allowance, workers can complain to the competent authority for social security of human resources above the county level where they are employed.
At the same time, since the high-temperature allowance is part of wages, not benefits, the total wages should be included in the tax deduction.
Therefore, the high-temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage range, and must be issued in cash, and cannot be replaced with physical items such as drinks.
The newly built Urumqi station is located in the high-speed rail segment of Urumqi city, and the entire building area is about 100,000 square meters.
The ground floor has 1 and 2 floors for entrance, waiting room and office and commercial buildings, and the ground floor has 1 exit level.
Currently, Urumqi Station is the largest integrated transport hub in Xinjiang, which integrates high-speed rail, rail transport, buses, taxis, etc.
There are three ticket halls on the south-north side of the platform and the north side of the exit platform, with 39 individual ticket windows and 34 automatic ticket machines.
In terms of check-in, there are 30 passages on either side of the waiting hall, and passengers can quickly check-in and wait based on the check-in gate number on the ticket.
If you need help, you can choose from 41 call buttons set up nearby by pressing the power station and get timely service.
From July 1, the passenger train from the old bus station, or Urumqi Zinan station, will be moving to Urumqi station in stages.
That is, all the cars and 30 trains can be parked at the Urumqi station.
Now both stations can buy tickets for buses, and the train between them takes about 10 minutes to pass, and travelers need to pay attention to the specific stations of ticket start and end.
The official commissioning of the new passenger station in Urumqi will be an important platform for building a national integrated transportation city in Xinjiang, and promoting the construction of the Silk Road economic belt and new zone.
Gracia is a female bigmouthed bird that spreads the air of tropical rainforest.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the giant-mouthed bird Gracia and its story have long been familiar.
At a press conference on August 10, Gracia, who had undergone surgery and recovered, finally made her debut, showing people her new 3D printed plastic bird nest.
The giant-mouthed bird, which was cut down and killed a year and a half ago, has finally been born again.
This day not only announces that it has been 100% healthy, but also the day it moved into a luxurious birdhouse and met with human friends who care about it.
The new home's first arrival, Gracia, was slightly shy, but not often became lively, rolling around in the water basin and eating grapes with fresh vines.
To remind people of the damage it has suffered, technicians did not give it a new color, but kept the original white of the 3D printing material.
Outside the bird's nest is a thin layer of angular nesting, inside which is empty, with only a few fine skeletal supporting rods arranged in a cross-section.
Although there is such an internal reinforcement component, the larvae of the bigmouth bird are still fragile and break when injured.
The Animal Rescue Center, the ornithologists and a US 3D printing company worked together to create several test kites for Gracia, which ultimately made the perfect kit for her.
Today, Gracia is skilled in using fresh water, eating, and even picking small grains of corn.
The final design of the finished product took about two months and was printed in only four or five hours.
3D printing is not the technology of the future, it is actually entering your life". Thomas Lang, Chairman of SG3D Printing USA, said in an interview with Xinhua International.
In January 2015, a blood-mouthed giant bird called Gracia was found dead in a farm in the Alajuela province of central Costa Rica.
At the time, its addiction was brutally broken by a group of young people, and it was completely unable to eat, life was in danger.
After the media coverage of Gracia's tragedy, there was a surge of protests against animal abuse inside and outside Costa Rica.
People are demanding stricter animal protection laws and increased punishments for abusers.
People volunteered to do their best to help Gracia recover as much as possible from her injuries.
Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of the Gracie's addiction.
The situation in Mangrecia is special, with the remaining part of the roof less than 1 cm, so the installation of the new roof is very difficult.
"We first scanned Gracia, then designed and produced an extension prosthetic slightly longer than the rest of it, and stuck it with a sticky stick on top".
This could reduce further invasive damage to Gracia", Zhang told Xinhua International Journalists.
Before installing the fake, staff must clean the faucet for Gracia every day to prevent infection.
Far from the mill, the story of the giant mouthed bird Gracia was inspired by the famous documentary director Paula Eredia and explorer news channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded the tiny bits of the process of installing the new fox in Gracia, and recorded a documentary, The Fox's Country, which was broadcast on the Animal Planet channel this month.
The documentary The Country of the Big Mouthed Bird shows people how a small, big mouthed bird can change a country and get the whole nation involved in the fight against animal cruelty.
Core tip: Japanese oil companies are particularly alert to the rise of small independent refineries in China, known as "Thai Chi" refineries.
Japan's largest oil company JX Energy believes China's expansion of exports is one of the reasons for the slump in the market, reports Japan Media on August 12.
Japanese oil companies have been particularly alert to the rise of a small independent refinery in China known as the "Tia-Tia-Tia".
The quality of China's oil products is gradually approaching that of Japan due to the Chinese government's stricter environmental protection regulations.
Before obtaining the import permit for crude oil, the tea refinery generally refined heavy oil with higher sulfur content imported from Russia and other places.
The high sulfur content of the oil products produced, the poor quality of the oil products, is one of the reasons for environmental pollution.
After obtaining the crude oil import license, the Zhao Tea refinery was able to import low sulfur content of Amman crude oil and Russian crude oil, and the quality of its oil products was improved.
East Gas General Petroleum Company said that the capacity of refining equipment has also improved as the quality standards of oil products in China continue to improve.
As a result, the quality of China's oil products exported to foreign countries gradually reached the same level as Japan, which has the highest quality in the world.
JX Energy said that after the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia, competing with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Despite the fact that the Japanese high-quality oil company is facing a crisis, the response strategy adopted by the Japanese oil company is only to export to the profitable regions while focusing on the market sector.
Due to the enormous impact of Chinese oil exports on the Asian market, there is also a growing concern about tea refineries.
The 2016 Young People's Daily Benefit Group Sunshine Scholarship campaign started on May 26, and after two months of registration, the total number of poor schoolchildren applying for grants reached more than 800.
In the course of the study, social contributions of more than 1.2 million yuan have been received. Five publications have been published that can help at least 240 students of Khangmen Yunhound University.
Currently, donations are ongoing, and the paper calls on society to continue to reach out to help more children in difficulty in families to receive funding and social care.
To ensure that the actions of the school assistants are fair, open and transparent, the paper has published the basic information of the school assistants, and today the first 100 students have been published and are supervised by readers.
Li Group Sunshine Assistant Action, a well-known Chinese charity brand, has been running in Jiangsu since 2003 and has funded over 4,000 poor children.
The funding for the event is for the admission of freshmen to the undergraduate program, excluding free specialties; education and training, family poverty.
Statistics Australia says that New Zealand's population growth has exceeded 2% during the peak of the baby boom population in 1974 and the 1950s and early 1960s alone.
As of June this year, the net influx of immigrants to New Zealand in the 12 months was 691 million, which has been the main driver of population growth in New Zealand in recent years.
In addition, the natural growth of New Zealand's population in the same period was 282 million.
Data shows that in the last 10 years, New Zealand has had an average net influx of 218,000 immigrants per year and a natural growth of 3,230,000 people per year.
From a demographic perspective, the large influx of immigrants means that the proportion of the working age population aged 15 to 39 years is gradually expanding.
In the 12 months to June 2016, the working-age population in New Zealand grew by 3.6% to 1,58 million.
At the same time, the population of older people over 65 years of age increased by 3.6%, reaching 700,000.
Yesterday at 10 am, the X9003 international freight train left from Xi'an Neuzhou Station for Almaty, Kazakhstan.
The train's journey marks the success of the Xi'an Railway since the start of the Central Asian International Freight Line in 2013.
It is understood that the goods class of this cargo class includes six categories of industrial raw materials, mechanical equipment, industrial parts, building materials, food and light industrial products, a total of 206 varieties.
As of August 11, this year, the new station has operated 221 rows of 10009 cars, and has collectively transported 33.8 million tons of export goods, of which 84 rows were operated in 2016, an increase of 47%.
It is understood that the cargo carried by the first batch of Chinese ships was made by China, and today it has attracted a large number of foreign cargo sources.
By the end of July, the volume of containers in the Central Asian group exceeded 64,000 containers, an increase of 8% compared to the same period in 2015.
With the crypto launch of Central Asia, the freight volume of the newly built stations of the Xi'an Railway Agency has increased year by year.
In 2015, the total year-round freight throughput of the new station was 2470,000 tons, and as of August 10, 2016, the freight shipment reached 153.1 million tons, an increase of 6.7% over the same period last year.
To meet the needs of future development, the Xi'an Railway Agency has launched the construction plan for Xi'an Xi'an Railway Integrated Logistics Center, which is centered on the new construction station, and has worked to build a modern, new construction railway integrated logistics park.
An Indian uncle who just experienced the shock of a plane's interior landing at Dubai International Airport last week won a $1 million grand prize at the same airport this week.
Mohammed Bashir Abdul Khaddar, a longtime resident of Dubai, UAE, has a habit of buying tickets every time he returns to the country.
His 21-year-old son died of an accidental fall 13 days after his birth, and he has been working hard to pay back his son's medical loan.
"The fact that I escaped from the plane crash was because God gave me a second life and gave me the money to do good", said Khedaar.
Although it is now autumn, the strength of the Tiger Tiger appears to be slightly less than that of the summer.
UV rays not only make the skin of the classmates darker, but also more sunny. How can the skin pass through military training without getting sunburned?
The SPF and PA are usually labelled on sunscreen packaging, SPF refers to the sunscreen index, which is aimed at UVB ultraviolet rays, and our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50, etc.
Products labeled PA are targeted for UVA, so sunscreen products play a more effective role, and in general, the intensity of PA is + to indicate the use, and more + to indicate the effective protection time is extended.
Oily skin should choose waterproof sunscreen products with strong penetration, and sunscreen spraying is also a good option.
Dry skin should choose sunscreen with a shiny shape; neutral skin generally has no strict regulations, any maintenance on sensitive skin rubbing is a burden, and it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products.
Remember to apply sunscreen half an hour in advance, because sunscreen products take time to fully penetrate the skin.
The training day is longer, and the sunscreen is rubbed every two hours to have lasting effects.
Because the skin was just exposed to sunlight, the military did not immediately use white products.
After the military training, if conditions are met, the burned skin can be covered with ice towels to reduce local dryness.
Farmers who buy farm machinery during the exhibition continue to implement the policy of additional subsidies, farmers who buy farm machinery can get up to 40% subsidies.
The exhibition is geared towards global tenders, and in particular, it has increased the invitation to countries along the Belt and Road and target market countries.
The exhibition aims to complete 60 projects of contracting, bring in 22 billion yuan of funding, sign more than 160 trade contracts, contract amount of 3.2 billion yuan.
It is reported that the reason for the seven consecutive years of implementation of the Jiao Tong Tong Bank is because the manufacturing industry in Jiao Tong Province of Hunan Province has a solid foundation and a long history of industrial development.
As the host of the JINGBO EXPO, JINGBO has established trade and trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
The Expo is an important platform for cultivating the local character industry and promoting the character industry out of the country.
On some nights, the ionization layer is filled with free electrons, which means that the radio signal can go further.
According to the August 11 issue of the American magazine Science Monthly, the US Air Force is interested in the effect of replicating the effect.
While the ionization layer with a stable amount of free electrons can help people listen to the radio on the broadcast edge of a university radio station, this may not be in the interest of the US Air Force.
The electron-filled ionization layer means that the radio used by the military has a greater range of transmission and may provide some protection for global positioning system GPS signals to protect them from the effects of solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of cubic satellites based on demand, which can strengthen the ion layer when needed.
But first, the teams that signed contracts with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles involved work.
Industry data shows that in 2015, the total coal capacity was close to 6 billion tons, with the country's coal capacity exceeding 1.8 billion tons.
In the last decade, the State Council has issued five notifications to eliminate excess and backward capacity.
Although the first four were not targeted at the coal industry, the target industry is directly related to the coal industry.
From last November to January this year, the price of coal from the 5,500-carriers of the island of Fujian was long-term low at 370 yuan/h, and 90% of coal companies were at a loss.
Since February, coal prices have been steadily rising, and recently, the price of coal has been rising for four consecutive weeks, rising to a 16-month high, once rising to 436 yuan per tonne, up almost 70 yuan from the beginning of the year.
As prices soared, people were worried about the consequences: Will a small coal mine be able to reproduce?
In this regard, the Chairman of the Economics Department of the Hainan Institute for Reform and Development in China, Liu Ming, conducted analysis and interpretation.
Q: The decommissioning of energy has attracted a lot of attention from all sides, and the result of the coal industry decommissioning that was published today is also a cause for concern.
These three factors reflect the relatively backward nature of our transformation in the past, which is that the government-led growth has not yet undergone a fundamental transformation.
Second, this is directly related to the capacity of local governments to drive, and in the process of decommissioning, funds and corresponding support measures must be put in place, and in this respect, the differences between regions are indeed large.
Third, if some provinces that are currently slow to progress are to catch up in the second half, they may face greater risks.
In this case, the process of relying on central grants to advance production capacity may have some negative impact.
First, decommissioning is not a simple matter of total control.
Our aim is to eliminate backward capacity, promote structural optimization and re-construct the whole coal industry.
In the process of deploying decommissioning, local governments must combine the transformative upgrades of decommissioning and the coal industry to develop the related services sector.
Second, if we want to complete this year's decapacity task, we still need to fully use the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision.
Finally, we need to strengthen the role of social security.
Since the market directly concerns employment issues, we need to strengthen the training of employment skills for employees and employees.
The reason for the decline in the ranking was the deterioration in foreign investment expectations for Brazil's GDP growth in the medium term.
In 2015, Brazil's participation in global direct investment was 3.7%, down from 5.7% in 2014.
The International Investment Attraction Index of the Swiss Bank is divided into four indexes: infrastructure, economic prospects, business environment and direct investment volume.
In 2015, Brazil's international direct investment was $64.6 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year, investment in Brazil's green spaces (in the investment model for foreign investment and plant-based investment) was $17.9 billion, down 2.1 percent.
There are 288 green-field investment projects in Brazil, with an average annual amount of 314 projects between 2003 and 2014.
However, in the first half of 2016, international direct investment in Brazil reached $33.8 billion, almost 10% more than in the same period last year.
Original title: Canadian police beat ISIS supporters: Ready for suicide bombing in the city of Yangon close to completion
The taxi company said the taxi was taken to the driver's house before the police arrived.
Canadian police said in a press conference Wednesday that information received by the police included "martyr video" provided by the FBI about the young man who will carry out the attack.
According to German Voice, a man wearing a black barracada hat was reading the Koran, mentioning crimes against Muslims and vowing to launch an attack on a Canadian city soon.
He said in the video that the attack would take place within 72 hours and at peak hours.
The incident was the first time police had killed a suspect in terrorism before the incident, since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office last year.
The upgrade of the Changhang Grand Canal branch line, the Yangtze River and the North Grand Slip Canal, will charge for passage from September 1.
The two channels have been converted into social finance and the fees have been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.
The Yangtze River waterway runs through the town of Kim, Fish Taeng, and enters the main waterway of the Jianghan Grand Canal through Nan Yang Lake, with a total length of 32.5 km.
According to the needs of the airline, the maintenance and transformation of the Yangtze River waterway was carried out, deep dives were carried out on the local water depth, direct cutting was carried out on the local water table, and air traffic conditions were improved.
The route runs through Qingdao County, Ningbo District, and enters the main route of the Jianghan Grand Canal through Nanyang Lake, and is 19 kilometers long.
The transformation project of the two lanes was started in February 2011 and completed in January 2015. The construction and investment and operation of the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center in Jining City were completed.
In accordance with the principle of construction of loans and fees and charges, the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center in Jinjing City is charging the passage fee based on the fee standard that was criticized by the Shandong Provincial Price Administration.
Among them, the basic transit fee is 1.75 yuan/load of tonnes, and the mileage fee is 0.05 yuan/km of tonnes.
The tolling period is from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019.
The reporter learned from the Jining City Port Aviation Authority that there are currently four charging routes within Jining, namely the Yangtze River Route, the Beima River Route, the North Great Slip Route and the Huawan Fu River Route.
The four shipping lanes are being upgraded and transformed to serve the Jinghang Grand Canal, which is a tributary of the Yangtze Canal, using social financing.
The upgrading and transformation of the Yangtze River waterway project is the first model to use the Yangtze Government+ market model for projects to build the infrastructure of the Yangtze port in Shandong Province. The government accounts for the main investment, social funds fill the funding gap.
Branch routes such as the White Sea, the Huangfu River, and the Great Northern Slip River have been purely marketed.
The funds allocated by the state budget cannot meet the needs of engineering construction and constrain the progress of the upgrade of the shipping lanes.
Social funds are used to build public infrastructure that meets the requirements of national policies and is also a way to break the bottle of funds.
Ningzeo's performance in the semi-final of the 100m freestyle swimming has silenced many Chinese viewers.
But in the 50m freestyle preliminary, Ningzeo refreshed the bottom line once again.
In fact, 50m freestyle swimming is not the main sport of Nietzsche, and his performance and best results at the Kassam World Championships also determine that he is unlikely to break through this project.
Of course, Hong Kong's official media outlet Zhao Zhao revealed that the biggest reason for Ningze's failure was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many factors outside the field may have had a major impact on his future thinking, and he may now be more interested in entering the entertainment world.
After the Kazan World Championships, Ningzeo became instantly red with his super high values and good results.
So the name of the national husband, the little fresh meat chicken, the flowery man chicken, etc. has become a label on his body.
All kinds of business activities are opening their doors, making good money, and becoming a glittering avenue.
In this case, even if Ningze Xi chose to retire at this time to join the entertainment world, it was not only his freedom but also a seemingly viable path.
After all, he is only 23 years old and after some training, he can play in a TV series or two thanks to his popularity.
But Nietzsche needs to see if he is qualified enough compared to these predecessors.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the 21-year-old has reached the end of her career as an athlete.
Her beautiful appearance quickly made her remembered and laid the foundation for her future entertainment career.
After retiring from the military, Liu starred in several television series and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tendao competed in the men's 10m individual medley at two Olympic Games and won 2 golds and 2 silvers.
But after losing to teammate Hujia in the men's 10m event at the 2004 Olympics, Tan Liang's athletic status declined and he was fired by the water polo team.
He and his daughter attend a variety show, where his father goes, and even get his eyes on the spot.
The golden generation of gymnastics, like Zhao Wei, Li Xiaojun and Chen Yi-shi, all played a high-profile role in various variety shows.
It is worth mentioning that Liu Li Xiaobo led China to the 2008 Olympic men's team title, and Liu Li is also a two-time individual All-Star gold medalist, known as the All-Star King.
Chen Yi-hye became the ring king while leading China to the 2012 Olympic group championship.
After losing the gold medal at the London Olympics, Chen's ice-skating move also left him with countless circles.
But the main energy of these athletes is still on the field, and for the variety show, it is just like a touch of water.
But whether retired or active athletes, to be favored by the entertainment world requires a certain level of achievement.
After all, athletes are entering a new field, whether it is ability or relationships, and it is a vacuum state.
Even the old-timers of the entertainment world like Tendaliang and Yang, who have been around for years, are mentioned by the general public, and more often than not they think about their performance at the Olympics.
And newcomers like Zhaowei, Li Xiaojun, and others, introduced during their performances in the variety show, are no exception to the Olympic championship.
The title of a swimming world champion was still slightly slim compared to the above.
Moreover, compared to the success of the likes of Tendai, Liu, and Liu Wei, Ningzeo would have been able to retreat quickly if his career was a little frustrated at the age of 23, and the negative impact on his image would probably be inconceivable.
After all, the demands of the athletes are not to win the 100 but to fight hard and hard, and Ningzeo is far from that point.
Ten Thousand Steps Back said that Ningze was mature and could fully rely on the value to get support from thousands of brain residues.
No energy, only appearance, wanting to mix in the entertainment world, this is no better than training to find the right condition.
The path of life is chosen entirely by personal will, but how to choose it should be counted in Ningze's mind.
On the surface, social networking platforms have expanded the circle of communication and reduced loneliness.
The power of network social is becoming more widespread, and not only has it gradually replaced traditional telephone contacts, but even entered the real life circle online, which is changing the social life of the people today.
The benefits of online social are obvious, such as convenience and speed, so it is especially easy to be favored by young people.
A survey of social habits among college students showed that 57% of college students use their phones for more than 5 hours a day, and the basic mechanics of everyday life are constantly at work.
Social networks have low cost, fast transmission, multiple people communicating at the same time, and meet the needs of contemporary university students.
Expanding adult relationships, more equal dialogue, and avoiding social worries are the main reasons why we are increasingly chatting online.
Newcomers love to communicate online with colleagues, and because they are not very familiar with the unit, the relationship is closer than ever through social platforms.
Loving friends also communicate online, and before they get in touch with friends for a while because of some mistakes, they later converse in a large group.
The IT engineer is said to be a deeply networked social enthusiast, and most of his social life takes place online, with more network contacts than online friends.
The legend itself is more confident on the net than the fish.
You can reply to your friends at any time you want, because there is a lot of time to consider words, and the expression can be clearer.
I often avoid face-to-face interactions, not only have the space for rotation, but also give each other more time and space to think and talk.
People of different identities have the same right and efficiency to speak, and social concerns in real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace.
However, the gossip friend, Junior, feels that gossip in life is a barbaric and uninteresting homely gossip.
The little girl and the proverb met in a large group, because they were both active speakers, and soon became acquainted.
Little Liu felt that if the gossip and the network judge two people, the words are boring, and do not actively comment, repeating a few sentences, well, yes, yes, or no, I will go online and check it out.
The police in Maung Wat have already intervened in the investigation, and the Maung Wat transport department will also step up efforts to correct illegal vehicles.
The police have not yet investigated the August 4 conflict, and the taxi of two other drivers was hit at their residence on August 11.
The majority of the three-wheeled vehicles now operate illegally at night, and the authorities hope to increase their efforts to fix them.
The South Sea Net reporter learned from the Public Security Office of the Leningrad Autonomous Community County that the police have already received reports of both cases, and further investigations are underway on the cause, who was responsible for the two cases and whether they are related.
Wang Wenwei, station manager of the Transport Management Station of the Ministry of Transportation of Maung Wat, said that the Ministry of Transport of Maung Wat began to correct the illegal passenger tricycle at the beginning of this year, banning a total of 613 illegal passenger tricycle vehicles.
The transportation sector will apply to the county government to join forces with multiple departments to increase efforts to fix illegal vehicles such as three-wheelers, motorcycles and black cars throughout the county.
On August 11, at 8 a.m., Zilou Evening News reporter followed the China Health Care Service team to the village of Gang Gang in the East Harbour district of West Lake Township.
The village is remote, about 24 kilometers from the city center, and the residents of the village are more than 200 people, and due to economic, transport and physical limitations, many middle-aged patients are uncomfortable with their outpatients.

51Talk No Worries English is considered a landmark in building the online education industry ecosystem.
CEO Huang Xiaojia said bringing the best learning resources from around the world to Chinese children is their strategy for the next five years.
It is understood that the biggest advantage of the Q51Talk is that it can meet different needs of users of different ages.
Zhang Li Min, chief operating officer, said that by connecting the global quality of teacher funding and services to students, parents no longer use the boat Laughton, and spend precious time picking up their children.
Central Bank extends business licenses for 27 non-bank institutions such as Paypal and PayPal for five years
To integrate business resources, leverage scale effects, and improve regulatory efficiency, the extension of the payment institution to adapt the merger fee to pay for business license fees, adjusted its business scope accordingly.
The merged payment institution should complete the payment business undertaking within 6 months from the date of the announcement.
The People's Bank of China will handle cancellation and exchange of business license fees after the business contract is completed.
Due to the serious violations of business, stagnation of business, or the type of business termination actively requested by some payment institutions, the extension of the scope of their business was reduced.
The relevant institutions should stop the relevant payment business as requested within 6 months from the date of the announcement.
The People's Bank of China will continue to carry out the work of carrying out the business license for payment of yuan in accordance with the law.
The magnitude 4.4 and 4.5 earthquakes in the province of Nima, Tibet, have not yet caused any casualties
According to local civil service departments, there are no casualties so far, and the specific disaster is under further statistical verification.
The Deputy Chairman of the City Disability Association attended the event and gave an important speech.
The present leadership jointly awarded the second batch of the "Lovely Love" "Lovely Mountain" "Lovely Mountain" private car team.

The National Award for Nominee for Model of Morality, Party Committee Secretary Sun Jiangbo said that the spirit of the rainbow is a long-standing practice that is consistent with the socialist value system.
After the ceremony, participants visited the Shandong Mountain Hardcore Entrepreneurship Memorial and experienced the construction of the facility without obstacles.
Mayor Vilfredo López of Rivaz said at the teacher training site that the Nicaraguan government agencies are working together to promote environmental management plans and plant trees together with the HKND Group.
As the developer of the canal project, HKND Group has always followed international best practices and built the canal according to international standards to maximize the environmental protection of Nicaragua.
The university students, through a combination of theory and practice, lead middle school students to plant trees together and teach the next generation of Nicaraguans how to green the environment.
A full-time team of Francesco Reyes, professor in the Department of Natural Resources and Environment at the National Agricultural University of Nicaragua, participated in the education project for planting trees and forestry.
We have reason to believe that the same trans-Ocean Canal project led by HKND Group will bring more benefits to the people of Nicaragua and create more jobs for the local people.

Tajikistan's Avesta News Agency quoted a Central Bank report on the 11th that inflation in the seven months of this year's year in the country was 3.7%.
Inflation in the seven months of the year in the Tower was 3.7%, with inflation in July at 0.6%, and inflation in the near year at 6%.
The government's goal is to control annual inflation in 2016 at 7.5%, while the inflation rate in 2015 in the Tower is 5.1%, the report said.
In addition, the report also noted that the Tajik government and some major international financial institutions have some predictions about economic development and inflation in 2016.
According to the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development, the growth of the economy of the Tower will reach 7% in 2016, while inflation in the country is basically above this level.
The Asian Development Bank, World Bank and International Monetary Fund have made different predictions about the economic development and inflation in Tajikistan in 2016.
For these two indicators, the Asian Development Bank forecasts are 4.2 and 7%, the World Bank forecasts are 4.8% and 7.5%, and the International Monetary Fund forecasts are 3.4 and 8.2%.
Despite the negative external factors, such as the international economic downturn, the devaluation of the Russian ruble and the decline in the currency exchange rate, the economy of the Tajik Republic grew by 6% in 2015.
In a phone interview with reporters on August 11, Huang Ilin, who had returned to Sichuan's Shangyang home, said: "It was so urgent, and I had only one thought in my heart: to save people!"
Huang Ilin is a student of the Class of 2015 of the Scenic Gardening School of the University of South China-Lincoln.
Huang Ilin, who studied urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Sichuan Province to study local architectural design, so a family went on tour.
At around 10 a.m. on August 8, Huang Ilin's father was resting at the hotel, and his mother and daughter were preparing for the ancient city of Yangzhou.
We had just walked a little far, and suddenly we saw a crowd of people shouting loudly, and curious people went up and down.
The little boy was missing, the little girl was desperately drowning in the water, her little head was exposed on the river, and she sometimes sank, and Huang Ilin, who learned to swim as a child, jumped quickly and quickly to rescue.
After the water, Yellow Irene, 165 cm tall, found that he could not step at all!
The water was calm before, but the bottom was a violent flow!
But she still goes to the little girl regardless.
Huang Ilin said that the river water, the rush, less than 5 meters away, almost consumed all her energy.
She did her best to push the little girl to the riverbank, the slope was particularly slippery, and I was afraid I was too weak to sink.
So Huang Ilin begged for help, heard her daughter's cry for help, and the water-poor lady prepared to go to the water rescue, and was stopped by the next tourist.
On August 10, after the story of Huang Ilin's jump-o-river rescue spread, Ms. Liu received many commendations and commendations from relatives and was also held accountable by relatives.
I'm really scared! To tell the truth, when the children couldn't hold on to the riverbank and cried out to me for help, my heart was broken.
Ms. Liu said with confidence that despite the danger, if she were to be in a situation like this again, she would still support her daughter's choice and she would be proud of her daughter!
Because of being forced, Huang Ilin rarely actively goes back to the water after learning to swim, and I didn't think that this skill was really used.
According to Huang Ilingban's principal Chen Yi-Ying, Huang Iling is a recognized alumnus of Banri and is happy to help.

From September 1, seniors aged 60 to 64 can take buses in the city district for half the price.
On the morning of the 11th, in the IC card sales center of the Jining City Bus Company, several elderly people were lined up in front of the card window to work cards.
Earlier, the Jining City Commission for the Aged, the Municipal Finance Office and the Municipal Transportation Office issued a notification about the half-price of buses for 60 to 64 year olds in the city, which the policy officially implemented from September 1 this year.
Older people who qualify can apply for a second generation ID card to the IC sales center; older people with a field account that meets this age also benefit from this benefit.
Xi, deputy director of the computer center of Jining City Bus Company, said that more than 200 half-price cards have been issued since August 1.
Currently, the senior card is divided into two types, one is the senior free card and one is the senior half price card.
In order to facilitate the elderly, the system was upgraded, and the free card for elderly people was reduced from two examinations in one year to one, and the elderly with the card no longer have to run two.
According to the official website of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission said today that the securities regulatory authorities of the two countries and the Deep Trade and Port Trade are working closely together.
At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission has established a special working group on Shenzhen Hong Kong search and actively promoted the preparations for Shenzhen Hong Kong search and the selection machine will be opened this year after the relevant regulatory rules and technical equipment are ready.
The number of fraudulent text messages is quite high, and even if they are not fraudulent, they can be found guilty of fraud.
The People's Court of the Guangdong District of Nanchang City, Henan Province, held a hearing to determine that from September 30 to October 4, 2015, the defendant Li Yiwang used fake base station equipment to send fraudulent information in the district of Tangber County and Nanchang District.
On October 5th, the same year, at 10 am, the accused was caught by the Public Security Police while using a fake base station group to send a scam text message in a hotel room in the Guangdong district of Yangtze.
The assessment showed that the fake base station device sent 62228 text messages on October 4, 2015, causing 62228 phone users to have their communications interrupted for more than 8 seconds to less than 10 minutes per person.
The court ruled that Li Xiawang used the fake base station to send a total of 622,28 fraudulent text messages to an unspecified majority, and that his actions constituted a fraudulent offence.
The defendant's plea to guilty is better than the defendant's plea to guilty if he was tried and unconditionally arrested and suggests that his opinion be taken into account.
The accused was sentenced to four years and six months in prison and fined 10,000 yuan for fraud.
The Northeast Tiger is currently listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin, data from joint monitoring by China, the US and Russia in 1998 shows that there are only four to six wild Northeast tigers and three to five wild Northeast tigers in Jilin province.
According to the Ministry of Forestry and Conservation of Jilin Province, the protection of wildlife in Jilin province has been steadily increased in recent years, the population of tigers and monkeys in Northeast China is growing significantly and the distribution area is expanding.
The latest monitoring data from 2015 shows that 27 wild Northeast tigers and 42 Northeast tigers were observed in the province of Jilin alone.
As the flagship species of the world's wildlife protection distributed in the China-Russia border region, cooperation between China and Russia is important for the recovery and reproduction of wild tiger populations.
According to the Ministry of Forestry of the province of Jilin, previously the province of Jilin had established a long-term stable cooperation exchange mechanism with Russia.
At the 2016 China China Tiger Protection International Forum, which ended on 11th, the forestry sector and animal protection organizations of China and Russia reached a number of consensus again.
The Forestry Department of Jilin province said that strengthening cooperation between China and Russia for tiger and rhino protection is not only a very urgent task facing the protection of the northeast China tiger and rhino, but also an urgent task to maintain the health of the Russian tiger and rhino population.
Sun Fu-Keng was the party's leader, the ideal beliefs were lost, the party was severely violated, and the party's 18th party still did not hold back, did not hold back, did not break the law, the nature of the bad and the plot was serious.
After this incident, which was reported by various media, became a focus case and the social impact was very bad.
After the incident, the police force of the Public Security Bureau of Haiku City was given high priority by the leadership of the police force, and a team of police officers organized an active strike and investigations immediately.
Police immediately executed the suspect's online manhunt, took several measures to contain him, and checked the country's descent through contacting the field police.
Because the suspect was a habitual thief, repeatedly beaten by public security agencies, had strong counterintelligence capabilities, and he often developed drug addiction and interrogation poisoning, interrogation work was very difficult.
Greenland sloths, also known as the little sleeping sloths, are widely distributed in the North Atlantic Ocean around Greenland and Iceland, reaching a length of 4 to 5 meters as adults.
But their growth rate is extremely slow, sometimes only about a centimeter a year, suggesting that Greenland frogs may have an extraordinarily long life span.
Traditional methods of measuring the age often use animal scaffolding, and some shark species use scaffolding, but this scaffolding is rare in Greenland shark.
A new study led by Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, uses the crystalline crystals of Greenland's cranberries for radioactive carbon dating.
This method has previously been used to determine the age of sharks, but it is the first time that it has been used to determine the age of sharks and other fish.
Their analysis shows that the largest shark's life span is estimated at 392 years, with a misunderstanding of 120 years.
That is, the age of the shark is at least 272 years, and the maximum is likely to reach 512 years.
In addition, female Greenland monkeys are said to reach sexual maturity at about 4 meters in length, which means that they reach adulthood at least at 156 years of age.
The researchers therefore wrote in their paper that the Greenland spider is the longest known vertebrate on Earth, surpassing the previous longevity champion, the 211-year-old.
The exchange rate has been significant for the past year, the exchange rate has remained fundamentally stable, while also laying the foundation for promoting the internationalization of the yuan.
From the market performance, the two-way fluctuation of the RMB exchange rate over the year was evident, the exchange rate elasticity increased and the exchange rate expected overall flat.
The exchange rate has changed so far, and the yuan has fluctuated above 100 points against the middle price of the dollar, but the process has been changed.
The last exchange rate change before the 8th and 11th yuan exchange last year was implemented in 2005, and the yuan has significantly appreciated against the dollar over the decade.
Since the new currency change was implemented, the yuan has changed its previous upward value, and the average value of the yuan exchange rate in a year has decreased by about 8%.
On October 1, the International Monetary Fund will officially accept the yuan as the SDR (special right of withdrawal) weighted currency.
This week, statistics released by the General Customs Administration of China showed that China's total imports and exports amounted to 13.21 trillion yuan for the seven months of this year, down 3% from the same period last year.
In July, China's total value of imports and exports decreased by only 0.9%, especially the export share increased by 2.9%.
Experts believe that although there are signs of stability in imports and exports in July, there should be no excess expectations.
In July, China's total import and export value of RMB2.09 trillion fell by 0.9% compared to the previous year.
Exports of RMB122 trillion, up 2.9 percent; imports of RMB873 billion, down 57.7 percent; trade surplus of RMB34.28 billion, expanding 34 percent.
Although the total value of imports and exports remained relatively low, export data showed growth, which is the fifth consecutive monthly increase in exports since March this year.
Shanghai police have been holding more than 3,400 people for four months against 157 gangs of thieves and robbers.
While investigating the case, the police also recovered over RMB 33 million in total for the pet.
According to the members of the theft gang, they entered Shanghai from outside by packing a black car, then dropped the car, and after hours each met up in the car and left the house together.
In the process of prosecution, the suspect often used a single building to climb the outer walls and monopolise theft curtains, from top to bottom.
The day before, the suspect in the crime involved was transferred to the Xu Hui District Prosecutor's Office to review the prosecution.
Police reminded the general public that it is necessary to lock the door and window when going outside, and recommended that the general public should choose steel with harder materials for the choice of anti-theft windows.
According to China's Voice of China News, Tonkin Kishimoto reported that in late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will visit Kenya to attend the 6th Africa Development Conference.
The Africa Development Conference is led by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, so this conference will also be the first to be held in sub-Saharan Africa.
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said that holding a meeting locally in Africa helped to raise awareness of Japan in Africa and Europe.
In support of Mr. Abe's visit, the Communist Party of Japan will send delegations to the relevant countries, according to the joint statement.
Japan's entry into the world of sustainable development began in the early 1990s, and the African Development Conference initiated by Japan also began in 1993, which is no coincidence!
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations, and is an important UN treasury, so how can Japan give up Africa if it wants to get into the regular loop?
The group will also exchange views with relevant stakeholders from countries on the extremist organization of the Islamic State and counterterrorism activities.
The Western Group of the Cypriot people will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau and others.
Japanese Foreign Minister Shishi Tanaka also recently expressed his intention to attend the Africa Development Conference at the UN Security Council.
Abe announced that in order to stabilize sub-Saharan Africa, 100 billion yen (about 61 billion yuan) of aid would be provided over five years.
Observers generally believe that Japan's generosity towards Africa has always had two main purposes: first, to increase Japan's presence in Africa; second, to seek the support of African countries on common issues.
Japan's expert on issues, Zhengberg, analyzed that while Africa is relatively lagging behind in development, but the number of countries is relatively large, Japan has always considered it the so-called "Big Bang".
Japan will not give up, and the work for Africa will not stop, and will continue to strengthen.
Economically, Japan's production capacity is relatively strong, but domestic markets are relatively limited, especially in the context of the current aging of children.
However, from the first ten years of the war, when the Japanese introduced the sprinting technique of the same name, to the next ten years, when the Japanese launched the sprinting technique several times, it was all the same.
Japan expert on issues, Zhengberg, believes that Japan's intention to enter the norm is obvious, but the path to normal must be difficult and heavy.
Japan must first develop good relations with its neighbours, and Japan must have the right attitude, whether in geopolitical disputes or national disputes or in historical understanding.
The morning ruling of the Haiku Maritime Court ensures the rights of parties to the sinking of a high-altitude fishing vessel
The relatives of the three crew members who died were present at the Haikou Maritime Court at 4am on August 7 to file a petition for the seizure of the cargo vessel suspected of misconduct.
After the incident on the 4th, the alleged cargo vessel was seized by the Maritime Administration in Haihua, Hong Kong, assisting in the investigation.
Given that the 72-hour withholding deadline for the Maritime Office expired at 9 a.m. on August 7, the victim's family was entitled to file a claim for property protection with the court on August 7 in the early hours.
At 4:20 am, the applicant filed a claim for property protection before the appeal, and the duty police patiently received.
The conference was hosted by Professor Cao Sheng, the Acting Vice Dean of the School of Political and Public Administration at Shandong University.
What challenges does globalization and integration of the global economy pose to governance?
How does governance adapt to a changing world?
At that time, VanDeshan will perform a full analysis of the above issues.
Dr. VanDeshan, Ph.D. in Law from Peking University, Deputy Director and Secretary General of the Center for Global Governance Research at Peking University, and former Director of the Office at the American Cornell University in Beijing.
Currently, the research focuses on profound changes in global politics, economics, technology, culture and religion, and the opportunities and challenges these changes bring to national governance, leadership, and global governance.
Traditional customs introduced a new highlight and 2016 Hong Kong Vijapan opened the Hong Kong Cultural Festival
The music of the drumming, traditional snacks, the decoration of the flowers, the crowds of people.
The 2016 Hong Kong Song Festival of Culture, organized by the Hong Kong Gang Gang Association General Assembly, is held from 12 to 14 in Victoria Park, and is one of Hong Kong's largest Song Festivals.
In addition to continuing the existing single-player competition, the whole family can participate in the pool for the set-up of the pool.
Not only is the manga presenting the cultural history of the island in the form of comics, but the site also features a 3D selfie area with the theme of the island, traditional snack food areas and traditional crafts flow classrooms, which attract many children and overseas people to experience visiting.
A couple from France stayed at the event site for almost three hours and experienced the flow of the mini-card classroom.
I looked at this special festival online, so I decided to come and see it and feel fresh.
They said that while France has similar festivals to commemorate the ancestors, the atmosphere is heavy, unlike here, where there is music and food and you can learn traditional crafts.
She said that in Hong Kong, the busy financial metropolis, you can also see such a large and organized ritual of ancestor worship.
This not only reflects the diversity of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to learn and pass on these traditional crafts.
President Chi Chihyang-Teng said that we do not want to make the festival of culture in China so scary that people are afraid to approach, especially young children.
We hope that through youthful activities and arrangements on the ground, young people will know that the culture behind the festival is about showing kindness and gratitude.
He also said that this time, 24 teams participated in the competition, which not only the community organizations but also some schools worked with to get students to participate.
It is understood that Hong Kong's Taizhou Ranch won't be included in the National Register of Non-Property Cultural Heritage in 2011.
On the evening of the 11th, the Chinese National Theater of Beijing travelled thousands of miles to Mexico City with its eponymous play, The White Snake, and presented a Chinese drama banquet in the National Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico City to the local population.
As the main performance project of the Chinese Cultural Exchange Year, the National Beijing Theatre of China will play seven Beijing dramas in Mexico City, Mexico City, and five cities such as Cordoba and Varrez, from August 9 to 23.
The audience followed the story of the story of the White Snake, and the actors' memories were played, and the audience smiled and applauded.
Marisa Ximenes Cacho, who watched the performance of the Beijing Drama 15 years ago, accompanied her daughter to the final performance.
Oh, it was a wonderful performance, music, lights and stage performances impressed me. I felt it was necessary to let my daughter learn about Chinese culture and Chinese theater arts.
The enthusiasm of the Mexican audience impressed the young actress and white daughter, Layla Caria.
I didn't think the Mexican audience would be so enthusiastic, and I was a little worried about whether they would understand the story, but today I was surprised to see that they could capture the plot and many laughs.
Chinese Ambassador to Mexico Liu Xiaobo said that the cultural exchange activities of the Chinese Cultural Exchange Year this year have a positive role in promoting deeper understanding and friendship among the people of China and Mexico.
Next year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mexico, and more cultural exchanges will be held in China and Mexico.
Liu gave you a trip to Asia to research the double repair and double city projects to improve the level of urban planning
On the morning of the 12th, Liu gave the honorary chairman a conference call, hearing reports on the progress of the pilot project in Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Liaoning, Lia
I give full assurance of the phased results and good experience and good practices created during the pilot work.
Liu Jingwei stressed that the tri-region should seize historical development opportunities closely, and play an important role in the pilot work of the twin-city twin-city twin-twin project, to play a leading role in the economic and social development of the entire province.
To play a leading role in raising the international level of tourism islands, starting with the details, enriching the international elements and creating international delicacies.
To play a leading role in urban and rural integration and tourism throughout the region, to accelerate the construction of characteristic towns and villages, to integrate tourism elements into each project, and to build every rural village and town in Tri-Aea into a tourist attraction.
To play a leading role in the 100 Days of Action for Investing in the Services of Society, to promote a number of major projects and the construction of parks, to ensure the placement of high-quality projects and to implement the requirements of the major actions.
The Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee, the Secretary of the Shia Municipal Committee Zhang Liu, the Deputy Premier Wang Lu, and the Secretary General of the Provincial Government Lu Yi took part in the research conference.
Liu Xiaobo won 18 world titles in his 14-year career, becoming the first person in Chinese Olympic history to win four Olympic gold medals.
She held the world No. 1 ranking for eight consecutive years and is the longest-serving female athlete in the history of table tennis.
On September 26, 2010, he became Deputy Secretary General of People's Daily and General Manager of People's Search Network Shares Company, a member of the Executive Committee.
Earlier today, she will work with Liu Min Hong to create the country's first platform for innovation and entrepreneurship in the sports industry.
There is also a group of star coaches on the Chinese gymnasium: they have won countless honors for the country in the era of athletes, and after retiring, they pass on their years of learning to later ones, cultivating the middle class championship.
As China's first world champion in men's gymnastics, Huang Yu chose to take up teaching after retiring.
From coach of the women's team to coach of the men's team, and then to head coach, Huang Yue made a legendary Olympic gold medal team, leading the team to a legendary 9 gold, 1 silver and 4 bronze medal at the Beijing Olympics.
Since then, Tendao has been a constant publicity spokesperson, and in recent years has played important roles such as the bullfighter, the lightning bolt, and the other.
Many NBA players have proven their strengths, but some progress and some fall.
Whether due to age or limited playing time, some players' performances will decline each season.
Of course, some of the steps may be a shrinking of data, and the strength of these players may not have decreased.
Even though Wade is still one of the best point guards in the league, his performance with the Bulls shouldn't be so hot.
He has limited range in the backfield with the Rondo team, and the star Butler's three-point shot rate is only 32.8%, which makes their offense cluttered next season.
Coming to Windsor City, Flashman will have to give more ball rights to Butler and Londo, who are likely to choose to make a living in the regular season.
Okafor's situation was embarrassing, as the 76ers first pick last season, and he had to compete with Simmons and Enfield for playing time and ball rights in the new season.
The competition may not come soon, Simmons needs to adapt to the NBA playoffs, and Enfield needs to recover fully from his injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafor can be in the 76ers is a question.
Last season, Okafor scored 32% from the low-point offense, which was higher than Cousins, Vucic and Brooke Lopez, while his utilization rate was also high in the league's top 40.
With Simmons already demonstrating excellent controls and Enfield having a better NBA personality, it is hard to believe that Okafor's position will be so firm again.
Over the past two seasons, Thompson's utilization rate has stabilized in the league's top 20, which is also the best two seasons of his career.
The problem is that Thompson's usage will decline with Durant's arrival, which will inevitably affect his performance.
This impact will not only affect the number of starts, but the offense of the team will certainly be greatly reduced next season, which in some respects will reduce the difficulty of the opponent against him.
Durant's arrival will certainly shrink the numbers of the Warriors, but the biggest shrinkage is probably Thompson.
But this does not mean that the level of the God of the Sea is retreating, it is more like he sacrificed for the team as a whole.
Parker performed better than the data reflected last season, not only because his basketball efficiency reached a career high, but because he and Aldridge's chemistry benefited the Spurs.
Duncan retired, and Gennobili declared another year of war, and the GDP portfolio finally came to an end, as one of the youngest of the three, the tank of the French sports car was running out of oil.
After winning his third overall ring, only Jabal, Jordan and Russellby James won more regular season MVPs, while Jordan was the only FMVP to beat James Stowe.
Oh, right, James just brought Cleveland its first professional sports championship trophy in 52 years.
James, who is entering his 14th season, needs better physical strength to prepare for the playoffs.
So, in the regular season, James' data is likely to drop further, and he will assign more burdens to Owen, but he will still easily be the top three player in the league.
You must use the skills you have learned from your country to promote in Russia.
On 12 local time, President Huang Shih, Chairman of the Moscow Association of Chinese Warsawers, spoke enthusiastically when he saw the Chinese news reporter.
Recently, she participated in a Chinese talent training course organized by the Chinese State Council's Office of Foreign Affairs and held by the University of Nanchang.
When I first attended the training class, I had no idea where to start with bookmaking, and after the training class, I was able to draw and write my own work.
Once back in Moscow, it is imperative that you use the knowledge and skills you have learned to contribute to the spread and promotion of Chinese culture.
The Secretary General of the Russian Chinese Cultural Promotion Association, Nan Yan Wei, who also participated in this training session, felt the same way.
She said that she has made great progress with the help of her classroom teachers, but also feels her responsibility as a Chinese culture overseas communicator.
Yang Wei said that after returning to Russia, he was determined to spread and promote traditional Chinese culture among Chinese and Russians who love Chinese culture.

Representatives of Deca Luxury are known in China as Bayern Munich, Dortmund and famous stars Thomas Mueller, Ram, Guterres.
In conjunction with the Weibo, Yu-Gi-Oh and Weibo Chinese platforms that have already been launched by Defa, Defa hopes to provide Chinese fans with a broader and more convenient channel to get the latest news about the league.
England won silver in the men's sevens rugby competition and Fiji won gold.
In the final of the seven-man rugby match on Thursday night, the British team failed to continue their excellent performance before being beaten 43-7 at Rio Tiororo Stadium by Fiji.
Fiji won the gold medal for their unbeatable performance in control, snatching, dodging, cooperation, running and strength, the first Olympic medal in the country's history.
The silver medal was also a minor consolation for the defeated British team, which was the third silver medal won by the British team that day. This was enough to make the British rugby team proud: they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa in the first seven-man rugby competition that entered the Olympics.
Earlier that day, the British team beat South Africa 7-5, which may have affected their position in the final.
But in any case, the Fiji team is now enough to beat a team of 15 spirited.
Tomorrow, at least one Englishman will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort to the English team, but it may not be. This Englishman is Ben Ryan, head coach of the Fiji team from Wimbledon, who was the head coach of the English team.
It is not easy for the British team to achieve today's results.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's coaching, they failed to win the Adelaide International Seven-man Rugby Championship.
And now they are just one step away from the championship.
Although they were hit hard, they made amazing progress.
Fiji took the lead in the opening game, leaving the British team without any fighting power.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like hitting a series of buses in the way. When Ossi Corinese stormed into the Horned Frogs, the World Series champions had a 5-0 lead.
After just four minutes, Jerry Touwai scored again with a touchdown on the right wing.
12-0 England hardly ever touched the ball.
Mitchell's strong blockage allowed Giant Leon Nacalawa to miss the third time, but it only slowed Fiji's score.
At 7 minutes, Asa Welamaru touched the right corner, 17-0 and the British team took the lead.
Carava scored another point, with one minute left in the first half of the game.
Then Watmo Lavoie broke through the defence of the English team and reached the goal line.
The score was already 29-0 at halftime.
The Fijians are born to play rugby union in seven-man format, while the British team is still the first to emerge.
This is the case.
The British team made a huge change in the second half and shook the Fijians' defensive line for the entire quarter, which was good for the first half. But afterwards the Fijians played a great match, scored again by Joshua Tuesova.
Dan Norton created a scoring opportunity for England, who changed the score to 36-7 with a left corner, but the game was already under the control of the South Sea island nation, with their fans singing loudly, waving flags and carrying a song dance on the platform.
The fantastic performance of the Fiji team is something to applaud.
Mata William stopped the Fiji team at the last minute in a meaningless attack.
The final whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced each other, and the defeated British team could only regret their retirement.
Earlier that day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in the semi-final, while England beat South Africa in a fierce semi-final match.
In the first half, Kyle Brown helped South Africa to lead, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with a good kick.
Afterwards, Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, with a brilliant interception, secured the team's victory, and the English team eventually won the silver medal.
Helen Grahn and Heather Stanning, encouraged by their cancer-stricken coach, won the gold medal in the yacht race
Without exaggeration, this is the most moving gold medal.
From the first time they rowed to now, Helen Grau and Heather Stanning have received 220 punitive pull-up training, and their win at the Estacio da Lagoa has even more extraordinary significance.
Although only the two of them were on the boat, the voice of the rowing coach Robin Williams, who was also on the boat, accompanied them to the second consecutive Olympic gold medal in women's doubles, the first British pair to reach this height.
They have maintained a record of 39 undefeated games and have an absolute advantage.
What we saw was that these two talented athletes were doing well on the water, but that wasn't all of the victory.
Behind every gold medal is a lot of volunteer help, and it is their constant dedication that makes the difference, and the biggest help is a coach who learned 30 months ago that he had cancer and didn't know if he would see it alive.
As he said, death could come at any time.
I had bladder cancer and they operated on me.
If not performed, cancer cells will spread throughout the body.
This would make things much worse.
This will change your mind a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he started treatment in early 2014 and the effect will be minimal, although it may not be appropriate to say so in this case.
I need to get paid, so I have to get better quickly.
This is an inspiration for me.
I live in the hospital, and although they say walking a few steps is enough, I walk 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet around the hospital every time.
This is the beginning of everything.
The racing boat sport itself is a journey, which makes it a little longer.
The moment they took the gold, they first thought of Williams. This morning Williams spoke a little more than usual, in order to overcome his anxiety.
Stanning, who was the captain of the Royal Artillery team, said she would travel to Afghanistan after the week: "I'm in a bad mood, maybe a little extreme, but the meaning of this gold medal is extraordinary".
It repeatedly told me how important this was to me, and how much effort Helen and Robin put in.
This is the return of three years of hard work Helen, Robin and I have been working towards.
Without Robin, we would be just a little unnamed, and I am very grateful to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn't find a better coach and coach than him.
Helen Grahn and Heather Stanning have not lost in five years.
The punitive intensity set for the combination is unmatched by their opponents.
Even as the final 500 metres approached, New Zealand and Denmark still had a large body of energy.
It was a shock.
Helen shouted: "Keep the pace, keep the pace".
It is very important not to be affected by the opponent.
We had a good start, and we didn't expect to do anything amazing.
We didn't think about today's glory, we just thought about making every move and winning this game, and we did.
The combination spent a year deciding their future.
Graeme will marry TV explorer Steve Baxhar next month.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say this is my last match.
This will put too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I was the Olympic champion.
It was a whole new experience and I was very nervous.
It's been about four minutes now.
She said that I feel better.

Bulgaria experienced inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria in July was 1%.
This is the highest inflation rate in years since June 2012. The inflation rate broke zero for the first time since last October (inflation rate 0.2%).
Compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015), the average annual inflation rate (measured by the Consumer Price Index) for the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) was -0.8%.
Compared to June 2016, the consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0%, which is a monthly inflation rate of 1.0%.
Inflation rate this year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2%. Compared to July 2015 and July 2016, annual inflation rate was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, prices for the following categories of consumer goods increased in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), and other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices declined in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, home appliances and regular maintenance (0.5%) and medical care (0.1%).
Alcohol and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, natural gas and other fuels, communications and education remained at the same price as last month.
Snapchat's animated animation effect has been criticized for ironically taunting Asians.
Snapchat said the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers believe it was racially colored.
Snapchat's 150 million daily users can change reality and make people funny through its filtering tools.
You can turn yourself into a mouse, a dog or a character in a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
These lenses have curved and curved effects, producing over 30 million modified self-images every day.
Any mistake will be immediately noticed by the public.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized for being motivated to play black or be beautiful with white skin.
So when the app offered some users a filter this week that could create eyelashes, teeth, and pink facial effects, some critics called it a racial satire on Asian yellow-legged human beings.
They even think that these recurring issues mean that the company has a bigger problem with diversity.
News from The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday sparked outrage after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company explained that the filter is a tribute to the characters of the anime, not a satire on Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of a damaging stereotype in reality.
Others are also firmly opposed to the cartoon images.
One of the Korean-American art students who tweeted about the photos and shared them widely said in an email that the lenses were at least unpleasant and uncomfortable.
She also said that it is difficult to distinguish the extremely disgusting Asian irony image from the effect of the filter.
Although the filter is not just yellow people, the yellow people are extremely underestimated.
Snapchat is not the only company touching these cultural baseline.
From the board of directors to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have been advocating for diversity and inclusion.
Snapchat's large youth population may be sensitive because of racial diversity more than the older generation.
When a Snapchat filter created an image of insulting users, 25-year-old Zuccetti (translation) said in an interview on Thursday: "These things are harder to get out of the public eye than before".
Ms. Ju, who is a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account on Thursday and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article she wrote for Medium and a telephone interview, she said she felt that the racial controversy reflected Snapchat's lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process.
Ms. Ju criticized the company's employees as mostly white, the leadership as entirely male, and added a tag at the end of the article: #DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese-American, Ms. Zhu said: "Either their employees are not of color, so they can make such a decision, or their employees are of color, but their position does not allow them to say what they want".
Other observers shared complaints that she was not responded to by Snapchat.
The company did not release data on employee diversity and said it was a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of its employees on Thursday, but a spokesperson said the company recently hired a recruiter who focused on the low internal proportion and promoting internal inclusivity.
Ms Ju said she would close her Snapchat account: "I wonder if they need more users like us who oppose this behavior".
The congressional team said that military officials distorted ISIS intelligence
A congressional panel released a report Thursday that officials at the U.S. Central Command changed the intelligence report to describe the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than it actually is.
The midterm report comes from a special task force composed of the chairman of the Republican National Committee of the House Military Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the House Appropriations Committee. The report said there was widespread discontent among intelligence analysts at the Central Command, who said their superiors were distorting their assessment of the war between the United States and Islamic State.
Centcom, located in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a press release about the report, intelligence reviewed by senior leaders of the Central Command is more optimistic about the U.S. counterterrorism operation than the actual situation, and always more optimistic than other intelligence agencies' analysis.
A Republican representative from California said that the behavior of the Central Command was unacceptable. On the one hand, our warriors suffered from war, and on the other hand, high policymakers received the wrong analysis.
The issue of leadership of the Central Command has extended to the highest levels of the institution.
The report details the longstanding problems facing Central Command in describing and analyzing the training of US forces in Iraq in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the changes, the analysts felt pressure from the leaders of the Central Command to make them express a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL), according to the report's description.
The report said that in the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and congressional testimony from the Central Command were much more optimistic than in reality.
For example, an official at the Central Command publicly stated that a large military operation could take Mosul back as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under Islamic State control.
Republican Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas said in a statement that the results are clear after months of investigation.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most of the top intelligence officials at the US Central Command manipulated the command's intelligence products to conceal the threat posed by Islamic State in Iraq.
The Republican Party formed a special task force after it learned from analysts that intelligence on Islamic State was manipulated.
As the investigation continues, more findings will follow the report released on Thursday.
The Attorney General of the Ministry of Defense also conducted a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their findings Thursday, in agreement with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
The Democratic leader representing Sheaanda of the committee said in a statement that between 2014 and 2015, the Central Command developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessment of the Islamic State and Iraqi security forces.
Mr. Sheaanda said that the process of the process impeded the release of intelligence, lowered the morale of analysts and prevented the acceptance of different opinions.
But Mr. Sheaanda and Democrats also said they found no evidence to prove that the palace was trying to pressure the Central Command analysts, so their conclusions were consistent with the false premise or political narrative.
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of the Congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's attorney general began investigating after receiving complaints from the Central Command division.
Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Department of Defense had not commented on the congressional report until the attorney general's investigation was completed.
But he said that while the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense sometimes disagree on interpreting complex data, they encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security issues.
The impact of this investigation has surpassed the question of whether the US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria have been successful (according to increasing numbers of Defense Ministry officials).
But last year, these claims raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can trust the Central Command's assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of IS intelligence is reminiscent of the controversy over a decade ago, when Gregory Hook, an intelligence analyst at Central Command, wrote a research paper, noting that despite opposition from numerous analysts, the administration of George Bush insisted on sending small-scale troops to Iraq and barely considered the situation after the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hook played a key role in this campaign against the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr. Hook's team concluded that the airstrikes on the Islamic State refinery did not significantly reduce the terrorist group's economic income as the terrorist group built temporary refineries to continue selling oil on the black market, which is in stark contrast to the statement released.
According to the September report in the weekly manga magazine Time of the Moon, the Central Command did not publish the findings to the outside world.
When several lawyers reviewed Senate testimony about over-optimistic assessments of the war, Central Command Command Commander Lloyd Austin III was criticized last year.
General Austin retired in April and is currently replaced by Joseph Waters in his position at Central Command.
The United States won four straight games in women's hockey and will play England in the final.
Katie Bam, who won the match 6-1 against Japan, led the American women's hockey team for the second time on Thursday, helping the United States defeat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games were a staggering four, but Bam, 27, said she didn't know she had such a great performance.
She said: "Oh, I don't know anything about this.
I'm not the kind of person who remembers having hit a few balls.
What she knew was that the U.S. team had won four straight games at the Olympics and would be tied for first place with the British team, who had not lost since defeating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States faced each other in the final match of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams will play in the quarter-finals of the promotion play-offs, which will determine who will appear as group one.
The team that gets Group 1 will avoid meeting the strong Dutch team, so that they can go further. The Dutch team will come out as the first of another group.
In Saturday's game, the U.S. team performed a marvel. At the London Olympics four years ago, the U.S. team finished last out of 12 teams.
Bam was also in the team at the time.
Bam grew up in Bruebell, Pennsylvania, picked up her first hockey stick at age 3 (her twin sister was playing hockey in Drexel) and joined the national team at age 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team to date.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she failed to make the final list.
In 2012, she and her teammates were not treated well.
The next year, Englishman Craig Panham took over as head coach, and things started to change.
"Oh, this is a cultural, mental and material change", said Bam.
We were not at the current level in London at the time.
We have come to a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam took the lead with a close-up shot from the opposing hand goal in the first half.
India had not yet tasted the results of the match, but the team showed amazing stamina and maintained their 1-0 lead until the end of the third period, when the boom occurred.
She ran the ball along the left side of the field, then cut the inside into the middle, and pulled the shot into the net, leading the American team 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The United States were the first to close the gap to goalkeeper Jackie Bridges in the competition, scoring one goal in each of the first three victories.
This time she was super-normal.
And so is Bam.
"We are in a good position now, but how good we are will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game", said Panam.
Cold acidic food during the Great Depression in the food pantry
In March 1933, newly elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down in the presidential office to enjoy lunch.
As a culinary person, President Roosevelt loved Fifth Avenue cuisine, such as chili peppers and Maryland seafood.
His menu was simple that day: tomato-flavored devil's egg, potato mud and fruit pudding as a snack.
Jane Zigman said: "Oh, this is to share suffering with those who are suffering in food.
Her husband Andrew Ko added: "This is also a reflection of the American way of eating".
This couple, who live in the Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Mr. Koh's previous book, The Culinary Meal, is about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ms. Ziegman, in her book, The Fruit Garden, tells the life stories of poor neighborhood tenants through food.
Their new book, co-authored by Harper's Bazaar, will be published Tuesday by Harper's Press, which will explore the history of food in the United States during the Great Depression.
After showing some common insights on food, they met a journalist at a sandwich shop in Eisenborg. This simple lunch counter in the Liu district has been in business since the 1929 economic boom.
Ms. Zigman, 54, ordered a cream cheese with a sliced olive sandwich, while Mr. Ko, 57, ordered a turkey, potato mud and vegetable pie.
The reporter pointed to a chicken roll, which the couple thought was a good way to discuss the diet during the Great Depression.
Ms. Zigman said: "The bread was very popular at the time.
There was peanut bread, liver bread, soy bread.
They are made with a raw material and a cheap cap that can be rolled on the raw material.
Imagine that your dinner is peanuts.
Mr. Ko played a strange role.
He said: "They must be like chicken in your stomach".
In the years before the Great Depression, Americans ate their own cafes, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cooked food for male farm workers, and breakfast, lunch and dinner were just made out of pie.
During the war, it was the Americans who delivered food to hungry Europeans. The rich menu show how the country suddenly ceased to be a rich place.
Mr. Koh explained why he and his wife were writing the book: "At that time, food had become a major topic that made Americans uncomfortable".
Another unpleasant topic is the new foods with cold acid: the food with a crust like bread and stews became the main dish, and stews are the best way to cook leftovers, Ms. Ziegman said, because chefs can use the cream in the food to mask the difficult food.
Fresh fruits are replaced by cheap cranberries.
The meat that has been the main character at American tables for years has become a rare luxury item.
Strangely, the big mess is about calories, not taste, and even basic sense of taste, and nutrition is the first thing people think about.
In the course of researching the book, including various recipes, Ms. Zigman made a roasted onion filled with peanut oil.
Mr. Ko said: "This is not common at dinner tables.
Ms. Zigman said: "Oh, that's weird too.
The oil of citrus fruits and the onion cannot be combined.
This is a feature of many family economic meals.
Family economists influenced the country's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as head chef of the Federal Home Economics Bureau from 1923 to 1943, which is unique in history.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to be careful about cooking and courageously turning bad foods like cream and carrots into delicacies.
The rich cuisine is a rich history of cuisine.
Particularly interesting is the government's response to starving people, such as President Herbert Hoover's criticism of others.
Although he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse he had as a child, his diet was as refined as that of a millionaire.
Mr. Ko said: "I like to eat European Western dishes, such as fish with cucumber".
He was wearing a nightgown and dining in a restaurant with a gold plating.
He clearly separated himself from the people.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if it hadn't been for his wife, Eleanor, who encouraged him to set an example in dieting.
As the book says, the housekeepers employed by Mrs. Roosevelt had no interest in taste, so the cooked food in the White House was not only the hardest food to eat in Washington, but also the worst cooked food.
When the United States returned to normal, many of the ways of dealing with the Great Depression were abandoned.
Ms. Ziegman said that what remains is our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to the diet.
The couple said that while writing the book, they learned more about Ms. Ziegman's mother's dietary habits, such as how she didn't throw away food.
Mr Ko said: "She is very afraid of wasting food.
Ms. Zigman recalled: "She actually caused many people to get sick.
For example, there was once a case of cream bubble.
After removing the plate, she and Mr. Ko took out a dessert they had prepared at home: this is the fruit pudding President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
Ms. Ziegman said: "This is called cream and fruit sauce, and adding that a new trend in the name of a regular dish is the usual trick".
The dessert has no cream, only fruit juices, a little flour, sugar, water and meat juices.
Everyone is trying hard to make it into the sticky brown paste.
Unsurprisingly, the dessert tastes good.
Mr. Ko ate the second spoon, the third spoon.
He felt that this was an acceptable, convenient dessert and told his wife: "Taking a piece of crushed walnut would be better".
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, while Saudi production reached new highs.
The report does not prevent the market from casting doubt on OPEC's credibility, and the road to recovery in oil prices is still full of thorns.
On Monday, OPEC President and Qatar's Energy Minister Sadha said that OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
OPEC's monthly report released Wednesday showed that production of the entire OPEC organization, including the Cuban oil, rose to 36,110,000 barrels per day in July.
OPEC also said in its monthly paper that low crude oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil products, adding to the extent of market surplus supply.
Under the influence of this news, coupled with the US's upward expectations of crude oil production and the unexpected increase in crude oil inventories, international oil prices have fallen for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday's close, the New York Commodity Exchange's September delivery of light crude oil futures fell 2.48%, and the October delivery of London Brent crude oil futures fell 2.07%.
Reuters believes that the proposed oil congress is unlikely to significantly tighten supply, and the data released by the US Energy Information Administration also undermines market popularity.
Iran's official news agency Fars quoted Iranian Oil Minister Zaganin as saying Wednesday that Iran's production of crude oil reached a peak of 3.85 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
As soon as news of the meeting was announced, Russian Energy Minister Novak said that there was no need for a new round of talks on the production of lithium at the current oil price.
The last oil producing countries meeting was held in April and OPEC members failed to reach an agreement on any measures.
Emma Richards, an analyst at BMIResearch Oil and Gas, said that markets and media may overreact to OPEC's meeting.
Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC would change the mood of the market by releasing signals that they would promote the agreement.
This means that smoke and mirrors are like the ones that open the eyes of people (which intentionally give the wrong impression).
Eugen Weinberg, head of commodity research at the German Commercial Bank, said that OPEC was unlikely to try to stabilize the market through the September meeting.
This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, which has played a role in the last time.
The focus of the screening is on the illegal publication of medical advertisements, complaint reporting centers, and medical institutions that have already been punished multiple times.
The National Health and Medical Research Council and the National China Medical Administration will inspect the progress of the special supervision and inspection work carried out in some provinces in due course.
According to media reports, due to the massive influx of capital into Internet medicine, which has caused serious problems with the homogenization of current products, the investment momentum has declined and capital has entered the observation period.
According to data from the Center for Management Research at the Elipe Hospital in Hong Kong, Internet healthcare companies have suffered a lot of deaths in the first year of their foundation, and about 20% of the start-up Internet healthcare companies have ceased to exist.
However, while most Internet healthcare companies struggle on the financing path of Round A or Round B, some of the leading companies in the segment still have the opportunity to gain capital.
It seems that Internet medical startups should not be left alone, but focus on market demand, focus on specialism and deep practice.
Fish jump invested 12.2 million yuan, accounting for 40 percent of the registered capital, and Kyushu General Mechanical Company invested 18.3 million yuan, accounting for 60 percent of the registered capital.
In recent years, with the support of the country's policies on medical informatization, the electronic and integrated supply chain management system has gradually entered hospitals at all levels.
Fish jump's collaboration with Kyushu General is targeting market demand to help hospitals build advanced supply chain management systems and seeking more cooperation as an opportunity.
Unlike many Internet healthcare companies, iBaby has focused on the vertical area of Internet delivery from the beginning, deeply cultivating both pregnancy and doctors.
Pregnant women can not only consult a doctor for free 24 hours and one-on-one, but also pay for directed medical consultations.
On the doctor's side, iBaby broke the geographic limit by taking the form of organizational experts to give doctors at the grassroots level online lectures, peer exchange, case discussions, etc.
Currently, doctors are opening three panels, namely for doctors to continue their education, doctors to socialize and doctors to seek help.
Provide services including online learning, case discussions, academic exchange; social platforms between hospital and classroom doctors; legal assistance for patient relationships or personal life; and entrepreneurial support.
According to media reports, CEO Wang Liu recently said Ali Health Liu was willing to take a deep breath to get health big data.
Internet companies and data companies lack professionalism and are not united in the way they write the same words.
Ali currently has three units in the medical health field: Ali Health, the Tamalpais Medical Center and Paypal Future Hospital.
Wang said that medical health startups will be harder than other industries, and it's not just about how much money, but also about being calm and tolerating loneliness and slowly doing it.
Watching the Olympics continuously at night is easy to damage the heart
The Brazilian Olympic Games are going on like wildfire, and even if the games are broadcast at midnight in the country, many citizens will watch them at night.
In this regard, doctors especially warned that watching the race at night is a health hazard that could cause cardiovascular disease.
If the hormone is secreted for a long time at night, the body is continuously in a state of tension and excitement, cannot be restored normally, and is prone to causing blood clotting and high blood pressure, which causes cardiovascular disease.
Han Ji specifically warned that groups with cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood fat, smoking habits, family history of diseases, are more likely to cause cardiovascular disease if they stay up late.
If you stay up late, not only are cardiovascular functions affected, but also gastrointestinal function, immune system, and neurotransmitter system, and even the risk of developing tumors increases.
To his old friends, Han Ji advised that they do their best not to spend the night watching the Olympics, especially those with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last FIFA World Cup, Han Ji-yeon had a patient in his 60s who had a heart attack or watched a game at night.
Han Ji-yeong explained that since this year, his clinic has diagnosed some patients with heart attack or stroke around the age of 25, which is largely due to the patients' long-term sleeping lifestyle.
1. Do not spend the night watching your favorite sports program every day, and occasionally watch the sports program at night, and other programs may wait until the next day to watch the event.
2. Supplementing with water at night, eating more fruit, preventing blood clots and boosting body immunity.
Beijing Time, August 12 News In the women's 50m rifle three-position final at the 2016 Rio Olympics, Chinese senior general Duri won the bronze medal.
Duri became the leader of the Olympic Four Dynasties, and won two gold medals, one silver and one bronze medal in four Olympic Games.
In 1998, he joined the Shandong Provincial Shooting Team and followed Wang Dewin's training to train in shooting professionally.
In June 2003, she took part in the World Cup shooting in Croatia, winning the women's 10m air rifle gold medal and breaking the world record with 504.9 laps.
In August 2004, she won the gold medal for the women's 10m air rifle and won the gold medal for the Chinese team at the Athens Olympics.
In August 2008, he won the Olympic gold medal in the 50m rifle triathlon, breaking the Olympic record with a total score of 690.3.
In August 2012, after the London Olympics, Duri filed a temporary retirement application with the International Radiation Federation.
In January 2015, Duri announced that the national team would return to training and prepare for the Rio Olympics.
In March 2016, the Rio Olympics qualification process ended and eight years later she qualified for the women's 10m air rifle Olympics again.
On August 6, 2016, in the women's 10m air rifle event at the Rio Olympics, Durie won the silver medal with a score of 207 rounds.
On August 12, 2016, she won bronze in the women's 50 metre rifle three positions event at the Rio Olympics.
The film is expected to premiere on Central Television and LTV early next year, and will also be launched in a full-scene VR documentary version for the first time.
The documentary, The Polar Earth Project, is a large-scale project focusing on the Tibetan Plateau at the Third Pole of the Earth, telling the story of Tibetan tradition and modern interplay and interaction with the world from a whole new perspective.
The biggest advantage of VR is that it gives viewers a unique sense of visual immersion, which also raises higher demands on the shooting process.
The filming team for the special edition of the VCR of the Panorama of the Polar Region said that they want to ensure that every aspect of the image is unprovoked and gives the audience a sense of place.
On August 11, the Special War Sniper Team of the Shandong General Staff of the Armed Police arrived in Kunming Mountain at high temperatures of 34 degrees Celsius to train in jungle.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union sent missiles to Cuba, almost leading to a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.
The incident was seen as the culmination of the Cold War, and history calls the Cuban Missile Crisis the culmination of the war.
But little is known about the fact that a powerful solar storm that was also during the Cold War led to the United States launching a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, which was not first reported by researchers outside until August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a powerful solar storm severely interfered with radar and radio communications for the US military in the Arctic.
These radars were part of the US ballistic missile warning system, used to monitor Soviet missiles.
The paper, completed by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed US military personnel who were involved in forecasting and analyzing solar activity at the time, and consulted non-classified literature.
The paper writes that in the 1960s, the US Air Force always had a portion of the warplanes carrying nuclear warheads flying in the sky to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly starting a nuclear war.
The US military commander did not know that the culprit in the interference was the solar storm and not the Soviet Union, so he ordered the fighter to enter combat readiness.
Fortunately, the US military's research into solar activity and electromagnetic interference with Earth, which began in the late 1950s, ultimately prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the US Air Force Air and Weather Bureau and submitted a detailed report.
The direct consequence of this solar storm was that the US military has since considered space weather an operational concern and established a stronger space weather forecasting system.
Citizens find their car being blocked by a strange vehicle on their daily journeys, and can use the WeChat mobile car lock function to solve this problem without contacting the driver.
On August 11, Xi'an Police launched the Weibo mobile phone service.
After the launch of this service, citizens can solve such problems in their daily life by using the WeChat mobile car lock function when they encounter a strange vehicle that blocks their vehicle from driving while the driver is not there.
The new service features are quick and administrative cost savings; second, respect and protection of citizens' personal privacy; and third, full-time and full-time service.
As long as citizens have WeChat, they can operate themselves very conveniently, which allows both sides of the car to meet in a friendly and easy way, alleviate parking problems and reduce the number of traffic safety cases.
On the other hand, for the owner of vehicles who refused to move, stopped illegally or obstructed passing, the Xi'an traffic authority said that the traffic police will take different handling measures depending on the actual situation.

The highly regarded Beijing Olympic men's singles champion, Spanish giant Nadal, won the men's singles title in two straight sets and advanced to the eighth position.
As the gold medalist, Nadal, who had a unique love for the Olympics, he was wounded and unhealing, this time with a third-place finish, and won the bronze medal.
He and team-mate Lopez will compete for gold medals in the men's doubles final with Romanian players Tekau and Megia.
The Rio Olympics women's singles event saw several seed players withdraw from the competition, and after days of intense competition, the women's singles were all born on the 11th.

On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly published a new edition of the Joint Defense Cooperation Policy in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more aggressive role globally.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Carter, U.S. Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Kishi Tan-Weng-shing and Japanese Defense Minister Sheng-gu Yuan attended a press conference in New York that day.
This is the fifth time that the Chinese People's Think tank has published the Japanese Military Force Assessment Report and the fourth time that it has been published in English.
Chapter 9 of the report includes general policy adjustments, military strength, defense budget, military deployment, weapons equipment, institutional reforms, military training exercises, military security cooperation with foreign countries, military security relations with China, and more.
The report said that 2015 was the year of the phase-out of the Abe government's major policy adjustments in the security field for several years running.
From now on, Japan's security initiatives will be primarily at the operational level, such as the application of the law, strategic implementation, policy implementation, rather than the substantial adjustment and change of frameworks, mechanisms and policies.
The report stressed that Abe's Cabinet tried to break through the above three points to achieve the multiple goals of promoting Japan's normal national makeup, self-defense forces to intervene in international security matters, strengthening the alliance between Japan and the United States, and anti-China.
Previously, the China Strategic Cultural Promotion Council released its assessment report on Japanese military strength on June 5, 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014, and June 30, 2015.
The Financial Times published a graph of the official residence of the US ambassador to China on August 12.
The article said that the opposite is that the US ambassador's residence, from the outside, could be used as a safe house in the next film adaptation of John Le Carré's Cold War spy novel.
The official residence is gray and is protected with a guardrail, a second floor wall, a threaded wire mesh and a vehicle roadblock.
Filling up the shortboard for public sports facilities
The black and uncluttered coalfield warehouse became a green football field like a green grass; the factory with the red-hot top became a modern sports hall.
On the National Fitness Day, the South Lamma Camp Sports Cultural Park outside the Wangjiang Gate in Hangzhou unveiled the mysterious face of the temple.
It used to be a coal mine, which was abandoned after closing more than a decade ago, leaving a large amount of illegal buildings and living waste.
After being restored, it became a sports and cultural park and will be officially opened to the public in November, providing free sports facilities to the public, and without a doubt opened up a whole new ground for all-national sports.
This is reminiscent of Hangzhou Chenhua University, where Chinese swimmers have swum for multiple world champions.
The name of the pool will be generated continuously, and the rich crowd base provides a good basis for selecting professional athletes, which vividly interprets the relationship between athletics and public sports.
The level of athletics is closely related to the foundations of folk sports, whereas athletics in a sense depends on folk sports, while folk sports depends on the conditions of the venue.
As of 2015, the per capita area of sports stadiums in China, although 150 times larger than when the new China was founded, is reportedly far behind the sports power.
In June this year, the State Council issued the "All People Fitness Plan" (2016-2020) to focus on the development of mass sports.
To fill this shortcut, on the one hand, relevant departments should take full account of the layout of the sports venues when planning the city.
On the other hand, public sports stadiums that have been built, including sports stadiums in units such as schools, should be expanded as much as possible to increase the efficiency of use.
Just as the Rio Olympics are going on like wildfire, it inspires people's enthusiasm for sport and awakens the awareness of participation.
Guild was awarded a lawyer's fee in the patent fight against Merck's hepatitis C.
According to the judgment of the US District Judge, Gilead Science is entitled to the attorney's fees arising from the patent litigation with the American pharmaceutical company Merck Group for hepatitis C.
In June, after a U.S. judge found Merck to be guilty of illegal acts, including perjury and other immoral acts, Gilded was exempted from paying $200 million in damages for violating two of Merck's patents for the sale of Gilded's best-seller drugs, Sophie Bouvey and Havana.
In Thursday's lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Beth Lamboison Freeman said Guild did not have to bear the costs of the defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the new generation of hepatitis C drugs. Gilead's drugs can cure more than 90% of hepatitis patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Guild and Merck sued each other, both claiming to be the owners of the laboratory work of the active ingredient in Guild's drug, Sophia Bouvey.
US-backed forces announced they had recaptured Manbi from ISIS
A spokesman for the force said Friday that the remaining Islamic State soldiers in the city had left entirely, and that US-backed forces had complete control of the northern city of Manbi, near the Turkish border.
After the militants hiding in the city left, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping the entire city.
Shalon Darwish, the military commissioner of the Syrian Democratic Forces Alliance in Manbij, told Reuters that they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians who had been kidnapped by militants.
He told Reuters: "The Boommanby season is now under our control, but we are still doing the sweeping".
The Clinton couple paid 34.2% of federal taxes on their income of $10.75 million in 2015.
Hillary Clinton released her tax return for 2105 on Friday, showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal taxes.
In 2015, the Clinton couple's charitable donation amounted to $1 million, most of which was donated to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton's speech fee was nearly $53.3 million, and the former Secretary of State received $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster from a book about her tenure in the State Department.
Clinton's campaign partner, Senator Tim Kane of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, have released their 10-year tax return.
Both paid 20.3% of federal taxes in 2015.
Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane will continue to be the benchmark for financial transparency.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump has been covering up and reclaiming his previous promise to release tax returns on false grounds.
Although the law does not require it, as is customary, US presidential candidates should make their tax returns public.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyers used the audit of the IRS as a reason for refusing to release the tax return.
Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams tweeted that you are the boss and attached a link to the Democratic nominee's tax return form.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special counsel, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release his tax return before the audit was completed.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and others, said Trump's refusal to release the tax return panel raised questions about his net worth, charitable contributions, business transactions and various other relationships, including with Russia.
Clinton took the issue to heart and posted a video online on Friday that high-profile Democrats urged Trump to release his tax bill.
She raised the issue Thursday in her economic policy speech in Michigan.
She told the crowd that for decades, he refused to release his tax return like other presidential candidates.
According to reports from the Huang Politician News Network, Trump paid almost no penny of tax in the 1990s for two years, and the New York Times Huang Business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and accountants on Friday as saying that the current situation may still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a major issue in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named a provision after Warren Buffett, a billionaire investor, that guarantees that people earning more than $1 million annually pay at least 30% of the tax.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire Hathaway is headquartered, and Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also undergoing an audit by the IRS, and Trump's fear is not the tax authorities but the voters.
The earliest tax return issued by the Clinton campaign group was for 2007.
The Clinton couple, who currently reside in Chapaca, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014, and a combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton couple's 2015 tax return shows that unlike most Americans, they earn less than $100.
Their main investment is the low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clinton couple earns $109,000 in dividends and interest.

Jewish filmmakers criticized Berlin Hotel for following Arab customers' demands for the removal of Israeli phone codes. Reuters News
A French filmmaker of Jewish descent told the media that the Berlin-based Kabinski Hotel did not list the Israeli phone code, and the hotel staff said it was in accordance with the demands of Arab customers, which sparked a stir of speculation.
Claude Lonsman, author of the Jewish Holocaust documentary The Pillage, expressed his disappointment with the Kebbinski Hotel and published an open letter in the Frankfurt Reporter in Germany.
During his recent stay, Longman wanted to find Israel on the phone code list provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can call directly from the room.
Did Israel disappear in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany?
Longman wrote.
Instead, guests can call Israel through the call center at the Kevinski Hotel.
In search of explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel's front desk.
In the letter, Longman said he was shocked by the response he received from the front desk.
Hotel staff said that this was a deliberate decision made by the management of the Penkinsky Hotel.
The reason for doing so was to anger the filmmaker.
Longman quoted the employee as saying: "Most of our guests are Arabs and they demand that the code of Israel be removed".
According to the Daily Mail, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas Hendarshman, called the incident a "strange shame".
We were surprised to learn about this incident.
This is a huge shame in itself.
What happened in Germany and the chain of hotels is even more a loss.
This does not require any explanation.
"We hope the hotel can draw the right conclusions", the official said.
The incident sparked a heated debate online, and everyone thought it was a scandal.
Some people think that the Cabinsky Hotel is simply bowing to meet the demands of Arab customers.
Another post pointed out that the hotel was not chewing and pointed out that the street on the famous Kudam Street was near a Jewish church.
According to the Weekly Shōnen Magazine, the hotel quickly clarified all the allegations, claiming that everything was negligent and apologizing to Longman.
The Daily Mail quoted a representative of the Cabinsky representative as saying that he never issued a direct order to remove Israel from the list of rapid dialling.
The paper also said that the code of Israel has been added to the list.
Brazilian students who were expelled from the protest using tear gas and shrapnel
On Thursday, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with police in protest against the government's reform of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and shrapnel to drive out protesters.
The incident was triggered by law enforcement officials trying to disperse students, so police used grenades and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the march, expressing their dissatisfaction with the programs.
To save money, Governor Paul Okmin plans to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students will be transferred.
Some students who took part in the protest expressed their displeasure with the interim president Michel Temer through graffiti on the wall.
Just days before the latest protests, protesters took to the streets in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the state Senate.
Scottish cyclist Carm Skinner won the gold medal for his bike after the title.
Scottish cyclist Carm Skinner helped the British trio win the Olympic gold medal after the 2012 London Olympics in the men's team event at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist replaced his Scottish compatriot Sir Chris Hoey as the centre-back. Even the legendary cyclist was proud of him when Skinner defeated and won the title of New Zealand's hot team.
Four years ago, the British team was a surprise, and Hoey won the fifth of six individual Olympic gold medals.
Hoey retired after finishing sixth at the World Cycling Championships in London in March.
Between the Beijing Olympics and the London Olympics, the problem with the British team was replacing the first round specialist Jamie Staff.
The team did this just when Sinds showed up.
Hoey's retirement also left a gap, and both Chin Emady and Matt Clampton wanted to fill it.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the England men's team coaching staff insisted on getting him into the national team, and Skinner was ultimately not in the spotlight.
Skinner's partners are Sindes and Kenny, who won gold with Hoye four years ago. The three set Olympic records in qualifying but were beaten by New Zealand in the first round.
The three British cyclists eventually beat their opponents to win the gold medal.
Although Sinds was slightly behind, Kenny led the team, and Skinner kept this lead until the end.
The change in strategy was key to this reversal, and Sinds chose a larger aircraft, so the speed was slower, which allowed Kenny, especially Skinner, to keep pace.
Hoey watched the match as a BBC commentator. Skinner, Kenny and Sinds saw him on the podium.
"I was shocked", said Skinner, a 23-year-old cyclist from Glasgow.
I just did my best to make a name for myself.
We set Olympic records in the final and beat the world champions.
This is incredible.
Nothing is more wonderful than this victory.
After winning gold medals with Kenny and Howie at the 2012 London Olympics, Sindes admitted to deliberately falling onto the track after a poor start.
He later retracted the comment, and the English team's opponents could not appeal.
And this victory has no such problem.
"Oh, it's like London, with the British flag on the platform", said Sinda.
We just teamed up three months ago.
We have lost many world championships, so it is amazing to be able to defend the Olympic title.
This is just one game, one gold medal for the British team that won seven of the 10 gold medals in cycling at the Beijing Olympics and London Olympics.
If this is a sign of the progress we have made in the past five months, then we will continue to succeed in the bike shop for the next five days.
According to Kenny's statements, he is not unlikely to repeat Hoai's achievement of winning three gold medals at one Olympics.
If so, Kenney, who was born on March 23 (the day seems to be sacred to British sports, and Steve Redgrave, Mo Farra and Roger Bannister were also born on this day), will have six gold medals and one silver.
This score is on par with Hoai's.
Kenny will fight for the next race, which starts today and will run for three days.
"I'll focus on the game for a while", said the 28-year-old Bolton.
Team competition is always the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
Frankly, one person wins a little lonely.
Sindags said: "If he can win two more gold medals, he should be awarded the Jazz Seal".
This was the only medal-winning match of the day, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Vikings, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Durr were the fastest to advance to the four-man four-kilometer group pursuit.
Their score was 351,943.
The world record for the gold medalist at the 2012 London Olympics was 351,659.
The first round and final (10:42pm) will be held on the second day of the competition today, and Vikings will undoubtedly be the focus of everyone's attention.
Yesterday, he had a dispute with the officials before the qualifying match, when the officials asked him to measure his height.
In the women's group stage, which ends tomorrow, Laura Trot, Joanna Roser Sand, Elino Buck and Kate Archibald from Milwaukee advanced to a new world record 413,260.
The British team relied on their strong local cycling team to take the lead in the mid-Olympic and won multiple medals.
After demonstrating their absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British cycling team was a bit disappointed on their way to Rio.
There were many twists and turns during the period, including the resignation of Tech Director Sean Sutton in April for allegations of sexism and bullying, and the retirement of legendary figures such as Hoey, Victoria Faldington.
But the first match night at the bike shed is enough to prove the legend that the British team will once again perform at a crucial moment in the peak stage.
After the little life comes into this world, parents and parents will be responsible for this life, which is not only about the physical health of the child, but also about the spiritual development, that is, education.
If children fail in education, even if their careers succeed, they cannot make up for the shortcomings of life and the failure of the family.
When a new life comes, new parents need to spend time and energy to look after and educate the child and be responsible for him.
Responsibility lies not only in caring for them physically, but also in their spiritual education, which is to teach them how to be human, how to grow up and how to succeed.
Good family education means parents need to accompany their children regularly, to give them caring and patient care, and to teach them civilized speech and behaviour, so that they learn better and improve their intelligence.
Parents' words affect the growth of their children, and they imitate their parents, which is the people often say that the dragon, the dragon, the mouse, the son will punch a hole, what kind of child the parents are.
So parents need to set a good example in front of their children, regulate their speech and develop their own good qualities, which can indirectly help them to shape a good mindset and make them better.
Amy is a smart, beautiful girl.
She is outgoing and lively, she can get along well with friends and she is also good at adapting to the environment.
But there was a small secret in Amy's heart: she couldn't focus on her studies and work for long.
This secret companion has been with Amy for a long time.

But when the task is heavy and time is tight, Amy feels very painful and tortured.
Individuals resist self-exposure and emotional experiences, and aim to prevent self-awareness and self-esteem from being threatened.
Some behavioral psychologists also view resistance to understanding as individual disobedience to the proper behavior of their behavior.
I tried to get Amy to do an exercise to calm herself down and feel the feeling of the feeling by breathing in a relaxed way.
Once she left the situation she was trapped in, she felt relaxed and regained her freedom.
This year, 63-year-old wanderer Han Mao got into a fight with another wanderer Shao after drinking and was killed with a knife.
Han Mu said that he and the wanderer Han Shu lived in the same area as the city center, more than 20 meters apart.
Han Mao said that on the day of the incident, they were invited by friends to drink together, and they had two quarrels during and after dinner.

Uber entered the Taiwanese market four years ago and has had a major impact on the local traditional taxi industry.
Taiwanese Taipei United reported on August 12 that more than 100 taxis bypassed Taipei's administrative court hall in protest on the morning of August 12, leading to severe traffic jams around the area.
The chairman of the Taipei City Drivers' Union, Liu Xiaobo, said that Uber has been in office for four years, and the authorities had only convened a meeting at the end of this month, so the drivers could not wait any longer.
However, the government has not believed, and it has been delayed and delayed.
The taxis driver who belongs to the lower working class feel cheated by the authorities to compete with Uber, which is illegal but not restricted.
Original title: Jiangsu Farming Farm 2000 sheep were seized by the court for sale by the owner of the farm
After the verdict came into effect, Wang Su did not automatically fulfill the obligations established by the verdict, so he applied to the Yang Yang Court for enforcement.
On October 16, 2014, the Yangtze court issued a civil ruling that only 2,000 eggs from all Li's farms were seized without permission to be transferred or sold.
After receiving the foreclosure ruling, Li Mao privately sold some of the eggs seized in the farm without permission from the Yangtze court.
As of March 8, 2015, when the Yangyang County Public Safety Bureau surveyed, only 142 eggs remained in the farm.
On August 12, the reporter learned that the announcement of the Beijing 2022 Olympic Committee for the Winter Olympics and the Olympic Committee for the Winter Paralympics indicates that the Beijing Olympic Committee for the Winter Olympics inherited intellectual property rights such as the Beijing Olympic Committee for the Winter Olympics flag and symbol.
Without the permission of the Beijing Olympic Committee, no one can use the Beijing Olympic Committee logo for commercial purposes.
The head of the Industrial Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission said today that excess steel capacity is a global problem.
China's capacity utilization rate in recent years is higher than the global average and higher than countries and regions such as the US and Europe.
China has taken decisive and effective measures to eliminate excess capacity, and the results are gradually showing.
The head pointed out that the Central State Council of the Party attaches great importance to the global issue of steel overcapacity.
The State Department deployment is being actively implemented in all departments and regions, and serious work is being carried out, and this year we will reduce the capacity of rough steel by about 45 million tons.
From our country's standpoint, China does not encourage steel exports, but instead takes a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The head stressed that international trade in steel products is essentially market behavior, based on the needs of the importing country, and independent choice of consumers after considering the price of products.
Implementing trade protection measures does not help to fundamentally solve the development problems of the global steel industry, but instead will only cause further impact on the international trade order.
Speaking about debt, the head stressed that debt resolution is an important issue that needs to be properly handled in the process of resolving excess capacity.
Due to the large assets of steel enterprises, which involve large areas, some enterprises have complex debt relationships, which could lead to regional risks if mismanaged.
According to the head, in recent years, as the pressure of the economy declined, the total demand of society gradually weakened, the capacity utilisation rate in some industries decreased, and the difficulties of production and operation of enterprises increased.
Some enterprises are not adapting to the changing market environment, production operations are difficult to maintain and even close to collapse, but restricted by some institutional mechanisms, more barriers to exit the market in a marketed way become zombie enterprises.
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces resource efficiency, increases social management costs and hinders the establishment of a fair competitive market environment.
The main causes of the losses are the volatile market demand and low capacity utilisation, as well as the difficulties faced by the global steel industry.
China mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic means and the rule of law, and the government mainly works to improve the working base and social stability, ensuring fair and equitable market order.
The head stressed that the next step is to firmly continue to work on the capacity, ensuring the completion of the five-year target of 100 million to 150 million tons of raw steel capacity.
On the afternoon of the 10th, the Chinese tourist police made an immediate appearance at Moscow's Red Square, attracting attention, and Chinese tourists waved their welcome with surprise, and local and foreign tourists could not stop to look back.
On the day, members of the tourist police branch of the Shanghai Public Security Authority, China's first professional tourist police team, came to Moscow Red Square to exchange ideas with local tourist police stationed there.
Moscow tourist police patrol three teams at Red Square, Nikolicsky Walk and the Goom department store, and Chinese tourist police train with Liu, and the whole process lasted for more than an hour.
Police officer Luchina, who is in her 20s and speaks English and Spanish, joined the tourist police force last year.
He watched the words of Russian peers carefully along the way, and did not interact with her regularly.
When meeting Spanish tourists to consult, the Moscow tourist police patiently explained to each other in fluent Spanish, which impressed Wang Ice.
The Moscow tourist police have a foreign language, and some even have more than two, which is very touching for us.
As an international tourist island, Hainan is gradually attaining importance to attracting international tourists, and we want to improve our capacity to match the status of international tourist island.
Before studying with Liu that day, the Chinese tourist police also visited the Moscow Metropolitan Police Station to exchange views with their Russian counterparts.
I often interact with Chinese tourists and I am very happy to see them come to Russia.
The questions they often ask are: how to walk, where is a monument, how to rent, how to get back to the hotel.
The captain of the Moscow Metropolitan Police Brigade of the Metropolitan Police said that the urban environment and tourism atmosphere in Moscow has improved in recent years and attracted more foreign tourists.
To adapt to the needs of tourism development, a tourist police force was established in July 2014 to patrol, protect, help and evacuate tourists at major sites.
Currently, all Moscow tourist police are fluent in English, some also speak Spanish and German.
The police force divided them into nine groups based on their foreign language level, taking classes twice a week to learn self-defense tactics, legal regulations and foreign languages.
"We have two tourist police officers who are learning Chinese now, and we have said well, and we will continue to improve their Chinese language", said Zheresazov.
Resacov told reporters that the Moscow Tourism Police has gained some experience since its formation and hopes to inspire its fellow triad.
He believes that cooperation between the police departments of the two Russian-Chinese countries will increase the sense of security for tourism to each other's countries.
The recruitment of the personnel of the Moscow Tourism Police, the police model, the equipment, and the good interaction with tourists have given us a lot of inspiration, Chen Xiaokun said.
Xinhua news reporter Liu Li found that at least nine provincial cities such as Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Guangzhou, Fujian, Beijing have issued residence permit application rules.
For the conditions for applying for a residence permit, the above areas generally propose that you must reside for more than six months and meet one of the conditions of legitimate stable employment, legal stable residence and continuing education.
Xinhua noted that the amount of zinc in the country varies in terms of treatment provided by residence permits, and that the range of public services and facilities provided in some areas has been expanded compared to the provisions of the national version.
These areas have increased the convenience of children taking the local high school examinations under the relevant conditions.
In addition, many places such as Beijing have made clear demands to gradually expand the scope of public services and facilities and to regularly make them public.
For example, Fujian proposed that at least once every three years, the public services and facilities enjoyed by residents of the city are made public to the society.
The Provisional Regulations of the Residence Permits Provisional Provision stipulates that the public security authorities shall produce and issue a residence permit within 15 days of the date of receipt of the residence permit.
The majority of regions agree with the national version, which is issued within 15 days, regarding the time limit for issuing the permit.
Hebei clarified that the residence permits must be issued within three working days from the date of receipt of the residence permits issued by the public security post of residence that meet the conditions of the claim and are complete with materials.
Jiangxi stipulates that the residence permit application conditions are met and the materials are complete, and the public security body must produce and issue the residence permit within five working days from the date of receipt.
According to the Provisional Regulations of the Residence Permits of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the above areas are clear, the first time to claim a residence permit, free of receipt of the document work fee.
For example, Sichuan demands that public security posts or community service agencies in various places strictly implement approved charging projects and charging standards, and firmly prohibit over-reaching, over-standard charging or ride charges.
On July 27, 2016, Chen Yang-yang, the Secretary of the South County Commission of the State of Guangzhou, reported to the provincial judicial commission to work as Director of the Party Wind Wind Supervision Chamber (level of Deputy Director, probationary term of one year).
The red wine served at the evening was provided by the friend himself, and the other costs were borne by someone else.
The Jiangxi Provincial Regulatory Commission reported that Chenyang-hwan, Chen-hwon-hwan and others were organized by private associations and accepted requests to eat, violating the spirit of the central eight regulations and violating the party discipline.
Bogba won two yellow medals in the Italian Cup last season, and one automatically banned as per the rules.
Although he has moved back to the Premier League, the FA still extended its cumulative ban to the Premier League stadium.
Bogba will be a guest at the Bernards on 14 August, and his return to Manchester United debut will be extended to the home game against Southampton on 20 August.
As a rookie No. 12 in 2014, Saritz will officially enter the NBA next season and join the Philadelphia 76ers.
Saritz is a young European player, and many fans don't know much about him, but I believe that Saritz' performance left a deep impression on the people through the Olympics.
In Croatia's last game against Spain, Saric successfully sealed off the last minute attack by Paolo Gassol, who tried to drag the game into extra time.
Recently, 76ers captain Brett Brown gave Saritz a high rating, saying that he saw Saritz' shadow of Manou-Ginobilly as a young man.
It is clear that Saridze has shown his talent and has made 76 people look forward to him.
In Croatia's first two games of the Olympics, Saric scored 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Saritz demonstrated his ability to take up space on the pitch, and after dismantling the match with his teammates, he could hit an outside line in three minutes.
Although the 76ers' lineup currently has many talented young players, they do not have the outfield skills of Saritz.
From the cap to the starting lineup, the number of inline players who can do this on the NBA court today is countless.
Since the start of the Olympics, Saridze has been a complete contender with 13 points, 8 rebounds and 5 assists in three games.
James has signed two consecutive 1+1 contracts since he decided to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014.
As the NBA's current pay agreement enters its final year, James will be at the forefront of negotiating the pay agreement as vice president of the NBA Players Union.
Given the dramatic increase in revenue for the league, thanks to the new TV broadcast agreement, and the dispute between the boss and the players about how to handle the money, the outside world fears the NBA will be stuck in the next summer.
But for James, he doesn't have to worry about becoming a free agent next summer, as he has already signed a three-year contract with the Cavaliers.
Regardless of when the 2017-18 season officially begins, James is under contract.
After the surprise debut of the iPhone SE, the mobile phone market has also been in the spotlight for small screens.
Recently, Nubia also launched the first product of its Z11 series: Nubia Z11mini.
The nubiaZ11mini continues its consistent excellence in photography genes and is equipped with a single-handedly easier to hold 5.0-inch screen and easy to use backhand fingerprint recognition, achieving its outstanding user experience.
The Z11mini, a small screen camera phone that was just launched under nubia, has been reduced by 200 yuan, down from the original 1499 yuan to 1299 yuan.
In terms of appearance, the Nubia Z11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen, the front and the bottom of which is still a classic red-circle aluminum design.
The center frame is metallic, and the bottom is symmetrical in design and configured with a Type-C data interface.
The future of the Portland refinery is uncertain due to the cancellation of the power supply contract
The future of the Portland refinery in Victoria and hundreds of workers at the plant is uncertain as the power company that supplies power to the plant discloses that the plant owner will terminate a supply contract, rendering all supply contracts invalid.
This move came after the Victorian government decided not to continue issuing subsidies to ensure the plant operates.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will end in November.
The 2,000 workers at the Portland plant of the company could be unemployed.
Once the factory is closed, up to 2,000 people may be directly or indirectly unemployed.
And since the power consumption of the plant accounts for about 10% of all electricity output in Victoria, there may also be a chain reaction.
In 2014, Merck closed the Henry Cape refinery, which led to the closure of the Angels Island power plant last year.
The Portland refinery of American Steel is currently losing and is at risk of closing.
The move was made after making predictions about the plant in the coming years, initially due to the strengthening of the AUS, and recently due to the price of the plant products.
AGL supplies power to the large refinery through the old Euphrates power plant in the Latrobe Valley. The company predicts that the owners of three other plants will also terminate their agreement.
The largest shareholder of the plant is a joint venture between the company Meridian and the company Hydrogen Oxide, while China's China Shipping Group and Japan's Muro Red Stock Company also hold a small share.
The joint venture said that AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, meaning that the refinery will continue to generate electricity demand.
AGL said the contracts were the result of a silicon hedge agreement that should have been in effect since November 2016.
The contract expires for 12 months, so they will end in 2017.
The power company said: "So AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in fiscal year 2017.
Any possible revenue impact on AGL from fiscal year 2018 is currently optimistic about wholesale electricity prices in the futures market.
AGL said the company had reduced the contract value of $187 million in the expected amount of the contract in the closing ceremony.
The company said that the decision to terminate these contracts would not affect the ability of the company to operate the refinery or guarantee the power supply of the refinery.
The American company said it signed a 20-year contract with Old Eun in 2010, which was due to come into effect in November, but the company did not explain why it withdrew.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland refinery in Victoria and the Tomaga factory near Newcastle will close due to the poor economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL's chief operating officer Stephen Mickelson said Portland's annual electricity consumption was about 600 MW and the Tomaho plant was about 900 MW.
If the two plants are closed, the demand for the electricity market will be greatly reduced.
"As an electricity company, this is not good news for us", he said.
Community Law Center rejects 160,000 people every year
Every year, more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are rejected by the community legal center. The funding for this service has been overwhelming, and now it faces further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of five people are denied free legal advice and representation services, most of whom are elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without the resources to fight unjust deportation.
The lack of funds for community legal services has long exceeded the limit and now faces further funding cuts.
Starting next June, federal funding for these legal centers will be reduced by another 30%.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Centre, said that thousands of people are denied access to the law every year, according to the latest National Community Association Law Centre Survey report.
Mr Farrell said that the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change the existing decision.
He said that the community law centre in Queensland has been in a long-term state of underfunding, which means thousands will not be able to access the essential services they need.
Those who need to stay away from violence, those who bear huge debts that cannot be paid, families facing breakdown, and workers under pressure, all face legal problems, and the report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut 30% of funding again from June 2017, meaning that thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Queensland MP George Brandeis to immediately withdraw these cuts so that people can get the help they need when faced with legal issues.
Last year, the state government pledged to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
Now it is necessary to pay attention to the needs of the community legal center and its corresponding communities, and the White House government must also be involved in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team is being prosecuted for staff shooting
New York: Trump's campaign team was prosecuted for failing to act after its Northern California chief fired a gun at a staff member while driving a jeep in February.
Vincent Bodini, a former software trainer for the state's campaign team, described the incident Wednesday in a state courthouse in Charlotte.
Bodini said he previously hoped the matter could be resolved internally, but after months of waiting he realized that this could not happen.
According to Bodini, the head, named Earl Philip, pulled out a gun, placed his right thumb on the dashboard, and pointed the gun at Vincent's knee bone.
After complaining to the leadership of the local and regional campaign team, Bodini learned from the book that at least four other people had experienced the same thing.
Bodini said in the complaint: "Not firing a shot does not mean that no harm will be done".
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential candidate in North Carolina told the crowd that if his opponent Hillary Clinton were elected and chose the judge she loved, the people who supported the Second Amendment, i.e. gun-supporting people and gun lovers, would probably take action.
Trump's campaign team said the media took his word for it and that he did not advocate violence.
Bodini in his complaint demanded that the campaign team compensate for their neglect of supervision, while also demanding that Philip compensate for his attacks, beatings and mental harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the news.
I can't get in touch with Philip.
According to the local news agency WCCB in Charlotte, Philip recently left the campaign team.
His consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services did not immediately respond to his calls.
The campaign team of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is controversial.
Both sides filed the case in the Court of Common Pleas of the McCormick County Superior Court (Charlotte) in Bodiney v. Trump Presidential Campaign Company, 16-CS-14300.
Britain must convey the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our community, London and the whole country.
For me, that is the charm of Heathrow, and as at the London 2012 Olympics, we do our best to ensure that our country and region can benefit from these events.
The Olympics have benefited Stratford and the East Region immensely.
And we will benefit the region again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and help the youth around the airport get out of unemployment.
As before the London Olympics in 2012, some people thought that Heathrow's expansion project was too big.
I was told that Britain would not be able to prepare for the Olympics and that we would be embarrassed in front of the world.
The questioners' suspicions about the 2012 Olympics are wrong, and their suspicions about the Heathrow project will be proven wrong.
While there are always obstacles that need to be overcome, Heathrow is solving every problem it faces.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not the few.
The expansion project will create up to 180,000 new jobs, bring 211 billion pounds of economic growth, and leave a wealth of technology and employment around the airport and across the UK.
We have a spending team on the Heathrow project, which completed £11 billion of infrastructure investment projects on time and within budget, including T5 Airport, which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years, and T2 Airport, which is located between the world's two busiest runways.
Now, they are preparing to build a third runway with private investment of 16 billion pounds.
Britain successfully hosted the London 2012 Olympics, and I am confident that the Heathrow Airport expansion project will also be a huge success.
Now is the perfect time for us to convey the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport so that we can sustain our future and create a wealth of technology and employment that will make the whole UK proud.
Sir Paul Dayton is chairman of Heathrow Airport's board and former UK Treasury Commercial Commissar
A woman committed suicide and was stabbed to death on a Swiss highway
The victims lay on the highway at midnight.
The woman who tried to commit suicide was hit by multiple vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning.
The accident happened early Thursday morning on the A1 highway near Morgeng, Wu province.
Wu State Police said a woman was lying desperately on the road in the middle of the night and was hit by multiple vehicles.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who apparently had suicidal intentions. She was run over by several vehicles, including a truck.
The woman died on the spot.
Police revealed that several drivers involved have been investigated, but some drivers have not yet been confirmed. The police are currently calling for them and witnesses to come and investigate.
Gilles Hofstadt's lawyer told the Geneva Forum that criminal investigations have begun, which is the usual course of events like this.
But it is not yet known whether any driver will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
Hofstadt said: "The prosecutor will determine the identity of the suspect".
According to the results of two other similar cases in the past five years, the driver will not be held responsible.
According to the report, both cases were caused by someone walking on the highway at night. The final verdict was that the driver could not expect pedestrians to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with causing death by negligence, alleging that in August 2014, she hit and killed a man on the A1 highway near Payet.
The court learned that the 22-year-old victim was crossing the road after drinking.
After the investigation, the judge said that the woman police officer's driving behavior at the time was completely legal, and that the man appeared on the road in a completely unexpected and unpredictable situation, and the woman police officer called an ambulance after the incident.
Anyone who can provide information about the accident near Moray on Thursday should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once suitable for human habitation
According to NASA's new climate model predictions, Venus was once suitable for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Institute developed a model that explores Venus' past, using tools and algorithms very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, which has a surface temperature, is waterless and has an atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, has ever had an environment similar to Earth.
Scientists previously believed that Venus rotates slower because of its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus may have had a thinner atmosphere similar to Earth and a slower rotation rate.
The model can also show the early geography of Venus.
Venus' dry regions may be larger than Earth's, but there was enough water and geographic changes to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early on, the brightness of the sun on Venus was 30% darker than Earth.
Anthony Del Genio, scientist at the Goddard Space Institute, explained at a press conference that Venus's slow rotation in the Goddard Space Institute model simulation extends daytime on one side of the planet to nearly two months.
This warms the surface and produces rain that can form thick clouds, which block most of the sun's heat like a sponge.
The result of the simulation is that the average climate temperature of Venus is actually several degrees lower than that of Earth today.
The model simulates the evolution of Venus in close proximity to previous planetary scientists' speculations.
Although life may have existed on Venus, over the course of billions of years, Venus has been exposed to extreme temperatures and ultraviolet radiation.
The oceans on the planet evaporate and the water vapor is also burned by ultraviolet rays.
With the leakage of the hydrogen, only thicker atmosphere of carbon dioxide and deadly greenhouse gas effects remained, forming Venus as we know it today.
Researchers published the simulated results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Communication of the Geophysical Research of Venus.
Patrick Roy resigns as head coach of the Snowshoe team
Patrick Roy resigned as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Ice Hockey Team on Thursday, saying he had no say in team decision-making.
Colorado executive vice president and general manager Joe Sachs confirmed the news and said the club would immediately begin looking for a new head coach.
Roy, 50, said in a statement: "I have been living with the vitality, passion and determination to serve as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche for the past three years.
I thought seriously about how to improve the team throughout the summer to give it the power to be on the upper level.
To do this, the goals of the head coach and vice president must be consistent with the goals of the club.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
But at present, these conditions are not met.
Sachs hired Roy on May 23, 2013, and he thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sadhis said: "Patrick told me about his decision today.
We thank him for his contribution to the club and hope that he will succeed in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach in the league in his first season coaching the Snows in 2013-14.
He helped the club to 112 points, placing first in the Central Division. But Colorado was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Minnesota, which has been on the losing side of the playoffs for the past two years.
In the 2015-16 season, the team finished 39-39-4 and lost their second outcard qualification to the Western Conference in five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two each for the Montreal Canadiens and the Snowy Colts.
Workers of the North Sea oilfields stopped the strike and continued negotiations
The chief negotiator said that workers at the North Sea oilfield stopped the strike on compensation and that the parties to the dispute had started a new round of negotiations.
Several strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have taken place on the North Sea oil platform operated by Royal Shell in the Netherlands.
According to a joint statement, the Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the current dispute resolution process.
We will start early next week, and in the coming weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings to re-examine these issues.
The union said that its recent actions were in protest of the maximum possible 30% wage cut, which was the first time the union had taken such action in 25 years.
Wood Group reduced the remuneration of North Sea contractors by about 9% this year due to market pressure.
Prior to this pay cut, the company reduced the remuneration of offshore contractors by 10% in 2014.
The company said that the further wage cut will help the company overcome the difficulty of the market crisis.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries, as the company needs to streamline its business after merging with British Energy Group UK Natural Gas.
Energy companies are facing pressure from the fall in crude oil prices and the UK's decision to leave the EU in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute of this generation in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
Dave said in a statement: "In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that serves the majority rather than the few".
In 2016, spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to be no more than $1.4 billion, while the average project spending over the past five years has been about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of the stars of the Songzhou constellation
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helps astronomers gather the most complete rotational velocity of the Sun's constellation.
New data is helping astronomers understand why the stars in the constellation have different rotational speeds and the association of rotational cycles with the composition of the planets.
Rosa Reeble, research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing Analysis at California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said at a press conference: "We want to understand more about the relationship between the mass, age, and even the history of the solar system by comparing our results to other galaxies".
The Ongju constellation is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the constellation were born about 125 million years ago and are just reaching maturity.
They reached their highest speed of rotation in their lifetime.
When they reach their maximum spin speeds, these mature stars emit massive stellar winds.
When these stellar winds pass through the star's magnetic field, they act as brakes on the star.
As the star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time when identifiable star black holes (such as solar black holes) appear.
The latest spin velocity data set shows that stars of higher mass spin slower than stars of lower mass.
Rebel compared the stars to dancers, who are faster than smaller dancers when they rotate.
"In the performance of the Song Ballet of the Song Jiaohuang Group, we found that stars that rotate slower tend to be of higher quality, while stars that rotate faster tend to be the lightest", said Rebu.
Because the AU is closer together, it can serve as the ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing the mass of stars with their rotational speed.
Rebel said that the constellation laid the foundation for the two-way rotation theory model of young and old stars.
There is still much to know about how, when and why the stars slow down and pick up their own dance shoes.
Rebel and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the rotational speed of the Aungzhou constellation in three new papers, which will soon be published in the journal Astronomy.
The head of the Department of Water Management of the South Lake Park, Liu Yijun, explained that the depth of the water of South Lake is more than 10 meters, and if the water is not understood, there is a high risk of danger.
Liu said that the rescue team at South Lake is very professional, but still hopes that tourists who sail large boats can wear life jackets, do not violate the law and play safety games on the lake. Liu Jiang said.
The village of Genghe has a unique marine environment, and is home to two major leisure tourist resources, the natural ecological and the human ecological.
But the individual owner of the parking lot in the village, who feared that doing so would affect the rental price of his parking lot, and suspected that others were private, had been behind the destruction, causing the parking lot renovation to be put on hold.
There is still a lot of debate about when and by whom the question was introduced.
In the current mainstream view, the introduction of tomatoes has three main lines.
The most influential and widespread of the three lines introduced by the Tanananan is the introduction of Chen Chenlong to Fujian province by the Philippines.
The Beijing City Office of Social Group Management will soon conduct a special check on the use of the uniform receipts for social group fees.
The inspection is self-examination and focused sampling.
The relevant officials of the Municipal Association explained that the scope of the inspection includes the social groups that received the uniform receipts for the period 2013 to 2015 from the Municipal Association.
In its 2012 Olympic strategy for dissemination, Rio's organizers said that the success of the Games is defined by who shares their stories on social media.
And from the reports of the Olympics, the media has made significant changes in many aspects of the way of communication, product form, language style, news perspective, etc.
The International Olympic Committee and media practitioners from around the world seem to be ready to meet this challenge.
On August 11, the IPO of the H shares of the company entered its final day. It was reported that the market reaction was flat in the two days before the IPO. As planned, it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18.
A broker analyst in the country said that the Eastern securities are not good on a port basis, and the underlying capital management business is the head of the Eastern securities. Compared to the bank sector brokers such as China Bank International and China Securities, it seems insufficient.
Experts point out that many of the stock market performance has declined since this year as the stock market has returned to flatness, but it is not possible to make a general statement about the development of the company's own business after the company goes public.
After the new regulation comes into effect, Suzhou will become the first second-tier city in the country to restart restricted purchases.
The second-tier cities that have or are about to have a housing market regulation policy are not just Suzhou, but also cities like Co-op and Nanjing.
Earlier, Co-operative had been the first to issue a limit loan policy, and for those who buy houses under the name Co-operative and have one home loan that has not been settled, the bank will refuse to provide home loan services.

Civil rights groups issued travel warnings against Missouri
Because of Missouri's discriminatory policies and racial attacks, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued travel warnings to colored people preparing to travel to Missouri.
In the NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which took effect on August 28, 2017, Liu called for special attention and extreme caution to be exercised by all African-American travelers, tourists and Missourians when traveling to Missouri, given the recent spate of suspicious racial incidents in Missouri, the group said in a statement.
The NAACP noted that a recent Missouri law made it harder to win discriminatory lawsuits, and that state law enforcement was also targeting minorities to some extent, prompting the organization to issue travel warnings.
The violation of civil rights is happening to people.
They were questioned, beaten or killed because of their skin color, Missouri NAACP President Rod Chappell told The Kansas City Star.
"We have received many complaints, the number has never been seen before.
This is the first such warning issued by the organization against a state in the United States.
The group cited the racial libel against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black man Toly Sanders of Tennessee.
Earlier this year, Sanders died under suspicious circumstances. He ran out of fuel while traveling to Missouri and was detained by Missouri police without charge of crime.
The consultation also noted that a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office showed that black drivers in the state were 75% more likely to be screened for parking than white drivers.
"The purpose of this consultation is to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri", Chabel said.
People need to be prepared, whether they are going to Missouri with bail money or letting their relatives know they are traveling within the state.
According to the latest data from the FBI Hate Crime Reporting Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; the state ranks 16th nationally in crime volume.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which will make it harder to sue housing or employment discrimination businesses.
Previously, states passed immigration law enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to detain immigrant offenders, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the move would increase the number of racial litigation and issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the US government to other countries, but recently, advisory groups have adopted this approach to address certain laws and trends within the US.
After experiencing the booming golden era of box office in 2015, the overall film market entered a period of calm in 2016, and whether it could break past last year's total box office performance of ¥44069 billion became a suspense.

BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city: making old people feel like they're living in a new era
On January 18, the reference news network reported that Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly becoming the modern charming city of today.
With an amazingly fast Internet, cutting-edge technologies such as facial recognition software, huge investments in artificial intelligence and unparalleled international energy, this Chinese capital is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners who are exploring.
According to the BBC website, German singer Clemens Seisch said on January 16, "Oh, if I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere later". He quoted singer Frank Sinatra singing New York City.
Sesi, creative director of the traveler's archives magazine, said: "If Sinatra were alive today, he would probably sing in a city like Beijing". He said that living in this city will make you feel like living in a new era of China, always keeping up with the trend.
Simon Norton, who lives in Beijing, but is from England, recently wrote on his personal blog 4Corners7Seas: "It's hard to say exactly how people feel about being in the center of something big, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it turns out to be and want to witness it firsthand".
The city's high-speed internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever before, the report said.
Andy Penia Fuert, who is currently deputy editor-in-chief of the Beijing Children's Wallet website from Manila, said that Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society, and the Internet is integrating the functionality of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions.
But the smartphone is just the beginning of Beijing's technological ambition, and facial recognition software is already popular, many mobile phone applications use this technology to make bank transfers and payments, allow people to enter apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of the driver.
Beijing recently announced plans to spend 13.8 billion yuan to build an AI technology park, where more than 400 enterprises will be based after completion, focusing on developing various AI technologies ranging from biometric to autonomous driving vehicles.
Food is also at the heart of many major festivals in the Chinese calendar, and foreigners are celebrating the festival. Spring Festival is the most important social and economic festival and one of the easiest for foreigners to participate.
Shehi said: "I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for last year, cleaning apartments and writing a red spring line on the door sign is equally important, and on Christmas Eve, all family members should gather for a lavish meal, and celebrate the year until midnight, welcoming the new year with a bright flame. For foreigners, sharing this night with friends and family is indeed an opportunity to integrate".
The number of foreigners in Beijing is numerous and growing, but Chinese language barriers and the ease of communication between the people of Beijing are easy to justify their lack of full integration into the local culture.
"Some foreigners have lived in China for years, but have little experience with their host country. If you initially try to contact the Chinese people without success, then you will easily have or feel easier to deal with other foreigners.
In these so-called "bubbles" (bubbles) foreigners are only mixed up with foreigners, without contact with locals and local cultural interpreters), foreigners gather in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only foreigners among friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin, which is easier than people might think.
Shehi said: "The last two hours of Chinese lessons or an introductory level of radio drama every week should be a busy schedule for everyone".
Even learning a few classic short sentences can be helpful when shopping, ordering meals in restaurants or talking in a taxi.
The report said that persistent air pollution is also a fact of daily life, although some problems have been curbed in recent years by the government.
Residents stressed that it is important to go outdoors during the often mildly polluted warm months to take those blue sky days as an opportunity to explore the historic hotspot or the popular Sunrise Park.
"Beijing is the Chinese city where you can find the most things under the surface, and you can find great artistic and musical activities, lavish nightlife, historical wonders, supermodern business districts and ancient homeless areas", Norton said.
The report notes that the barrier to growth of human capital is increasingly evident, especially in the North-East region, where the average annual contribution of ageing to human capital growth is 1.28%.
Pan Gongsheng pointed out that the risk of cross-border capital flows is currently controllable and the fundamental factors that support the balance of international accounts remain in place for a long time.

The European Commission accused Google in April of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre-install software such as Google Search and Chrome Browser, or not allowing them to use other Google applications.
The European Commission considers this to be detrimental to consumers' interests and hinders competition.
The EU regulator initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
If the antitrust charge is upheld, Google faces a maximum fine of 10% of its global revenue, which is about $7.4 billion.
Google has not immediately commented on this.
Google is also facing an investigation by the European Union for its bias towards home shopping services in search results.

Summary: Apart from the natural price reset triggered by speculation, the downturn in the digital currency round has nothing to do with the risk of regulatory oversight by the Chinese adversary.
From a visualized map, the attitude of Eastern countries towards Bitcoin is more conservative than Western ones, and the countries that make up the global mainstream are still observing the legality of digital currencies, representing a high risk of the black hole.
"This article is from Wall Street News (WhatsApp ID:wallstreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more great information, please log in to wallstreetcn.com or download the Wall Street News App".
With the regulatory storm rising in key bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union, and the worldwide digital currency dominated by Bitcoin being bloodied this week, Bitcoin prices fell below the psychological figure of $10,000 on Tuesday, creating the biggest one-day drop in three years.
Apart from the natural price reset triggered by speculation, this round of digital currency falls has nothing to do with the risk of regulatory oversight of the long-standing adversary.
In this important gateway, visualized big data site HowMuch.net produced a chart showing the legality and regulation of Bitcoin in countries around the world.
Green represents the legal market for Bitcoin, as shown below; yellow represents the neutral market, although it has not publicly legalized Bitcoin's status, but there are no major restrictions on its use; light pink represents restricted markets, i.e. the local government attempts to approach the use of digital currency through red line policies or regulation; deep pink represents Bitcoin as an illegal country; gray is a country that has not yet been commented on.
(The above chart was taken from the HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15.)
The article notes that the distribution of green blocks in Africa can be seen from the chart that the attitude of Eastern countries to Bitcoin in the traditional sense is more conservative than that of the West.
Russia is currently the largest country that defines Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest Bitcoin restricted markets, and India is one of the largest countries that has not yet commented on Bitcoin and has not yet introduced a policy.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of Bitcoin, meaning that the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are markedly different, and the distribution of blocks in the above regions is more mixed.
Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Brazil are legal bitcoin markets, and Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bolivia have some restrictions on their trading and use, and more Latin American countries have not yet spoken out against bitcoin.
Combined, the data shows that 99 of the 246 countries surveyed globally - or 40 percent - do not have restrictions on Bitcoin transactions and use, i.e. green and orange zones.
There are seven countries (or 3% of the population) that are restricted markets (or pale pink), 10 countries (or 4% of the population) that define Bitcoin as illegal (or pale pink), 130 countries (or 53%) still do not treat digital currency information (or gray).
This indicates that the countries that make up the global market (53%, more than half) are still watching the legality of the digital currency headed by Bitcoin domestically, and represents the risk of Bitcoin's black hole still being high, as some of them may eventually make legislative decisions to limit the digital currency.
The article argues that global regulators have not yet fully understood the emerging category of digital currencies, which may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made any statements.
Although Bitcoin's popularity has grown exponentially since last year, it does not represent interest in all countries, and some countries may fear that local fiat currency is threatened or even more feared that digital currency is being used by criminal organizations.
The Wall Street Journal has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news against Bitcoin since last week, including China's start to crack down on centralized online platforms and mobile apps for off-site exchanges, South Korea still considering closing digital currency exchanges, the EU believes Bitcoin is not yet widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of losing their lives to the bloodless.
Wall Street Journal selected the 2018 newsletter: The Year of the Global Central Bank's Digital Currency launch. Liu has stated that from any perspective of regulation, acceptance/criticism, adoption, 2018 will be the year of the digital currency of the global central bank.
Great powers like Russia have criticized the legality of Bitcoin, but in fact they are also trying to give way to official digital currency issuance.
News Agency of Madrid on January 8th Reporter Sheyuchi) Barcelona's new assistant Coutinho8 made his debut in the Bassa jersey at the Nokamp.
Coutinho passed the physical examination of the Bassa that morning and signed a contract with Bassa president Patomeo, which expires in summer 2023.
He then appeared as a player for Bassa in front of nearly 7,000 fans in North Kemp.
According to Spanish media, the total transfer fee for Coutinho, or 160 million euros (about 7.77 yuan) is the first price in the history of the club and the Premier League.
Since Cutiño is still injured, he will have to take a break of almost 20 days before he can make his debut in the Baza shirt.
What else is sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most defining sign of the regime's change was when they began attacking the statue.
Americans and everyone else agree with this. So Saddam Hussein was carefully planned to be toppled in Baghdad's Paradise Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key thinkers in the Trump administration, was sure of what would happen to the Statue of Liberty if he cut off a symbolic axe when he argued with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, a group of sailboat owners and liberal followers would surely devour his life.
But he did attack the meaning of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was engraved on the base in 1903 (the monument was completed 17 years later).
As Miller reproached Acosta: "Oh, I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the goddess of freedom is like a symbol of America's freedom to light up the world".
The poem you mentioned was added later, not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller is right, but as he himself says, this is not really about history.
This is a modern echo of Lazarus's words, and the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowded crowd of people who crave free breath,/the suffering people who refuse your crowded beach.
Those who do not have pain refused to see the moment when the pain becomes more acute on our screen.
Miller has never worked as a literary critic, and he made it clear that these people would not be welcome in the Trump era.
This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends at the base of the poem, who were in the event after her death, were aware that their actions were highly political.
The sculpture is intended to express the connection between French and American republicanism through an ancient classical metaphor that personifies the female goddess of freedom.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poem, the image of a woman is no longer abstract, she wants to speak.
She gave herself a very different name: Mother of Exile.
The poem combined with the painting was a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to Native Americanism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have always wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker Rush Limbaugh, a Baptist at the time of Trump's arrival, believes liberalism is not inviting anyone in 2010 and is now an early neo-conservative who brings the flame of American wisdom to a world of ignorance: the goddess of freedom is unprecedented.
She intended to bring the freedom sparrow from the United States to the rest of the world.
The fireworks are not the way to light America.
Unusually, Limbaugh was actually struck by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the perceptual perspective.
Lazarus's imaginative approach is to see it. When tired, poor but hopeful people see it on the deck after a long and often dreadful journey.
On the surface, this concerns the world view of people seeking asylum and having opportunities to improve their lives.
Her statue conveys to them the hope and welcome they need to hear.
Of course, this is not the view that Miller and Trump wanted to admit.
They are not lit to light the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of strength.

2017 World Cup: Neil Black praised Scotland's England national team
Elidh Doyle recalled that the England national team had only two Scots players.
Neil Blake, executive director of the British Athletics Association, said the squad of 16 strong Scots in the World Championship group would make a huge contribution to the national team.
The record number of Scottish track athletes selected for the 2017 World Championships in Athletics in London, which opened on Friday, set the record.
Blake believes that Scotland is achieving an unusual development and British athletes must learn from it.
"We accept and manage to understand this, and we will stick with it until we succeed".
I went to the people of the Scottish Sports Academy to talk to them. They thought it was related to their role.
Scottish athletes believe this is related to their performance.
The British Athletics Association believes this is related to their role.
Even people on the streets think so.
In any case, this is extremely ridiculous.
Several Scottish athletes competing for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, will be below Mo Farah at 5,000 metres, while Elidh Doyle will be selected as team captain.
A little modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible. "Oh, Blake said".
Many athletes, whether they are Scottish or wherever they live or train, walk out of their doors proudly and proudly.
The passion and genuine feelings that Ahrid naturally put into it are good.
The Commonwealth silver medalist in the 400m backstroke event at his fifth World Championships said that 16 Scottish players were in the British national team, which was an incredible achievement.
Previously, the maximum number of Scottish athletes participating in the World Championships was seven, which is the number of participants achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle distance runner is the leading figure. She has set five British records and two European records in the past year.
She will compete in the 1500m and 5000m events.
Chris O'Hare, who competes in the 1500m event, is another Scottish player to watch, having done well in the previous season, winning both the qualifying and the Olympic anniversary competitions in the UK.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first World Championship, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said that she is very proud that so many of her compatriots not only join the team but will also challenge medals and compete in the finals in some cases.
The special thing about being captain of the national team is that it is voted on by the other team members of the national team. Therefore, knowing that your teammates voted for you to strive for an extraordinary achievement, in any case, it is a great honor for me, she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scottish team members.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are all old-fashioned athletes here, athletes who are about to move towards the goal of being honored with the medal.
How was my captain's speech?
Oh, I think it's great.
I just referred to the fact that in this case, we are very lucky because we are hosting the World Championships at home.
So it's really important that we get back on track with the support of the home team and that we grow by going back to the Olympic Stadium.
I will get a second chance to participate in the competition, and the atmosphere will be amazing.

Blocking critics on Facebook: If you can't stand voters' reproaches, don't run for public office
Our father knows the way of bad media.
Americans loved Washington, but soon after, the major newspapers began to lash out at him, not letting go of anything from domestic policy to political principles.
He was furious with these criticisms, there is no doubt.
But he didn't make those critics cry.
Because as early as 1783, Washington had said that freedom of speech would be denied and we would be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance.
This reminded me of Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who needed to study in Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 posts because they shared their views on his official Facebook homepage.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff considered the lawsuit to be very rash, and online reports filled their fierce resistance: Who cares?
Many people say that this is just Facebook.
But it is important.
This is especially important because people like Hogan are faced with this.
This is a Republican who is governor in a democratic majority state, and he is also surprisingly popular.
Out of the 50 governors in the country, he was ranked second in the good ratings.
Hogan is not a reactionary, impulsive person.
He ran Maryland smoothly and strictly followed the rules.
He is also very good at using Facebook as the main way to connect with voters, and he has shown his post-chemotherapy bra for the first time on the homepage.
So blocking comments from the governor's homepage is completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous. This homepage is a public forum and is the official management platform for the list of employees who pay public taxes.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Shas, defended the governor's behavior, saying she believed that blocking their comments was just trying to get them to restrain themselves a little bit.
But they are overly rash in describing it as a flood monster or cynic that is sweeping the web.
The Washington Post spoke face to face with people who were blocked by Hogan.
They are nothing more than ordinary people's dialogue with their chosen leaders: their identity as teachers, small business owners and pastors, not a flood monster.
They have expressed their comments with depth, respect and not disdain.
The pastor quoted the Bible verse in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Ramani, the attorney general of Puyallup, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked questions about hate crimes.
She wrote in the Washington Post's News Story Commentary section, "I am polite to comment and express disappointment that he did not retaliate for hate crimes and other recent news events".
I also don't like a group of people commenting on the same topic because they are directly ignored by some people, who think they are so-called public psychologists, rather than considering them as a group of concerned citizens.
The government officials claimed that the heavy junk information bombing may have been a persistent claim by others.
The age of Facebook made it easy and easy to modify a message, with only one critic being blocked or a negative comment removed.
And cleaning up is much cleaner than in the past, and in the past decade, to achieve the same effect requires sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical remarks or arresting or shouting protesters.
But that is what is happening now, but at a digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of gossiping about others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being prosecuted by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
Last week, a landmark ruling was issued in Virginia on such matters.
According to District Judge James C. Katharis of Alexandria, U.S., the Chairman of the Laudington County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment by blocking voters from her Facebook homepage.
Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) was also criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable mail and the Internet have a similar impact.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters were written to strongly criticize his leadership.
And even then, Washington had a flood monster against him anonymously.
People used pseudonyms such as Eureka, Valerius, Belizarius, and Pocus to write letters to the newspapers, which were harshly critical of Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected online by George Washington newspaper projects, his office was flooded with petitions, criticizing his attitude towards the friendship, commerce and maritime treaty signed with the British Crown Prince.
But he didn't make them cry.
Freedom of speech, freedom of dissent and freedom of speech are the foundation of this country.
And real leaders need to accept this.
The wind blowing from the marketplace shakes people's sensitive nerves.
Limit purchases are a tough one for many urban real estate regulation policies.
In May 2017, Jinnan introduced a provision that undergraduates pay Social Security for six consecutive years and enjoy the same housing policy for residents living in the local permanent residence.
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that states that university students can apply for a diploma and employment certificate within three years of graduation.
The policy was subsequently codified, and the official said that students could buy houses at prices below the market price of 20%;
In July, Chengdu introduced a rule that young people with undergraduate and graduate degrees from foreign universities can apply for a residence permit only with a diploma.
In addition, cities and regions such as Kunsan, Shanghai's port have also introduced policies related to the housing market, reducing the threshold for housing for people with talent.
Zhang Maonghui believes that this is actually the struggle of the big cities for population, especially talent, and the city is competitive to keep the population, especially talent, and that is the most important meaning of these real estate policies.
Some even think that this means that the time has come to cancel the restrictions on the housing market.
The director of Lwinlipe said that the shooting plan had been long in the making, and the first adaptation of the script was in 1999, and he was even ready to find Golden City Wu to play the 13th.
Ronan Lafferty looks forward to the feeling of being at home in the Renaissance Club
East Lothian Renaissance Club is hosting the 25th Scottish Open, and former European champion Ron Lafferty will feel at home for the next three days.
The Northern Irishman led his neighbour Acherfield Lynx last year to the final but lost to Paul Ayres, who now works for the new venue and is the ambassador for the event on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Salvati.
Rafferty said: "I witnessed the establishment of the Renaissance Club and we will witness its glory through this competition.
Athletes will see the best looks and best condition of the stadium.
Jerry has created this place without precedent.
He is a passionate supporter of the competition and is very proud of what he has achieved here.
This is the best stage to show the stadium.
Englishman Ayres is looking forward to his first defence, although in his 32-year career he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"Oh, this is really special", said the athlete from Shawspot.
I didn't defend the Estremadura Open because the race was cancelled the second year after I won.
It feels magical to come to this place.
It's wonderful to play golf here.
Last year's memories have emerged, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was of special significance to us.
It was truly a special memory, and we will always remember it.
Returning to his homeland, Gary Orr, who turned 50 earlier this year, also played on the European Tour.
This is his first Scottish tournament since the Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always makes more sense to play home games", said Orl of Helensburg.
You want to do well; but you can feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoy being able to play again, and I've been playing golf.
I am satisfied with the current situation.
The three players who joined the group were former Masters winners Ian Woosnand regular-season champion Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark Maynooth.
Six Scottish athletes were present, two of whom were O'Reilly and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, and four others were Andrew O'Donnell, Stephen McAllister, Bill Lowe and Ross Drummond.

In Beijing, Liu Zhejiang, Director of the Environmental Supervision Office of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, introduced that in August, 57 cases of continuous penalty cases were implemented nationwide, and the new revised Environmental Protection Law, implemented earlier this year, clearly enhanced China's environmental enforcement power.
Currently, environmental protection bodies across China can use punitive means such as continuous penalties, seizure seizures, production limitation and administrative detention to investigate environmental violations and cooperate with judicial authorities to punish environmental crimes.
In August, 335 seizure and seizure cases were carried out in China; 177 cases were carried out in production restrictions and production stoppages; 189 administrative detentions were transferred and 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution crimes were transferred.
Among them, Henan has implemented seven consecutive penalties per day, and China is currently fully embedding and enforcing comprehensive environmental pollution governance from end-to-end control.
Although the pressure on the economy is showing, China's Ministry of Environmental Protection has already made clear that China should correctly handle environmental protection positioning in economic development, strengthen the green stability bar, and the slower the economic growth, the more it cannot relax environmental protection, and play the role of environmental protection in optimizing the economy.

Chinese Communist Party and World Party High Level Dialogue Keynote Speech
Zhejiang province is strongly encouraging the spirit of the Red Boat, and with firm action, the work is ahead of its time.
After collecting new samples, the mother and her colleagues immediately got busy.
While daily monitoring
This year they are working to tackle the topic of smart management of rural sewage.
How to manage it well is actually a very serious challenge.
The Institute of Ecological Environment at Zhejiang Qinghua Chengdu Research Institute is located in the heart of the Red Boat spirit.
From the one that was nothing decades ago to the present day
Zhejiang Qinghua Long Triangle Institute has developed into a three-state innovation platform with nearly 400 overseas students who have settled in Zhejiang.
The spirit of the Red Boat is a force we must follow and understand, and innovation is really hard.
Every innovation here
To the extent that it feels impossible to solve, if you stick to this stage, you are constantly walking and walking.
It was the people who went up the door, now it is up and down, so that is to say
Doing real things for the people
So far, through this method, the Yangtze district has collected 59,815 problems, of which 3,8668 have been solved, and 1,496 are being addressed.
Our staff in Zhejiang have a saying:
The geographical advantage is less than the strength of the cadres, the policy advantage is less than the quality of service, and the spirit of dedication of the Red Boat encourages us to push forward, and even more so to lead the way in practice.
Courage to fight
Recently, 19 representatives of the Chinese Cultural Organization and well-known artists from the literary world have been part of a mission team to visit the 19 great spirits in Mongolia, the Yellow River, Gansu, Shanghai, Guangdong, Guangzhou and other places.
They delved into the grassroots mass art galleries, local academies and some universities in Inner Mongolia, the Yellow River, and Gansu, and the new cultural mission of the 19 great spiritual Chinese arts workers.
I am deeply proud and happy, and I am willing to sink and sink again, writing the fate of the small people of the great age.
There are some good suggestions for this aspect of the development of the arts at this level.
Now the popular culture is very hot, and there is something about popularity.
It is always a showcase of the extraordinary work of the age.
It should be rooted and grounded, deep into life, and then create works with a certain cultural thickness, positive direction, and permanent artistic charm.
Twenty-eight have been confirmed, with the contracting area of 15.2 billion tons, of which 11.1 million tons have been completed.
Eighty-two percent of the land area of the two-round household contracting cultivation, seven provincial districts such as Sichuan have been reported to the Central State Council of the Party.
The country's contractual validation is expected to be completed by the end of the year 218.
In the future, the Ministry of Agriculture will explore the real results
The first star in China's Space Science Satellite series and the world's first dark matter particle detector satellite.
In the space of nearly two years, four scans of the entire sky area have detected more than 35.5 billion high-energy particles, giving the world's most accurate measurements.
The results were published in the international academic journal Nature's Nature.
In space, we observe something new that has not been observed before, something that cannot be explained and explained using this theory that is already there.
The results of this research are of multiple meanings, and most importantly, it demonstrates the cutting edge technology used by Chinese scientists.
The ability to make scientific instruments to detect a very difficult scientific problem.
Looking for toilets with their noses, this is the last century, and many people remember the Chinese toilets.
And more and more human design is being integrated.
Many tourists are impressed by the year-round ventilation and smell of the bathroom.
Now we don't have to go to the bathroom with our noses.
Not only do we change the hardware, but the software also follows suit.
Tourism demands that the tourist areas' toilets be equipped with toilet paper and handwashing liquid
But in some areas
Is this public service stopped because of the uncivilized behavior of individuals?
Managers in different places made choices
On the one hand, saving is advocated through civilization, and on the other hand, technological innovation is being carried out.
Public toilets in Nanjing, Guangzhou and other places in Jiangsu
Brushing your face for three seconds means getting a free piece of paper, but getting a double piece takes ten minutes or more.
Avoiding misuse of public resources
It's a habit, maybe some tourists are really thinking about taking the paper back, but on the other hand we also have to reflect.
Is there no paper for our next toilet for tourists to enter, so this is something we have highlighted in our new three-year plan.
To solve this imbalance and this insufficient part of the world
To push the toilet revolution deeper is to think more about what the masses think.
A third toilet must be provided, so that families can accompany the elderly and children to the toilet.
We brought babies and boys to the bathroom and we were not happy to go with them.
The little girl in the kitchen seemed to understand the embarrassment, and the board was particularly comfortable and convenient for us to carry the children.
People feel civilization and become the builders of civilization. In rural areas, villagers in Guangxi River pond are building new water washrooms in their homes.
It has already been very successful, and actively promoting the toilet revolution will not only help people stay away from diseases, but also drive economic development and reduce regional development gaps.
This toilet problem It is a general problem, a node in the development of social problems.
It is a national civilization project, guided by the state from the perspective of the layout, and then solved the small social problems from different levels of participation.
This will complete all our shortcuts.
With the recent construction of the Irrigation District of the Yellow River, 14 major water projects have been started in the country this year.
The investment amounted to 900 billion yuan.
Currently, the enrollment rate of children with visual, hearing and intellectual disabilities and adolescents in compulsory education in China is more than 90 percent.
The high-speed Western Railway connecting Xi'an and Chengdu will open on December 6, and the first trains and ticket for the scheduled pre-trains will start selling today.
China successfully launched the land-based reconnaissance satellite 1 into the designated orbit with the Long March 2 Ding rocket at the Winu Spring satellite launch center this afternoon.
The first public railway tunnel in Huang River was opened before the opening of the tunnel.

Spiritual meaning
Next, we will focus on international news.
The Senate of the United States voted to pass the massive tax cuts bill.
The analysis said this marks a step closer to completing the largest tax cut in the United States in three decades.
The Senate, which had a Republican majority, finally passed the tax cuts with 51 votes in favor and 49 against.

The robot needs some motors, a pump and then a controller, and now they can all be developed by themselves.
Shanghai introduces preferential policy
It also brought a group of innovative talent to stay in the country and stay in Shanghai.
The 19th report, which for the first time proposed the construction of a modern economic system, called for
Smart manufacturing enterprises are transforming from traditional manufacturing industries
In the third quarter of this year, smart manufacturing output was close to 1.6 billion yuan, almost 40% growth compared to the previous quarter.
We have been feeling clearly from the past few years that the whole industry is not enough of its new dynamics, so we are going to be able to make a change in the way we are doing things.
This has increased the strength of the transformation of this enterprise
Shanghai is accelerating its move towards a technological innovation center with global impact, in line with the demands of General Secretary Xi Jinping.
To accelerate the transformation of scientific research results from paper into money, local regulations were introduced in Shanghai this year to promote the transformation and service of scientific results.
Ten days after the 19th round of talks, Shanghai issued further implementing opinions to further promote the development of a new generation of artificial intelligence.
There are many disadvantages in the process of innovation.
The monkeys release their vitality
In the new era, technological innovation is becoming more and more possible.
The Institute of Micro Satellite Innovation at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai is a pioneer in satellite technology innovation research in China.
Doing something new, in itself, is a new goal choice for this task.
The average age of researchers is only 31 years old, and the Institute of Microsatellite Innovation at the Faculty of Medicine is a small institute.
Five satellites will be launched in the near future
The full-scale innovation from materials, devices to components has led to the upgrading and transformation of China's manufacturing industry chain.
The 19th report clearly states that China has entered a new era and that the standard of power in China is to lead.
You know, all the satellites that we've launched so far, all the satellites that we've launched at our small satellite laboratory, are groundbreaking, and we're not going to follow the path that others have gone through, nor will we go after others.
A large multi-disciplinary, multidisciplinary and comprehensive science industry has been formed, which has fully enhanced Shanghai's original innovation capabilities and seized the strategic capabilities of the world's technological and innovation pioneers.
The strong momentum that innovation drives development brings to Shanghai is showing itself as it enters a new era.
The bold experiment, bold boldness, and self-reforming spirit of initiative also stem from Shanghai's constantly taking institutional mechanism reform as the key to developing this great article.
The 19th Party report notes that the reform of the technological and technological system should be deepened and a system of technological innovation should be established that integrates enterprises as subjects, market oriented and deeply integrated in research and production.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia
Badina Daje does not use the stove when cooking.
She rarely even uses a pumpkin.
Her wooden house is located in Enarotalli, the capital of Panay Province, Papua, Indonesia, and the housewife usually just puts a redhead in the fire, which locals call a "notch" or "notch".
Half an hour later, the burnt red chicken was taken out by a pair of unwashed hands and eaten by the wolf.
Daisy sits on the mud and she has no furniture, and here she does her daily household chores, such as washing clothes and washing water, all from the nearby swamp.
A bucket of water is placed in a room without a roof, which is an outdoor toilet.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to the fields to care for her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course working late is dangerous: most men in the village are out of work, and many are dirty and drunk, plus there are many soldiers here.
She said: "No one dares to walk around the village after 5 pm".
This is a rare occurrence in everyday life in the Babu Highlands, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia after a referendum in 1969, but was also controversial when only 1026 chiefs were forced to vote by hand in front of the army occupying the area.
The current movement for independence and opposition to Dutch rule will soon turn its attention to the Jakarta government, which is exercising a high-pressure rule against the region and isolating foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
The remote location of Enarotaly is deserted and smoke-free; to get here you need to take a 90-minute flight from the provincial assembly of Chaipura to Nabire, then a five-hour rental car ride, one way through the river.
There is no public transportation here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the wooden roofs surrounded by bamboo tiles, and the iron leather roofs are all kinds of yellow orange covers made of iron tiles.
There are few Indonesians coming, let alone journalists, and almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago Babua believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here as well.
Daisy said we're not used to wearing these clothes. She was referring to her brightly colored hand-woven headscarf, dark shirt and bright half-shirt.
"We used to cover our bodies with only leaves.
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and the region with the highest infant mortality and lowest literacy rates in Asia.
But here is also Indonesia's golden continent.
Panay County is located on high ground, about the same area as New Jersey, with 153,000 people. The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Glassberg, is only 60 miles away and is owned by Phoenix-based Philip McMoran Copper Gold Company.
In 2015 alone, Philips mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper ore here.
In addition, Papua's timber resources are rich, estimated to be worth $78 billion.
However, these rich resources are also the source of the tragedy of the Babai people, and Indonesia's powerful military forces have been able to suppress them for so long.
A 2005 investigation report by The New York Times found that Philip paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 per officer.
The Babas' growing demand for independence threatened the gold lord and they were treated cruelly.
According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papua New Guineans have been killed since 1969, and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by Indonesian forces.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the 1970s in the highlands of the Babua tribe have escalated to genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane said that we would lose everything, including evidence of the previous year's shocking atrocities, such as extrajudicial killings, torture, and another report that rape and electrocution were particularly prevalent, and the brutal crackdown on peaceful march demonstrations.
Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher with Human Rights Watch, said that the violence is happening every day, so it is difficult to count the number of victims.
Papua's resources attracted large numbers of migrants outside Indonesia, and repression began.
83% of the province's 3.5 million people are Christians, but the population structure has changed since Muslim economic migrants arrived from the densely populated islands of Java, Garimandand, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese snack stalls sell fried chicken and vegetable-mixed cardos, served with peanut butter.
The locals are struggling to fight.
Apos Yu, a 24-year-old Panay native, moved to Chiapra, a provincial assembly, to find work, explaining that the immigrants began selling chicken and vegetables at lower prices than the local Babua in traditional markets.
This has caused the local Babua mama-mama to lose their market.
Indonesian President Zoko Vidodo (often referred to as Zokowi) vowed to address inequality and abuse of power in Papua during his 2014 campaign.
The former carpenter, who was on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, was supported by 27 of the 29 districts, including Paniyeh.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
Yu said that we are heartbroken and in 2014 we voted for Zokovy, hoping that he will fulfill our wish to restore justice.
In fact, only two months after Zokovy took office in October, Paniy experienced the most terrible nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotaly sang Christmas carols in front of the fire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly came by on motorcycles.
The children were surprised and told that they should turn on the headlights.
According to local priest Ayveet Tbey, one of the soldiers was unhappy with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses claimed that the drunk soldiers used their guns to chase the children.
Then one of the soldiers fired a shot at the group of children.
16-year-old Yulianus Yemyin was severely beaten and passed out.
Hours later, the building of the Election Commission of the nearby government body caught fire and the incident escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Barbadian men, women and children gathered in front of a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They were carrying ceremonial bows and dancing around the circle, dancing the waita of the Babulian Mee Pago tribe and imitating the bird.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the military regularly.
According to an official document document seen by the Time magazine, when emotions continued to intensify, soldiers received orders via internal radio: "If the crowd resisted more than three times, shoot immediately".
Jeremiah Kaiaumi, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotaly, felt that something dangerous was about to happen, and called on the crowd to calm down and begged them to go home.
But no one was in the mood to listen to him.
He stood on the porch of his brightly colored wooden house and told the Times of China magazine that when I turned around, my left wrist suddenly shot.
Kayaumi still doesn't know who fired the shot, but he said the bullet came from among the soldiers who had gathered.
He also said that the crowd was very crowded and they fired a lot of guns.
According to local people, the cousin of Orpheus Euler, he witnessed the shooting and saw three guns in Orpheus Euler's body.
Johannes sadly told Time magazine that I ran past to check his body to see if he was the one who had been killed.
I found out he was dead... I kissed him.
Inspector General of Police of Papua Juergen Mende told reporters that his subordinates were only protecting the police station of Papua because the police station was attacked.
In 2015, Papua Police spokesman and Police Chief Pujjo Sulistio said that when someone threatens to kill us, we must defend ourselves.
It's a matter of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killing spread slowly the next day only in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovy gave a loud and vocal speech in Chaipura, expressing deep sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to solve the problem of abuse of privileges of the historical legacy of Papua.
He said, "I hope this case is resolved as soon as possible so that this will not happen again in the future".
In October 2016, Minister of Security Villanueva said he would set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuse for the push was almost instantly answered.
He said that most of the attacks were long ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have been committed to resolving these violations, but this requires a process.
Then, on June 5th, while speaking to the magazine "The Age of Enlightenment" in Jakarta, Vilanto said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said that everything will be solved according to the law.
The United Nations has already filed a complaint against Vilando over the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the bloody independent vote in East Timor in 1999 to defuse human rights violations, but he said 11 human rights violations in Papua have been resolved, including the Panay incident.
The families of the victims of Panay incident took a breath away from these remarks.
Johannes said that in the last three years, I have received four interviews, but things have not progressed at all.
Years later, he said, "I'm tired".
He still lives in fear now.
He said, "Oh, I'm scared.
I was afraid of being arrested by the army and I was afraid of being shot.
His brother Yuccabus also believes that the people of Paniay are afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said that after the body was buried, the military came to me.
The shooting has not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deai County, near Pani Ai.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a coma man to the hospital, and the two sides clashed, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
24-year-old Lavianus Durwood drowned while fishing on the nearby river and died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company's on-site office.
Police said villagers threw stones at police, so police fired a warning.
But the anti-riot mobile force (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, and one was killed.
Domingulu Badi, 29, told Time magazine that we were all panicked and now feared they would retaliate. He lived near the hospital and witnessed the injured being rushed to the hospital.
I hid at home for two days.
The DAI Parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and for the anti-riot mobile forces to evacuate the area.
Panay has always been a bad place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has fueled discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who are scattered in the central highlands of Panipat.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the Papua people by kidnapping Indonesian soldiers through scattered attacks and raids.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Paniay, including Tadyuus Yugi and Daniel Yudas Kocaja.
As a result, thousands of Panayis have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military in recent years in the guise of upholding the sovereignty of the country.
Some have not yet appeared.
In the eyes of the Babua, Paniay is a place of tragedy that has been forgotten.
Poverty has grown in discontent.
Enarotaly sells rice that is poor and the locals can't afford.
Bread is not far from reach.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly red peppers and some fruits and vegetables with leaves.
Farming is a woman's job, and every woman can take care of four or five blocks of red grape land.
They usually use the majority of the harvest to keep writers, and the rest are put on the local market for sale.
Ten pieces of red rice are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has been drawn between local Babuans and new immigrants, and the number of these immigrants has increased dramatically since the opening of the new route to Nabireh Airport.
The small number of jobs that exist usually fall into the hands of better educated and wealthier immigrants.
Few Babaians have the funds or skills needed to run competitive companies.
John Gobai, chairman of the Panay Tribal Council, said that young people do not want to stay in this village... because there is no work here and there is no money.
Papua is isolated from the world.
In addition, the restrictions on international media coverage remain very tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudie and Basel Ronshan were expelled from Papua for refusing to cooperate with relevant agencies, even though they had rarely received a license to shoot.
According to Human Rights Watch's deputy director for Asia, Phillim Kane, Zokovy's revoking of the reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development in elections was not fulfilled.
He said in a statement that if foreign journalists try to report on the most eastern provinces of Indonesia, Papua and West Papua, they are at a new risk: refusing visas and being blacklisted.
The lack of media surveillance means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is basically limited to the neighbouring country of Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations, including Tonga, Tonga, Peru, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands, requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the widespread human rights violations in Papua New Guinea, including the Panya shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arman Nata Nasir said that he was not concerned about the allegations against the group, and told reporters in Jakarta that Indonesia still has a democratic system and media freedom, so evidence of human rights violations is difficult to cover up.
The locals want more attention from foreign governments.
According to a source, on May 4, when Dutch ambassador for human rights, Kaas Van Bal, led a delegation of officials to visit Chiapra, the local people broke their silence and begged for freedom. He also attended the meeting but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia will hold the next presidential election in 2019, but the Babua said they are unlikely to vote for Zokovi again.
Goby, the chairman of the tribal council, said that Djokovic's intentions were good, but that all those around him were involved in the Paniyeh shooting.
He wanted to let Zokovy know that the people of Paniqi are not only living under the threat of greedy military, but also that education is scarce and public health services are scarce in the region.
Gobai said that the people of Paniay, like other Babuans, thought that voting for Zokovi was a debt he had to pay.
He said that they don't need money, they need justice.
Even under threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Panyai shooting still carried out their last symbolic rebellion: burying a victim's body across the street from the military police station.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let the culprits forget their crimes.
Yuccabus nodded and said that my family was killed.
What else can we do?
With capital power, brands such as Sofia, Hollywood, Top firm, and others are tailoring the home industry's big-box foot. On February 10, 2017, the Chinese Securities Commission approved the initial application of Guangdong Fashion Posting Home Shares Limited to issue a license to market the company's shares in Shenzhen, China.
Industry insiders believe that with the launch of fashion delivery and European homes, the custom home sector will shift from product competition to capital competition.
Fashion delivery was first approved at the beginning of the new year, and news of the upcoming launch of a typical representative brand of fashion delivery in the home-painting sector has attracted the attention of the entire home industry.
Reuters reported on 9 Beijing Time that Samsung Electronics on Tuesday released its first set of components for autonomous vehicles developed in collaboration with Harman International, as well as its information entertainment solutions, which is an important initiative for the company to enter the electronic vehicle market.
Samsung Electronics acquired Harman International about a year ago.
At CES this week in Las Vegas, Samsung unveiled a car camera with collision warning, lane departure warning, and cruise control capabilities, developed in collaboration with Harman.
Samsung plans to launch the camera system this year, which is built on technologies such as machine learning and augmented reality.
Samsung also showed a digital cockpit that can be more personalized even if the driver is not the owner of the vehicle, as the system allows users to download driver information from mobile devices and cloud.

The fire again engulfed Dubai's torch and the tower.
On Friday, a fire broke out in Dubai's tallest residential building, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-high, 79-story super-high building.
This was the second major fire to sweep through a high-rise building in just two years, and happened to be in a skyscraper known as the "Snowflake".
The building has been evacuated, no injuries were reported, and the cause of the fire has not yet been identified.
"Hey, we were sleeping, and then we were woken up by a fire alarm, and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to run down the 50th floor, a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said the fire brigade extinguished the fire around 4pm local time (00:00 GMT) and is cooling the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The accident could again raise concerns around the world about the safety of the use of exterior wall materials in high-rise buildings.
An investigation by the management of the Monument after its 2015 fire found that the majority of the damaged objects were covered wall panels for decoration and insulation.
British police have said they believe problems with the insulation and roofing system at the Grenfell Tower in London could have caused the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
Williams' team also hinted that Massa might return, although he had already announced his retirement.
Just a month away from the opening of the Pyongyang Winter Olympics in South Korea on January 9, the atmosphere of the Winter Olympics in South Korea is getting stronger as the Olympic flame is transmitted from south to north with preheating and preparation work being done in a tight rhythm.
South Korean opinion expects this long-running Korean summit to bring a month's worth of eggshells to the Pyongyang Winter Olympics.
On November 1, the holy fire of the Winter Olympics in Beijing arrived in South Korea.
The excitement of the St. Turin event is directly reflected in the ticket sales for the Pyongyang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the ticket sales rate for the Pyongyang Winter Olympics were only 32% and the ticket sales rate for the Winter Paralympics were only 4.3%, and the low ticket sales rate once raised concerns about the popularity of the Pyongyang Winter Olympics.
But as the chairman of the Pyongyang Olympic Committee, Li Feng-fan, recently predicted to reporters, the heat of the Winter Olympics is increasing as the Winter Olympics are being broadcast throughout South Korea, and he believes that ticket sales will soon improve.
According to Korean media reports, as of January 3, ticket sales for the Pyongyang Winter Olympics have reached 64%, and ticket sales for the Winter Paralympics have surpassed 50%.
To encourage foreigners to visit Korea, the Ministry of Justice of South Korea announced on 8 that foreigners visiting Korea to watch the Winter Olympics in Beijing will be extended their stay in Korea, up to 120 days.
The survey found that more than one-fifth of U.S. travelers carry illegal items on board.
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20% of passengers had deliberately or unintentionally carried illegal items through the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration check-in stations, and at least 6% of passengers unintentionally boarded with prohibited tools or other blade-bearing items.
Less than 1% of passengers claimed they only found the wrong way to travel with guns, ammunition or explosives after the incident.
The survey of more than 1,000 people conducted by the charter airline Stratos Jet Charters Inc. found that young travelers are more likely to ignore regulations.
Among those who admitted to intentionally trying to bring TSA illegal items on board, 19.7% were Millennials, compared with less than 15% of Generation X.
The most common items that TSA security personnel intentionally collect are food and beverages.
More than 3% of respondents admitted to deliberately carrying a blade through security, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also said they deliberately carried illegal drugs on board.
The company said the survey was conducted to find out how many travelers accidentally and intentionally carried illegal cargoes through the airplane.
It is no surprise that those who are most likely to carry illegal cargo and pass security checks, whether intentionally or unintentionally, are those who fly most frequently.
However, the company notes that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and difficult to understand.
People are often unsure of what kind of liquid they can carry and how much they can carry.
So it is no wonder that the TSA has captured the most illegal liquids.
It was once thought that the TSA might also make books illegal.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry them.
Environmental Protection Agency Director Prut changed his mind about the Obama-era emissions reduction regulations
A day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Prut changed his decision to delay the Obama-era implementation of the smoke-air pollutant emissions reduction regulation.
Prut proposed the change because the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state environmental regulators than previous governments.
He did not mention the legal challenges raised by the Federal Court of Appeal against his former position.
The focus of the controversy is setting a deadline for states to start implementing the 2015 ground ozone standard on October 1.
In June, Prut announced that he would delay for about a year to allow the EPA more time to study the plan, to avoid interfering with local decision-making or hindering economic growth.
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Prut was Oklahoma's attorney general, and has long opposed stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Prut has repeatedly turned around to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is one of the latest legal obstacles on the agenda for Prut's regulatory shift.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency director had the power to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's requirement for oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued Wednesday night, Prutter expressed his great disdain for the ozone standard, saying that he was committed to strengthening the EPA's commitment to cooperate with states and to adopt complex procedures to reach new standards.
Prut said that under previous government administration, the EPA usually did not meet the deadline, then waited for activist groups and others to sue, and then agreed to a deadline by agreement.
"We don't believe in the regulation that is being carried out through the lawsuit, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously.
Nevertheless, the EPA's statement said that Prut may again use his extension license and all other legally available license licenses to ensure that the regulations are in line with the best policies and information available.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a sweeping overhaul of the ozone layer regulations.
The House bill approved last month aims to delay implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who leads the state coalition, this week sued the US Environmental Protection Agency, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: "The US Environmental Protection Agency's reversal is a win that is important for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, and more than 115 million American communities are directly affected by smoke emissions after we filed the lawsuit".
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia joined the ranks of New York to participate in the case.
Ground ozone is formed by reacting with sunlight in the atmosphere to common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources.
The smoke that results from this causes serious breathing problems for sensitive people, causing thousands of premature deaths every year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered for Prut's amazing transformation.
Lori Ann Bird, director of the Center for Biodiversity, said: "What is disturbing is that this common sense measure is under great pressure from the heads of the department that protects the air we breathe.
"We must fight the Trump administration to fight the mind movement to meet polluters and special interest groups".
Apart from external factors that are warming steel prices, companies are struggling to move forward on the path of lowering costs.

Since the second half of 2009, the volume of sales of bamboo plants in the mountains has been higher, especially this spring, the sales of bamboo plants in the mountains have reached record highs, sales have increased and prices have skyrocketed. According to statistics, from 1 to June this year, the revenue from the sales of bamboo plants in the mountains increased by 48% compared to the same period last year, the growth rate was the highest in almost 20 years.
Shhei Yong, deputy director of the Forestry Bureau of the Yangtze Region, said that along with the good sales situation, the production of Yangtze flowers has also developed faster.
In the past two years, the cultivation area of the plant has expanded to 30,000 tons, reaching a total area of 180,000 tons; while actively developing outside the district, the plant has established plant bases across the country to 80,000 tons, an increase of 30,000 tons compared to 2008.
As the planting area expands, the quality of seedlings is constantly improving, the value of the nursery is increasing, large specifications and high quality seedlings are retained more, and some seedlings are sold at a discount.
Shhei Yong also reminded that in the face of the current booming situation in production and sales, producers should calmly face and objectively analyze, both to see the demand for flowers will be long-term and continuously increasing, while also recognizing that the competition in the market will be more intense.
In the early morning news of July 13, Beijing Time, US company Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the East Texas District Court alleging that Apple infringed on a patent for battery technology it applied for in 2010.
The company has previously sued Huawei, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba for the same patent.
The lawsuit alleges that the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices infringe US patent 7,657,386, which is called the Silicon Integrated Battery Service System.
The plaintiff wants to get cash compensation or a patent fee for infringement equipment after the verdict is announced.
From the prosecution's judgment, the plaintiff appears to believe that the iPhone's fast charging capability violates the company's patent.
The fast charging iPhone will quickly charge to 80% of the power, and then recharge with a stream of hydrogen.
Somaltus is actually a so-called patented silicon company because the company does not offer obvious products and services and it is difficult to find relevant information online.
However, they have managed to reach an out-of-court settlement on the patent with car manufacturers such as Ford and Nissan.
The conference believes that accelerating the development of information technology, promoting the integration of resources and the use of resources, and increasing the level of industrial digitalization and intelligence, are important to promote Chinese manufacturing by 2025 and mass entrepreneurship, mass innovation, fostering innovation and improving the quality of life of the masses.

According to leaked phone records, Trump had pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post leaked a record of conversations between US President Donald Trump and leaders from Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The US president reportedly expressed his displeasure over his public attack on the wall, allegedly saying to him: "Oh, you shouldn't tell the media".
Trump pledged to build a wall on the southern border of the United States during his presidential campaign and announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
He also released a record of a conversation between him and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which showed a tense exchange between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal for the United States to take refugees to Australia was a ridiculous, disgusting and stupid one, and that he had suggested that the United States ban refugee resettlement and now stick to the deal that the Obama administration has been lurking in would make him look like a fool.
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull that this was the most unpleasant call he had made today.

Moreno tragedy: activists reiterate racist lynchings and justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car passed through the small town of Monroe, Georgia, and ran towards the small Moreton Bridge.
Four black passengers and a white driver were in the car, and a group of white men with guns walked forward before the car reached the bridge and blocked the road.
The gang's head - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - was deeply sucking a cigar and staring into the windshield.
The passengers in the car were filled with fear.
Oh, we want - Roger! Oh, the man cried.
I dragged him out of the car!
A young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat, screaming and breaking silence.
Fortunately, the terrible scene on July 22 was just a repeat.
But when Roger Pan's necklace was put on the back of the suit, almost all the surrounding audience gave a real sigh.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moran Bridge, recreating the scene of two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Marcon and George and Murray Dorothy - being executed by the K Party in 1946 that night.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"While we know who they are, although we have seen them in the community, they have not been arrested in years, it is incredible", said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the replay.
"This is the stain of history, the burden of our souls".
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia state legislator and lifelong rights activist.
For him, the rehearsal was a remarkable call for action, reminding the people of the Menro community every year that the injustice was never corrected.
"We want to sue, we want to solve a case, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we must get justice first", he said.
"Unless we get justice, we will not get healing and reconciliation".
On July 27, 1946, the coroner placed a sheet over the body of a Morsi victim of the massacre.
According to Federal Bureau of Investigation files obtained by the National Broadcasting Corporation, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in the murder.
But none of them have been prosecuted.
Although the suspects have been in a state of remoteness for decades, civil rights activists said that the dual motives for the execution of private torture are well known throughout the town: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote in the primary for the first time later that summer.
At about the same time, according to FBI statistics, black farmer Roger Malcolm assassinated white landowner Bennett Hearst in a fight - it looked like it was for a woman.
Brooks said the town rumor was that Hurst slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband.
The FBI said that on July 25, 1946, the prominent white landowner, Roy Harrison, spent $600 to bail Malcolm out.
Dorsey and cousins Mae Merry and George Dorsey accompanied him to prison.
But when they returned from prison and were about to reach the Moran Bridge, a group of suicide bombers surrounded the car.
The murder was reportedly organized and ordered by Harrison, and a report by the FBI concluded that.
It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement agencies, which not only participated in the murder, destroyed evidence, but also concealed the identity of witnesses.
Brooks is very clear about this.
He said, "Oh, this is a disastrous vote-getter case".
The murderers sent a message to the black people in the community: "If you register and vote, you will end up with the same thing".
For the past decade, Cassandra Green has been responsible for leading the annual reenactment of the Murder at the Bridge.
Her performance is vivid, catchy, and comes with a deep racist background. Many people hope that racism no longer exists in the United States.
It's hard to see, not harder, but Green said that's the key.
"We don't want to talk about private punishment because private punishment makes us face the ugliness of everyone", she said.
But if you don't listen to me or tell me about my experience, I can't have a relationship with you.
This year's show began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - dozens of white and the rest black - crammed into a room to listen to Green's rehearsal performance.
Wade Malone is the co-director of Green.
He has played the role of the Three K Party for years, but he said this role was never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not that kind of person", said Kim Malong.
But I think it's important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to that era.
In the room, actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Lascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnet Hearst, rehearse their lyrics.
When the play began, Malcolm shouted and pushed Hester, becoming angry with his wife Dorothy who slept with him.
Oh, I said, roll out my floor!
Lascona hit back.
Then they started.
Then everyone -- at least all the black actors -- burst out laughing.
Green laughed the hardest.
What's going on?!", Lascona asked.
He was panicked and confused.
Am I acting too much?
No, no, said Jungle with a smile.
"I just don't think white people say 'oh' when they fight back".
Oh yes, there is another black actor playing the joke.
Your tone must be tough.
So the energy in the room changed; the feeling of friendship and love drove away the discomfort.
Everyone is trying to do this, not only to perform the play, but also to honor the four victims.
The scene started again.
This time, Lascona spoke the "oh-oh" tone sharply and forcefully.
There is no laughing grounds.
The reenactment ended strongly and quickly.
Screaming, gunshots, and then, there was silence.
A woman in a funeral dress standing beside the actor's body singing Billy Halley's condolence words.
Her voice overwhelmed other words.
A hundred yards away, about 40 spectators were constantly wiping their sweat and tears.
Black and white people account for almost half of the audience.
A couple came from the New York City area to see the show, and many more lived near the road.
Brooks took them to the cemetery worship in Malcolm and Dorsey, a nearly eight-hour journey, and everyone was coping with the uncomfortable humid heat of Georgia.
Until now, the killer was still a fan. But now, standing on the same plot of land where the massacre took place, anxiety is in the air.
When the last note of the song disappeared, Green asked people to come closer to check the bodies of the actors.
The children bowed their heads, looking at fake blood and bodies, whispering to each other.
They weren't really dead, and a little boy was talking like he was reminding himself.
After a few minutes, Green thanked the crowd and the show ended.
The actors opened the death rope and wiped their tears.
Brad Shaw embraces Malone, a man in a suit who is playing the leader of the Three K Party.
Nick Lascona hugged two of his colleagues and cried silently in their arms; the emotion in the performance eventually infected him.
It's okay, one of the women said in a low voice.
Oh, we know your heart is not like that.
You did this for a reason.
Afterwards, the audience sat down and ate dinner with the actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta had a close chat with a black couple they had just met and talked about the replay.
Denis Duplinsky found it difficult to find words to describe what she felt after watching.
It's hard to imagine the horrible words and actions that people like you say and do because they look like you, she said.
"It really made me think that the private torture was still going on", she added, adding that "it's just called police shooting now".
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat at the table watching, tasting and tasting civil rights.
He said he had already started planning to perform next year.
"The repetition of the song is an inspiring way to describe the horror we have experienced, but it is also very educational", said Liu.
If you don't learn from it, this could happen again.
Those who do not study and do not understand their history are destined to repeat this.
The importance of the reform of the pipeline's independent pipeline is obvious for the reform of the gas market, but the resistance and controversy are also greater.
The reporter learned from Hebei Keizhou Group on 7th, at 11:25 am, that an explosion occurred at the Keizhou Group Chemical Works Limited's dairy workshops in the Guangzhou district of Dongsan, Hebei province, where 13 workers were trapped.
So far, one of the 13 trapped has been rescued and rushed to hospital, while the remaining 12 are in urgent search.
It is understood that the site is currently blocked and local public safety, fire and medical services are rescuing the site.
According to witnesses, a thunderbolt and a cloud of clouds rose in a moment.
According to the personnel of the Kekiyang Group, which was founded by the local organization, the company is located in the Guangzhou district of Dongsan, Hebei province, north of Guangzhou. It is a state-approved civil explosion equipment point production enterprise, which was established in 1958.

US media: Scientists from the Chinese Air Force Engineering University are studying laser satellites to clean up space debris
On January 18, the reference news network reported that Chinese scientists have proposed a bold innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up the messy Earth orbit and destroy the old satellites and their sky debris.
According to the January 15 report on the website of the American weekly news magazine Xi'an, researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled "Studying Xi'an Laser Removing Small Scale Space Fragment Transformation Model", which described how space fragments can be reduced to smaller, less harmful fragments by laser radiation using a Xi'an platform laser.
Space junk has been a concern of the International Space Agency for years, and the US Space Agency has considered multiple options for tracking, detecting and removing man-made debris.
Methods to remove large-scale space debris include a huge web of waste to clean and collect, and magnets that can be used to draw them out of orbit. Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean Earth's orbit.
The paper's abstract: "The simulation study provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris removal technology to the ground-based platform laser".
A 2014 study by Lockheed Martin, a US defense industry giant, found that about 200 threats per day are present for satellites that are in orbit.
High-speed debris along Earth's orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions, described by experts at the European Space Agency as a series of lethal threats.
According to the January 17 issue of the American magazine, Space is essentially empty, but space close to Earth is becoming increasingly crowded. Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris running around the Earth, and over time, these debris will pile up.
The more debris, the more likely it is that a satellite still in normal operation will be hit by debris, damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of dollars.
All space agencies have plans to clear space garbage in the future, the report said.
NASA is considering reducing the speed of the debris by jumping gas to take it off track, Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net to capture debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan's idea is to capture debris with an electrical chain.
Now China has also proposed a way to solve space junk, which is to use a large laser to shred floating space junk into less harmful pieces.
According to a paper published in the German journal Fluorescence Monthly by a group of researchers from the Chinese Air Force Engineering University, installing such a laser on a satellite would sufficiently efficiently clean space, at least according to the simulation results.
The only way to confirm effectiveness is to test, and there are no arrangements for such missions at the moment, but it is possible that sooner or later someone will install a laser on the satellite and send it into space.
Once we do this, we can finally start eliminating space junk once and for all.

Bacon Group cut 3,000 more jobs and cut dividends to revive business
British education group Peasants Group said on Friday it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut its mid-term dividend by 72% as it began another restructuring project to cope with business pressures.
Chief Executive John Farron said that most job cuts will be made in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, after the previous restructuring had reduced 4,000 jobs.
In May, the Bacon Group announced plans to cut costs by £300 million ($394 million) in its third cost cut project to revive the business that has been hit by the rapid development of digital chemistry learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Landon Books to partner Betasman and reported that its basic sales rose 1% to £2.5 billion in the first half of the year, but said the outlook for this year was unchanged.

A convoy of troops killed in a suicide bombing attack in Kabul
According to official reports, a military convoy was hit by a suicide bomber in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.

Mackey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko met for the first time to discuss the possible future final battle
The most notable under 147 pound boxing match will be held soon, and Vasily Lomachenko and Maki Garcia will meet for the first time on Thursday, while they are currently in a state of possible conflict.
They each walked down the aisle in a separate room in the ESPN office in Los Angeles, where the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia led the way to greet World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion Lomachenko.
In Saturday's Showtime boxing match, the referee unanimously confirmed that Garcia had won the fight against quarterback Adrian Bruner, and both boxer has now finished in the top five of the same weight class.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said: "Champion, are you okay?"
I wish you luck.
In Saturday night's 7pm ESPN game, Lomachenko beat Miguel Mariaga and retained his position.
When they took the photographs, Agis Klimas, a Romatchino agent, noted that the potential confrontation between the two players depended on the perfect size of the ball.
"I used to be lightweight", said Bengasi.
I upgraded my weight to 140 pounds against Bruno, but I didn't weigh that much.
I'm a little weaker than 140 pounds.
I want to go back to lightweight.
He must reach the lightweight level (135 pounds) and then we can fight.
This is what fans want.
Then we meet them.
Lomachenko agreed to this.
The world of boxing needs this fight.
Klimas asked if he should be charged a fee, and part of his strategy was to have Lomachenko make his debut later this year against a 135-pound player, thinking that next summer he would have a date with Garcia (37-0, 30 elimination). Garcia was also interested in a match against the winner of the fight against Holher Linares-Luc Campbell after the lightweight boxing match at the Forum on September 23.
"The fight may be a pay-per-view, because all fans are asking this question", said Gangassiya. He then expressed his openness to the competition on the network that offers the best financial solutions.
"We are the main characters.
Others cannot generate such attention.
As long as they're ready...
Garcia appreciated Lomachenko's excellent bowling ability and could watch his boxing match on Saturday.
But Lomachenko hesitated to praise Garcia, saying he thought the third-tier champion from Riverside looked slow. Sorry, McKee... you will be eliminated.
Garcia said the focus was on showing the strength of the fist, and then the boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their own boxing match.
"Oh, this is a fight that must be fought.
The attention and enthusiasm is unmatched by any other boxing event.
I am very happy to participate, said Bengascia.
Lomachenko said: "Oh, I've been waiting for top fighters, this time it's McKee.
This will be a great confrontation.

No notification has yet been received of the end of the limited power production, but in fact the pressure on the enterprises is much greater than in September and October, a private steel company in Hebei province told reporters.

The latest results of the Swedish refugee age assessment test are published
The Swedish refugee test uses the latest methodology to assess their age from a medical point of view, and the latest results show that more than 80% of respondents are determined to be over 18, but not everyone believes its accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (Rttsmedicinalverket) started this test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to assess the age of some of the refugees who claim to be minors, the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) designed these tests to provide a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Immigration Agency has sent 6880 test subjects, and the Forensic Center has published the results of a total of 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
80% (2002) were determined to be 18 years of age or older, but in another 25 tests, the Swedish National Center for Forensic Medicine determined that the subjects could be 18 years of age or older.
In 432 tests, the result was that the person may not have reached the age of 18.
The test is only for people with age-doubts.
According to John Granson of the Center for Forensic Medicine, these results are consistent with the results of the previous few months.
He told The Local: "These data and the data from the previous months are not very different, and the numbers are very consistent".
The high proportion of cases where the age of 18 or older is determined does not necessarily mean that the refugees lied about their age.
In May, the center released 581 test results and said 442 cases indicated that the subjects were 18 years of age or older.
The news newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of 581 tests published this year, and found that 243 respondents had publicly stated that they would turn 18 this year.
X-ray examination of the brain, nuclear magnetic resonance scans of the joints, and analysis by dentists and radiologists, this medical assessment method is also questioned in some areas.
One of the suspects is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of Caroline College, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they experience puberty earlier or later than normal age.
He told the news newspaper Metro: "Oh, I have reason to think so, and I think the measurement method used should not be this way.
It is not accurate to determine biological age in this way.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can.
However, the forensic center's Glanton defends the accuracy of these tests: "It is generally safe to say that judging a child as an adult is a small risk of uncertainty".
The biggest risk is that the person is just under 18, which is about 10 percent.
The governor of West Virginia announced a change of party
On Thursday night, Democratic Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia announced at a meeting with President Trump that he would change the party.

The rally broke out with cheers.
So tomorrow, I will change the party name to Republican slogan, Justice added.

The Democratic Party currently has only 15 governors and controls the number of state legislatures at an all-time low. The statement by Justice Governor is the latest rejection of a party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unified slogan.

Sebastian Koh praised Russia for its frank apology for the doping scandal
On Thursday, the president of the International Athletics Federation, Sebastian Koh, appreciated Russia's apology for the doping scandal, saying that the apology was sincere, but he reiterated that now is not the time for Russia to participate in the sport again.
At the International Athletics Conference on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics, the president of the Russian Athletics Federation, Dmitry Shirakdin, said that his country's ban on the sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He expressed regret that all the athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were stripped of medals.
Despite his comments, the International Athletics Federation still voted in favour of maintaining the ban. Earlier, a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) mentioned evidence that Russian state sponsors the use of doping, which was implemented in November 2015.
I think today's response is very candid, very candid introduction, the chairman of the International Association of Athletics told reporters.
The whole Council and the Athletics Federation are pleased... The Russian Federation acknowledges that it has been going through a very burning period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can participate again in the competition.
Ko said he was also very happy that Russia accepted the criteria for re-entering the competition.
"I think this is a very constructive day and I think we have made some progress, but the recommendation of the team that supported the idea of the competition is not yet the time to restore Russia's eligibility", said Yanko.
"We need to do everything we can to normalize this situation in the coming months".
Our guiding principle has always been to isolate clean athletes from the polluted system, Liu added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict standards of International Athletics Federation will compete as neutral athletes at the World Championships in Athletics on Friday in London.

What impact will the financial rules have on Neymar's move to Paris?
Rules designed to prevent European luxury football clubs from being restricted in spending will not prevent Neymar from moving the record price from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint Germain (PSG) in France.
The consequence was that UEFA further downgraded the Paris Saint Germain Football Club. The UEFA is the governing body of European football competitions and has the right to prohibit teams from participating in the much-watched UEFA Champions League.
The FFP, the European Football Association's Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP) introduced in 2011, means that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club must ultimately prove Neymar's transfer is financially supported without causing huge losses.
Barcelona have already paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to pay the Brazilian player's contract discharge fee, while Neymar's salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Neymar's move to France.
Given that the team's funding comes from the financially-deprived Qatari ruling family, the Paris Saint Germain Football Club can of course sign Neymar with cash and put him in the squad of other star-studded clubs.
The club can spend huge sums of money to buy players, but they must use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge sums spent, allowing them to achieve a loss-and-loss balance in the football related business.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules were conceived by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
The former Frenchman believes that for clubs that build up their debt to succeed, if the banks or everyone withdraws their support funds, they are actually cheating and risking their club destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the club's rulebook shifted from the club's debt issue to the monitoring of the club's loss situation.
This change means that Roman Abramovich, who used the business model when he bought Chelsea in 2003, to buy a club with potential and then invest heavily in improving the team and establishing a global brand, is now facing a more demanding situation.
During the three-year assessment period of the rules of the game until 2018, the club could lose 30 million euros.
Despite Abu being ousted by the incumbent president in 2015, UEFA successor Alexander Ceferin is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
Of course, the rules of the game have not yet expired, and we will certainly strengthen future regulations. "Andrea Traverso, the UEFA responsible for the rules of the game related matters, told the Associated Press last week.
While Paris Saint Germain FC will pay Neymar's terms and conditions once, it can also allocate the amount according to accounting purposes within the contract term.
Neymar has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee could be worth €44.4 million in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of the "Street Rules" sanctions implemented in 2014 put the Paris Saint Germain Football Club and the Abu Dhabi-based Manchester City Club under the harshest sanctions.
Paris Saint-Germain FC was fined €60 million ($82 million at the time), later reduced to €20 million, and demanded that the team reduce its players to 21 instead of the normal 25 players in the Champions League in the 2014-15 season.
UEFA is watching the clubs who try to increase their income by linking to the club's owners and cheating the financial regulators.
While Qatar's companies can sponsor Paris Saint-Germain, UEFA will not consider it legal income if the amount of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market price.
This happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount of Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of Paris Saint Germain Football Club was exaggerated.
According to reports, Neymar's part of the revenue of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris may come from the 2022 Qatar World Cup organizing committee.
However, both Paris Saint Germain and the organising committee deny Neymar will be the World Cup ambassador, and it is easy for UEFA's regulator to make such a move.
The recent sanctions imposed on Paris Saint Germain mean that UEFA will be more vigilant about any attempts to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, sources familiar with the matter said that UEFA had not discussed Neymar's transfer with Paris Saint Germain FC in advance.
The above individuals only contacted the Associated Press anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the Paris Saint-Germain football club.
The last published accounts show that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club had an operating income of €542 million in 2015-16 and made a profit of over €10 million.
The accounts for the previous financial year have not yet been released.
Paris Saint Germain Football Club expects Neymar's membership to bring good news to sponsorship events, franchises and sales of jerseys.
The club expects revenues to grow by at least 30% after signing Neymar.
It was obvious that the biggest players left, and the Spanish league was furious, trying to block Neymar's move and claiming that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club violated the rules of the game.
La Liga president Javier Tebaz told Spanish newspaper AS that the "simplified example of a financial stimulus" is that clubs and countries are the same, referring to Qatar as the ultimate owner of Paris Saint Germain.
Arsenal's head coach Arsene Wenger, who is the owner of the club, has reservations about the attitude of the national fund and the Premier League.
"This is the consequence of ownership, which has completely changed the entire ecology of football for the past 15 years", Wenger said Thursday.
"Anything happens once the country has a club".
This will make it very difficult to abide by the rules of the game, because for a country, there are many different ways or various interests to require players to play for a country.

According to Apple, starting February 28, this year, the iCloud service in mainland China will be transferred to the cloud to be operated by Guangzhou.
Apple said that the collaboration between Huawei and Guangzhou on cloud will allow us to continue improving the speed and reliability of iCloud services while also complying with the new rules that cloud services in China must be operated by local businesses.
During the shutdown, the data that users previously stored in iCloud will also be stored in iCloud and will not be lost.
If users want to use iCloud after February 28, after the shutdown, they will need to accept the new terms and conditions to ensure that the account is reactivated and moved to the cloud in Guangzhou.
At the same time, Apple also stressed in the statement that Apple has a strong data privacy and security protection mechanism and will not create a backdoor in any of our systems.
iCloud's main data center in Guangxi New Zone will also be the first data center project set up by Apple in China, and after the project is completed, it will be used to store data for Chinese Apple users.
When built and put into service, Chinese users upload and download data without having to transmit back and forth over long distances between China and the US, increasing speed and reducing delays.

The market for infectious vents is nostalgic for the hip hop summer camp and the hip hop detective Duong Hyung.
The story is retold to commemorate the actors' fashionable years of the 80s and the junk era of the 90s (after David Wayne and Michael Thiewart produced the sketch comedy for MTV before the national anthem); as well as the nostalgia for the year 2001 itself; before that year, many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poole and Paul Loud had not yet been born.
As a cultural artwork, it is a replica and embodiment of the perpetual memory of our Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is not enough.
The first day of camp was a strong response to the airing of the anime, but not only because of its absurd humor. The plot is about an original story about a vegetable head that will speak, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin.
The double use of the core laughing stock - the middle-aged actor playing the child of the age of eggs - makes it a funny part of not being able to go back in time.
Ten years later, adults are real adults, and emotions are not so deeply rooted and imitations are more widespread, including improvised creations about 90s movies, such as the handshake of the cradle pusher.
At one point, a character was trapped in an Apple laptop, some straight-line skates and some other 1991 stuff.
Many of the core stories are the same.
Mr. Sweet (Mr. Thwaite) is now a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten about Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (played by Ken Marino) still retains his male form.
There is another villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (played by Mr. Howard) inspired by George H.W. Bush (played by Michael Ian Blake, impressed).
As always, the best part of the series is the interludes.
It is particularly interesting to see Mr. Ludd, who is always young, showing off the soul patch of Matt Dillon in the movie The Single Nobility, and Andy, who was once a giant on the campus, now feels like a giant.
This is a random moment of madness that could give the film the momentum, like the recurring Seven Years of Maiden's Life series, until I come to the conclusion that I think is logical: Maiden's Summer Camp: Maiden's Last Act, twenty years later, is to get the gang to see the premiere of Maiden's Summer Camp.

Some of them are good visual heads. Police watch chess on TV and send time because Americans like to play football.
And many famous voice actors - including Jenny Slater, Nick Overman, Maheshara Hashbaz Ali and Kolo Sevini - created a wonderful sound event.
But Detective Du Xiong-Chi is so committed to creating a noisy, realistic propaganda comedy - the show has a killer wearing a Reagan mask - and it usually plays a role like that.
The six-episode television is slightly dragging and the comedy effects are not released fast enough or often enough.
Detective Du Xiong's editing was more rigorous, and when Gregor and Ayshoff visited the US embassy repeatedly, they showed better provocative irony, because there were always two fat wolves in the embassy lobby eating a bunch of burgers.

In a recent interview, the journalist learned that the benefits of steel, rail transport, shipbuilding and mechanical manufacturing industries in the North East region have generally declined and even lost.
Some experts believe that under the current situation, the new round of industrial revival in the Northeast is not only related to the national economic recovery, but will also affect the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, so we are waiting for adjustment transformation.
The general decline in enterprise profits in traditional industries, the loss in raw materials industry and heavy machinery equipment manufacturing, the decline in profits and even losses, is the first manifestation of the economic downturn in the middle east and north east.
In the past, the downturn in the economy was mainly characterized by low-end and primary products, but in this economic volatility, the traditional industrial high-end and low-end products of the North East are affected.
The company started with the adjustment of product structure in recent years, focusing on the development of high-end plates such as container boards, steel rails, boards and electrical boards for civilian use, but this year sales of these varieties have decreased significantly, especially boards sales decreased by 50% compared to the same period last year.
Liu Qingchun, head of the Liquing Department of the Liquing Commission of the Liaoning Province, said that Liquing is the third largest pillar industry in Liaoning, with an annual production of 60 million tons of steel capacity ranking third in the country.
In May this year, the production of crude steel in Penning province was 215.4 million tons, the national policy encouraged, the local government built projects with great strength, the product sales situation was better, the market competition was more intense and the product decline was greater, which is another feature of the Northeast manufacturing industry.

The film, which will be released on August 4, titled "Triple Peaches", was released yesterday in Beijing, where the duo, Yang Yang, Liu Yifei, and Liu Weifei, were present.
After having had surgery on his right ear a few days ago, he made his first appearance after being wounded, and he interpreted his role as a happy, non-figurative, always silent and hiding all his feelings in his heart.
Liu Yan said that it was necessary to mobilize the emotions of the whole body to convey the character's insidious sadness to the audience, which was a new challenge for my performance, and during the performance I really wanted to get to the inside of the wound.
Liu Yifei revealed that he cried a lot while making the film, and once he cried to the ground.
The Japanese Olympic Committee recently said that the Japanese delegation's goal for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics is 30 gold medals and it is in the top three of the gold medal table.
In October last year, the chairman of the Japan Olympic Committee Committee for Sports, Shinai Taihiro, said that he expected Japan's total number of gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics to be 2.5 times that of the Rio Olympics.
At the 2016 Rio Olympics, the Japanese delegation took sixth place with 12 gold medals.
The delegates, in their own groups, stared at the ball and stepped into the meeting place.
The roads around the venue are running normally, there are no balloon signs outside the venue, no red carpet, no plants and flowers.
Yesterday, the second session of the Fourth People's Congress was held in Guangzhou.
Walk into the Guangxi Expo Center, the venue has no sign, no cup of tea, not even a bottle of ordinary mineral water.
It was replaced by a simple banner, a meeting place, an environmentally friendly paper paper bag with assembly material, and an environmentally friendly paper cup with tea water.
The meeting material was somewhat thinner than before, and several papers summarized the themes and agenda of the meeting.
We understand and welcome the people's savings, and it is important to save the day. Returning to the current simple and realistic meeting environment, the representative of the city of Guangxi Wang said that effective practical and non-formal meetings are what they are willing to see and participate in.

Bank of England will maintain interest rates of 0.25%
The Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged, and the previous weak economic growth and loose inflation have ruined hope for a higher rate.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue to weaken as it strengthens its interest rate control while tightening household income.
The decision makers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to maintain the 0.25% interest rate, while a minority of members this month called for an increase in the rate even though weak economic growth had weakened the upward support.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England shrank its growth forecast for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7 percent and 1.6 percent respectively, and warned that the tightening of household incomes would continue, while inflation would soar to nearly 3 percent in the fall.
But it said that in the coming years, interest rates would need to be raised to curb the inflation brought about by Brexit, while borrowing costs may need to be raised more substantially than expected in the financial markets.
A year ago, a massive economic promotion policy was implemented under the influence of Brexit, and members voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce a suspension of its regular financing scheme, starting in February next year to provide cheap funds to banks, although the bank said that under the scheme, the bank currently needs an additional £15 billion on the basis of £115 billion.
In the record of the interest rate decision-making meeting, the Bank of England said: "In the core forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term, as the real income of households will continue to be constrained by the tightening of consumption".
Regarding interest rates, the bank repeatedly reiterated the need for monetary policy tightening to suppress inflation and to increase the rate of inflation to a greater extent than market expectations.
Currently, the market is expected to achieve its first growth in the third quarter of next year and the second growth in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any upgrades would be slow-moving and contained.
The bank's growth forecast for this year and next year is downward trend, while the forecast for May was 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank maintained its forecast of growth of 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar, followed by the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% against the dollar, reaching 1.31, and the euro fell 0.4%, reaching 1.11.
The increasingly upward expectations were shattered by the recent unopposed growth data before the unchanging decision emerged. GDP grew to 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with only 0.2% in the first three months.
The bank said growth in the third quarter could remain at 0.3%, although it will increase slightly by the end of the year.
The average household is shocked by the inflation boom, and wage growth is insignificant, and the Bank of England's recent inflation report does not bring them any good news, as the bank says that the tightening will get worse before it improves.
He also said that the monetary policy bubble could not prevent the impact on income in the coming years, but wages are expected to recover in large numbers by the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, the economy will be stimulated by the strong growth in demand for British goods due to the value of the pound, which will offset some of the effects of low consumption.
A year before the decision was made, a shocking EU referendum caused the pound to plummet, lowering the interest rate to 0.25% in August.
The Bank of England estimates that it may take four years before it has a full impact on prices and the UK economy.
The call for interest rate hikes was heard before the bank announced its latest rate ruling, as inflation has added snow to the ordinary household that has already been under pressure, while the three policymakers called for the rate to be raised to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June last month to 2.6%, although the Bank of England said this was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that the target of 2% was relatively low, and that the overtaking part was already the final bottom line of the weak pound.
Andrew Montrec, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in the interest rate on the downturn, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more competitive again, as lenders strongly call for more business and look forward to making the perfect decision this year with a positive attitude.
For those who may soon want to close their existing transactions, such a market looks particularly advantageous, because re-possession (many of which can be done without overtime and at low interest rates) is becoming increasingly popular.
China's earthquake platform officially confirmed that at 19:02 on November 13, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake occurred in New Zealand (magnitude 42.53° South latitude, east latitude 173.05° East longitude) with a depth of 10 kilometers, and the capital Wellington was strong.
The controversial HIV drug has been greenlit by the NHS in the UK
After the High Court has settled the matter of providing medicines to the NHS, patients will be able to receive the transformative treatment for HIV prevention starting in September.
NHS England announced that Pre-Exposure Prevention Therapy (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sexual intercourse, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk populations by around 86%. Now, health services will provide the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year initial trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's ruling last year. The ruling said that although the NHS claimed that local authorities should fund the drug, the NHS was entitled to pay for PrEP.
The move announced Thursday was described by NHS UK chief executive Simon Stevens as a major new intervention window, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a critical moment.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to register. More clinics will be added in October, followed by full implementation across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylactic medication (PrEP) is an HIV drug taken before sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Trials show that PrEP can significantly reduce the spread of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This medicine can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
Those eligible for treatment include gay, bisexual, transgender men and HIV positive carriers who have not been treated successfully.
The clinic will determine whether the participants who qualify and agree to the trial, including men, women, transgender people and unknown persons who have HIV status with their sexual partners, are receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and are registered as GP can also register for the sexual health clinic they attend in their local area.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England has signed a contract to purchase the drugs this week after competitive international procurement.
The trial aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is positioned, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr Stevens said that this important new intervention should serve as a comprehensive and increasingly successful complement and reinforcement to HIV prevention.
This is another milestone in over 30 years worth taking action to make progress in addressing major human health challenges.
"This is a critical moment in the fight against AIDS", said Deborah King, CEO of the UK AIDS Trust Fund (NAT).
If it is indeed targeted at people in need and at risk, then pre-exposure prophylaxis offers the possibility of changing the UK AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, the NHS-funded trial in England will provide a new authorized tool for people with HIV at high risk, which can be implemented individually and without consulting with sexual partners, and will improve the lives of many people.
We are in favour of this announcement.
Ian Green, CEO of the Trident Higgins Trust Foundation, said: "The priority now is to ensure that the trial is quickly rolled out nationwide and that no HIV infection is dropped.
Now that we have purchased the PrEP test drug, we are prepared to protect more than 10,000 people with high risk of HIV.
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson claimed: "After months of delays and government delays, the start of the preliminary trial of PrEP is popular and should come sooner".
Evidence shows how the drug can change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This trial will give us a better understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
Now, it is very important to launch this trial nationwide as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and help us further stop the spread of HIV in society.

High quality living: applying the tower and ingenious design to make the small condo apartment a spacious home
Joanne Ray is a former banker who is passionate about home improvement and moved from her large house on Knight Bridge to the small apartment in the county court in 2014.
The apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - Joanne didn't pack her bags and sold them, which is a powerful proof of the new design.
Before that, I lived with my ex-boyfriend in a bigger house on Knight Bridge, Joanne said.
I was looking for a house that would fit the offer.
I saw this apartment in the county court and it had a very high ceiling.
I would love to make an offer that day.
After first seeing the house, the 1,000 square foot apartment has now been completely renovated.
The apartment was originally a complex single room layout - it took a kitchen to get to the bedroom - and Joanne wanted to add storage space and loft to make the most of the height of the ceiling.
I want a high ceiling, large windows, and enough light.
That's my request, Mom said.
To do this, she hired Elvan Azadi from Duck & Shed Architecture and Design Studio (Notting Hill) to use the 12.5-foot ceiling to carefully build a house that was not just a development project, but where Joanne lived.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to add two upper and lower spaces, so the challenge is to create a tower high enough to stand.
Ervan must play creative, so that this problem can be solved.
The structure of the aluminum steel is quite complex, he explained.
"We have to arrange space so that it is displayed above and below, and without the need to shoulder the bow back.
It is not only simple to build a simple platform, but also to move the steel to the right height to achieve its function.
By this arrangement, Elvan was able to get two full-height rooms in the space - adding many interesting elements.
The tower features retrouvius branded retro bronze windows that overlook the charming living area.
The golden furniture with mirrors, the silver pieces and the retro lighting of Serge Mouille laid the foundation for the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing atmosphere, space and light.
Mirrors are installed at both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored anti-lock panel is like a window to another room.
At the front door, a small box with mirrors provided storage space for Joanne to store dining and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an attractive sense of space, and can hold the kitchen when not in use.
Folding kitchens are not new.
But what is unique about this folding kitchen is that it has a garage-style elevator door.
He discusses some engineering knowledge and explains the steel reinforcement MDF gate.
The principle of balance is used, so it is easy to slide when you push the door.
Thanks to clever use of space and resources, Joanne received an additional 16 square meters, a bedroom and an improved layout.
"In the end, you sell the area of the house - or your property is valued based on the area of the house", says Elvan.
Basically, the real estate agent goes into the room and calculates based on the size of the floor.
They will try to increase the space and use quality materials, which will give the space a luxurious feeling.
Ervan said that the materials of aluminum are personal choices, so it helps to create emotional bonds in the home.
Oh, you won't fall in love with the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they won't hold you back.
It turns out that with good design and added extra space, standard apartments can swing to your surprise.
In fact, you might choose to stay like Joanne.

News of July 26, July 22, Journalists from Red Bridge District learned that the largest riverfront park in the city's city center, Red Bridge District, has completed the green landscape upgrading project on both sides of the South Canal and is open to the public free of charge.
The entire landscape belt, using the natural ecological and historical cultural resources, was redesigned and upgraded on both banks of the South Canal, creating the five riverfront views of the waterfront corridor, the New World Square and Wellington Square.
A 1,500-meter-long plastic tunnel was laid on the green ground on both sides of the river between the Qinghua Bridge and the new three stone bridges.
In addition to planting various flowering trees on both sides of the tunnel, a children's playground was built and a set of sculptures were placed on the sidewalk.
Along the way, you can see that the beach has also built seats, tunnels, small bridges, a level table and sand pools for children to play in, which integrates the green landscape and water system on both sides, providing a place for recreation, fitness and entertainment for citizens.
Yesterday, the head coach of the Chinese national team, Liu Lipi, announced the list of 23 players who will participate in the China Cup, which has sparked a huge controversy.
The State Council attaches great importance to how to deal with the scandal of new energy vehicles, which has been the subject of high attention from the entire society and even the international automotive industry since the revelation in January this year.
One of the reasons why electric cars are not selling well is because the product is not promoted well enough.
According to the latest national public health survey data from 2014, the population of sports fitness increased by almost 8 percentage points compared to 2007.
The brothers played the $500 million real estate empire fighting the Great War.
Forty years after their Italian family founded the dynasty, the brothers fought for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Colin De Lutis, former director and developer of Carlton Football Club, lives in a mansion in the Tucala district, three blocks from his brother Paul's home. The latter sued him in the Supreme Court over the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul had wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the two brothers had a fierce argument in the Supreme Court about the asset division.
Together, the brothers and their mother own 38 properties worth more than $500 million, which have accumulated steadily since the family bought Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually expanded to 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company was sold for $85 million.
The money was then put into real estate. Currently, the DeRuthis family's portfolio includes city office buildings, the Blenrich and Sorrento development projects, apartments on the Gold Coast and in Mount Blair, and suburban shopping centers.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, the main promoter and dominant figure in the DeRuthis family, as his brother Paul was known, owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul owns about one-third.
The documents submitted to the court said that, according to the settlement, the property owned by Colin was worth $ 316 million, while the property owned by Paul was worth $ 176 million.
Paul believes that the division of real estate and cash proves to be the symptom of negotiations.
The Property Divide Proposal proposed by Colin left him with what I consider to be the best property, he wrote in a first court oath in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the Supreme Court held its first hearing.
Now, the brothers are still fighting for control of the existing businesses, and Paul says Colin has taken him out.
Colin denies this and accuses Paul of failing to manage certain real estate.
In his early affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed his desire to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian tradition determines the family as the most important option. My Italian ancestry determines the family as the most important", he wrote.
The costs of the case have been rising, and there are hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and reports from top law firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Mrs. DeRouitis and her late husband Luigi both immigrated to Italy. They started running mass catering and fast food stores in the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the mortgage to buy the Colinwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said, "Well, I was in high school when I was three, and he founded Westco, and Paul was very young at the time (about 10 years old).
Anna de Ruthis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass the property peacefully to their son.
Louise Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of the DeRuthis Group, and Colin said Mark paid him $10 million when he left the company and Luke $26 million.
Paul said Luke and Mark were equally unhappy with the terms of their property division.
According to television star Eddie McGuire's biography published in 2015, although Colin was a member of the board of directors of the former AFL club, he kept his tone low.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
However, only Colin responded by text. He said that since the case has been submitted to the court, I really can't say much.
My brother Paul chose to sue me and take our family affairs to court, which is very, very sad, he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
He said: "Our father doesn't want to see Paul and I end up with a dispute like this, and he added that he still has hope for a resolution of the dispute".
On Friday, this hope seems to have been shattered.
Our problems will be solved in court in the near future, Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media time
Others have tried, but all have failed.
John F. Kelly might actually be able to do it.
If so, he is the first.
According to the political news website Politico, the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports, in order to ensure greater stability for the boss.
Here is a quote from journalist Josh Dawsey:
When new White House chief of staff John F. Kelly began his first day of work and met with senior officials to discuss, he pointed out that he was solving one of the key problems President Trump entered the White House: the flow of bad information into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information helped the president make better decisions, so information needed to be handled by him, either in writing or briefly.
Kelly's diagnosis seems similar, but others tried to dissuade him by monitoring Trump's media time, but ultimately failed.
President Trump's TV habit has been going on for a long time and is now in the White House, where his TV watching habit is still deepening.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Naberg told Politico that it would be helpful to let him know that he has been given positive coverage in a credible channel if candidate Trump is frustrated with the unfair reporting.
Tallah Palmerie of Politico wrote at the time that, based on the experience of six former campaign officials, the focus of controlling Trump's tweeting habits was to ensure that the media messages he received personally always contained a certain amount of praise.
This is absolutely fine.
But Trump's Twitter habit of being controlled is a ridiculous view.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know about, which is that Trump's tweets would have been even more explosive if they hadn't intervened.
We may never know the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff were able to save him from the water and fire, even if only a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing groups, people are promoting their worldview and flourishing their careers by providing Trump with information that may or may not be reliable.
Politico was all about the story and in May reported that advisers were keen to provide the president with questionable information strategically.
Here is an example described by journalist Shane Goodmancher:
The current and former Trump officials said Trump's reaction to negative news clips like volcanic eruptions, especially those that have destructive information leaks, would be crazy about finding out the source.
In late February, someone maliciously copied an article on the website GotNews.com of cyber instigator Charles C. Johnson to the president, which alleged Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh was the source of the massive White House leak, which Trump was doing at the time.
Even though Johnson has been banned permanently from Twitter for harassment, he has not provided any concrete evidence and has blasted out a number of false accusations, which he later publicly denied.
Trump looked at the article and started asking officials about Walsh.
Goodmancher also said that then-staff chief Raines Prebas and White House secretary Robert Porter tried to create a system to manage and record the files Trump received.
What about the results?
Kelly intends to do the same thing three months later.
He may prove himself to be a more efficient administrator than Prebbs, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his aides are still competing for influence.
These perpetual influences make it difficult for Kelly to do his job.
Tourism town: How to get tourists drunk
[Abstract] The potential of Zhejiang Town is gradually being awakened.
These towns, which are now important destinations for tourists to visit and appreciate the waters of the mountains, read the culture of the mountains and feel the nostalgia of the mountains, will also be an important contribution to my efforts to build the most beautiful tourist destination in China.
Win the mood
The drumming of the company is accompanied by a rise in the moon, and the aroma of the sausage is followed by the wind.
The traditional handicraft techniques such as bamboo, bamboo, iron, shoes, picking, cotton, etc. are everywhere, fully showcasing the non-material cultural heritage of the town, visitors are immersed in the atmosphere of experiencing the popular style of Shao-ting and learning about the historical cultural accumulation of Shao-ting.
It is reported that during the three-day New Year's holiday this year, more than 650,000 tourists visited Anhui Town.
In Zhejiang, the unique towns like Anhui Town are the star-roofed tablets: the waves of the Gajing West, which flowed over the warmth of the Jiangsu-Yang village; the white walls of the 28th district of Zhejiang, which tell the story of the millennium old town; the fisherman paintings of the town of Shijiazhuang, which sketch the life of fishermen with both traditional and modern vibes. These towns are the jewel in the crown of Zhejiang tourism and the favorite destination for tourists from all over the world.
In recent years, with the development of tourism throughout the province, the potential of Zhejiang Township has been gradually awakened.
In 2016, the provincial government office officially released a proposal for the implementation of the work to create tourist towns in Zhejiang Province, proposing that over a period of about five years, about 100 popular folk towns with strong folk influences, ecological beauty and tourism-rich characteristics will be named in the entire province.
These towns, which are now important destinations for tourists to visit and appreciate the waters of the mountains, read the culture of the mountains and feel the nostalgia of the mountains, will also be an important contribution to my efforts to build the most beautiful tourist destination in China.
The relevant head of the provincial tourism office explained that in the tourism-friendly towns, the creation of tourism-friendly towns is now more important in the towns and cities of our province, and new tourism projects and business levels are coming out endlessly, bringing rich experience to tourists and gaining a good reputation.
Heavily promoted
Recently, the Zhejiang Tourism Authority and Zhejiang Daily News Group organized by Zhejiang Group Tourism Full Media Center organized by Zhejiang Group Tourism Towns X Future Artists Shared the collection of poems Zhejiang Towns Have a Spirit Zhejiang Towns Have a Spirit Zhejiang Province Exhibition Hall held the closing ceremony of the promotion season of Zhejiang Tourism Wind Towns 2017.
The town of Hurricane has artistic beauty and a temperature of life.
The town's atmosphere is original, original, original, a pure, original ecological.
Experts such as the teacher of the Department of Film and Animation Arts of the Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, the country's leading director of video advertising, Shei Liu, and Professor Xu Wenjian, the dean of the School of Arts and Communication of the Chinese University of Measurement, told the story of the small town of Liu Xia in the footage.
Many of the scenic tourist towns in Zhejiang have rich cultural resources, and Dong, a representative of the town of Nanchang in Huzhou City, has been rebuilt to interpret the national painting Nanchang on the spot.
The atmosphere of Jiangnan Water Country has always been loved by book artists, and today, Nanchang Town has a deep collaboration with art institutions such as China Academy of Art.
Tourism is essential for tourist towns and cities to have the elements of the atmosphere, tourism, service and environmental elements.
In this context, tourism's service facilities and environment are also important.
If a rain-like day passes by, it will also allow visitors to experience the town's atmosphere better.
In this era of sharing, the hottest sharing company, Rainbow, has created a series of shared stories of the Zhengjiang Rainbow, which is a collection of poems written by the Zhengjiang Rainbow, in order to advocate the concept of green rainbow sharing, to raise tourism awareness and civilized values among tourists and townspeople, and to create a beautiful tourist environment.
This became a highlight of the promotion of the 2017 season of the tourist and windy town of Zhejiang.
Looking forward to the great
As of now, Zhejiang Province has released the first list of 21 provincial tourist-friendly towns and 115 provincial tourist-friendly towns to cultivate the list of creation.
As a priority area for rural tourism development during the 13th and 15th Dynasties, Windsor Town will eventually be built into a tourist attraction above level 3A, becoming a new model for tourism products diversity, tourism benefits highlighting, and industrial integration win-win.
The tourist town is attractive because of its original juicy taste.
The beauty of the tourist-friendly town is not only the flowing water of the small bridge, which is covered in smoke, but also the long-standing cultural tradition; the revitalization of the countryside is the result of cultural confidence.
The international, Dutch town of Leather, Austrian town of Halsted, and French town of Nambour, which are the main attractions of tulips, salt peppers and nambour each year, attract large numbers of tourists from all over the world to realize tourism and boost the economy of the town.
For the towns of spirit, the emphasis on the characteristics of the town, the emphasis on the country-like atmosphere, makes the towns with a clear personality and soul, more so in providing cultural immersion, carrying local context, and highlighting the country's indigenous civilization.
The tourist town, which is linked to culture and country, and carries people and landscapes, connects with tourists from all over the world, allowing traditional atmospheres and cultures to be passed on and innovated in the sharing of co-building.
In essence, the tourist town is a complex open tourist area, and should be a shared living space for local residents and foreign tourists and even travelers.
As the main battlefield for future tourism growth, tourist towns and villages can not only change the ecological landscape of the countryside, the way economic and social development is conducted, the direction of industrial elements flow, but also the important force to eradicate the urban and rural construction gap and awaken the rural cultural recovery.
In the rush of rural revitalization, the tourist town of Zhejiang will tell a richer story.
Data shows that 70% of China's travel demand is concentrated within 3 kilometers, so the entire short-haul market is a day of bike sharing.
Japan's Financial News reported that inflation pressures will increase due to the fiscal expansion policy of the Trump administration's next term, and the rate hike in 2017 will also accelerate.
The annual CES International Consumer Electronics Show will open in Las Vegas from January 9 to January 10 (Beijing time) in the United States.
According to the list of exhibitors published on the official website of CES on January 9, a total of 4577 enterprises from all countries participated in the 51st CES.
Compared to the huge production of 13,000 episodes of TV series broadcast annually, these low-key dramas are nothing more than a fluke.
The campers negotiated the tunnel and returned to the Rich Street tunnel
There was another dispute between some of the wealthiest owners in the West Midlands and the will-owners, who negotiated a government-built ditch to return land outside the mansion.
The tenants parked their 20 trailers in an empty space outside the bustling Solihull Street, which was renamed the "Rich Street".
The campers, looking down at their horses, hugging babies and leading the campers, returned after being driven out in May, and the city government dug a dam in the city wall that did not stop them from entering.
The team of the slide trainers found a gap in the defensive line, and although there was no roadblock set up to pass through, their vehicles squeezed through the gap.
Angry residents have been fiercely critical of the Solihull Council, saying that it has performed poorly in dealing with the issue.
One resident who did not want to be identified said: "They arrived there on Monday night and before they arrived in Binleysh Street, they threw stones at passersby.
The committee should be ashamed of their actions, because they are simply nothing in their dealings with the issue.
The guest came here in May and were then driven away, and now they are back.
There were many more coming last night, and there may be more today.
She added that Birmingham City Council knows how to handle the protection of its parks by imposing a long-term ban.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I would not be willing to continue paying municipal taxes if Parliament could not stop this.
A local resident who declined to be named said: "Oh, this is ridiculous, we just saw the last group of passengers leave, but it was easy for another group to destroy it".
The number has increased again, and some people have even seen horses eating grass on the park lawn.
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Committee said: "We know that someone is camping on an empty plot of Szwahritzbrook road without permission, and we are now working with the Solihull Police and taking the necessary legal action to get them out as soon as possible".
It is very important to support our evidence collection by asking as many locals as possible to report any antisocial or criminal activity to the police by calling 101.
This helps us to outline the situation when we submit cases to the court for the court to consider.
On March 15, the closing session of the Fifth Session of the General Assembly of the People's Representatives of the 12th National Assembly was held in Beijing People's Congress Hall.

Stanford University launched the One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100) research program to evaluate the future of AI over the long term.
Researchers believe that AI will be ubiquitous in the future and will play an important role.
When it comes to employment and workplaces, research suggests that AI can replace tasks rather than jobs and help create new jobs.
According to an actor from the drama team, Zhang Ma was a thoughtful person on the scene, and he had to be personally present in every aspect, from the crowd actors to the dress code.
Italy takes a tough stance on NGO migrant rescue vessels
Italy warned NGOs operating migrant rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be allowed to continue rescue operations unless they signed new operations management regulations.
Interior Minister Mark Minnitti said in an interview with Turin Daily News: "It's hard to see what they'll do if NGOs don't sign the new code of conduct".
The day before Minnetti issued the warning, Italian officials suspected that the crew on a boat that was hauling young rescue workers from German aid organizations actually conspired to help illegal migrants and to arrest human traffickers.
The aid group has only been operating for a year and refused to comment on the specific allegations of Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartoccio.
In a statement on social media, the group said that saving lives is and will be the most important thing for us now and in the future, so we regret that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area at the moment.
After collecting all the information, we can only assess all the allegations and situations at the moment.
Italian officials have been monitoring the Iuventa boat, a youth rescue group, since October.
Its crew allegedly carried migrants who were transported directly by small boats by human traffickers and allowed smugglers to rush away and reuse the vessel.
According to documents from prosecutors, at least one such meeting allegedly took place in the sea 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast. The document was published by Italian media.
Its crew is alleged to have publicly disregarded the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees the rescue operations in the area out of humanitarian zeal and not any other motivation.
According to the Code of Conduct, vessels like the Iuventa clearly require an Italian policeman to supervise their activities on board.
Currently, only three of the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue operation have agreed to comply with the code of conduct: Save the Children, the migrant maritime aid station based in Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that although it considered the new rules unnecessary, they could be accepted because they would not bring any significant changes and obstacles to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign, the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF) is one of the most important.
Meanwhile, Minnitti said the number of migrants arriving in Italy has plummeted in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libya's coast guard and unite local mayors have seen firsthand results.
The minister said: "In the last few days, we have started seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.
He announced plans for an in-depth meeting this month: discussing economic development activities with the mayors of Libya and how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave these countries for Europe with Chad, Niger and Mali.
Transport Bank chief financial officer Liang Ping said that due to the fact that the industrial value added in the first three quarters of 2017 was characterized by a quarter-end increase, it is expected that the industrial value added growth in December could accelerate to 6.6%.
Fixed-asset investments are expected to grow at a cumulative rate of 7.2% in December, compared to the same period last month, which is lower than last year.
Although industrial production will be weak in October, it is basically on par with November.
While Chinese manufacturing investments were low in December, but infrastructure investments improved slightly, so fixed asset investments are expected to remain flat in November.
More than 200,000 people entered the United States, mostly for smuggling; they were abroad, they were never home, their loved ones were separated, and similar scenes continued to occur.
Beijing Xi'an University evacuates new initiative: 10,000 students from the North Chemical Institute will be in the Xi'an Xi'an campus
The opening ceremony of Beijing Chemical University's new campus 2 was held in Beijing's Xi'an District, and the 1,800 acre green campus was officially put into use.
The journalist learned from the ceremony that in recent years, in the context of the development and disengagement of non-capital functions in Beijing, Beijing has accelerated the disengagement of Central City High Schools to suburbs, and some high school students are moving in batches to new suburbs such as Shunxi, Daxing, and Xianshang.
The North Chemical New Campus, located in the town of Nanzhou, China, covers an area of 1,800 hectares and is 40 km from the city center. It is one of the key projects in Beijing to remove non-capital functions.
The construction of the new campus divided into three phases, the current phase of construction is complete, and the second phase is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year, and the entire project will meet the needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty staff to learn and live.
Looking back at this year's film market, we found that the original script and the two sets of stars that starred in the film were an important part of the expected audience.
At 17:10 today, the 119 command center in Yangon City received an alert for a fire in the storage of the macrochemical plant in Dongxiang, Tsinqing District of the city.
The Yang City Fire Department immediately sent 20 fire trucks of the 5 squadron to the scene with heavy anti-chemical clothing and anti-chemical washing machine equipment.
After initial detection, the fire was started by a small storage tank of chemicals such as folic acid, which produced a large amount of smoke.
As of the press release, firefighters were working to rescue, and municipal health, safety, environmental protection, security, transportation and other departments have been rushed to the scene without any injuries being detected.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to death for the suicide of Conrad Roy by text message
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for killing her boyfriend by texting and phone.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months in prison, which can be commuted to probation after the expiry of the term.
Carter was convicted in June of involuntary manslaughter for Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is saddened.
My son is my best friend.
While awaiting appeal, Carter was allowed to remain free.
She faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, but her lawyer group believes she and Mr Roy both suffer from mental illness.
At the time of the sentencing, Carter stood, wearing red pants and pink shirts, hands clasped, eyes covered with wax, and eyes facing down.
Her actions killed Conrad Roy, prosecutors told the court.
She ended his life to live better for herself.
She has not taken responsibility, the prosecutor said.
"She has no regrets".
But Carter's lawyer said it was a terrible consequence, and she regretted it.
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find her age or maturity, nor did he find that her mental illness would have any significant impact on her behavior.
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said, "I have not spent a day not grieving the loss of my beloved son".
I hope he is proud of me and everything I have done. I am trying to stand with him and his sisters in all my pain, and these pain will accompany us forever.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was in a mental state of trance because she realized she could never attend her brother's wedding or be the mother of his children.
Losing someone who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and I will live with it for the rest of my life.
This case seems to set a legal precedent, as the law in Massachusetts does not require anyone else to commit suicide.
Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his car in 2014; Carter was 17 this year.
Carter's text message revealed that she had threatened to kill him, and the case sparked national attention.
There are many ways to hang up, jump up stairs, stab himself. She said in a few text messages sent two weeks before his death; he was on vacation with his family.
In the time before his suicide, she wrote: "Oh, you need to do this, Conrad, oh, you just have to start the generator and then you get freedom and happiness".
Judge Monitz said Carter had gained attention through Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There is legal disagreement in this case.
Among the few people who defended Carter, Amanda Knox, who was accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007, was acquitted two years later.
In a column article published in the Los Angeles Times, Ms. Knox, 30, said: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not imprisonment".
Zhang Jiejiajie is destined to be a controversial film artist who has been at the forefront of Chinese cinema since he started shooting his first film, and has also garnered a lot of uncontroversial rewards while leading the Chinese film scene.
The reporter learned from the Lhasa Net Earth Basketball Club on 2nd that recently, the Lhasa Net Earth Basketball Youth Team took fourth place in the final of the National Junior Basketball League in Beijing.
The Lhasa Netto Ground Basketball Youth Team is composed of 11 local players, with the head coach being assistant coach of the Lhasa Netto Ground Men's Basketball Senior Team, R. R. Sanju.
The Tibetan basketball player who was traveling to Beijing for the final.
Liang Jun-sup, general manager of the Lhasa Net Earth Basketball Club, told reporters that the team's performance has improved significantly compared to last year, the confidence of the players and the grasp of the field have improved significantly.
After the match, team captain Jiang Zhou said that he wanted to do his best for the basketball career in Tibet by accumulating experience by participating in the game.
It is understood that in the Beijing games, the players overcame factors such as low altitude intoxication, which showed the Tibetan image.
Although athletics is the gold medal of the Olympics, and athletes have to be under the sun, the name of the sport will be less than gold.
Automobile manufacturers are facing a shock, Audi will upgrade up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before Audi announced the upgrade, BMW said it would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 cars.
BMW's chairman said BMW believes that driving diesel has more intelligent options than restricting diesel, meaning that major European cities - including Munich, where BMW's headquarters are located - are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it would refurbish 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
No company has claimed the move was a recall.
European car manufacturers are promoting diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help achieve CO2 emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
Automotive companies are also increasing the cost of installing equipment to offset diesel exhaust emissions, so it is difficult to keep diesel cars competitive on prices.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government led by Prime Minister Angela Merkel has also been accused of over-indulging in these powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid repeating the cover-up of the masses, which is to cover up the alleged failure of their use of devices, adjusting emissions during vehicle testing to conform to legal regulations and restore normal driving conditions.
Several executives at Volkswagen have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated by countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermo-mechanics at the Audi engine research and development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zacchero Giovanni Pameo is Italian and therefore not subject to extradition protection and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the general public, where the German government accused Audi's installation system of expanding the scope of the investigation to the United States to avoid European emissions requirements.
Audi is under investigation and could have a significant impact on the general public: luxury car manufacturers hold a disproportionate share of the profits of Volkswagen.
A film is a common occurrence in the world, from preparation to release, for a year or two or even several years.
The animated film, which was announced ahead of the Big Fish Beach Day, will be released on July 8, 12 years from the time of preparation to the release date!
Liang Guo, the original author of the manga, a 21-year-old from Qinghai University, who founded the thermal energy industry, along with his friend Zhang Chun, the company Beyond Day, which received a million-dollar venture investment from the joint venture in 2008 to launch the anime film Virgin of the manga.
The film has won numerous awards at home and abroad during the creative prototyping phase, and has been acclaimed as one of the most outstanding works of art by the Centre d'Art Contemporain de Pompidou in France.
Due to the six years from its creation to production, the film was dubbed "The Godfather" by millions of fans who were hoping for a premiere.
The Great Fish Beach tells a fantastical story about the Chinese people. With the release of this preview, it brings a whole new hope for all the audience.
Liang said: "I've only done this for 12 years, and now it's become a reality from a dream, and I'm both nervous and excited.
Zhang Chun said: "I'm driving the team crazy when I think about using one fifth of someone else's budget to produce the same picture effect as everyone else".
The world's largest cement factory in Dongguan, which once relied on raw materials processing and large-scale construction, is focusing on the high-level talent who can lead the city to reposition itself.
During the recent week of high-level talent events organized by the Dongguan Municipal Government, the first financial journalist saw that some local companies with strong tools have taken part in talent talks.
On the bright billboards under the red wall, each marked a price code that was unfair.
Therefore, the China Television Production Industry Association decided to unite the national television production industry and sign the Convention on Autonomy.
Provence's cotton is threatened by climate change
The garment has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is bad news that it is threatened by climate change.
The decline of the garlic is due to the ongoing drought and the emergence of virus-carrying insects, which has left scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions with headaches.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute of Agriculture in Provence, said that the plant is facing a major threat because it has been affected by climate change in recent years, with significantly reduced rainfall in spring and prolonged monsoon in autumn.
This will affect the life cycle of the garlic.
There is also a smaller individual, a leafy leafy shrub that can spread microorganisms, and in very dry weather they appear in large numbers.
The key is that their numbers are huge.
Apart from attracting holidaymakers, the clean, lavender laundry is also sought after by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric Jones said: "Unlike plants that can grow many large flowers and have very long grain spines, we have problems with smaller individuals, poor development, lack or lack of stems.
So we have less essential oil.
Solutions under study include adopting better irrigation techniques and reducing soil moisture evaporation, spraying protective mixtures of clay and water on plants, and developing more drought-resistant varieties.
The two main actors expressed their interest in the story of the film rather than the science fiction elements in the film.
On the afternoon of September 5, the reporter of the Washington Post, who interviewed several prominent figures in the photojournalist community, and two photojournalists, were surprised that they were almost unanimously silent.
One was a Berlin filmmaker, one was a teenage actor in the ascendant period, and one was also the first partner of Zhang and Li Lifeng.
Mexico's dangerous situation is heavy, journalists have been killed
The entire staff of Riodoce Weekly usually gather on Wednesday to review their plans to report on the riots in Sinaloa, which were caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and an endless war on drugs.
But today, the shadow of tragedy overshadows themselves, and they gather to discuss security issues.
They are told that it is important to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed which would make them feel safer: whether to take their children to their offices (the office was hit by grenades in 2009) or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemy, neutral and ally.
They let these journalists list their names under each of the posts, and no need for evidence, observation and intuition is enough.
There are suspicions that drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists, or cartels on the government list, the villains have put a dangerous burden on reporting in Mexico.
Violence has never ceased, and the country is full of journalists: at least 25 journalists have been killed since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to records from the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 journalists have been protected by federal protection after being attacked and threatened; and so far this year, at least seven journalists have died in seven states.
The last one to die was their editor and inspiration, and the co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdes Cardenas.
Valdis has written many books about drug violence, and in one of them he wrote: "The biggest mistake I made was living in Mexico and becoming a journalist".
It was felt deeply that he had left, although he was everywhere holding a huge photo hanging in front of the Riodoce building, Valdis staring at his middle finger, chanting "Justice Cheers"; Aaron Ivala and Miriam Ramirez, the two 30-year-old journalists, wore T-shirts showing his smile, wearing glasses or his iconic Panama straw hat.
The workshop was held less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and multiple disorders.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, the office prosecuted only two people, according to records from the Committee to Protect Journalists.
The majority of the thousands of criminal cases per year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so it is rare to bring the killer of journalists to justice.
In Riodoce, they insisted on reporting the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts were broken, although the land was a thousand holes.
Iwara said that without information about the killer and without justice, holding a security forum would be useless.
He said that wasting time at such a workshop was stupid.
You don't trust anyone until we know why.
On the morning of May 15, Valdis left the Riodoce office in the capital city of Curiacan.
His red Toyota Carolla was stopped by two men after only a few blocks; they forced him out of the car and fired 12 guns, presumably because the newspaper's name translates to "Twelfth Street".
The thug drove his car away and crashed it nearby.
Valdis is 50 years old.
He left behind his wife and two grown children.
Kuryakam is rumored to be four.
But as far as the subject of Valdis is concerned, there is nothing really except silence.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become the country's bloodiest battlefield, where hostile forces have been madly slaughtered.
One or more people are shot every day on the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is filled with two-story, lavishly poisoned mausoleums, which are already commonplace.
Forget about the state of peace and quiet for a while when only one cartel controls the state of Hawai'i and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdis was well aware of the dangers of the job, 60-year-old Riodoce Co-Founder and Director Ismail Bohoquay was still not guilty of not protecting his friends.
He believes that two mistakes caused the tragedy.
The first, published in February, was an interview with Damasso Lopez, who led a cartel group fighting against several of Guzman's sons.
The report may have angered the sons; the newspaper was bought by suspected gang members once it was delivered to the newsstand.
The second mistake was that after another newspaper reporting the same story was confiscated, Valdis was not forced to leave Mexico for his own safety.
Valdis is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death has significant implications for Mexico's violence against journalists.
His spirit lives on, and his friends and colleagues believe that he has always been with us.
In 2003, he was a senior journalist at the Northwest Coalition, and together with five colleagues he founded the Riodoce Coalition, selling $50 of the shares.
Pookwee said that in Sinaloa, journalism cannot be done without dealing with the drug problem.
Over time, the paper has gained a good reputation for its bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising have increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish investigative reports that are harmful without worrying about censorship, and readers like to publish stories that others do not dare to report.
Riodoce won the Latin American National Maria Moscabo Press Award five years after its founding.
The same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded Valdis the International Press Freedom Award, in recognition of his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug reporting.
He confessed that he was afraid too.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the prize, he said, "I want to live".
Later in late October, he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV, a local television station, that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
You must take the task on your shoulders as a journalist, either that or you must be deaf.
I don't want to be asked what you did... why don't you speak out about what's happening?
The entire staff of Riodoce misses Valdis, missing him, who cursed like a dock worker, missing this friend who never wavered in his embrace and advice, missing this teacher who knew how to survive.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat all the time.
The El Guayabo bar, which is across the street from the office, is always sitting at the same table.
Now, they will ask: Is it his daily habits that caused his fall?
His death also forced them to think about how to work well and live well.
Pookwee said, "Oh, they don't like you bothering their women and children, nor do they like you affecting their legal companies and secret airports for transporting drugs".
These have crossed their bottom line.
The result is that even when it is safest, a high level of self-censorship and self-protection is required.
Believe in your intuition.
If you smell a dangerous breath, get away quickly.
Andrés Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, said the problem was that the smell of the lime was a feeling of being deceived... and then something like Havilland happened.
He and others said that the old rules no longer apply to Sinaloa, just as they no longer apply to Tamalpais, Veracruz, Greer and other states, where smuggling routes are profitable, and where institutions are fragile, government officials are corrupt, and smugglers are out of control.
The situation is changing constantly.
Mobile phones were suddenly banned in the rooms where Riodoce employees were attending security training; days ago, spyware allegedly sold only to the government had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen were walking in the cool under the tree, avoiding the high temperature of 104 degrees Celsius (40 degrees Celsius).
They are the state government's offices to protect Riodoce's property, which is located in a four-story building in the middle class district of Curiacan.
Some journalists jokingly said they didn't know if the police would be more than 50% of the letters the governor himself said.
Journalists have been in the mountainous region for months now, where drug trafficking groups are under the control of their real presence.
This week's Riodoce series mainly covered three major events.
Among them was the murder of the brother of the great former boxer Julio César Chávez of Sinaloa.
The governor's hometown also disclosed government funding.
The kidnapping took place in a restaurant in Curiacan, which is just one block from the prosecutor's office.
The authorities have not released information about the abducted objects and the abduction process, so it is necessary to be cautious when writing about what the city knows: that is where the restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and officials.
A journalist learned from public archives that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the ruling party, the Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political classes throughout the last century.
Recently, several revolutionary regime party governors have been accused of corruption in several highly regarded cases.
Viral asked reporters to write a story about what happened at the scene before, including the incident where a son of Mexican top drug addict, Tang Guzman, escaped a military attack.
If readers look at Valdis' column a few months ago, they will find the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
Virair, 46, known as "the skinny one" because of his slim figure, said that we already knew what was happening before.
Now all our communication channels are monopolized.
Valdis' office is now used to store the logos and stickers of journalists protesting the killing, because the employees become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed a sign and left the room for the local prosecutor's office to participate in a march related to another journalist.
Salvador Adamey disappeared in the western state of Michoacán, three days after Valdés was killed.
The official found a burned body and said that according to DNA tests, this was his body.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal, organizing protests and putting words to save media outlets on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, Director Bohoquay was not in Washington, D.C., and he was working to get justice for the Valdis case and international support.
The day after Valdis was killed, during a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez sued the official reporter for information and killed them because they said they had exposed the facts.
Given that her anger had affected her objectivity, she also asked to resign from her position as a government affairs reporter.
Valdis has repeatedly reiterated that Mexican journalists are surrounded by organized crime, corrupt government officials and indifferent social circles.
In his previous book, The Newsroom of the Drug Industry, he wrote that journalists are not only harassed by drug trafficking groups, but also on the list of politicians and security forces who are involved in organized crime and corruption.
The media surveillance group Articulo 19 blamed police and public officials for more than half of the attacks on journalists last year.
Ramirez said, "You're in Mexico, they let you die just to keep you quiet".
Obviously, these murders are unfathomable.
No one has forgotten that six years ago, the bride Maria Elizabeth Marcias died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Next to her body was a statement allegedly signed by Zetaskarel: "Oh, I came for my report".
Her headline was cut off and a computer keyboard and headset were placed next to her.
After Miroslava Brady was killed in March, some newspapers opted to close, such as El Norte, the newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others are still going on, but they are still going on, as the director of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo was killed in 2014.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly discussed the drug cartel in a headline news article entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their homelands or even left the country.
This is a difficult choice.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still need to be careful, cautious and alert on the streets.
Sometimes they get arrested, and it is said that in 2015, photographer Ruben Espinosa was killed in a Mexican city and four women after fleeing Veracruz three months later.
For those who continue to work behind the scenes, this is a daily step in high-risk decision making.
Iwara once wanted to be a poet, and he admitted that reporting drug trafficking made him afraid.
He said that Mexico is becoming hell, so I became a journalist.
On a recent Friday at midnight, the latest edition of the newspaper was printed, and the editors of Riodoce's blog were sitting in the hallway outside the office drinking beer, and suddenly their phones rang.
A series of gunfire attacks against hostile forces and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan have confirmed 19 deaths.
The war is still escalating, as predicted by a series of cartel information found in the region.
They uploaded the news on their mobile phones to Riodoce's website along the way.
The next day the headline had to change.
The whistle rang nearby and another gun battle took place in the area.
Poohquiao looked at the police station guarding the area to see if they were awake.
If they were a little scared, they didn't show up.
The founder of the paper has died, and in his large portrait, his center pointing to the whole of Sinaloa, where the view is needed, the entire staff of Riodoce followed his steps.
The same day Havel was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the streets to report.
China's self-driving tourism market size to exceed trillion yuan in 2020
[Abstract] In the context of consumer upgrades and free movement, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and increasingly popular among consumers.
But at the same time, the market for self-driving cars that is expected to break trillions of dollars is also facing a double challenge.
Against the background of consumer upgrades and free movement, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and increasingly popular among consumers.
But at the same time, the market for self-driving tours that is expected to break trillion-dollar levels is also facing dual challenges, on the one hand, the development of the self-driving touring industry is out of proportion to market demand, and self-driving tour organizers such as self-driving clubs and travel agencies face a marginal profit; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services faced by self-driving tours are still in the initial stages.
The market is expected to reach trillions of dollars, accounting for 60% of the total domestic tourism.
In 2016, 4.44 billion domestic tourists visited the country in the whole year, self-driving travel accounted for about 60% of the total domestic tourism, and the size of the self-driving travel market is expected to exceed trillion by 2020.
According to statistics of the China Traveling Car and Boat Association, the number of people travelling by self-driving car has continued to grow in the last five years, and the proportion of domestic tourists who travel by car has steadily increased by more than half.
At the same time, the emerging field of self-driving cars has shown greater attention and support at regional and national levels, and from 2016 to 2017, a strong set of policy regulations related to self-driving cars, RVs and camping tourism have been introduced.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourism Administration and the National Sports Directorate, jointly released the development plan for the Autonomous Driving Camp; in the same month, the development commission and the Ministry of Finance jointly printed the plan for the promotion of rural tourism development and upgrading of the action plan.
The launch of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of self-driving within the country.
The self-driving clubs are not profitable, and the entire industrial chain is key
Although the potential for the domestic self-driving market is huge and the national policy is actively guided, the self-driving tourism industry is still in its initial stages.
According to the annual development report of the Chinese Autonomous Travel Association 2016-2017, thousands of Autonomous Travel Clubs, Auto Clubs, Motorcycle Clubs and others are found in China, but the proportion of tourists who arrange self-driving trips accounts for the majority, and tourists who attend various organizations such as Autonomous Travel Association and Autonomous Travel Club account for only about 15%.
At the same time, online travel companies and traditional travel agencies that develop autonomous self-driving products are also a number, and many online travel platforms sell only self-driving products provided by some suppliers, while some self-driving clubs are also important suppliers.
From the organizational point of view, self-driving activities cover many aspects of eating, living, walking, traveling, shopping and entertainment, high fragmentation, heavy upstream supply chains, and random consumption by tourists.
Li Changjie, founder and CEO of Beijing Beijing Tianjin Automobile Club, believes that self-driving clubs are essentially similar to travel agencies, and the main earnings model in the early years was mainly offline activities, with the focus on self-driving route products and front line services.
But now, the line products in the autonomous travel sector are seriously homogenous, the level of service in the front line is uneven, and autonomous travel clubs face the need for a new transformation.
It can be seen that self-driving tourism itself is not an independent industry, but rather forms an ecosystem across regions and industries with its characteristics of self-driving tourism, which is important for the formation of a complete industrial chain.
Experts point out that experience is a more important consumption element than basic tourist consumption.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving tourism industry, the experience characteristics should be enhanced, the development of the theme of self-driving tourism + tourism and the IP of self-driving tourism products should be developed.
Landscape paths are not just roads, car camps should not be just for dining.
In the face of the rise of self-driving, the development of the basic support for self-driving is also relatively elementary.
Li Chunjie pointed out that the tourist landscape path is not just a road, but it needs to integrate elements of transport and tourism, but the road repair and tourism itself are two sectors responsible for the transport sector adding tourism elements, but also staying in the construction of toilets, consulting centers, propaganda facilities, and the combination of tourism is not high.
The construction experience is worth learning from the famous self-driving route that crosses the US 66 highway.
Landscape design is no longer the quickest route between the starting point and the destination, but follows the design concept of driving experience fun, providing self-driving tourists with the best enjoyment of the scenic views along the way; the landscape can connect pointed and facial tourist landscapes, while preserving the historical value and cultural value of the ecotourism resources along the way, and can host various thematic activities to enhance the participation of tourists and the experience of the tourist break, creating economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
Apart from the scenic trails, the camp is also an important support facility for self-driving.
But among the self-driving tourists, who the New Jiajing Journal knows, few consumers choose to stay in the camp.
They believe that many camps are oriented towards infrastructure, and can only satisfy the needs of food, not high quality, single products, and not be able to meet the needs of self-driving travel that contains many elements.
Some industry insiders who did not want to reveal their name said that many companies that have been camping in the past few years were to land, land, and afterwards, the infrastructure construction and services of the latter stages of support were not followed, many operating conditions were losses, and without the latter stage of funding, it was difficult to make some corresponding support products.
Consumer groups
According to data released by the China Cruise Ship Association in 2017, the age-specific self-driving tour group is 21-40 years old, especially 31-40 years old, with a certain economic base, and a high demand for personalized tourism and more for child travelers.
According to the accommodation survey, the self-driving population is relatively more likely to prefer non-standard accommodation.
From the type of self-driving, surrounding self-driving is the most important type of self-driving, accounting for 84.32%.
Self-driving is a desire of many people, but the proportion is smaller.
At the same time, as consumer demand increases, tourists who used to like to drive to the attractions have started to change the idea of not taking photos and sleeping in the car during the drive, but focusing more on the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs used disguise to hide from enemies
At first glance, it is terrifying, but it looks like a statue.
The researchers published the first results of a study of biological fossils as large as rhinoceros discovered by Canadian miners, pointing out that the fossil is well preserved, and therefore experts call it the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world.
The fossil is so well preserved that it can even tell that its skin is reddish brown. This indicates that it has had some troublesome experiences.
Relevant reports in the journal Biology Contemporary described it as the best preserved Beetle dinosaur ever discovered in China and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.
The fossil is a newly discovered species of dragonfly that lived in the middle of the Late Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its preservation is extremely good, and researchers were shocked to describe it as truly stunning.
According to the National Geographic magazine, the herbivore, the fossil of the Philaeod dinosaur is the best preserved dinosaur fossil ever found.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the fossil while mining at the Sencore Mill Mine near McMurry Fort in northern Alberta, Canada.
At the time, he came across something that seemed to be not as big as the surrounding rock, so he decided to look closely.
Afterwards, the fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Canadian Museum of Archaeology in Terreval.
It took researchers six years to bring the beast inside the 2,500-pound (1,100-kilogram) Tibetan soil to life.
After so much hard work, the final results are now to be announced.
"If you look closely, you'll almost believe it's sleeping", says Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Terrier Museum and first author.
It will be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science - Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world.
Researchers have found that by studying its skin, the herbivore, although armored, is like a walking tank, but could be threatened by a major threat from the carnivorous dinosaur.
The heavily armored dinosaur uses red and white disguises to hide from predators and uses a cloaking technique known as the "rebound" cloaking technique, which is also used by many modern animals.
Experts say that in this way, it is better able to blend in with its surroundings, avoiding enemies, indicating that it is being preyed upon by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature, a member of the Knot Dragon family, made headlines in May and is currently on display at the Royal Terrier Archaeological Museum.
After 7,000 hours of careful uncovering the monster's face, Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was a member of the team, now studies the monster and names it the Borealopelta markmitchelli frog.
The samples were preserved in excellent condition, allowing Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to record the patterns and shapes of the silicon and silicon deposits.
They discovered the "picking" technique, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the back of the species is darker than the color on its side.
Although the use of the technique is common, the results were surprising, as the dinosaur's body size is far greater than that of existing animals using the technique.
The dinosaur is under pressure to be hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs, and thus evolves in a favorable direction, allowing it to hide in the shed as a means of survival.
However, most animals that use feedback, such as deer, zebras or seagulls, are as small and vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the organism is facing real survival stress.
The massive, heavy-duty dinosaur that were subjected to wild prey shows how dangerous the white-tailed carnivorous dinosaur was, Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in its pollen also showed that the skin color of the dinosaur was red-brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the life trail of the creature, including the stomach contents it retains, to find the final food to eat.
They believe that the dinosaurs fell into the river at death, then were rushed into the sea, and finally sank to the bottom of the sea in a backward manner.
The climate in Alberta was as warm then as it is in southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans may have been deeper inland than they are now.
Brown said: "This knot dragon is truly amazing because it is completely covered by the preserved silicate skin and is still preserved in dimensional space, thus preserving its original shape".
Therefore, the shape of the species is almost the same as it was in the Paleocene.
You don't have to rebuild it with too much imagination; if you stare at it, you'll almost believe it's asleep.
The Biocene was the period when large bipedal dinosaurs roamed the Earth.
Although the Zhao Wang Dragon was the king of the dinosaurs, it appeared only millions of years after the Beetle. The Beetle may have been killed by some of the ancestors of the Zhao Wang Dragon.
They include the tall thorny dragon, a giant that weighs up to 6 tons and is 38 feet (11.5 meters) long.
The latest study found that scientists in the journal Biology of Contemporary Chondroplasia believe that the dragon was washed into the sea after his death and then formed into mummies in the soil.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink excavated the creature at the Millstone mine near McMurry Fort, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved Beetle dinosaur, complete with skin and armor from the nose to the neck.
The average length of this organism is about 18 feet (5 meters) and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch-long spikes that protrude from the shoulder.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous Pithea dinosaur was active in what is now western Canada after flooding rivers flooded into the ocean.
However, the dinosaur buried under the sea allows its scaffold to be preserved in its entirety.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen are very well preserved, so that the remaining skin is still covered with unstable scales of aethers that are bumpy on the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic Magazine, this conservation is as rare as the middle color.
The more I watched, the more incredible it seemed.
The remaining skin fossils are still covered above the armor that is spotted on the dinosaur skull.
Its right forearm is on its side, with five legs extending upwards.
I can get a statistic of the A piece.
The reporter learned that adding hydrochloric acid, corrosive acid and amino acid additive carriers of natural or plant sources to the urethane production process can modify the effect of traditional urethane, and the utilization of hydrochloric acid urethane, hydrochloric acid urethane, and wheat grain urethane urethane increased by 5 to 10 percentage points compared to ordinary urethane.
Environmentally friendly, crop production potential is evident, especially large particulate urine is a quality raw material for BB fertilizer.
This total security staff is twice as many as the security staff at the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest ever Security Initiative.
Previously, the Brazilian government said that a total of 85,000 soldiers and police will be in the joint fight, including 20,000 soldiers and 65,000 police.
Most of the troops will be responsible for defending the Olympic venue, while the new 3,000 troops will be responsible for security at international airports, metro stations and streets.
Police patrolled other parts of the city, including the subway, buses and streets.
It is reported that 6,000 soldiers have arrived in Rio for Olympic security services.
In addition to being responsible for the four Olympic venues in Rio, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport and the main roads connecting the airport and the Olympic venue.
The introduction of the assessment mechanism in the service sector is not new, and it is important to make the assessment mechanism effective, so that the regulation is more effective and not out of form.
How do radicals learn to answer the question: Whose streets are they on?
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Farrell was left in a state of shock and uneasiness.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis native sat on a bed that Peter rented and browsed Facebook on his cell phone.
She accidentally discovered a post from a high school student.
The above reads that the police just killed an 18-year-old boy who was still lying in the street.
She was confused to find that no one else posted the message on the messaging. She shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user of @TheePharoah kept pushing her Dynamic Times.
The St. Louis area rapper tweeted live the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man who was shot dead by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying in the street, his body lying in the street for four hours.
Madness, thought Bo Ferrell.
But death is not new to her and the community she lives in.
She put down her cell phone and didn't open her Twitter again until later that night, reading about the crowd gathering on Camfield Avenue.
There was police video and a photo of people screaming, and there was a photo of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, which said: "The Wolfgson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a message message on the spot where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
She said in another video that another policeman held up his rifle and shouted: "Oh, I will kill you all... cattle".
"It's not normal", said Mr. Ferrell, recalling.
"This is not what we are used to, and it can be called a typical murder case".
At that moment, I felt uncold and shaken.
I was angry and crying.
She booked a return flight and returned home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's home and decided to leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Farrell and Ferguson over the next three years was the subject of a new documentary film, Who's the Street? that was released in theaters on August 11.
It's a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and perseverance from the perspective of people living in this community, crowded with streets and demanding answers.
While Farrell and her daughter (who were wearing flowers and crown jewelry) were driving to Ferguson, the two discussed the many topics they had discussed before that morning - the black experience and the black situation.
"Do you remember when I taught you that black people had to fight for their faith?" she recalled.
Well, we're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is wrong.
I had to take her, Bo Ferrell later said.
What happened today is the climax of everything in the past.
She needs to know, see and get out of this.
She needs to develop not only well in terms of extremism and organization, but also to understand the different levels of black experience and condition, and understand what we must do to gain freedom and liberation.
Even though I was fortunate enough to give her a racist experience she hadn't experienced in person, she was no different from any other black girl.
If I protect her in this case, I feel like I'm hurting her.
They arrived at Ferguson's first station, which was located across the street from the South Florida Police Station. The militants waited until Officer Darren Wilson was finally uncharged, and the site became their camp.
Farrell and her daughter contacted a local business owner who made lunch bags.
They prepared bags and were responsible for delivering the bags to the protesters.
Slowly, Farrell began to form a new type of activism.
She said that her radicalism changed dramatically after August 9. While she was an undergraduate at St. Louis State University, Missouri, she was president of the Minority Nursing Student Association, which focused on the issues of food justice and health disparities in the black community.
I have no organizational experience.
This is how it all came together.
A few weeks later, Farrell met with film co-director Sabah Fulyan during a night parade.
Foleyann said she and her photography director Lucas Alvarado Faledo were just trying to document what happened to her.
A question arose in Farrell's mind: "Do you want to record or find a story that you can use?"
This suspicion comes from many of these cases: people - usually white people - enter a community to benefit from its suffering and perseverance.
As Foleyyan explained in a recent interview, "We hear that people in Ferguson's native land are not focusing their voices, and we want to do it in a different way".
Foleyyan has been in contact with co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism against death row inmates.
His involvement led Ferrell and six other locals to join the Who's Who of the Street? project team, which has been unwavering for years after Brown was shot.
"This documentary is not about someone speaking for us or talking to us, it is about us", said Davidson.
I am focused on how these characters are presented, because that is how I am presented.
Although the goal is not to focus on Farrell's experience, but to show that the campaign is not about the Savior's leader, but about community cohesion, Foleyann said, "She has proven to be the most open participant in the film".
As a result, whose streets are the streets? The streets are amazingly documented in Farrell's personal life, such as falling in love and getting married.
I felt naked, and I laughed when I first saw the finished product.
But I understand that doing this job and making black people human must have a certain degree of vulnerability.
In addition, Farrell's story reaffirms and re-locates the role of black women in the broader movement of black life events.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the shooting of black teenager Trevor Martin in 2012 - have been identified as cool.
Black cool women under Liu's leadership generally supported the movement, Liu Ferrell said, "It's because we continue to fight on multiple fronts".
Black cool women have to put up with all this.
Foleyyan agrees and says that the campaign has really received the support of black women and many black cool women.
Because of her identity, Farrell was chosen as the center of the film. However, she insisted that this was not a positive action for the matter.
"She's the one who inspires this energy", she said.
And while she is on the front lines, it is no coincidence. Because in the life of these crossroads, as a black cooler woman, you have a lot to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy.
Meanwhile, news cameras have long since disappeared in Ferguson, but the tense racial relationship between the community and the police remains.
Ferrell was sentenced to more than two and a half years in prison for trying to block the highway during a march.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in what she called her home region: "A mess".
Nevertheless, she has been sticking to the sacred songs she has been trying to memorize since walking down Ferguson Street three years ago.
"We have a responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing left to lose except the lock on our body.
In fact, online translation services were already available on the web a decade ago, and in fact, long ago, there was talk about the machine that would soon replace humans in translation.
Similarities: The artist used DNA portraits of Chelsea Manning to create the image.
In the center of the exhibition hall at the Friedman Museum in New York, there are several faces: white, black and brown, with almost imperceptible similarities between each face, which are connected by lines that slope from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea Manning to send her face cotton and hairbrushes.
Manning sent haircuts from Livinworth Prison after leaking classified diplomatic cables through WikiLeaks, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
The exhibition opened on August 2nd with the theme "The similarities of the chicken".
This was the result of two years of communication between DuVernay and Manning, who combined his subject with his own in technology, computer science and art, while Manning was a prominent dissident who went to prison and completed sex reassignment surgery in prison. Former US President Obama pardoned her remaining sentence three days before the end of her term.
By algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA, and creating 30 portraits of the most likely appearance of the mole, Heather Duway Habog made a sharp and somewhat ruthless comment. His commentary was both multi-sensitive about DNA and about the concept of identity itself.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, admitted publicly to being a woman in his teens. He was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges including six counts of espionage violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photo, a black and white selfie with a particle sensation, a seemingly restless look, sitting in the driver's seat wearing a fake gold hair.
In 2015, Heather Duway Habogg had a huge success in her 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In that work, she used court documents such as tobacco and gum, and DNA extracted from the fragments, to create a 3D portrait of people that may look similar.
That was the email she received from Paper magazine.
They wanted to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and they needed a portrait. Heather Duway Habogg told the media at the opening ceremony of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning could not visit or take pictures at the time, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
So the artist and her imprisoned boyfriend became an impossible friend, exchanging many letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book cover image, drawn by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted that the president would grant Manning privileges in the future and that she would be able to see the exhibition in prison.
Obama demanded her release days after the book was published. This may have been a coincidence, as Manning was in his seventh year at the Kansas Military Prison.
In addition, the exhibition has another layer of depth. Because the Trump administration in the modern United States is constantly waging war on government leakers and transgender military personnel, while looking for new ways to play on Twitter to uncover and incite division, the exhibition is just about to compensate for such division.
When asked about the special moments of all this, Heather Duway Habog said that everything happens for a reason.
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's signature "Super Big" (with a heart in his name) called for an end to the party-based disorder based on gender, sexual orientation and culture.
On the front wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, with the pencil twisted twisting the Cs,Gs and As symbols.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleic acids, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heather Duway Habog wanted to express that human beings are like this, at least in terms of their physiological structure, by drawing these strikingly similar portraits.
"I hope people get out of this dilemma, that our genomes don't care who we are, how public genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is". Heather Duwe Habogger said that his 2007 video work "The False Memory" is also showing up.
DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so here are 30 of them.
The last piece in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page in the story in the front illustration.
The manning, in the shape of a Kim Jong-un, is displayed under the amplifier held by American soldiers.
"When they stop your speech, they win".
So, please don't shut up.
"The content comes directly from a letter she wrote to me", said the Philadelphia artist.
"I'm scared again, I still have to say".
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person, as predicted in the comic, but when she does, she will be cheered by her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters in the center of the exhibition hall.
This is also purposeful, as all items in the exhibition reached the height of her genetic monopoly information written with pencil (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
I have hung them on walls in the past, but I hope they feel like a bunch of people.
But I wanted them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just like they were protesting for her release.
Northwestern University professors and Oxford University staff are wanted for murder
Police said a man was found stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago, a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were later searched, and the search for suspects is ongoing nationwide.
Cook County court records show that Wyndham Lesem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were sentenced to life in prison without parole for first degree murder in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Durandolo.
According to document records, 26-year-old Cornelius Durandoi died from multiple stab wounds.
According to a community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27.
Police received the call and arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment, where they found several cracks on the victim.
Police said that Cornell Durandello died on the spot, and detectives were investigating his murder, while police were actively looking for two suspects.
Lacem has been an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cowbec, deputy director of campus relations, said in an email statement that Lesem was now dismissed and banned from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
Cobez said that now it is a criminal case, and the relevant authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for Somerville College, Oxford University, said in an email statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist the US investigative body when needed".
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped he could take the case on his own.
Anthony Guerrelli, chief liaison officer of the Chicago Police Department, said he strongly encouraged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
Guerrelli said that the police had a rough idea of their descent and we are working to locate possible locations.
Gürlmi said that local, regional and national authorities are doing their best to assist in the search for suspects.
Guerrelli said that the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment, who had just received a secret tip that there was something going on in apartment number 1008.
Police said the situation was very appalling at the time.
Guerrelli said it is not clear whether the incident happened on July 27.
He said that according to security cameras, Rasem and Warren were in the building at the time.
"We believe Professor Lacem has a certain relationship with the victims", said Mr. Tangurelmi.
Grand Plaza's management team issued a statement to residents saying: "The police are currently investigating the timeline and background of the victims' cases, investigating various motives, including possible domestic events".
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said that we will complete the roadmap of the World Anti-Doping Agency in the near future.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it would not take too long to implement the remaining standards for restoring the rights of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
The implementation of the roadmap standard has reached a certain stage, and RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).
WADA's roadmap has been updated in this regard, Mr. Mutko said Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko made the above statement in commenting on the World Anti-Doping Agency's Roadmap for Compliance with the Regulations in Part II, which sets out the criteria for restoring RUSADA's rights and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the standard does not contain anything that could cause Russian concern.
He added that everything had already been announced and everything would be implemented.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian anti-doping agency must publicly accept the findings of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into the Russian state's support for the use of doping events in its sport.
Speaking about the incident, Mutko said: "Well, we are investigating and our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind this, and we will not admit something that does not exist.
Mutko's words were in response to the words of Vitali Smirnov, head of the Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission of Russia.
Smirnov acknowledged the problems that the Russian anti-doping agency had in the past when he was interviewed by the Russian outlet RSport earlier that day, but he added: "We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and provisions.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally, said Hans Milnov.
Following the doping scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended RUSADA's right to conduct doping inspections within Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate inspections under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director-General Olivia Negri said in July when she visited the organization's headquarters in Moscow that RUSADA is moving in the right direction and working to restore its rights.

In an interview, Croatian Football Association President Davou-Suk said that the China Cup is important for Croatian football and the prize numbers for the China Cup are very large.
No need to buy a replacement!
During the regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, the Ministry of Commerce press spokesman, Shikopeng, said that as of now, 15 free trade agreements have been implemented by China, involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 products imported with zero tariffs.
At the same time, imported cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean red wine, tropical fruits from ASEAN... these products you need are no longer expensive to buy.
Currently, China has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, 15 of which have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 products imported with zero tariffs.
For example, agricultural products, with the implementation of the Free Trade Agreement, consumers can taste agricultural products of good quality and cheap quality from different regions in four quarters of the year.
For example, tropical fruits such as durian, pomegranate, and logos in ASEAN, import tariffs have been reduced from 15% to 30% to zero.
The import tariff on salmonfish from Iceland was reduced from 10% to 12% to zero.
Red wine from Georgia and Chile, import duties reduced from 14% to 30% to zero duty;
New Zealand's beef and dairy products, among other agricultural products, have also been heavily taxed.
For example, the import tariff on some cosmetics in Switzerland has been reduced to zero for industrial products.
The import tariff on some watches has been reduced by 50% and will be reduced to zero duty in a few years;
The import tariff on products such as electric refrigerators, electric cookers, massage equipment, beauty equipment in South Korea has been reduced by 40% and will be reduced to zero in a few years.
There are also significant tax cuts for consumer electronics products.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the Free Trade Zone also include intermediate products and raw materials needed to manufacture many domestic terminal consumer products, which also contributed to some extent to the structural upgrading of domestic consumer products.
The Ministry of Commerce press spokesman, Kunp, said that almost one third of China's total imports can benefit from the preferential tariff treatment of the Free Trade Agreement, most of which are terminal consumer goods, which bring real benefits to consumers.
Further reduction of import tariffs on consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted tariffs on imports of certain consumer goods, further lowering tariffs on imports of consumer goods, covering food, health products, medicines, everyday products, clothing and footwear hats, household appliances, cultural entertainment, daily grocery, and other consumer goods, and a total of 187 8-digit tariffs.
The average tax rate on these consumer goods will drop from 17.3% to 7.7%, almost frowned upon!
From January 1, 2018, China has also made some adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
Import duties on some cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shadow and perfume were reduced from 10% to 5%;
After the tariff reduction, consumers will no longer have to buy foreign products they like, and no longer have to run far to buy foreign products.
2018 Yiwu Import Shopping Festival: Red wine, snacks, fruits and vegetables are all cheap!
Foreign News: The rules of the US market differ greatly at the end of the year. Shopping and returns must be cautious
China New Network December 29 Electric
According to the US daily The World's Fair, Christmas is just around the corner and the return tide is beginning.
According to ABC, more than half of the merchandise sold last Christmas was returned.
In addition, readers have repeatedly blasted out online purchases that have been deceived, and consumers need to be more careful when shopping on informal sites.
In general, large shopping companies have a formal and reasonable return procedure, but if you buy gifts or e-commerce purchases from some small stores, you have to be careful.
Ms. Hou of Rolongong bought a jacket at an online store that sells printed coats on December 1 local time, and it hasn't been sent yet.
She sent an email to the client and did not receive a reply.
Another netizens reported that last year, when they went to the United States to travel, they bought a mobile phone from a third-party seller and found a box of mud in it.
Knowing that you have been deceived, apply to the website for a refund and get a full refund.
But customers also believe that the website's refund service is not 100% perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident of Northern California, said that he had purchased an emergency delivery service on a website twice, and an emergency service of 4 yuan, but both times it was not delivered on time.
Afterwards, the application for refund was made and no response was received.
Large shopping malls or shopping malls have better return policies.
Most of the merchandise is fully refunded within 180 days.
But goods must remain in their original shape and must have a purchase certificate such as receipt or bank purchase record.
Without a certificate, customers can also get points from the mall, which can be used to buy other goods.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for general goods, and electronic goods usually have a 15-day return period.
However, the return period for electronic and entertainment goods purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017 has been extended to 30 days.
It is worth noting that the 30-day refund period is calculated from December 25, i.e. it should be returned before January 25, 2018.
Extreme shopping experience, new era of shopping development in the business world is coming
Over a decade ago, China as a whole was still in the seller market, and people's choices were limited and demand was limited.
But after a decade of development, the market has already achieved a shift from seller to buyer market, and today's consumers taste more and more bitter, they are no longer satisfied with the simple simple act of handing money to hand delivering goods.
So how to get consumers a shopper experience is the next competing issue for real estate developers.
Among the many factors that affect the shopping experience of consumers, the impact of shopping centers in the business world is the most significant.
See how city builders everywhere are focusing on shopping experiences.
There are no two perfectly identical leaves in the world, nor are there two perfectly identical shopping malls, and a famous shopping mall must have its own characteristics.
For example, the world-famous Turkish shopping center Canyon, whose unique wave-shaped architectural design was inspired by the Grand Canyon, hence the name "Kanyon", walks 200 meters along the canyon's central pedestrian path as if it were inside the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon-style design, there is a large oval performance space in the center of the shopping center, which is unique in appearance and often hosts special performances.
Because the open platform design allows tourists to walk on every level to view the activities taking place in the canyon gorge, and has the effect of changing the landscape.
In China, the first forest-style walking shopping mall is located in Nanjing Forest Mall, where shopping is perfectly combined with ecological and fairy tales.
7000 square meters of green space, 3000 square meters of rooftop water platform, the project consists of 9 single buildings, aerial corridors interconnected between the buildings, the overall submerged courtyard design, taking French oak trees on the terrain as building surface, rooftop water platforms, creating a forestlike feeling.
Walking into Forest Mole, like a carelessly falling into a nest hole in Alice's wandering adventure, the tree trunk along the tree trunk surrounds the building, mirroring the grasslands and springs, bringing people into a forest full of life and vitality.
There is also the Lijiang-Liang Water Business Circle, which was built in Chongqing, Long Lake, planning for the Alibaba business, planning to introduce more than 50 international flagship stores, 100 international top brands and more than 500 domestic and foreign famous brands, and building a business center with a focus on the services industry.
Not only that, the Lijiang Water business circle also integrates eco-friendly buildings, oriented towards public transportation, and integrates fashion shopping, lifestyle services, catering, entertainment, education and sports, while bringing consumers a very intense shopping experience.
Overall, it can be seen that at present, a part of the housing industry is already aware of the trajectory of this new urban commercial discovery, and industry insiders say that this consumer experience-centric consumption model of how to combine shopping with experience will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
Today's business circle is not only a place of merchandise, but also a complex place where artistic culture and creative themes are integrated, and people are responsible for living in cities.
Therefore, while meeting the needs of consumers to eat and drink and play and buy one-stop materials, maximizing the spiritual needs of the multi-level cultural art to transmit and fulfil the needs of living in a livable environment is inevitably the high point of the future development of the business world.
In Chongqing, Jiangsan, on the northern shore of the Qinghai, the land is located in Jiangsu, near the Audience Bridge, the commercial elite of the world, the international giant circle around the circle, the first-class brands unite, and the international fashion is close to the bargain.
Here, step by step prosperity, the world's excellence;
East China Jin-Yut has a better shopping environment, East China Jin-Yut is close to the South China Business Circle, exclusive to the Western and even the country's leading four-level triple transportation system, which has improved shopping comfort.
In addition, the green gardens of the two walkways of the Hu Industrial Road and Wanda Square were upgraded, the landscape was upgraded, about 300 seeds of Choi Ji were planted, 40,000 square meters of renovation were laid, and the image of the South China Sea business circle was improved.
The Long Lake Aquarium, near Chongqing's first low-density aquarium, is surrounded by nine parks, the commercial blocks are low density, the opening is high, making people more willing to stop and sit and enjoy the pleasure of shopping when shopping, instead of being caught in the back of a rush rush rush ahead, and really achieved walking shopping.
Today, the commercial competition will only get fiercer, how to kill a bloodline in a highly homogenous market, to win the reputation of the future consumer of the shopping sanctuary, worth thinking seriously about all real estate developers.
It is far from enough to have a differentiation strategy alone, only developers who really put consumers in their hearts, who are hurrying to buy, who want what consumers think, who offer consumers a very extreme and concise shopping experience can laugh in a storm-torn market.
Of course, I would like to say that the people of Chongqing, who are the most prosperous and have such a good shopping experience and business circle, could not imagine the prosperity of today 10 years ago.
Item section: Consumerism's rave masks the real environmental price
16.82 billion yuan, which was the amount spent by the customers of the cat on November 11, 2017, within 24 hours of the global celebration of the Catalan Twelfth.
Specifically, in just three minutes after the opening of the 11th round, the cat cat's turnover exceeded 10 billion yuan, 6 minutes and 05 seconds more than 20 billion yuan, and 9 hours to 100 billion yuan.
On this day, the total number of payments made by global consumers through PayPal reached 1.48 billion, up 41% from last year.
These consumption will lead to 812 million logistics orders.
Whether it is the online shopping platform of the Catalan or the payment platform of the Baby, all belong to the Ali Group of Ma Yun.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that the single youth's self-mockingly created "Hung Hockey Asia" festival was organized by e-commerce and became the current phenomenon of the "Hung Hockey 11" shopping festival.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used the marketing slogan of the Hockey Day promotion for the first time: No one talks to you about love, so go online and buy.
The result was surprising: the transaction volume of the Taobao trading center (formerly the TNT) surpassed 52 million yuan on that day, which was 10 times the daily volume of transactions at the time.
Since then, the Tomb Raider 11 has become Alibaba's shopping festival, from the beginning of domestic buyers and sellers entertainment, to the current influx of global merchants, nine years have passed, and the volume of transactions of Tomb Raider 11 billion has been more than 3,200 times that year, making Black Friday look unlikely.
There are many e-commerce businesses that promote the Wind Tintin Dual Eleven, among which the most powerful is Beijing Dong-Yun.
Beijing Dong-Yun has its own shopping savings of 6.18 tonnes, but without significant impact on the 11 tonnes, and this year, from November 1 to 11, the cumulative sales of Beijing Dong-Yun reached 12.71 billion yuan.
After the 11th, the similarly-named 12th-day discount rave, the Christmas shopping season, followed.
The Chinese consumer is waiting for the new year, the year before Spring Festival, the Valentine's Day shopping period, the consumption, not the holiday.
The environmental problems caused by the massive consumption of instantaneous time have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua Daily Telegraph, according to the usual standard conservative estimate of 0.2 kg per packaging container in the industry, at least 300,000 tons of garbage was generated during the year.
Liu Hua, director of the pollution control project of the Green and East Asia division, told China Foreign Dialogue that orders for the Tomb Raider 11 tonne alone will generate 160,000 tonnes of packaging waste this year.
The National Post Office released a report in 2016, which noted that the fast parts of the 2015 X-Twin11 series (November 11-16) were about 780 million pieces, used more than 3 billion weaving bags, 99.22 million packaging containers, 169.85 million meters of ribbon, and the ribbon length could go around the Earth's equator for 425 rounds.
This year, the National Post Office expects the fast delivery volume of the Double 11 to exceed 1.5 billion units.
Wang Ji, manager of a Beijing waste incineration center, told Xinhua that the daily amount of garbage entering the site after the 11th tank was more than 2,000 tons, which is more than the processing capacity of the incineration station.
The courier company has realized that the environmental pollution caused by the courier industry is not neglected.
Some e-commerce logistics companies, including Suning, have introduced recyclable plastic forwarding boxes for reuse, recyclable plastic for shopping bags and recycled packaging bags for garbage bags, but the acceptance of the problem-free consumers is not high.
Ma Yun also called on the popularity industry to support green packaging and green logistics.
The Weibo has garnered over 68,000 likes.
What kind of mobile payments do Germans want?
Zhang Jing: The mobile payment campaign in Germany is not promising.
WeChat payments and payments are just moving the battlefield to Europe, the competitors haven't changed, the takeover position hasn't changed the Chinese, so is globalization?
Where there is a payment, there must be a WeChat payment.
In accordance with an agreement with German e-payment service provider Wirecard, WeChat Payment officially landed in Germany in November this year and gradually deployed to merchants across Europe.
This strange event between the two countries is happening again in Europe.
Paypal and WeChat have always been on the road to globalization.
For the globalization of mobile payments in China, the AIR Consulting Group's China Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Research Report 2017 summarizes two things: one is through strategic investment, experience outputs, investing in and supporting domestic mobile payments enterprises abroad.
Second, through Chinese tourists' consumption abroad, mobile payment services are promoted to foreign merchants, thus changing the perception and acceptance of Chinese mobile payments in foreign countries.
Indeed, the Chinese have to go to hell.
China's economic development is rapid, coupled with its large population base, and Chinese tourists' spending in Europe is an attractive figure.
But this is also bound to be the case, and the Chinese mobile payment battle that has been launched in Germany is not promising.
WeChat payments and payments are just moving the battlefield to Europe, the competitors haven't changed, the position of the looters hasn't changed or the Chinese, is it globalization?
A more pioneering question is whether China's mobile payments can be used in mainland Europe.
Take Germany as an example.
New retail bottles were cast with magic
Chen Zhen, Chen Keying: Amazon announced its entry into bookstores and grocery stores when it was squeezing into the top 10 retailers in the world, and it's worth playing with, whether it's the time or the motivation.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two in Portland and San Diego.
Amazon opened a store in New York in early 2017 and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced that its Amazon Go supermarket was operating, customers would not have to queue, check in, scan the door, and take the goods they wanted and leave, and the purchase amount would be automatically deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
For Amazon, the sudden frequency of action in physical stores in recent years is a very unexpected thing.
As CEO Jeff Bezos stressed in a public letter to shareholders in 2007, Amazon will not open a physical store easily unless the following four conditions are met:
1. We must be sure that this new opportunity will return the investment of shareholders;
2. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of significant significance to the whole company;
3. We must ensure that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
4. We must be sure that in this market we have enough resources to make customer-oriented differentiation.
Bookstores and grocery stores are the most volatile of the two retail entities, and Amazon's first competitor since its rise.
Amazon announced its entry into these two physical markets as it squeezed into the top 10 retailers in the world, and it's worth playing with, whether the timing is right or the motivation.
Is Amazon's practice contrary to the assurances in the shareholder letter?
Similar sounds were heard on the other side of the earth. On the morning of October 13, 2016, Ma Yun, chairman of Alibaba's board, delivered the keynote address at the 2016 Hangzhou Yunnan Conference.
He said: "From next year onwards, Alibaba will no longer mention the e-commerce slogan.
The era of pure e-commerce will soon end, and in the next 10 or 20 years there will be no e-commerce, replaced by new retail stores.
The combination of offline and logistics will create new retail.
For a while, the new retail phrase "three words" was like magic, and was often hung on the mouths of industry people.
But what exactly does the new retail bottle mean?
If only the index line is combined with the subline, then the concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked 180 of the largest e-commerce companies and estimated total sales of about $200 billion, with the largest 25 of them accounting for more than $159 billion.
Of the 25 stores, 18 have only started online traditional retailers in the last five years - such as Macy's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.
Alibaba Group has invested 28.3 billion yuan in Suning Yun business and also has a track record.
Globally, retailers and e-commerce are moving from a single channel to a full-channel retail system covering physical stores, e-commerce, mobile devices and social media.
Is Ma Yun suggesting a new retail bubble, more of a summary than a vision for the future?
If not, what is the difference between the concept of a full channel and the new retail chain?
Perhaps the key to the problem is not whether online and offline will merge, but how they will merge.
Looking back at the last 20 years of retail, the rise of e-commerce, as well as the rise of discount retailers in the early years, has focused on price and convenience.
Based on these two pain points, e-commerce has moved products with very high standards, such as books and CDs, from offline to online.
With the adoption of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, e-commerce will also reach out to other categories and start improving efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, Liu used the ideas and technologies of the Internet to comprehensively reform and upgrade the total of about 30 trillion social retailers that exist, so that the increasingly upgraded consumption demands of Chinese consumers can be effectively met, and that the entire process of production, distribution and service of goods can be made more efficient due to the widespread use of the Internet and big data.
So the road to e-commerce is a road of light assets, which are actually heavy assets.
The burden of fixed assets, personnel allocation, and management processes is not as large as traditional retail; the burden of heavy loads means that large investments are required in logistics and warehousing.
Changes in the way logistics are done have ensured high efficiency of e-commerce.
According to Chinese government news website, Premier Li Keqiang, who presided over the State Council's regular meeting on April 28, said that expanding domestic consumption demand was an important step in steady growth and restructuring.
The meeting determined that the relevant departments should work hard to come up with specific plans based on scientific evaluation.
The pilot of reducing import tariffs on domestic consumer goods, which are in demand by domestic consumers, was carried out before the end of June this year, gradually expanding the scope of the tax reduction goods;
Combining tax reforms, improving consumption tax policies on consumer goods such as clothing, cosmetics, and more, and coordinating adjustments to the scope of the taxation, tax rates and collection links;
The addition and restoration of duty-free shops at port of entry, the reasonable expansion of duty-free varieties and the increase of a certain amount of duty-free purchases, facilitating domestic consumers to buy foreign products at home;
Further facilitating customs and tax refunds for travellers shopping abroad, and strictly implementing the requirement to declare goods entering the country in accordance with the law.
Developing a check-in and quarantine policy that supports cross-border e-commerce imports and clearing the unreasonable charges on import links;
Accelerate the promotion of Chinese brands, support the development of physical stores and achieve online and offline interaction.
Regulate market order, strictly counterfeit debasement, promote good and bad.
It allows consumers to shop conveniently and conveniently.
BlackBerry (BlackBerry) phones have always been hardcore, but in the face of peer exclusion, there is always a similar model, so we have this Passport released last September.
Sony often launches various black technology products, such as the flagship 4K reflective supershort focused first plane, which was released earlier this year.
Of course, the price of such high-end products in the atmosphere is naturally not good, and 5 million yen is about the equivalent of 250,000 yuan, and buying a car is enough.
Large-sized luxury TVs have always been representative of the technical strength of the major manufacturers, and this time the award winning 77 inch curved 4K OLED TVs with soft-handed LG are typical of this type of product.
This is not just a simple fixed angle curved TV, but a complex device for users that allows them to adjust their curves according to their location!
Using the ultra-thin display panel of 9mm, LG made the deformation of the entire panel difficult to detect with the naked eye, thus achieving the maximum variation of the maximum curvature 4000R.
Users only need to comfortably put on the remote control to move the best view of the 77 inch screen, making it suitable for any viewing scene.
Leica (T-Card) is not much to say about its position in the field of cameras, the T-Card microchip was released last year and enabled the all-new T-Card port as the lens port of the T-Card microchip.
In addition to the two Lens released in the same period, the 23mm focus and 18-56mm focus conversion, the Lens series can also be used with the M-Adapter T switching ring.
Triumph (安芬) has accurately grasped the key to this problem and developed a new Magic Wire underwear.
The use of a well-supported silicon resin material as a locker of underwear allows wearers to not only enjoy the comfort of a non-steel locker, but also to get a full-fledged support such as a steel locker.
Additionally, the built-in grid stabilization net provides more support, thus achieving the perfect fit of the underwear, shaping the full chest line.
Today, LG's home appliances are quite characteristic, and the CordZero C5 vacuum cleaner is the main wireless tracking function.

On January 18, Alibaba held the E-Commerce Poverty Alleviation Summit Dialogue in Chongqing, announcing that it will promote precise poverty alleviation and rural revitalization by exploring the new model of Internet+ poverty alleviation.
This is after the development of rural strategy, the launch of the Rural Taobao project, the online platform for rural poverty alleviation, and the establishment of the Alibaba Poverty Alleviation Fund, Ali once again made a strong case for poverty alleviation.
Fighting poverty is one of China's most important national strategies today.
Total poverty eradication has never been achieved in China in the last thousands of years.
E-commerce poverty alleviation is an innovative initiative in the new phase of poverty alleviation development and is an important catalyst for achieving precise poverty alleviation and precise poverty eradication.
The Centre attaches great importance and points out that the Internet can play a role in helping to fight poverty alleviation, advance precise poverty alleviation, precise poverty alleviation, and allow agricultural products to reach rural areas through the Internet.
So Ali put forward a rural strategy in 2014, which along with big data cloud computing and globalization is one of the three core strategies for Ali's next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Village Taobao Project, recruiting small villagers in rural areas to lead farmers out of poverty and become rich through e-commerce.
Ali worked with the business sector to create the Xing Farmer Poverty Alleviation Channel in 2017, which currently aggregates 13 provinces and 120 national poverty counties across the country.
The Taobao Village, which was born on the Ali platform, has 2,118 villages.
Of these, nearly 400 are in provincial poverty counties and 33 are in poverty counties in 13 countries.
In 2017, sales of Taobao Village reached 120 billion yuan nationwide on Alibaba China retail platform.
Zhang Yong said that faced with the national strategy of de-poverty struggle, Ali has been thinking about how to use technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovation capabilities of the good Ali economy to take a new path to de-poverty.
Among them, Mura Tao is the main platform for Aly e-commerce poverty alleviation and is leading a new link to direct selling Internet poverty alleviation.
In the planting phase, villagers from Taobao and Zhengmin Suwe jointly implemented agricultural equipment and small loans support.
In 2017, among the 832 poorest counties at the national level, Zhengmin Ji served 795 people, providing them with convenient payments, credit and other services.
Bird is responsible for storage and logistics, the cat cat is responsible for sales, and Ali Yun's big data feed guides agricultural production, further improving the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of e-commerce out of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
Ali has opened an e-commerce course through Taobao University to teach farmers standardized, qualified and scale-up farming methods, and has achieved a combination of poverty alleviation and mental support to enable farmers to survive poverty.
These courses have covered about 92% of the poorest counties at the national level.
The idea of getting rid of poverty through public-benefit thinking and business means can also ensure Ali can achieve real poverty reduction while alleviating poverty.
Alibaba's chairman Ma Yun said that poverty eradication should be divided into three phases: poverty alleviation, de-poverty and enrichment.
Poverty alleviation is giving people fish, poverty eradication is giving people fish, enrichment is building a fish pond for farmers to feed them.
The industrial poverty alleviation driven by e-commerce is the production of fish.
In the field of industrial poverty alleviation, the Locauan Apple industrial poverty alleviation model, created by Ali in collaboration with Penceilo Kawasaki, has been replicated and promoted nationwide by relevant departments as a model.
Ali's e-commerce poverty alleviation work has also been recognized by the decision-making level.
E-commerce companies representing Alibaba have been spotted using online channels to ensure that farmers increase production and revenue.
Some of the people in the village of Snowy 2 and the village of Snowy 2 were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experiences of e-commerce poverty alleviation.
Currently, the UN World Food Programme's China office has worked with Muro Tao to reduce poverty in the e-commerce industry in Anhui and other places.
The third edition of the New Economic Think tank conference, organized jointly by Ali Institute and China Visionary Think tank, was held on January 16, and Zhang Li, Director of the Research Institute of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce, attended and spoke.
She believes that we have ignored the most important issues of globalization, the body and use of globalization and the stages of globalization.
This is why many people think that globalization is stagnant, and many developed countries and developing countries have different attitudes to globalization in the new phase, different models.
The second concept is the problem of the mid-stage of globalization, and what constraints are there in the mid-stage of globalization?
Restrictions on the basis of the economic environment are only restricted because the economic basis changes and globalization occurs.
Zhang Li believes that global economic adjustment will basically end at the end of 2017 and will enter a new phase of growth after 2018, and the next phase of growth will be product pull.
The first live-fresh supermarket 7FRESH in Jindong recently opened, and plans to open more than 1,000 stores nationwide over the next three to five years.
Along with Ali's box of fresh meat, the super species of the Yung-yang, the fresh meat of the Sunning, the fresh meat of the Yung-yang, and so on, new retail store chains began to pile up and start to yell at each other for innovation and even prices.
The life-changing supermarket is fighting for the upgrades, and it has become a phenomenon in the new retail sector.
In 2018, we will quickly enter the country and open a lot of shops in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before Spring Festival.
Box Ma Ma'an-Jin CEO Huang10 revealed the new approach for 2018 at the second New Retail Summit.
From 2018, Box Ma was not only a live e-commerce business, but also a live e-commerce business that caters to consumers instantly.
The core model is the flow and experience, and online is real sales.
Unlike traditional supermarkets, boxing is a fun and delicious snack in the eyes of many consumers, and even some intermediaries have developed the concept of boxing.
Online e-commerce platforms and offline retailers have their advantages and disadvantages, but consumers are present in multiple channels, so both are trying the full channel model.
Industry believes that in the context of the large upgrades in consumption, there will be more and more stores of box horses in 2018.
Box horses continue to explore more consumer spheres from their initial freshness, which predicts more innovation in the retail market in the new year.
The business model combined with online and offline attracted the attention of consumers, and the lively supermarket opened everywhere was called the "good place".
But these relationships said so much more, and they didn't work, and I realized that you brought a good experience to consumers, and I was willing to pay.
According to CEO Jiao, CEO of Daihatsu Fujian, consumer habits have changed and demand for purchases has changed in the new retail environment.
It was a split-up, straight-line, straight-line, straight-line, straight-line, straight-line, straight-line, and now it's a game of cat and mouse, because consumers don't have the distinction anymore.
The capital battle is in full swing, giving the brand new retail fireworks that are currently represented by the fresh supermarket a taste of life.
The analysis suggests that the competition for new retail in first-tier cities is far from the Red Sea pattern, and there are still large second-tier cities to be explored, and there is still a lot of opportunity and space in the market.
Different types of industries will bring the development of new retail into a diversified state of development for the new retail layout.
The Central Financial Channel, the Institute of Financial Strategy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has prepared a raw material for you, which is the annual development report of Chinese e-commerce in Shenzhen.

Total sales again broke record speed and accelerated track
Since 2006, China's online retail has been growing at a super-speed, and it is estimated that it feels fresh online shopping and not going out to buy something is cool!
But since 2013, the growth rate of online retail has started to fall below 50%, and in 2015, the growth rate was below 40% for the first time, and in 2016, it became 26.2%.
But this year, the situation is different, online retail has accelerated again, and in September this year, the growth rate rose to 34.2%.
The growth rate is much higher than in 2015 and 2016.
Maybe you'll turn around and find that buying and buying is more pleasant.
Among them, physical goods retailed online for nearly 5.08 trillion yuan, and services retailed online for nearly 1.49 trillion yuan.
The share of total retail sales of social goods reached 13.6%, an increase of almost 3 percentage points.
Students, don't fall asleep, focus on the service online retail is definitely a great thing!
The second-largest online shoppers in France are online shoppers, with per capita purchases of $1,925 and the most online purchases of goods, clothing, are the country that loves fashion.

Help you avoid becoming the next Uber startup
Amy Errett once wanted to investigate the happiness of employees in her e-commerce startup, but the investigation did not work.
The answers are often vague, helpless, and even worse, deceptive.
Even though she promised to use anonymity, some employees still do not trust the process.
Eret, who manages Madison Reed, a San Francisco-based e-commerce retailer with 75 people, said the response she received was inconsistent and unobjective.
So she called outside for help.
A number of new HR startups have emerged, such as Rainbow and Spring, to help companies understand the feelings of employees.
They built and authorized software specifically designed to measure employee engagement, allowing companies to quickly conduct opinion tests for specific teams and demographics, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass executives and report directly to the board.
Now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit? said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glint, a startup company in Redwood City.
Eret said that in three years, she gained more insight into employees' thoughts and feelings with Glint.
In addition to the quick investigation and polls of specific teams, Glint also provided a company hot chart of which units complained the most, which managers approved the lowest scores, which allowed her to understand why.
Companies began to realize that they had to master the culture of the company's workplace to become the next Uber. Before Uber's former employees published a blog post describing the harassment environment, these speakers were punished by the company and Uber got into scandal.
For startups like Glint, the desire to supervise the company is a huge business opportunity.
According to Let's Talk Payments, a financial technology analysis website, the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a startup in Denver, Colorado, dedicated to helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw increased interest and activity in this area during a period of deterioration in Uber's reputation earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Apple, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed on as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent can allow companies to send customized diagnostics of urine, collect confidential responses in real time, and view hot maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also offers anonymous text hotlines to let employees report bad behavior.
If the chairman is caught, the complaint will go directly to the board.
Patrick Kunlan, founder and CEO of Convercent, said that the courts of opinion have seized the authority of the regulatory body.
If a company is found to treat its employees unkindly or behave immorally, even if regulators do not intervene, it could face the high consequences of consumer boycott, employee loss and involvement in litigation, Kunlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees understand the working rules and procedures and provide easy ways to contact the company's headquarters.
Before that, if employees want to report problems, they must find the company's headquarters phone number or email and make a formal complaint, and hope that the headquarters will take this seriously.
This is often a frightening and disturbing experience, as Ruby Tuesday's general counsel in law, James Vitranno, said, saying that he felt there was no good way to track employee complaints.
But now the company uses Convercent to more quickly identify and solve issues previously unknown to executives in distant offices, cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices.
"I can get a 360 degree understanding of the work experience from a closer angle", said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment lawsuits.
Kunlan said that after the Andor accounting firm went bankrupt after the Anan scandal violated ethical norms, companies have been putting more emphasis on ethics, values and employee engagement since 2002.
But it wasn't until the social media boom entered its own world stage that companies realized they couldn't stop their outbreak from spreading viral online.
"Hope was seen as a strategy before the use of technology to monitor ethics", Liu said.
Glint and Convercent both provide their software as a service and charge companies a regular fee for using their products.
This business model and business opportunity is supported by venture capitalists who have already supported the two startups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million in funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness between companies, culture and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
More and more studies show that today's employees expect a higher level of workplace than ever before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high-paying and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued, and spent time in a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join a company, feel their voices are heard, and their work is rewarding, they are more committed to making the company successful", said Nina McCartney, LinkedIn's vice president of global welfare and employee experience. LinkedIn uses both Convercent and Glint at the same time.
Investors earn returns when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well when they are employee loyal and committed.
It is no wonder that third-party analytics tools will seek financial support if they promise to increase employee loyalty and commitment.
Workplace culture experts say that it is very important to have knowledge of employee engagement data.
But the data is useless unless the company's administrators take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can be expected that the company is changing.
If the change does not progress quickly enough, or if there is no progress, it can lead to disappointment and lead to employees leaving the company.
Russell Lath, consulting manager at Cote International, a business management company, said: "If you want to seek 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations. He has seen the mistake of some companies relying too much on data collection.
Because if we don't follow through, the employees will think, "Hey, did you really hear me?"
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I care?
Eret said Madison Reed now conducts a monthly employee survey and has been able to take action on the same day as the Glint report issue.
After collecting feedback from employees about how frustrated they were with the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by reorganizing the internal team of the company and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights from its employees, who long term hope to make a change in the industry known for its high talent loss rate and better retain employees.
"If you don't work to create a culture of transparency, you will lose your talent", said Zvitrano.
"If you lose talent, you will lose customers".
And when you lose customers, you lose the company.

The NCAA canceled training twice daily, extending the daytime training time for the Bears
It was close to 11 p.m. when the UCLA football team chatted near the team's new campus practice ground.
Some players have taken off their sports shirts and exposed their bodies sweating after their first day of training camp.
For a large part of the team, the minutes of the empty space are a rest period.
Players who participate in the summer course will return to the dorm after three hours of practice for the final exam, and then return to Wasserman Football Centre for the meeting at 6:30 a.m. the next day.
The next three days were a struggle for the guys, Bears coach Jim Mora said on Monday as he was about to enter Tuesday.
The NCAA canceled two practices per day (intended to ease the burden on players), but actually extended their daytime training time - at least until Friday's end.
That's why the first three rounds of training at UCLA are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the already crowded schedule.
From canceling two training sessions a day to more training sessions a day, the Bears began training almost a week before last season, and Mora trained at summer school for the first time in six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions on August 20 and then begin preparing for the official race for the first Texas farm workers in September.
Mora said he supports the adjustment of the rules of the NCAA, although this would add another project to the player's busy journey.
In three or four days, we will give them a huge amount of training, which is very challenging, said Pamora.
They just passed. They are working out, they are all great kids.
I thought Saturday would be more time, and that was great.
At the end of training camp, UCLA will stop training. Given the clear views of the nearby parking lot and the Luskin Center, this is not an easy task. The Luskin Center Senior Hotel has been hit with a football pitch across the body after passing through the goal post.
Starting this weekend, the Bears team will be staying at the hotel. But Mora admitted that there could be problems if the rooms are empty during the season.
"We will take security measures", said Pamora.
Oh, this is a really worrying question. The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in the room and record training scenes is not strong.
If you have a training video tape, it's pretty good too.
But we will take security measures there, and we will take security measures in the parking lot number 8.
We will make the best use of the existing resources.
I won't worry too much about that.
We have a plan.
Statistics Australia (ABS) data shows that the average value of Australian homes rose by 1.5% to 2% in the second quarter of this year, an increase of 3.5% year on year, creating the lowest annual growth rate since March 2013.
While real estate agents expect to sell more properties during the holiday season, the increase in Australian house prices is at its lowest level since 2013.
IT Home reported this morning that the Wall Street Journal reported that AT&T had cancelled plans to sell Huawei's new flagship smartphone in the United States.
Huawei originally planned to announce the partnership this week on CES, but AT&T cancelled the partnership at the last minute.
In response to this, Huawei responded to the news reporter on January 9th, saying that on January 9th, local time in the United States, Huawei will release new products and specific marketing information to the American market.
Huawei said that over the past five years, Huawei has proven its strength by launching high-end products in global and US markets.
According to previous reports from IT House, Huawei will release the best phone you've never heard of at CES in Las Vegas on the afternoon of January 9, and the phone's durability will support two days of use.
The industry generally believes that Huawei's upcoming flagship phone, the Huawei Mate 10 Pro, is equipped with Android Oreo system.
Wang Li, a reporter for the evening news of the city of sheep, stars in the film I am not PanLin' Yang, starring Van Ice-Clan, Guo-Jin, Da-Jin, Zhangjiajie and others, will be released nationwide on September 30.

Liu Xiaogang explained: "The subject is similar to the director of Zhangjie's film, and it's easy to think of a piece, so I wanted to know how to shoot in a way that you didn't use.
Liu Xia said he made the work as a virgin, and he learned how to shoot a circular image with a photographer, even spending millions of yuan to get the photographer to shoot a ten-minute pilot.
Facebook will launch fact-checking capability to fight fake news
Facebook announced Thursday that it would send more potentially malicious articles to third-party detectives and display the results below the original post. Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to crack down on so-called fake news.
Facebook said in a statement on its website that Facebook will start using updated machines to learn how to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, and may display fact check results below the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main sources of so-called fake news, and many believe Facebook influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, with voters experiencing a flood of fake stories ahead of the presidential election in France in May, and Germany being the first to endorse the penalty scheme ahead of the September election, where social media networks would be fined if they failed to remove hate posts in time.
Facebook said in a separate statement Thursday in Germany that a new fact-checking feature test was being launched by the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Sarah Sue, Facebook News Feed's product manager, said in a blog post that in addition to seeing which stories are questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people want more background to help them make informed decisions about what they read and share.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the functionality of its content-related articles and make other changes to its news content to reduce fake news.
Creating a sketch novel: The Story of Castle England
Recently, the small Scotchney Castle has been the main character in a compression music video and once served as a refuge for Margaret Thatcher's husband during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney witnessed 700 years of turbulent history in the comfortable location of the Belle River Gorge in Kent, and it is now the inspiration for the graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes (a Yorkshire man with a special fondness for historical documents who kept his head in a drawer).
I can see the handwriting of 300 years ago, and I find it very beautiful.
"What kind of human destiny is it to have this letter in my hands?"
From the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era, a castle in England reads books that document families living in Scotland, each story written by different artists of the future of England, such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book to be made in the archives: he also wrote The Tooth of the Dead 2014 and other stories, a book inspired by the literature of the British Library, a work he completed with an uncontrollable creative passion.
He said: "I can't restrain my writing impulse from the moment I see the fingerprints left on one side of the letter, which was written by a double agent working for Jacobite groups in the 18th century.
Oh, that's his fingerprint!
And the letters always smelled like smoke, because then you need to light a fire to have light.
For us 300 years later, this smell makes us feel that they are also with us.
Oh, I like archival literature!
For those who are touched by the old paper, getting the support of the National Trust and Arts Council of England and living in the castle for almost four months (to be honest, I stayed a little longer) seems great, and I just can't believe it is true.
Rhodes spent several days visiting Victoria's Neolithic Castle, browsing archives, exploring the many treasures and artifacts of the estate, such as the dog head hanging from the wall, and the centuries-old bottles he spent in the river guarding the castle.
He walked through the land and ruins of the old castle, chatting with vagrants, gardeners, and sometimes with illustrators who painted for him in his books.
Then in the evening, he would drink some whiskey and then write.
Scotney's secret history is not clear, as the National Trust was not fully established until after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hesse, in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rodz arrived, the staff began processing the files, and he described them as the noble house of hundreds of years ago: "Hey, put it in the attic".
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, map out the borders of each country: "You'd think land disputes would be boring". "But it would happen", Rhodes said, "two families would get a big hand for a white oak tree".
Let go of me, guys!
Some of the stories in the work, which use the castle as a starting point, lead to a broader study of English history, including The Labourer, which is a clue to a man who left the new castle to participate in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.
The story of the Knights of Kent and Sussex, in the Book of Common Pleas, records a riot in the castle in 1380.
The Peasant Uprising started in that area, and I think it's a good place to start the uprising.
Maybe there is a connection between the two?
Other stories are deeply rooted in the castle's history, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darel family hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, the protagonist of the story is the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darryl, who is believed to have given himself a funeral by filling a coffin with stone (his coffin was discovered years later on the ground).
The Darrells are Roth's favourite Scotney Castle family: The Darrells seem to be ruthless gentlemen who always borrow money and spend money on things they can't buy.
Generations of Darryl men have solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I think they should be a group of handsome young men who know how to pursue women.
As his assignment at the castle ended, Rodez began looking for other strange writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness completing a sketch novel about El?m?nm?ki?, an early 20th century nursing home that was slowly abandoned.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave", he said.
"Oh, it's like, 'Oh, I have to face the real life of the pitcher.'"
According to ZTE News reporter, ZTE's Intelligent Car Team is headquartered in Zhuhai, and the controller is the executive vice president of ZTE Communications, Tan Wen-go.
Every major energy company has a wealth of enemy countries, so who among the many energy companies in the world is the most profitable?
Yesterday, the renowned PFC Energy Company announced the top 50 energy companies listed in 2011, after U.S. oil and gas producer ExxonMobil won the joint venture with a market capitalization of $40.63 billion, followed by China Oil and the Royal Dutch Shell.
In this list, China Oil has twice been questioned by PFC in 2007 and 2009, and the top positions in other years were all held by ExxonMobil.
In the top 50 list in 2011, three companies from mainland China were included, in addition to China Oil, which ranked second, China Petroleum, which ranked ninth and China Ocean Oil, which ranked 15th.
According to PFC's statistics, however, despite the current oil price being much higher than four years ago, the CEO of PFC Energy noted that there were many reasons for the low total market value, mainly including the fall in gas prices in North America and the low activity of the global stock market.
According to Xinhua, the heavy pollution weather in Jingxiang and surrounding areas intensified further from the 16th to the 19th, and the AQI in Hebei's Shijiazhuang, Sinzhuang, and Yangtze 3 cities showed a booming trend.
Amendments to Green Card Rules in the United States
Media quoted President Donald Trump as saying that the United States will launch a new immigration program that will amend the green card regulations.
The plan aims to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 per year, and temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications will be limited by stricter regulations.
The new regulations were proposed by the Republican and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in both houses.
The US media quoted Trump as saying that the bill would reduce poverty, raise wages, and save taxpayers billions of dollars by changing the way the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will replace the current program to reduce chain migration.
This new application process is conducive to applicants who speak English, have financial support and have the skills that are beneficial for economic development.

To optimize the environment of the scenic area, and build beautiful Nanyu, recently, the Nanyu District Tobacco Special Bureau (subsidiary) of the 636th Volunteer Service Brigade conducted an environmental protection campaign to protect the forest and cherish the home.
The event was supported by the entire staff of the Tobacco Bureau of the district, but also attracted retired senior staff, workers' families to join together in environmental protection practices, the three generations of young people joined forces, climbed the forest and cleared the garbage, and devoted their strength to the construction of the beautiful Yangtze River.
This volunteer service event aims to protect the landscape resources of the Southern Yue, promote the volunteer service concept of caring for others, caring for society, caring for nature, and allowing the next generation to accept the gift of volunteer service from childhood.
It is reported that the 636th Volunteer Service Team has grown to 16 members since its inception in early April this year, and has since launched a series of volunteer activities such as helping disabled retail customers, helping tobacco farmers care tobacco leaves, and making a generous donation to the Yan earthquake.

Sex robots are indeed on the rise, but we should be careful
Just when you thought 2017 would not be any more bizarre, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots was released.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robots (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Honorary Professor Emeritus of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipple and the type of nail.
Sharkey said in the release of the new report: "People are laughing behind the scenes, but the big companies have indeed launched a lot of sex robots, and we will see more".
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots, with skin that is smooth, touch that is warm, and specifically use artificial intelligence to set up human-like sexual responses.
Users can also customize their robots to suit their preferences, from eye color, nipple shape to nail type or color.
But what is even more disturbing is that many robots with personality tags make them look advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with a shiny skin.
For example, RealBotix robots can be defined based on what users find attractive, such as being shy.
There is also a Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion, which can pre-set characteristics, including a slightly shy frozen-fried-up French fry and a wild-fried-up adventurous Winti.
The Roxyxxy Gold robot has as much personality as possible that is comparable to yours, and the True Companion website is a great way to get involved.
So she loves you, and you love her, and you love her.
She was just as emotional as normal people were those days!
She can chat, she can talk, and she can be sexy and sexy!
The rise of sex robots has brought a lot of unrest not only to the fact that it replaces the real human relationship with the feminine characteristics of the downtrodden and the submissive, but also to the fact that the suggestion of rape drawn on Farah in the frozen interpretation is most worrying.
True Companion compares Roxxxy to a man's shaker on its website.
The site says, "If women have vibrating rods, why can't men have Roxxxy?"
However, these sex robots are not a mere romance, nor is they just a sex toy.
Their emergence and maturity point directly to a darker, deeper part of our culture: fleeing perfect gender equality and moving towards sex with submission as an additional option.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while FRR notes that sex robots are becoming increasingly popular, they are still on the fringe of consumer culture.
But something that penetrates from the edge can give us a glimpse into the process of this era in which we are.
Many people would not be weird or aggressive until the free market gave them the opportunity to become so.
These delicate sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are under threat globally, and the White House has a president who boasts of sexual violence against women, which is no coincidence.
The most chilling part of the story of women in TV series is not the realistic picture, not the hanging corpse, not the eyes of the couple being dug out, but the overly realistic imagination.
The Republic of Kiribati was a leap forward, but now it doesn't seem that far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to use the best technology possible to create the body that looks the most like a real woman, even if it's proportionate to porn stars.
The creators of these robots want them to have a human touch and mimic real human actions.
But frankly, their shiny personality is not representative of the real woman.
They can't separate and they can't leave.
They have no appeal institutions, no follow-up stories, no independence at all, and no fantasy of slavery that could be completely broken.
In other words, they are passion slaves.
Or, as the 2017 saying goes: make a girl.
The story of the ancient Chinese elite forces fighting against the monsters in the world-famous Great Wall to defend humanity.
The last episode of the fourth season of Running Brothers Running has been recorded, and the head coach of the men's team Running Super received a Weibo interview with Shenyang Evening News on May 30, from the male runner's school to the male villain's funny villain, and then the male runner's silence, and the impression of the audience as a male superhero is constantly changing.
Liu Super said that the same thing I would not do on the show, and that it should be updated continuously.

Political differences have led to the polarisation of the American electorate, which, from a microscopic point of view, has undermined the harmony of American families. This is already strange for the Trump era.
After Christmas and Thanksgiving, major newspapers in the United States filled their comment columns with fears about how to deal with the Trump relatives who voted.
It is generally thought that we are doing everything we can to break through our filter bubble.
Less commented was the strength of Trump's bringing his family together.
I mentioned this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, who has long been at odds with the Republicans in our house, was coming to visit me in New York this week.
She reminded me that united against common enemies can have powerful effects.
Because she worked with Trump at the White House, everyone she knew, even her Republican relatives, who had been in political strife for decades, now suddenly and oddly stood on the same front line.
If all of them were at the table, that would certainly be a good thing. But what shocked me was that from a broader perspective, this would pose a significant risk.
While leftists have always been under Trump's tutelage, the curvature effect he brought as president has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about normal makeup and Trump, we are talking about the possibility that his strange behavior might one day stop.
However, there is a more worrying long-term scenario where Trump's attempt to normalize his relationship with right-wing Republicans, who once opposed Mr. President's standards, now suddenly appears to be a rational symbol.
I recently found myself missing something about the crazy weirdness of Mitt Romney's version: putting dogs in cars, 14% income tax (but at least we know his tax return), and the two actions seem to be too minor a crime compared to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate will need only reasonably qualify for invaluable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town, we took the kids to the New York Park Spinning Tomi, the largest spinning Tomi operated by the New York Central Park Authority, and if you don't need coffee, the $3 ticket is the most cost-effective in the city.
The sound of the horse was huge like thunder, and the central cylinder was designed with fiberglass, all clowns and animals twisted their heads, looking at their shoulders in terror and malice, while the music that the horse sounded sounded strange.
Too many slums are disappointing: the landscape overlooking the towers of the high-rise is getting old, the skyline is getting too familiar and can no longer provide much excitement, while the reality of the city does not support the dream.
35 years later, I still don't completely forget the day when I discovered that this Swiss cottage was not actually a Swiss cottage, but an old Swiss cottage, located in the theme bar, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, which I can't remember, but near a crossroads in north London.
However, the rotating Tomi horse in Central Park remains a magical experience, and everyone is happy to participate in the event for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old boy, and four 40-year-old girls.
If I could evaluate the rotating horse, I would give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before I was able to browse my credit card, I was asked to rate my trading experience with a one to five star rating.
This is also the case in the coffee shop on the corner of my street, and you can also choose to rate with a 15% discount, which is to buy something at the counter.
The effect of doing so is not only to slow down the speed of transactions that should have been neutral, but also to put pressure on the server to add personal factors to the unnecessary situation.
The poor woman in the department store smiled sorry, and I was exhausted, and her credit card trading experience gave her a five star rating.
Oscar Pistoles was transferred from prison to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time Pistoles has left prison and been transferred to hospital.
Last year, he was taken to hospital for treatment of a wrist cut, which prison officials said was caused by a fall in his cell.

In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he shot Sting Camp multiple times through the bathroom door at his home in Pretoria, until his death.
Pistoles claims to have mistaken his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder hiding in the lounge.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time for the six-year sentence against Pistoles, which they consider too generous.
The State Prosecutor's Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, which could hear the appeal this year.
If prosecutors win, Pistoles will face a prison term increased to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

On May 18, the Ministry of Finance announced the special grant funding management measures to adjust the structure of industrial enterprises, which will arrange special grant funding to promote the decomposition of the overcapacity of the coal and steel industries, totalling 100 billion yuan.
In recent years, several local governments in Shanghai, Shaanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, and the state of Hilangjiang have repeatedly proposed reforms regarding the decomposition of excess capacity.
Many provinces have even proposed to actively seek the financial support of the central government for their provinces to use their energy.
One proof is that only eight provinces have announced coal capacity targets that are up to 90% of the national coal production reduction plan.
Linberg, director of the Institute of Energy Policy Research of China at Xiamen University, said in an interview with reporters that the decarbonisation of the steel and coal industries is far from enough to rely on the centers alone. More funding is needed from local governments and businesses. How to solve this?
In the recently published coal decommissioning implementation details, Shaanxi Province proposed to restructure Shaanxi Joke Coal Group into a state-owned capital investment company, restructure the assets and operations of enterprises and reintegrate them to create a completely new business model.
The actual funding gap may be three times that of the subsidy earlier, Minister of Human Resources and Social Security Liu Min said that the initial statistics show that the coal system of the personnel who are deployed to distribute the capacity of the pump is 1.3 million and the steel system is 500,000.

Do chicken, dairy products and chocolate help alleviate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
Chicken and chocolate may sound like a dream for your digestive system.
But a new study shows the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate the associated symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition affects the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 Britons, leading to diarrhea and diarrhea, frequent or bleeding diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington usually recommend that patients avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers found that the protein's key amino acid-serine helps promote the growth of immune cells, which can increase the resistance of the gut.
Dr. Marco Colonna, lead researcher, explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not enter the body.
Maintaining balance between the cells that cause inflammation and the cells that improve tolerance protects the body from damaging sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
When the equilibrium state is too inflammatory, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
In the experiment, a cell that promotes immunity was found in small white mice carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need serine (one of the constituent parts of proteins) to form the appearance of the cell.
Professor Kolonna said: "Well, we have established a link between a bacterial population (Roy's leucoma, which is a normal part of the gut microbiome) and a cell population that can promote the development of resistant cells.
The more serine the mice ingested in their diet, the more immune cells they had.
He suggested that if humans used the same method, combining a diet rich in lactic acid and lucerin, a more resistant, less inflammatory gut environment could be created.
Postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studied an immune cell that could increase resistance, and when she found that one group of mice had such cells, another group of the same strain did not have them when they were separately fed.
She suspects that this difference is related to the small mouse's gut microbiome (i.e. bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the stomach).
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice was done and six bacterial populations were found in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
The small rat is fed in a sterile environment, so they lack gut microbiota and cannot produce this immune cell, while the presence of Luteo leucoma produces immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers cultivated luteolus in the liquid, then transferred a small amount of the non-bacterial fluid to immature immune cells that had been isolated from the small rat.
The immune cells develop into resistant cells.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be proven that the active ingredient is a byproduct of the metabolism of serine, called calcium-3-lactate.
When researchers doubled the amount of serine in the feed of the rat, the number of cells increased by about 50%, but when the level of serine was halved, the number of cells was halved.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same growth resistance cells as mice, and most of us have Lympocytosis in our stomachs.
Whether humans can induce cell development by selenase byproducts from luteinizing bacteria, like the small white rat in the experiment, is not known at this time, but a gene defect associated with selenase has been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
"The development of these cells may be the result we want, because they control inflammatory responses on the surface of the intestine", she said.
It is uncertain that the high levels of chlorine present in Lutelactyl may lead to an increase in the number of species.
Jose Mourinho believes United signed the talented player Namani Matchi
On Wednesday night, after Nemanja Matić made his debut against Sampdoria, Mourinho confirmed that Manchester United had signed a talented midfielder.
Mattich, from Chelsea, signed for £40 million and won 2-1 in the league's final preseason game ahead of the European Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, winning the favour of Paul Bogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, in the pre-season Asian Tour in Bruce, Mattichi's game was seriously understaffed, finishing with only 45 minutes, and Mourinho acknowledged that improvement was needed before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and a genius way of thinking that makes him think about football", said Mourinho.
"We will help him prepare as soon as possible".
Mourinho started to arrange his debut squad at the start of the season. Like Mattiche, newly signed players Viktor Lindlov and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Ingevova Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still wanted to bring in three more players, but insisted that the club had done a great job, and he had four first choice players in mind, three of whom the club had already brought in.
The club introduced three of the players signed, and I am very grateful. He added.
"I would be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they have already put a lot of effort into it for me".
Is China going to be behind if it doesn't build this type of warship?
With the recent announcement of plans for the construction of new frigates by the world's major naval powers, as if the frigates had become the focus of the attention of the major navies overnight, Japan decided to purchase two new frigates in the 2018 defence budget, which finally gave Japan a substantial breakthrough in the DEX frigate program, and then the US Lockheed Martin recently announced the latest plans for the US FFG frigate program, where did China's new frigate come from?
With the sinking of the latest 054A frigate at the end of 2017, the 054A has been built up to 29 ships, approaching the sum of the 053H series, and the construction of the 054A has been 12 years since the first 054A sinking in 2006, and even worldwide, so many high-performance general purpose frigates have been built, except in China, and only the United States built the Permian frigate in the last seven or eight centuries can make a comparison.
The reason why so many 054As are being built is simple: it is convenient, useful, and adds to the Navy's debts over the years.
The 054A frigate, which has been favored by the Chinese Navy for many years due to its high price and good combat capability, has a discharge volume of about 4,000 tons, with a 76 mm main gun, 32 units of the Red Flag-16 and Fish-8 anti-submarine missile rack launches, 8 fighter 83s and a straight-9 helicopter. Although construction began in 2006, the design time is a very early ship, but its combat power is not too bad even today, and the eyes of the world's frigates can reach the middle level.
But after all, it is a type of ship designed in the early 21st century, with weapons configuration aside, its power system and electronic radar equipment are already very different from the mainstream ships in the world today, and it is time to develop new models, such as ships of the same type in Europe, which are already equipped with full power propulsion, small multifunctional counter-attack radar, large size helicopter deck.
So how China's new battleship should develop is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic direction of our Chinese Navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will be to become a blue water navy completely, and the future will be to move to the ocean, with rapid deployment in areas where China's tangible interests are relevant, demonstrating the presence of force, and being able to have strong combat power when necessary to ensure that China's tangible interests in the region are not damaged, so it looks like the new Huajiang will move towards enlargement and oceanisation development.
Consider the positioning of the new type of patrol vessel in the future Chinese naval sequence, the future Chinese Navy should be similar to the US Navy, removing the necessary near-sea defense ships, other main force ships will be formed as a carrier battle group or a two-ship attack group depending on the situation.
The role of the new ships in the future carrier battle group should serve as the anti-submarine and the positioning of the near-medium area of the airspace, and in the attack group of the two attack ships should serve as the class of ships of the guard, and according to such requirements, the new ships must have strong anti-submarine capabilities and good mid-range area of the airspace.
Based on the above positioning, it is bold to imagine the likely pattern of future domestic patrol vessels.
First of all, the discharge volume will increase significantly compared to the current 054A type of frigate, estimating that the discharge volume of the new frigate will reach about 5000-6000 tons; the propulsion system will adopt an integrated electric propulsion system consisting of one QC280 improved gas turbine and two diesel engines, the maximum flight speed is expected to reach about 30 knots, and the durability will increase significantly; so that the weapon configuration of 76 mm main gun and 1130 near-barrel gun should be maintained, but will increase the launch system of the Red Flag 10, the main gun should have a vertical system of 32-48 single-barrel Red 16 improved and the fish-8 rig, and the rear of the ship should be equipped with an 8-16 single-barrel vertical system similar to the launch pad 18 and the new patrol control; the radar platform
This will bring the overall level of the new frigates to the world's best level, even if it is not as high as the US FFG.
Of course, the concept above is just my guess about the new domestic model of the frigate, and let's look at how we can wait until the new frigate goes down.

What's worse than not being able to afford a house than not being able to pay off debt?
Recently, everyone has been discussing what changes have been made to real estate policy recently, whether real estate policy should be relaxed, whether the diversity of land policy supplies will cause house prices to fall?
But when we were worried about real estate prices, worried about macroeconomic regulation, worried about the future trends in the real estate market, the People's Daily wrote again, the last time we specialized in discussing the regulation of real estate regulation, and now the People's Daily wrote about a more serious topic than not being able to buy a house, which is whether you can buy a house, still get a debt?
Today, we're going to talk about a more serious issue than buying a house: repayment.
One, China's increasing housing debt crisis
The People's Daily published a commentary article on January 17 in the Foreign edition of the Chinese People's Daily. The joy and worry of the youth in the struggle. According to the data in the text, in November 2017, the China Deleverage Process Report of the National Finance and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the National Assets Balance Sheet Research Center published the third quarter of the Chinese Deleverage Process.
The debt share of the residential sector in the entire physical economy is increasing and the leverage rate is rising faster.
Related studies show that Chinese households' liabilities in financial institutions are mainly based on consumer loans, accounting for about 2/3 of the resident liabilities, about twice the amount of operational loans.
Among them, medium-term loans, mainly home loans, account for about 80% of consumer loans, but in terms of growth, short-term consumer loans grow faster and higher than medium-term loans.
In addition, the Chinese household debt ratio is only a statistic of the total amount of credit the household sector receives from financial institutions, while Chinese households have a large amount of hidden debt, including private loans to relatives and friends.
According to statistics from the SUNY Institute of Finance, the leverage rate of Chinese residents in 1996 was only 3%, and in 2008 it was only 18%, but the leverage rate of residents has been growing rapidly since 2008, doubling in just six years to 36.4%. By the third quarter of 2017, the leverage rate of residents had reached 48.6%.
Compared to one data, in May last year, HSBC released a survey report of nearly 10,000 respondents across nine countries.
The report visited millennial youths from nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
The report notes that the proportion of young people in China after the 80s and 90s who own housing reaches 70%, which is far ahead of Mexico, which is second by far (46%), and is twice the level of the US, which is 35%.
These data tell us that a very likely problem arises, which is that the largest potential rhinos in China at this stage are estimated to be debt-free compared to homes they cannot buy.
Second, why is the mortgage crisis the most serious problem?
As we analyzed earlier, although we have always said that China's housing prices are higher, but the home ownership rate in China is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world, instead of saying that housing prices are high, I fear that the question now to ask many friends is whether you can still get a loan?
We have been looking at the real estate market around the world, and the real estate market in China has not yet experienced a major real estate crisis, except for Hainan, which we mentioned earlier, because of the late start, but the origin of the global financial crisis in 2008 was the real estate crisis in the United States ten years ago.
The real estate crisis in the United States is blamed on two houses: the house and the real estate.
In the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold homes to low-income people in the United States at extremely low prices in order to expand sales. The real estate market was booming when the U.S. economy was doing well, but the prospect was not long, as the U.S. economy stalled in growth, causing the income of home buyers to decline, and large household consumption expenditure began to decline.
But the financial assets and real estate assets that were part of the assets of American households at the time were the current state of affairs in the United States, and almost all household assets in the low-income group were real estate, while most of the assets in the top 20% of high-income groups were financial assets, which resulted in the higher debt to real estate in the poorest households in the United States.
A serious fact is that these people bought houses when the economy was better, so the money to pay for the mortgage was also calculated on their better income, and when income fell, the pressure on mortgages did not only decrease but also increased because some subprime plans became floating, so under this austerity, the real estate problem of these American families gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
Some people are unable to pay their mortgages because of their income, so banks start collecting the property, and when banks collect the property from borrowers who borrowed loans, they sell it at extremely low prices, which leads to a gradual drop in the price of houses in the area, which triggered a further drop in house prices, forming a vicious cycle, and when the house price fell to a certain extent, more and more buyers found that their house value was even lower than their loan, so more people stopped lending and caused more bad checks.
So a huge vicious cycle was formed:
The economy is not economic The income declines Some people are still not able to sell mortgages The banks sell low prices The houses of debtors The house of the debtors The house of the debtors The prices of the houses decreased More people stopped paying the mortgages The banks sold the house The prices of the houses decreased again ...
And the problem is more than that, because the house price continues to fall, and you stop lending the house to the bank and you don't have any debt after that, and if the money you get from the house auction is not yet on your loan from the bank, then you still need to repay it, simply say if you bought a house worth 3 million at the time with a loan of $600,000, $2.4 million, and when the house price drops to $2 million, you no longer lend the house to the bank, and after the bank auctioned the house, you not only lost your first payment of $600,000, but you also owe the bank $400,000, you still have to repay the money.
So, under this vicious cycle, the U.S. economy gradually collapsed, eventually triggering the 2008 financial crisis.
So, the high level of domestic debt in China at 46.8% at this stage is a very wary issue, which is still below the level of developed countries at the moment, but the root of the problem has begun to emerge, and the country has repeatedly stressed the issue of leverage since the beginning of last year, which is a very predictable judgment that if the domestic debt rate is allowed to continue to rise, it will inevitably cause huge risks, so it is necessary to strictly guard against the emergence of financial risks.
So, with the house being positioned for living, not for cattle, the country is faster to establish multi-subject supply, multi-channel safeguards, leases and takeovers, etc.
For our individual families, it is imperative to abandon the speculative thinking of real estate, to make a measurable effort to buy a house, to avoid the enormous burden of our own families, and only a reasonable assessment of our income and debt level is a healthy way to develop family wealth.

A British inventor installed a chip for himself, and with just a wave of his hand, he could open the front door of his house, enter the office and even start the car, becoming the first person in the country.
Steven Northam, 33, implanted a small chip in his thumb and forefinger and is now offering the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, which is made possible by his company BioTeq through technology.
He has worked with Dr Jeff Watson, a senior adviser to anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure that the implantation process meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to the implantation of a cat and dog chip, and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also replaces the locks of rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, costing £300 each lock.

According to military records published by the Time magazine, last month the White House decided to transport a Marine Corps helicopter to South Lawn for the great glory of American manufacturing, at a cost of up to $24,000.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as Marine Corps No. 1 during the presidential ride) was a key exhibit at the White House on July 17 highlighting the activities of the American construction project.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufactured products from all 50 states.
The exhibit features Connecticut-built helicopters, a yacht in Maine, a fire truck in Wisconsin, and a fork in Mississippi.
According to records from the Marine Corps Helicopter First Flight Squadron (HMX-1), the White House Military Office required the helicopter to be present by daily order (FRAGO), which was only 36 hours before the helicopter landed in South Strait for the special hunting operation.
The day before the event, the commander of HMX-1 said in an email sent to the Deputy Commander of the Marine Corps Flying Forces of the upper class, "I just wanted to confirm that you know, because this event is highly regarded".
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn about 7 a.m. on July 17 to participate in the 3 p.m. event and leave after the lawn is cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. that evening.
The information also said that the time of departure from the White House was delayed and the return flight was delayed due to the shift time limitation that required second group crew.
The original crew members were stationed at the helicopter side during the operation, while the security forces were stationed nearby when the aircraft was on the ground.
The records obtained by the Time magazine are unclear as to whether a second crew is needed in the end.
The Shahjaji Bill prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record shows that HMX-1 asked if the activity violated the law.
The commander wrote that one of the questions we asked was whether this violated the provisions of the Shahjaji Act and was told that there was no violation.
"I heard you were locked up", the deputy commander replied.
The White House defined the U.S. smoking operation as an official activity and is therefore not governed by the Smoking Act.
But even official activities have political colours.
During the event, the president launched the Senate's theme of healthcare reform and boasted about the regulation of government regulations.
It is no longer a new phenomenon to use the Marine Corps' 1st or Air Force's 1st aircraft for political propaganda purposes.
The previous president was asked to travel and take these planes.
But it is not uncommon to use it for photography purposes alone.
Trump received attention in February when, in Melbourne, Florida, the presidential plane slowly slid over the background of his first campaign rally, while his Twitter account was full of complaints about the former president using the presidential plane.
White House deputy press spokesman Lindsay Walters said the White House was excited about the second American Manufacturing Aluminum Exhibition, which showcased products from all 50 states, all made by American workers using American materials.
HMX-1 crews frequently fly training near Washington and South Lawn, practicing the precise location of the President of the United States in the White House.
During Trump's G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 exercised 58 landings at the White House.
One official said that this US manufacturing activity flight was included in the crew training requirements this month.
The helicopter force also flew an additional 11 hours on the day of the non-presidential support mission.
The White House said taxpayers did not bear any other expenses for the event.
Sikorsky's spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging the display of the Nanchang helicopter.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records of presidential flights, so it is very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
But according to the Department of Defense's annual hourly fee record for fiscal year 2017, the Department of Defense can charge the VH-3D $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records recording the time each plane takes to fly from the base at the Marine Corps airport in Ponteco, Virginia, for 30 minutes.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower than the cost.
Walters said that it was very misleading to estimate the cost of taxpayers based on recoverable fees.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many others, including the cost of sinking in the annual allocation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the Department of Defense's refundable costs do not include personnel costs, but do include fuel costs, maintenance costs and contract costs.
At the time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spike defended the helicopter for the event, saying that the helicopter was used to carry out the mission.
And that the idea of the pump is to showcase something that is made in the US this week.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, that they are both a force for our national security, and I guess even if it's not thousands or hundreds of people who depend on it.
And I feel like most Americans are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of countless Americans' hard work.
So emphasizing this is certainly not timeless.
We don't know if Trump interacted with the helicopter while visiting South Lawn during the campaign, but he did sit in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky's representatives and joked with the media about the company's own aircraft.
He said, "I know Sikorsky very well. I have three".

According to Market Star, from 2005 to 2011, I province's GDP rose from the middle to the second tier.
But the province's economic growth still has difficulties such as low investment efficiency and lack of core competitiveness in the industrial economy. For this reason, the latest edition of the Economic Information Center recommends improving the quality and effectiveness of economic growth.
Based on some representative indicators of the province's economy in 2005 and 2011, it was compared with the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic benefits, in 2011, the high energy consumption industries such as industrial energy and raw materials accounted for a considerable proportion of the province, which was affected by market volatility and double pressure pressure of overcapacity, while the lack of innovation in the dominant industries such as home appliances and automobiles led to weak profits.
The large amount of investment has not brought the corresponding economic benefits, which is an important reason why the quality and efficiency of our province's economic growth is not high.
To this end, experts suggest that effective measures should be taken to encourage enterprise innovation, and that the scientific achievements of universities and research institutes should be transferred to enterprises in a timely manner.
Experts say that if the economic benefits of industry are not high, it is also necessary to actively promote industrial integration, restructuring, optimizing industrial layout and extending industrial chains.

The union wants the management of the biscuit maker, Mevita, to guarantee a long-term commitment to production in the Las Vegas factory.
The Scottish branch of the British General Union said the company had remained silent about the future of its investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory has more than 500 employees and produces products such as Hobnobs and Rich tea.
Pladis, owner of Mavitha, said that the company has invested more than £5 million in the plant over the past few years.
He added that if the factory operation changes, employees and union representatives will know firsthand.
In a letter to the head of the factory, the Scottish branch of the British General Union called on the company to solve the problem of not turning the funds to the modernization of the production line.
Drew Duffy, senior organiser of the British General Union, said: "We cannot clearly understand the future business needs and investment plans of Tollcross from the General Manager of the plant, which makes our members deeply concerned.
Generations of families work here, and the high concentration of labour in the local community and Greater Glasgow area is an important pillar of decent employment in areas with high unemployment and severe social exclusion.
Therefore, in terms of employment, wages and economic prosperity, the growing cost of living and the long-term recession in manufacturing in the UK, the East Glasgow region urgently needs the continuous expansion of the production network of Mavitha.
A Pradis spokesman said: "The head of Tollcross just received a letter yesterday from the Scottish branch of the General Union of Great Britain, and the company will respond immediately, as we attach importance to maintaining continuous contact with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the UK General Union at Tollcross, where we discussed some issues openly.
We discussed with employees and then, like all other companies operating in highly competitive and economically ambiguous environments, we reviewed our continued operating patterns for enterprises and factories to maintain competitiveness.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in improving production lines and operations.
We fully recognize the historic status of Tollcross as a production base, and if there is any change in our operations at the plant, employees and union representatives will be the first to know.

The Premier League may regret throwing an olive branch at Marco Vilatí
After offering £189 million to try to get them to exercise exemption terms, Paris Saint-Germain will not give up signing Neymar, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago that they would launch an attack on the world record-breaking attacker?
This notorious approach has opened the summer transfer window, and the FA club is preparing to break the world transfer record by double the price of the previous transfer record. Paul Bogba returned to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
Once the transfer is complete, Neymar will jump to become the world's highest paid player and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. Paris Saint-Germain offers more than £500,000 a week after tax.
Barcelona are angry at Neymar's offensive style and his way out, and sources on the board of directors of Catalonia insist that the club has been doing everything possible to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.

The financial subsidy strength of the new energy vehicle boom in Sichuan has weakened, the penetration of charging facilities has not been high, the use of 3-yuan lithium batteries has been suspended in new energy buses, facing the current upward pressure on the domestic new energy vehicle market.

In the past one Winter Olympics cycle, the British Sports Council has allocated a total of £32 million (about RMB280 million) for the Winter Olympics programme, doubling the cycle of the Biscayne Winter Olympics.
Most of the money comes from the state lottery, the rest from the state finances.
Britain's hopes for gold rested primarily on two men, one last year's world speed skating champion Alice Christie and the other on the previous year's women's steel skating champion Liz Arnold.
At the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, the British delegation won 1 gold, 1 silver and 2 bronze, their best result since their first Winter Olympics in 1924.
Welsh AM is worried about the chicken like a chicken.
Some suggested that AM should change the title to MWP (Welsh Member of Parliament), which shocked many AMs.
The reason for this proposal is that the name of the parliament is to be changed to the Welsh Parliament.
AM in the political community is worried that this will make people laugh.
One Labour Party member, AM, said Labour members were concerned that the name would be associated with Twp and Pwp.
(Non-Welsh readers note: in Welsh, twp means "dumb-ass" and pwp means "dumb-ass".
One National Party AM said that the entire National Party staff was not satisfied and suggested changing the name.
A Welsh Conservative said the Conservatives were open about the change, but noted that it was easy to make the MWP sound Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission is currently drafting legislation on the name change, he said: "It's their own business that committee members ultimately decide what name to choose".
The Welsh Government Act 2017 provides that the Welsh Parliament has the power to rename the council.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposed names, generally supporting the use of the Welsh Parliamentary name.
On the issue of the title of AM, the committee favored WMP (Welsh Assembly Member), but the public consultation resulted in the highest support for MWP.
Clearly, the AM suggested other names, but meeting chair Elin Jones felt that the delay was not consistent, as he was to submit a legislative draft for the name change within weeks.
Legislation on reform will also include other changes to the way parliament operates, including rules to abolish AM qualifications and the design of the committee system.
AM will vote on the final name during the legislative debate.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
Direct voting is a solution to the decades-old dispute between Macedonia and neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has insisted that the name of its northern neighbour implies that Greece has a legitimate right to its territory and has repeatedly refused Macedonia's accession to the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposed the renamed referendum, said he would not participate in the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that changing the name is only the inevitable cost of joining the EU and NATO.
The church in Harlem is in danger, and the bell in St. Martin's is silent
Old people I've talked to in the history of yoga say that there will be a bar and a church in every corner, Adams said.
"Now, there is no bar or church here.
He said the disappearance of the bar was part of the rationale.
"Now people are starting to participate in social chat in different ways", Adams said.
The beer bar is no longer a regularly visited neighborhood living room.
As for the church, he was worried that the funds for selling assets would not be supported as long as leaders expected, and that the money would eventually go to zero.
He added that the church will be replaced by apartment buildings, where people who do not help maintain the rest of the block's shelters will live.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white monks, he said, and therefore, this will also accelerate the complete closure of the church, as most people who move into these apartments are unlikely to become members of the church.
Both churches were built by white congregants ten years after St. Martin's, before Harlem became a black city (the city corporation district in 1870).
The first white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A black congregation in the vicinity for worship acquired ownership of the building.
Under the leadership of Rev. John Howard Johnson, St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation, which had led a campaign to boycott 125 Street (125 Street) retailers. 125 Street was a major shopping street in Harlem, but refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but due to the parish residents of Father Johnson's plan to rebuild the church, they commissioned the bell to be made.
The son of Johnson's father, the heir to St. Martin's, the Rev. David Johnson arrogantly calls the bell the bell of the poor.
Professionals who played the horn in July called it: "The horn of culture and the historical instrument that cannot be replaced".
Tiffany Ng, a professional at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first bell played by a black musician named Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago to play a larger bell.
Merriweather said St. Martin's Church was not looking for a replacement.
What happened at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complex story about architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by the secular leaders of the church, others by the bishopric.
The parish's governing body, the parish council, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the parish in July expressing concern that the parish was trying to transfer capital to the parish council, although the parish councillor would not be involved in hiring the architects and contractors who had been handed over to the parish.
Some parish residents complained about the lack of transparency in the parish's affairs.
A 13-year-old boy in California was bitten by a shark while diving for a lobster
Officials said that on Saturday, the opening day of the California salmon fishing season, a 13-year-old boy was bitten by a shark while diving for a salmon.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he and his friends were diving on Saturday morning, and about half an hour later, a boy shouted for help and a man pulled him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought the boy was too excited to catch the dragon, but later he realized that the boy was screaming and I was bitten!
I was bitten!
His entire ankle was torn open, and Hamel said he noticed it when he was around the boy.
"Oh, I shouted everyone to get him out of the water: there is a shark in the water!" said Hammer.
The boy was airlifted to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where the situation is critical.
The species of whales involved in the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles, a rescue worker, told a news conference that a shark was discovered in the area weeks ago but that it was determined that it would not pose a threat to humans.
Jales added that the victim's upper half was traumatized.
For investigative and security reasons, the authorities have closed Casablad's Ponto Beach to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours.
Jales said there are more than 135 species of shark in the region, but most of them are not a threat to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is to adopt the style of the department store Boots, Superdrug and DeBenhams to open a beauty corridor equipped with professional assistants.
With a large number of department stores entering the £2.8 billion beauty market in the UK and the market still growing during a decline in sales of fashion and household goods, beauty corridor testing will be conducted in 11 stores across the country and if successful, it will be rolled out to more stores next year.
Since the supermarket's TVs, microwave ovens and shelves for household items were once sued, the supermarket decided to invest in beauty products and use these shelves space.
Sennesbury department store said it would double the size of its beauty products and launch more than 3,000 products, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space, with brand areas similar to shops such as Boots.
The supermarket has also relaunched its own line of premium cosmetics to make the majority of products pure vegetable products. This is a requirement of more and more young shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will conduct franchising trials at two stores in Sainsbury. The first opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the other will open at the end of this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
The current dominant trend is online shopping and a small amount of food purchased daily in local convenience stores, which means that supermarkets must take more measures to attract visitors.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's department store, said the chain would offer more services and non-food to counter discount dealers Aldi and Lidl, who would increasingly be like department stores.
Since acquiring the chain two years ago, Sainsbury's department store has opened Argos stores in hundreds of stores and introduced some Habitat. The company said the acquisition boosted grocery sales and brought profit.
The supermarket has tried to transform beauty and pharmacies before, but it failed.
In the early 21st century, Sennesbury and Bojo tried to run a joint venture, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to split revenue from the pharmacies in Bojo supermarket.
Three years ago, Sainsbury proposed a new strategy to sell its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain pharmacies, for £125 million.
The company said Lloyds Pharmacy will add a range of luxury skincare brands to its four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, and will therefore play an important role in the plan.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director at Salisbury department store, said: "We have changed the look and feel of the beauty corridor to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in introducing special trained colleagues who will offer advice on the spot.
Our range of brands designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient geographical location means that we are now an attractive beauty destination that will become a major challenge to traditional shopping.
Peter Jones was shocked after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the £11 million deal.
TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from the £11 million lifestyle brand business deal to focus on a new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV, which caused the uproar of Peter Jones, the star of Dragon Den.
Willoughby doesn't have time to invest in their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business for the partner is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning's Instagram channel announced his decision to leave.
Holly Willoughby left the lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute and turned to a rich new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which angered the star of the long-running series Peter Jones.
The sources said that TV Gold Child admitted at a tense meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of the Mallow Commercial Empire in Buckinghamshire that she had just reached a deal worth up to £1.5 million, and was shocked to learn that this meant she would not have enough time to invest in the homewear brand Truly with which they worked.
The business is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, which was expected to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was on a plane from England to his vacation home.
A source said: "Truly was Holly's top priority at the time.
This will be her long-term future plan for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave was a shock to all participants.
No one believed what happened on Tuesday because the market was about to be thrown out.
The Mallorcan headquarters has a whole warehouse of goods waiting to be sold.
Experts believe that the departure of the UK's most lucrative This Morning anchor could cause millions of dollars in losses for the company, as the company has invested heavily in products such as anchor, anchor, clothing and household goods, and may further delay market placement.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Now, Willow, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been good friends for ten years with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby and Capp founded Truly in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as a director in March.
The couple always go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the TV production company in Bolvin.
Willoughby will be M&S's brand spokesperson and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that we have no comment on his business side of things.
After a long conversation, we fell in love.
He joked about criticism of the media. Some felt that this was a loss of the presidency and an overestimation of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump sacrifice so much?
Trump imitated the voice of the news anchor.
Oh, I didn't sacrifice anything.
He noted that the first meeting of leaders of the two countries was held in Singapore in June, and Trump praised the move as an important step towards denuclearization of North Korea, and now Kim Jong-un intends to hold another meeting.
But the denuclearization negotiations are stuck.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean top diplomat Lee Yong-yeon addressed world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, saying that North Korea did not see the United States responding appropriately to the early disarmament operations of North Korea.
He pointed out that the United States continues to press and impose sanctions.
Trump expressed optimism in his rally speech.
He said, "Well, we have a good relationship with North Korea".
If we go to war with North Korea,
I fear that millions of people have already died.
Now, the relationship is good.
He said that the work to improve relations with Kim Jong-un has had positive results, rocket tests have been terminated, hostages have been successfully rescued, and the remains of US soldiers have fallen to the ground.
In addition, he defended his special approach when talking about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, saying that he was not a man who could be seen with his own eyes.
It's easy to be president, but instead of letting 10,000 people crowd out into this crowded space, we'd rather have 200 people standing here, Trump pointed directly to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroyed an island, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Long Island, foreign NGOs and other organizations were told they did not need their help.
Although more than 10% of the population has been displaced, the government has not declared a national disaster, and national disaster is a prerequisite for launching international aid.
Unfortunately, in many cases, they are clear that they will not ask for international assistance, so this will be a huge challenge for them, Ms. Sumbung said.
Save the Children organized a group to Barou, but it is not yet clear whether foreign workers will be able to enter the workplace.
The spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, Sutopo, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Baru to determine whether international agencies would be needed to participate in the rescue work.
It is clear that Indonesia is not fully prepared for the earthquake that may continue to occur and the rage of nature.
Although Aai has already built a beach shelter, other coastlines have not followed suit.
Although the tsunami warning has been in effect, Baru clearly lacks a tsunami warning, which could be responsible for the deaths of people.
Even in the most favorable conditions, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
A medical ship that was originally stationed in Long Island to rescue the earthquake victims is heading to Baru, but it will take at least three days to reach the new rescue site.
President Joko Widodo will be at the heart of his campaign to improve Indonesia's decaying infrastructure and spend a lot of money on repairing roads and railways.
But as the government faces re-election next year, the lack of funds has been plaguing the government.
Zoko also faces the pressure of the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslim members are more conservative.
Christian and Muslim gangs have used knives, arrows and other simple weapons in street fighting, killing more than 1,000 people and displacing tens of thousands.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge level the score against Chelsea
On Saturday, at London's Stanford Bridge, Daniel Sturridge's goal in the 89th minute saved Liverpool's loss to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, when his team was 1-0 behind.
He passed the ball lightly to the left side and then shot the goal at the remote pole.
The ball flew high above the restricted zone when it moved to the upper right corner of the goal.
The Kepa Arrizabalaga, who finally jumped over, fell into the net.
In an interview with Liverpool FC.com, Sturridge said, "Well, I just want to get into that position and control the ball, and then players like Shaq will try to move forward as much as possible, and I just create the potential for myself as much as possible".
"I saw Kant walk by, touched the ball, and didn't want to shoot too much".
Chelsea's midfield took a 1-0 temporary lead after the 25th minute was scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In that match, the Blue Force forward passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic with his footsteps, then missed the half of the Liverpool offense near the midfield.
Kovacic played a quick passing match in the middle.
Then, with a nice direct message, Azhar was brought into the restricted zone.
Azar overcame the defense, and the left foot shot over Liverpool's Alisson Becker, shooting into the long-distance pole.
Liverpool will play against their opponent in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday afternoon at 3pm.
Chelsea will play VidéoTon on Thursday afternoon at 3pm in the UEFA Europa Leaguge in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
The National Disaster Management Agency said early Sunday that the death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
Administration spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference that a 7.5 magnitude earthquake reportedly occurred on Friday, triggering a massive wave of up to six meters (20 feet) and causing buildings to collapse and many people to be trapped in the building rubble.
The city of Pallu, with a population of over 380,000, is a ruin, full of ruins and the ruins of a collapsed building.
A 32-year-old man was arrested by police for allegedly murdering a woman who led to her death
Police have opened an investigation into the murder, which was discovered this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The dead woman, 44, was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street with stab wounds. The man involved, 32, was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged the crowd in the area to jump in and provide clues.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation into the allegations is still in its early stages, and I urge the crowd near John Street in Berkshire to contact us if they have any leads".
At the same time, I call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if any clue is caught in the traffic logger, because the information you have is vital to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the victim was a local from Birkenhead, and the body was found inside a residence.
A friend who knew the woman came to the scene this afternoon and asked where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have said they are notifying the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was trying to get back to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed to enter the building.
After figuring out what happened, he was silent.
Currently, residents have been notified and will have to wait a few hours before entering.
A policeman told a man that the whole area was designated as a crime scene.
A woman on the scene cried.
My mouth kept saying, "You are too sad".
At 2pm, two police cars stopped inside the alert line and one van stopped outside the alert line.
Several police officers were on alert to monitor the situation in the apartment building.
Anyone with information can send a DM to @MerPolCC by calling 101 or anonymously contacting Crimestoppers (phone number 0800 555 111), citing the record of September 30th, 247.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament became the last monument to suffer from historical rewrite controversy
Cromwell's fanatical Puritan followers have carried out Taliban-style destruction of British culture and religious artifacts, expelling what they say is a deserved punishment.
But the Crumwell Society called Crick's suggestion extremely foolish and attempted to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said that in the current debate about the statue being removed, the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would undoubtedly be the target of an attack.
The destruction of the British Civil War was neither directed by nor initiated by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's biggest mistake was being the victim of what his predecessor Thomas did in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's high praise of Cremwell well proves the 19th century claim and is considered by many to be part of Cremwell's history that is still to be celebrated.
Kim Smith told the Sunday Telegraph that Duncan Cromwell was considered by many to be the defender of congressional resistance to external pressure - in his view, monarchy - and that there may be fewer people today than in the late 19th century.
Whether this statement is completely accurate has been the subject of historical debate.
But it is certain that the conflicts of the mid-17th century affected the later development of our country, and Clemwell was a person who was recognized as a party representing the division.
His achievements as a patron saint are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
Pig kills pigs, pigs tear Chinese farmers to death
According to local media, a farmer was killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
According to the Xinhua Morning Post, a man named Liu was found dead near a pig circle in a market in the Six Plate Market in Guangzhou province, where his artery was cut off and his body was covered with blood.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai province, China, was preparing to give the pigs a vaccine.
The pig farmer and his cousin reportedly rushed to the local market from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin found the pig farmer dead and the door to the pig house nearby was opened.
He explained that there was a larger pig in the pig's circle, full of blood in his mouth.
According to reports, forensic identification confirmed that the 550-pound fat pig attacked the farmer and killed him.
Citing the news of the evening news, Liu said that the legs of my cousin were bleeding and could not bear to see him, his cousin said.
Monitoring video showed that the man with the name of Chiang entered the market at 4:40 am on Thursday.
His body was found about an hour later.
But the fat pig that caused his death was neither of the male of the family name nor of his cousin.
Market administrators told the evening news channel that the fat pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others again, while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
The family of the man with the surname of Han is reportedly negotiating with the market authorities on compensation for his death.
Although less common, there have been reports of pig attacks on humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts, causing them to be seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound fat pig pushed a Welsh farmer on a tractor until his wife ran away to scare the livestock.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his own pig, and a farmer in Lake Manitoba told Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's CBC News network that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can play the role of a calcium-stimulating agent.
They just like to play games and play games.
They are like children, curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the proper respect, he said.
Hurricane Remains of Tropical Storm Rosa will continue to bring heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa continued to move towards the northern coast of Mexico, and as predicted, the winds weakened after reaching this cool part of the sea.
But Rosas is expected to bring heavy rainfall and flash floods to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
At 5am eastern time on Sunday, the center of the Tropic of Capricorn is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, with winds of 85 mph and is a Category 1 hurricane.
The Rosetta Trench is expected to continue northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific begins to form a low valley, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. Tropical Storm Rosa will form near the lower California peninsula on Monday, when deep tropical moisture will move northward into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, the Tropic of Cancer will bring 10 inches of rainfall to parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, the interaction of tropical moisture with the incoming wave valley will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Local reports say that 1 to 4 inches of rainfall can cause flooding, mudflow, and even possible desertification.
The effects of deep tropical humidity will bring rainfall to an altitude of 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to reach 2 to 4 inches in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Due to the dispersion of tropical rain and the rapid deterioration of conditions, flooding may occur.
Desert adventure will be very dangerous due to the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain may cause the canyon to form a fast flowing river, with thunderstorms bringing local wind and dust.
The wave valley that is coming will bring local heavy rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
The total rainfall could exceed half an inch, which could lead to slight mudslides and road slides.
This will be the first rainfall in the region since the rainy season.
Arizona will experience decentralized tropical rainfall on Sunday evening and Monday morning, followed by an expansion of rainfall on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
Due to the Arctic coldering and the tropics remaining fairly warm, temperatures across the United States will fluctuate sharply in October.
This situation sometimes leads to extreme temperature changes within short distances.
On Sunday, there will be a huge temperature difference in the central United States.
Temperature differences between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, will reach nearly 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the unrelenting heat will be brought back and the range will expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience heat in October, with temperatures ranging from the southern plains to parts of the northeast reaching 80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 27 degrees Celsius).
The temperature in New York City on Tuesday could reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 27 degrees Celsius) and will be about 10 degrees Fahrenheit higher than average.
Long-term climate forecasts show that as of the first half of October, temperatures in the eastern United States are above average.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
On Thursday, a hearing on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his alleged sexual assault of Christine Blasey Ford in the 1980s was broadcast on six television networks, attracting over 20 million viewers.
Meanwhile, political stalemate continued, and the BBC disrupted the regular programming of Friday's final turn: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake promised to ask the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh touched her body after getting drunk at a high school party and wanted to take off her clothes.
Kavanaugh responded generously and furiously, saying he was 100% sure that this had never happened.
Nielsen reported last Friday that more than 20.4 million people may have watched the hearing.
The company is calculating average viewing rates for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewing data from other networks that broadcast the situation of the hearing at the same time have not yet been obtained, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen often encounters problems with the number of people watching programs in the statistics office.
Objectively, this figure is much larger than the audience size of a playoff football game or an Academy Award.
Nielsen said that Fox News had 569,000 viewers during the day of the hearing, pressuring other online media. The Fox News anchor was a strong supporter of Kavanaugh's appointment.
ABC is behind, with a viewership of 3.26 million.
Nielsen estimates that CBS has 3.1 million viewers, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million.
After the hearing, the attention remained high.
Flake became the central character of the Friday show.
Earlier, the moderate Republican said in a statement in his office that he would vote for Kavanaugh. On Friday morning, he climbed the elevator to attend the Judiciary Committee hearing, and was caught on CNN and CBS cameras, protestors chanting against his opening.
CNN live broadcast saw him stand silently for several minutes while being condemned.
One woman said: "Oh, I'm standing in front of you".
"Do you think what he told the people is true?"
You have the power to do so, and so many women are powerless.
Before the elevator closed, Flake said his office issued a statement that he would make more comments at the committee hearing.
In the case of live broadcasting on cable and radio networks, the Judiciary Committee will vote on Kavanaugh's nomination and send it to the Senate for a full vote.
But Flake said he would only vote if the FBI did a further investigation into allegations of sexual assault involving the candidate next week. A minority of Democrats have been urging further investigation into the matter.
Frank had some degree of confidence in this after a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talks with Kuhn and several senators, Frank made the decision.
Flake's selectivity was great, because obviously, Republicans would not have voted to approve Kavanaugh if no investigation had been conducted.
Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate Judge Kavanaugh further.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of Brexit playing a political game
British Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with The Times on Sunday, accused critics of her Brexit plan of playing political games with the future of Britain and damaging national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived in Birmingham on 29 September 2018 to attend a Conservative Party meeting.
In another interview with the front page of the paper, former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson strongly criticized its so-called Brexit check plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should impose tariffs on each other is absurd.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspect in shooting a Louisiana State University player
Police have arrested Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University, suspected of shooting him.
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
Police released a video of Sims and Simpson fighting, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS affiliate WAFB reported that police found the pair of glasses on the spot, saying Simpson's DNA was found on it.
After questioning Simpson, police said Simpson confessed to shooting Wayde.
Advocate reported that the cost of his body could be as high as $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.
The Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and citizens of the region thanked the police for their assistance in the investigation and the eventual success in arresting the fugitives.
Joe Alleva, athletic director at Louisiana State University, thanked the district law enforcement department and praised the department for its hard work and justice.
Sims is 20 years old.
Sims, 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) tall, was a forward and grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. His father Wayne was also a member of the Louisiana State University basketball team.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball head coach Will Wade said the team was saddened by Wayde's passing and that it was difficult to accept.
Wade said, "Well, this is the end we most don't want to see".
Mexico City volcano erupts
The eruption of the volcano Popocatepet, the ash from which sprayed, spread to the southern blocks of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Control Center of Mexico recorded 183 smoke outings in 24 hours on Saturday, and then warned the Mexican people to stay away from the volcano after the activity at the volcano.
The disaster prevention center monitors the frequent rumbling and minor earthquakes.
Images on social media show a layer of ash covered in the windshield of a car near Mexico City, in Ho Chi Minh City.
Earth physicists note that volcanic activity has increased 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as the Cuckoo Peak, has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with separatists on the eve of the anniversary of Catalonia's independence referendum
Thousands joined the anti-demonstration march on Saturday to mark the one-year anniversary of Catalonia's polarized split referendum, and independent protesters in support of the protest clashed with riot police, six of whom were subsequently arrested in Barcelona.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and powder coatings at riot police, causing dust to cover the streets that used to be crowded with tourists, and were subsequently stopped by riot police.
Later that day, a mixed-up took place and police used police rods to quell the riot.
Ha Ha Ha never forgot, never forgave, Ha Ha' independents who supported Ha Ha' and who stood for hours in opposition to the protesters who were united in their claim to Ha Ha' and Ha Ha' in Spain.
According to local media, 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
The referendum held in Madrid on October 1 last year was considered illegal and a year later, the situation in this region with a tendency to independence is still very tense, but Catalan separatists are celebrating.
The vast majority of voters chose independence, but voting remained low, as most people opposed to the split refused to vote.
According to Catalan authorities, last year police tried to block successive voting in the polling stations in the region, sparking violent clashes that injured nearly 1,000 people.
Friday night, support for the collective independence camp, stop the demonstration march and support the actions of the national police.
The demonstration continues, but it has to take other routes.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's independence.
Last year, we had the best time of our lives.
My parents cried because they were happy to participate in the vote, but now we are in a dilemma, he said.
Despite the crucial victory in the regional elections in December last year, this year the pro-independence Catalan party still tries to maintain its momentum, with many of its most prominent leaders either self-deported or detained pending trial for their public appearances during the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, 42, a mechanic who recorded the protests on his cell phone, believing police were providing support, said the conflict was instigated by politicians on both sides.
The situation is becoming more tense, he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he will contest next year's European Parliament elections.
As a candidate for the European Parliament elections, Liu publicly condemned the Spanish government's backwardness in terms of democratic ideas and repression, which would be the most favorable way to win, he said.
London, Delhi: Three men were arrested for driving into a house
Three men (ages 33, 34, and 39) who drove a car into a house in London's Derryshire several times were arrested by police after the incident.
The incident took place around 19:30 on Thursday at Ballynagard Crescent.
Senior police officer Bob Blemmings said the impact caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
In some cases, there may have been an intervention in the car's suspension.
Monka's goal helped Levinson win 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal was a win for Livingston.
Livingston's promotion shocked the Rangers, with Steven Gerrard losing for the second time in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal became the key goal of the game, and Gary Holt's team tied the Irish team with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerald's team still has no home victory this season and will take the lead next Sunday in the eight-point lead against the Red Heart.
Prior to this, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday. Before that, the Rangers will play their home games against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston will continue their sixth consecutive undefeated season in the region, and Holt has not tasted a taste of failure since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity to compete against the strong opponents.
Holt's team already had a lead before scoring, and their offense brought a variety of problems to the nomads.
Scott Robinson, though he broke through the defense, threw the ball to the other side of the goal, and Alan Lithgow was pulled to the side after receiving the headball from Craig Halkett.
The hosts are very willing to play the struggling team because they know they can create problems for the guests when they are positioning the ball.
This is how the critical shots are generated.
The Rangers threw an arbitrary ball, Livingston opened a gap, and DeKlanlagger and Robinson formed the Monka, who took a score from the center of the block. The Rangers threw an arbitrary ball, Livingston broke the gate, Declan Gallagher and Robinson surrounded the Monka.
At this point, the Rangers, although they had control of the ball, found the main team's defense difficult to break through, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was basically nothing to worry about.
This pattern continued into the second half, despite Alfredo Morelos scoring a goal from Kelly's feet.
Scott Pittman was kicked out by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, while Lithgow missed another position for Livingston.
Crosses constantly entered Livestock's restricted zone and were constantly rounded off, while two goalkeepers were sent back after Harcourt proposed replacing Glenn Middleton and a handball.
Levinson team's superb performance and analysis
BBC Scotland journalist Alasdair Lamont reported at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Livingston's performance is amazing and impressive.
The overall performance of the players was excellent, once again exceeding the expectations of the people.
The team's style of play and personnel configuration have changed little since Holt returned to the top flight, but the honour Holt has brought to the team is truly commendable.
He brought out a lot of heroic players.
Captain Harcourt was unable to do so, he deployed an organized super-strong defensive lineup, and Montag had not let Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall down the line throughout the process.
However, the morale of the nomadic team is not enough.
They performed well under Gerald's leadership, occasionally, but far from the norm.
Their last ball didn't come in, and they only hit the home team once, which was a wake-up call for the midfield team.
Erdogan is happy in Cologne
Saturday (September 29), the last day of the Turkish president's state visit to Germany, was a thousand miles away, and the leaders of the two countries held a friendly breakfast meeting in Berlin.
President Erdogan's controversial trip to Germany is aimed at restoring relations between the two NATO allies.
They are caught up in issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to a huge mosque in Cologne, which was recently built.
Cologne, the city with the largest Turkish population, is the most populous city outside Turkey.
Police stopped 25,000 spectators from attending the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters still showed up nearby welcoming the president's arrival.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of whom are Kurds) also voiced their condolences against Erdogan's policies and condemned the German government's failure to welcome Erdogan to Germany.
The protests on both sides reflected differences over Erdogan's visit: some German Turks called him a hero and others condemned him as a dictator.
Dartford road traffic accident: death of bicycle driver after collision with car
A cyclist died in a crash in London.
The time of the accident was approximately 10:15am British summer time, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy stretch of Deptford in the south-east of the city.
The driver checked the car park, and medical personnel carried out rescue, but the owner of the bike died on the spot.
Just months before the accident, another cyclist died in a crash on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said the police were identifying the man and would notify his immediate family about the incident.
The road has now been closed, bus routes have been changed, and drivers are advised to bypass the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Riot resulting in six prison guards being injured
The prison office said that a high-security male prison was rioted, and six prison guards were injured in the riot.
At 9:30am on Sunday morning in the summertime, riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire, and the riots are still ongoing.
The relevant authorities sent a special squad of the Hurricane Raid to the scene to deal with the riot involving eight prisoners, and all involved are now controlled in one apartment.
The prison guard's face was slightly injured and treated on the spot.
A prison administration spokesperson said that Liu has deployed special staff to deal with the ongoing riots in HMP Long Lartin.
Six wounded prison guards have been treated.
We will not tolerate any violence in prisons and we will hand over the perpetrators to the police, who may face longer jail terms.
HMP Long Lartin Prison has over 500 inmates, including some of the UK's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison warden was reportedly attacked by prisoners and sent to hospital for treatment.
In October last year, anti-riot police were deployed to the prison to deal with major riots and were attacked by Taiwans.
Hurricane Rosa is a flood threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City. Dry areas may benefit from it.
Tropical low pressure strikes in Arizona are rare, but likely to occur earlier next week as the remaining forces of Hurricane Rosa will hit the desert regions of the southwest, causing flood risk.
The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings for areas from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, on Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa is expected to arrive with rain later on Monday and cross over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Beijing wrote on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have remained in tropical storm or low pressure status within 200 miles of Beijing since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that landed within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
According to the latest National Hurricane Cente model, rainfall is projected to reach 2 to 4 inches and local rainfall at the edge of Mogollon, Arizona, will reach 6 inches.
Rainfall in other southwestern desert regions, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, is likely to reach 1 to 2 inches, and local total rainfall may reach 4 inches.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rainfall from Rosa may be a blessing because of the severe drought conditions in these areas.
While flooding is highly regarded, moderate rainfall may also be beneficial, as the southwestern region is currently experiencing drought.
According to weather.com, the U.S. Drought Monitor shows that more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought conditions (second severe category).
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will lead it to land on the lower California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa was still in the strongest hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, located 385 miles south of the Gulf of Eugenia in Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The hurricane touched the cool sea water on the Pacific, and the wind power weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to land from Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the intensity of tropical storms.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, and there is a risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, the total rainfall from the lower California peninsula to northwestern Sonora State is expected to reach 3 to 6 inches, or possibly even 10 inches.
Rosa will then travel north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border in the form of a tropical low pressure on Tuesday morning, and through the entire state of Arizona late Tuesday night, entering southern Utah.
The National Hurricane Center said the main threat to the storm or its remaining force is expected to be heavy rainfall to the lower California peninsula, northwestern Sonora and desert regions of the southwestern United States.
This rainfall is expected to trigger life-threatening floods and mudslides in the desert and cause landslides in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four suspects arrested for premeditated murder
A 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset, and the suspect was arrested after the alleged murder was discovered. The suspects were three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man.
The teenage boy was found injured around 4am on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was then taken to hospital, where his injuries remain stable.
Avon and Somerset Police said that suspects of crime - including a 17-year-old man and two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man - had been arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police called on witnesses to jump in and provide clues to the video captured on the scene using their mobile phones.
Trump called Kavanaugh the recipient of the Democratic Party's contemptuous anger".
Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, that the vote cast by Judge Kavanaugh was a vote against the Democratic ruthless and shameless tactics.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered the contempt and anger of the Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh, who was questioned by Congress on Thursday, emotionally strongly denied the allegations made against him by Christine Blasey Ford, saying that he had never sexually assaulted Ford as a minor decades ago.
Ford also attended the hearing on his allegations.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's over-humanity and courage that day.
The president told supporters in West Virginia that Mr. Liu voted for Judge Kavanaugh, who was the most accomplished legal scholar of our time and a public service jurist.
The president indirectly shot Kavanaugh's candidacy when he spoke about the importance of the Republican electoral landscape in the midterm elections.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
I'm not running, I'm running around like this.
It's to get you to pick out the best candidates", he said.
Trump said the Democratic mission is to fight back and block.
A senior Republican assistant to the leadership told CNN that the first crucial procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be held in the Senate Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of deaths from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami are still rising
Indonesian authorities said on Saturday that a major earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Indonesia, killing at least 384 people, many of whom were swept away by the tsunami.
Hundreds of people were gathering on the beach in the city of Baru on Friday evening to party, when a wave of up to 6 meters (18 feet) hit the coast, killing many people, and the beach was completely unseen.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In a press conference in Jakarta, the spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB, Sudopo Purwo Nugroho, said: "Unfortunately, people were actively on the beach when the tsunami hit yesterday and they could not escape in time.
The tsunami, which was rife with cars, timber, houses, and all the mud on land, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the beach to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 evacuation centres in Baru.
Aerial photographs released by the rescue agency show that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were distorted and collapsed, and a mosque was surrounded by sea water.
On Saturday, the quake continued to affect the coastal city.
The region of 2.4 million people was hit by a powerful earthquake.
The Indonesian Institute of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the force released by Friday's tremor was about 200 times the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement also noted that the city is located at the end of a narrow bay, so the geographical location may have amplified the strength of the beach.
Nugroho described the damage as massive damage and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
Some of the bodies of the victims were crushed under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the damage and casualties along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Baru could be more severe, in the region of Tangara, which is closer to the quake.
The phone in the city is completely unused, there is no news, said Ngoroh.
The Red Cross said that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that Red Cross staff and volunteers were travelling to the affected area.
"Although this is already a tragedy, the situation could get worse", the Red Cross said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing the public about the tsunami that hit Baru, although officials said the tsunami occurred after the alert was issued.
In a video shared on social media by amateurs, a man on the top floor of the building can be heard screaming madly at the crowd down the street, warning them of the impending beach.
Minutes later, the water walls rushed to the coast, rolling over buildings and vehicles.
Reuters cannot immediately identify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused massive power outages, cutting off communication around Baru, and preventing government authorities from coordinating rescue efforts.
Indonesian authorities said the military had started sending rescue transport aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuation personnel were still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport in Baru is currently only reopened for rescue work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Baru on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800 people.
This is really bad.
Although the staff of the Bangalore World Enlightenment Association have arrived safely in Baru and the employees of Baru have been temporarily placed in the temporary oil tank shelter built in the company's courtyard, the scenes they saw on the way were unbearable, Doseba said.
"They said they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
This is really bad.
Just as the rescue organization began this brutal campaign and started the disaster equipment, some complained that foreign rescue workers with deep expertise were banned from traveling to Baru.
According to Indonesian law, the movement of funds, supplies and personnel overseas will only be allowed when the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
But it has not been announced.
"It is still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says that this is a national disaster, we can go to international relief, but the current situation is not allowed.
On the evening after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, in Baru, the relatives of the missing people still hold a line of hope, hoping their loved ones can create miracles that add color to this tragic natural disaster.
On Saturday, rescuers rescued a young boy from the sewers.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been crushed for two days under the rubble, with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national figure skating team, trained two missing figure skater athletes in preparation for the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month.
The other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, are his students.
As a senior athlete in the field of sliding, I bear the emotional burden of personal responsibility, he said.
Gendon said that within hours of the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread in the skiing community, he was desperate to send a WhatsApp message to his Barrow competitor at the beach party.
However, his message always showed only a grey pair, not a blue pair.
"I think this means that the message has not been successful", he said.
A thief stole $26,750 while gambling at the ATM in Newport on the Levee.
A news report released by the Newport Police Department reported that a Brink employee was stolen $26,750 on Friday morning when he placed a ticket in the ATM at Newport on the Levee.
Dennis McCarthy of the police department reported that the driver of the car had cleared the ATM of the entertainment restaurant and was preparing to go inside.
Just as he was busy, a man ran out of the Brink employee's backyard and stole a bag that should have been put in the ATM.
Witnesses reportedly found several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the case.
Anyone who can provide information about identity theft should call 859-292-3680 and contact the Newport Police.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to "Ye"
The singer Kanye West changed his name to "Ye".
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, specifically: "Kane West, as we all know him before".
West, 41, has been known as "Ye" for some time now, and he also used the name as the title of his eighth album, released in June 2018.
The name change was announced before he was to participate in the Saturday night live show, and he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi Yandhi, in the show.
The show's producer said he took over from singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show due to emotional issues.
In addition to being an abbreviation of West's current professional name, he has said before that the word has religious meaning to him.
West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy: "I believe Ye Ye Ye Ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, meaning Ye Ye Ye in the Bible".
Oh, so I am you, and we are.
I used to use the name "Kanye", which means "the only one", and now it's "Ye", which reflects our good, bad, lost, everything.
This album reflects more about who we are.
Many famous rappers have changed their names.
Sean Combs has used many names, most commonly Puff Daddy (P. Diddy) and Diddy (Duddy), but this year he announced that he prefers Love (Love) and Brother Love (Brother Love) to both names.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has also changed its name, using either unrelated characters or unrelated characters and capital letters.
AMLO Mexico has declared that it will not use force against civilians
President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador reaffirmed that no force will be used against civilians on the 50th anniversary of the upcoming student persecution in Mexico.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use force to suppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, as the leftist student movement was taking root throughout Latin America, Mexican forces opened fire during a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador pledged to provide scholarships and open more free public universities to support the development of Mexico's young generation.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead to teenagers going down the road of crime.
The United States should double its A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in research in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research spending in this field, said investor and AI entrepreneur Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This speech was directed at AI announcements made by various departments of the US government, and the US as a whole lacks a formal AI strategy.
China launched a plan last year: to strive to be the leader of AI innovation by 2030.
"In this area, all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for new breakthroughs in AI, so doubling the AI research budget would be a good starting point", Lee said.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling funding could double the chances of the United States becoming the AI breakthrough again.
Lee's book The Superpower of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published last month by Hackett Publishing. Lee is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in Face++, one of China's most well-known AI companies.
In the 1980s, he created an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University, defeating top-ranked American Athlete Othello, and then became the executive director of the Microsoft Research Institute and president of Google China.
Lee acknowledged previous US government science competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and then asked what competitions would be launched to achieve the next group of dreamers.
Researchers in the United States often have to pay a high fee to get government grants, Lee said.
"China is not taking away our academic leaders, but the corporate ones", Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired outstanding people from universities to work on AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its work on artificial intelligence.
"I think we should give Dr. AI green cards", he said.
The State Council of China released a new generation AI development plan in July 2017.
Lee said that in the United States, American researchers can get funding from the National Science Foundation and other government organizations, and in China, the National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for researchers in academic institutions, but the quality of academic work in China is relatively poor.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to attract partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced that it has invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
Currently, the National Science Foundation invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
In contrast, the US legislative branch, the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has been in the works for months.
A referendum on whether Macedonia should change the name of the country
The Macedonian people held a referendum on Sunday to decide whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve the decades-long dispute between Macedonia and Greece, which had prevented it from joining the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, which retains the name of its northern neighbour, meaning that Greece has a legal right to its territory and has rejected its accession to NATO and the European Union.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new country name, but nationalist opponents believe that changing the name would jeopardize the ethnic identity of the majority of the population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum and that the boycott campaign was questionable whether the vote results would meet the minimum voting rate of 50% that would have made the referendum effective.
The question regarding the referendum vote is: "Do you accept the agreement reached between Greece and NATO and the European Union for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)?"
More prominent supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that Macedonia is one of the countries that derived from the dissolution of Yugoslavia and that seeking to join the EU and institutions such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is worth paying a certain price.
"I am voting today for the future of the country, for the young generation of Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the protection of the EU, because this means that we can all live a safer life", said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska of Skopje.
While not bound by law, enough MPs have said they will resolutely comply with the results of the vote.
But changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said that as of 1 p.m., no wrongdoing reports have been received.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters participated in the vote.
I came to vote for my children, we live in Europe, says Gjose Tanevski, 62, in Skopje, the capital.
On September 30, 2018, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, along with his wife Zorica and son Dushko, cast their respective votes in a referendum on changing the name of the country, which will pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage outside the entrance to the Skopje Parliament and moved his chair to the tent built by those who opposed the referendum.
"Although it is for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU), we want to join with our hearts set on the right path, not through the back door", Kavardarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they do not consider us Macedonians, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, to become members of the AEO integration.
General Zaev said that Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent, will receive the much needed investment as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
I am sure most people will support the referendum, because more than 80% of our people support NATO and the EU, Zhaev said after the vote.
He said the vote for him will determine our future.
Polls released by the Macedonian Institute of Policy last Monday showed that 30% to 43% of voters will participate in the referendum - a figure that is below the required voting rate.
Another poll by Macedonian Telma TV found that 57% of respondents said they planned to participate in Sunday's vote.
Of course, 70% of the population said they would vote in favor.
If the referendum is successful, the voting rate must reach 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum means that the pro-Western government's policies will be hit hard for the first time since taking office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City side Sergio Aguero broke through Brighton's tight defence to score a goal
On Saturday, at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling of Manchester City broke through the defence of Brighton, eventually winning 2-0.
Aquino's goal in the 65th minute looked easy.
At the start of the match, the Argentine forward received the pass in the middle.
He quickly ran past the three defence staff of Brighton and rushed to the open zone.
Aquino then found himself surrounded by four other players.
He launched a defense squad and overtook several defense squads on the edge of the Brighton restricted zone.
Then push the ball to the left and pass it to Stirling.
The England striker used his first touch in the restricted zone to pass the ball back to Aquino, who shot the ball to the right side of the goal with his right foot, beating Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
Juan Aguero has a leg injury, Manchester City head coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about getting him to play 55 or 60 minutes.
He did it.
Fortunately, he scored the goal at that moment.
However, it was Stirling who established the initial advantage for the Sky Blues in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
In that match, Aguero received the ball from behind Brighton.
He passed the ball along the left wing to Leroy Sane with a beautiful straight pass.
After touching the ball several times, Sane led Stirling to the remote pole.
The Sky Blues forward easily put the ball into the net before slipping out of the line.
Manchester City will play against their opponent, Hoffenheim, in the Champions League group stage at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday afternoon at 12:55.
Scherzer wanted to play the game against Los Angeles.
As the national team was eliminated in the playoffs, there is no reason to force them to start again.
Seeger, who was eager to win, hoped to make his debut against the Colorado Angels on Sunday, but assumed the Los Angeles Dodgers were still immersed in the playoff effects, the Los Angeles Dodgers led the National League (NL) West by one point.
On Friday night, the Los Angeles Angels beat the Nationals 5-2, locking at least one outcard number, but they still hope to take the first division title.
"Even if it wasn't for this, at least we could play in Denver, the crowning achievement of the WNBA, and other teams would play at the highest level I would face this year".
How could I not want to participate in the contest?
The national team has not announced the starting lineup for Sunday, but it is reported that in this case they will likely allow Schizer to play.
This will be the 34th start for Schesser, who started training at the bullring on Thursday and will pitch on Sunday, his normal rest.
The right-hander from Washington has 18 wins and 7 losses in 222 2/3 innings this season, a 2.53 defense average, and 300 strikeouts.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican primary in the midterm elections, the president indirectly reflected the situation facing Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court elector he was elected to.
"Everything we do is about the November trend.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
This is important, I am not running, I am running around like this, so that you can choose the best candidate, he said.
Trump continued, "Oh, you see how terrible the Democrats are, and you can see now".
They are determined to use whatever means necessary to take back power, and you can see their filth.
They don't care who they hurt, to take control, to get control, to put who under their feet, it doesn't matter, they only have power and control in their eyes, and we won't give it to them.
The Democratic Party's mission is to fight back and block.
"You've seen this in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats angry, shameful, mean and hypocritical.
He mentioned the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which caused a stir.
Do you remember her answer?
Is this the document you leaked?
Oh, oh, what.
No, oh, no, someone gave me this body language, which is so bad, and it is the worst body language I have ever seen.
Labour is no longer a bigot.
People here are not allowed to speak up.
I was not surprised when activists from the local Momentum party voted against me.
After all, one of my Labour MPs finally found out that we were not popular MPs, but that we were not popular because we expressed our ideas.
My colleague Joan Ryan in parliament was treated similarly because she was firmly against anti-Semitism.
The criticism of my motion was because I was against Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, similar issues have emerged regarding responsible economic policies, national security and European issues, in which Jeremy and his previous leaders have opposed.
In the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, the party said that it hopes the meeting will be inclusive and productive.
For most of the eight years I have been a local Labour MP, this is what the GC meeting on Friday night looked like.
Unfortunately, today, this is no longer the tone of many conferences, and people have long forgotten the political promises of kindness, gentler, and it seems that they have not even started to practice.
Labour cannot tolerate the left-wing view, and all views are judged on whether Labour leaders accept it.
This phenomenon began shortly after Jeremy became Labour leader, and I had thought that my colleagues and I shared the same political views, but they began to expect me to change my views and take a position that I would never agree with, whether it be on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly, what I say is not important, and it is followed by accusations on social media, demanding the cancellation of elections, condemning Chinese politics, or telling me that I am not worthy of joining the Labour Party.
I am not the only one who has experienced this.
In fact, I know that I am lucky compared to some of my colleagues, because my comments are often political.
Many of my colleagues face the usual accusations of flooding every day, either using insulting language that discriminates against gender or speaking in a racist color. But they never shunned it, and I admire their professionalism and determination.
The most disappointing thing about this political era is that insulting language has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant cultural atmosphere.
The fact is that we are no longer a large church with multiple voices, and that, with one another's rhetoric of mistrust and change of the rules of election, Labour has become more narrow.
Over the past two years, I have received many suggestions that urged me to stay calm and not be so outspoken so that I can be more self-sufficient.
But that's not my original intention in politics.
32 years ago, when I was still a student at school, I joined the Labour Party. When our comprehensive school curriculum was basically in shambles due to the negligence of the Thatcher government, I have since done my best, either as a Member of Parliament or as a government minister, to seek better public services for those who need public services most.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East would be surprised by my policy stance and the areas where I disagree with my current leadership.
To those who proposed on Friday, I don't understand that you are wasting time and energy to decry my loyalty to Labour leaders while our country is trying to achieve Brexit, damaging our families, businesses and public services.
In fact, I would like to say a word to my constituents -- whether or not they are members of the Labour Party -- rather than to the Nottingham Momentum: I have the honor to serve you, and I guarantee that no threat to the election or political gain will prevent me from acting in the way that I think is best suited to all your human rights interests.
Chris Leslie is the current Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Al-League 38-17 Power Kmelros: undefeated Al-League wins again
The last two attempts may have influenced the final result to some extent, but there is no doubt that the win in this interesting game is deserved.
They are now in the top spot, the only undefeated team among the ten teams.
In the end, their excellent defense and exceptional opportunities satisfied the home team and coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been through the tough tests of the competition, but so far we have been unbeaten, and I must be happy about that", Mercy said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The honour belongs to the A's, who have taken advantage of the opportunity better than we have.
Grant Anderson temporarily led the AL in the 14th minute attempt and was replaced by Frazier Climo, but the golden medal against Scotland's Roy Hughes in the match against the Warriors gave Melrose the lead in numbers, while Jason Baggot seized the opportunity not to be replaced.
Before the halftime break, Crimo extended the lead of the AL with a point, and after the goal, he got extra points alone to make the score 17-5 after the halftime break.
But Melrose's start to the second half was good, and Patrick Anderson's one-point shot in Bagget reduced the score gap to five points.
After Ruaridh Knott was delayed for a longer period due to serious injury and being carried off the field by the scaffold, the game resumed and the United increased the score again with a shot by Stafford McDowall, who had been replaced by Crimmo.
Following the Yellow Card warning of EI's acting captain Blair Macpherson, Melrose regained the lead in numbers, breaking the huge pressure spell with the unreplaced Bruce Colvine shot.
However, after the home side regained momentum, when Struan Hutchinson was warned by a yellow medal after a goalless kick against Crimson, McPherson scored a touchdown from behind the Albion offensive.
As with the restart, Crimmo was replaced again, with Kyle Rowe taking the lead for the fifth attempt of the home team, after receiving a kick from David Armstrong, and sidekick Gregor Henry.
Still Game is preparing to enter the catering industry
Still Game stars Ford Kieran, who appears to be preparing to enter the hotel industry after being discovered as a director of a registered catering company.
The 56-year-old actor played Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, which he wrote and co-starred with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the show's final season, and Keelan also appears to be planning to follow Craig's lead.
Official records show that Keelan is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a source for the Sun newspaper in Scotland suggested that Kiran wanted to join Craigslist's catering business.
The sea of the Pacific belongs to us: the landlocked country Bolivia wants the court to rule on the resumption of the Pacific route
The sailors searched the well-equipped naval headquarters in Rabas.
On public buildings, a sea blue flag is waving.
From Lake Kakka to the naval base in the Amazon, the words are: "The Yangtze Sea is legally ours".
To take back the sea is our duty.
In Bolivia, surrounded by land, the memory of the coastline falling into Chile's hands remains intact in the bloody resource conflict of the 19th century. Bolivia is eager to head back to the Pacific.
This decades-long hope has reached its peak, as Bolivia finally awaits the International Court of Justice's ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said: "Bolivia is dynamic, the people are focused, and unity and nature can lead to a positive ending".
The International Court will broadcast the entire ruling process live on the big screens across the country, and Bolivians can watch it all. The Hague court hopes that after decades of intermittent negotiations, the Hague court will be able to support Bolivia's claim. Chile is obliged to grant Bolivia a sovereign port of call through negotiations.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charming president, who is a native of the country, will also be interested in Monday's ruling. The question of whether he will run for re-election next year is disputed.
He had announced in late August that we were about to return to the Pacific Ocean.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and that if it does, it will not change anything.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no authority to grant territory to Chile and has issued a rule that it will not determine the possible outcome of negotiations.
Paz Zárate, an international law expert in Chile, said that the final debate hearing had just ended, and the International Court had ruled, indicating that the case was not complicated.
And Bolivia has not pushed this goal in the last four years at all, and may have backed down.
The current Bolivian government has blocked access to the Pacific Ocean, Zarate said.
She said that Morales' provocative remarks had exhausted the goodwill of Chileans.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to engage in dialogue sooner or later, but after that, it will be difficult to continue the dialogue.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
The representative of Bolivia in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, denied the claim that the court's decision was exceptionally quick.
Monday's results will open a new era of relations with Chile and bring an opportunity for the Bolivian government to end 139 years of disagreement and mutual benefit, he said.
For Morales - who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents - to use the maritime issue as a political crutch, Kaldira also denied the claim.
Bolivia will never give up the right to use the Pacific, he added.
The verdict will create opportunities for us to conquer the past history.
North Korea says it will not disarm if it cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Lee Yong-hoon said that if the United States cannot be trusted, North Korea will never disarm.
Lee Yong-yeon delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the pledge made between the leaders of the two countries during the Singapore summit.
Li Yong-yeon's remarks were made more than three months ago when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore to try to restart a deadlocked nuclear diplomacy.
Li Yong-yeon said that trying to force North Korea to kneel down through continued sanctions, even against declaring an end to the war, is a daydream.
Washington will be cautious about the issue of agreeing to a declaration if Pyongyang cannot take a major disarmament action first.
Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump both hope to hold the summit again.
But there is widespread doubt about whether North Korea will really give up its nuclear arsenal, after all, it is highly likely that North Korea will see it as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit North Korea next month to discuss the possibility of another summit of leaders of South Korea and the United States.
Paris Fashion Show brings many new series headlines
If you are hesitating about buying more hats or shading the sun, do not hesitate.
Designers Valentino and Tom Browne unveiled the bizarre super-large SS19 series at the Paris Fashion Week show, which surprised everyone.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with unpractical hats, so the designers brought their own design to T-Series.
Warren's most notable item is a metallic cap with a wide feathered edge that completely covers the heads of the models.
Other oversized ornaments include a jewelled pumpkin hat, witch hat, and even a hood, but the design was not intended for warmth.
To coincide with Halloween, Thom Browne launched a series of bizarre masks.
Many colorful masks with double lips are more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
Some have a similar underwater lung equipment, with breathing tubes and goggles, and some look like melted ice cream.
On your journey to find the fashion metaphor, you will find even more surprising things.
Fashion observers predict that the huge hat may soon be on the fashion street near you.
Rihanna, Emily Ratajkowski's La Bomba straw hat on top of her head is very eye-catching, exaggerated, and the hat is 2 feet wide, and then it becomes a popular decoration for the hands of the bats.
The cult label behind the very unrealistic hat that emerged on social media sent another important creation to the T-Stage - a strawberry sandbag almost as large as the model of a swimsuit. The no-thing-utility hat was widely publicized on social media, and the fashion label behind it brought another big idea to the T-Stage, a strawberry sandbag almost as large as the model of a swimsuit.
This brightly coloured, wine-colored, orange-colored raffie strawbag with white leather handles is the eyepiece of Paris Fashion Week's Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 series.
Famous fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I estimate that next summer, fashion street will have a variety of large hats and sandbags, because designers have made a huge impact, and the demand for supersized accessories cannot be ignored".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland have maintained excellent academic performance, and in 2018 they have achieved a number of satisfactory test scores, while individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community work have been added to the list.
These private schools have gathered over 30,000 students from across Scotland, and under the leadership of the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), they strive to provide the best service to students and parents.
The purpose of the private school is to lay a good foundation for students' continued education and higher education, career choices and social status as global citizens.
As an educational institution capable of designing and implementing customized school curricula, we are fortunate to witness that modern languages have always been a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: "If you talk to each other in a language that others can understand, your words will enter each other's minds".
If you talk to each other in their mother tongue, your words will enter their hearts.
This phrase reminds us that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with foreign friends.
According to the latest results of this year's examinations, the language of private schools has been consistently ranked in the top rate of passing.
68% of students who learn foreign languages have achieved A grade.
Data from 74 member schools of the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS) shows that 72% of students have achieved A grades in Chinese, while 72% of students studying German, 69% of students studying French and 63% of students studying Spanish also achieved A grades.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign language as an important skill that children and adolescents will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, as a subject, language is considered synonymous with STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons employees are working hard to fill vacancies is due to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to lay a good foundation for the future career of teenagers.
As more jobs will need language in the future, this skill has become essential in today's globalized world.
Whatever career you choose, if you learn a second language and master the skills that will benefit you for life, you will have real advantages in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with foreign friends will definitely make those who speak multiple languages the best in the competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults showed that 75% of people were able to use a foreign language well for conversations, and French was the only language hundreds of people used to reach two digits (15%).
Therefore, it is necessary to increase investment in language education for children today.
Mastering multiple languages, especially in developing countries, will provide better opportunities for children to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, the languages taught in each school are different.
Many schools focus on teaching more classical modern languages, while others teach languages they believe will be very important to the UK in 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of what language your child is interested in, private schools offer multiple language options and equip professionals in the field.
Regardless of the future of the child, private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a good learning environment where children can lay a solid foundation and provide them with the skills they need to succeed.
There is no denying that language is still vital to the future of the country in today's globalized business environment and must therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be seen as a skill for international communication.
Private schools in Scotland will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to teenagers.
We have to do this.
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS)
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans are waiting for LeBron James' debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers head coach Luke Walton announced James will play in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it is not yet known when James will appear.
Watton said on the Lakers' official website that the clock will be between 1 minute and 48 minutes.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James' playing time may be limited.
After training ended earlier this week, James was asked about the Lakers' six preseason schedule.
At this stage of my career, I no longer need to warm up to the preseason, he said.
Trump's time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin a series of campaign rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
This is the first of five rallies Trump plans to hold next week, including stays in places he likes, such as Tennessee and West Sibley.
The move, which was intended to win support for the upcoming midterm elections, was delayed because the election to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court had resulted in the Republican losing control of Congress during the November vote.
What time is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. eastern time.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via his YouTube live stream.
Trump is likely to address the issue of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh at a hearing this week, which has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct during the FBI investigation, due to the expected one-week suspension of the Senate vote.
However, the main purpose of these rallies was to help the Republican Party gain support in the November elections.
According to Reuters, President Trump's campaign said the five rallies next week were designed to inspire volunteers and supporters as the Republicans seek to protect and expand their seats in the Senate and House of Representatives.
A spokesman for the Trump campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters that the control of the Congressional floor was critical to its agenda, so the president will travel to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season approaches.
According to West Virginia's The Washington Post, the rally planned for tonight at Wesbanco Arena will bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and will attract a large number of Pittsburgh media outlets to cover the event.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month on Saturday, and in 2016 Trump won the state with more than 40% of the vote.
Trump tried to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who was left behind in the polls.
According to Reuters, political scientist Simon Haeder of West Virginia University said that President Xi had to push the tide in the polls to help him, which was not a good sign for Morris.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA demonstrated a strong and challenging spirit of competition in the singles match on Sunday
After the first three singles matches, Saturday afternoon's four-man one-ball match may be exactly what the Ryder Cup needs.
The dynamic swing is a completely new concept invented by the sports world, and sports players have no doubt about it, especially in such a competition.
Now, where is the momentum?
"They were six points ahead and now they are four points ahead, so I think we have some momentum now", Jordan Spieth said.
Of course, the European team has some advantage, currently leading by 4 points and 12 points in the next match.
As Spitzer said, the Americans felt that they were not doing well, but many aspects were encouraging, especially the performance of Spitzer and Justin Thomas, who played an entire day and scored three out of four points respectively.
Speith was extremely lethal from the pitch to the stump, and he set a benchmark.
As the game progressed, the screams of cheers rose, and in the case of his and Thomas' 2-2 fall, he scored a key kick to tie the fourth game.
His kick won the victory for the U.S. team, and the cheers and applause echoed again on the field, which showed us that they believe the U.S. team did not get out.
Speith said: "Oh, you really need to get into your inner game, the game of mind".
This is the state of all players at the moment.
18 holes to hit.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more than Spitz and Thomas, which is the undisputed situation in the Ryder Cup.
This strange but lovely combination of European teams, with four wins without losing a game, will not make mistakes.
Mollywood were the only team not to play a pair of dice on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the dice on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning after nine innings.
This energy flowing to the crowd and the way they came out of it, made it clear that they were the only ones to beat on Sunday and that there would be no more popular players to steer their European victories.
It is best to be in different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the European team winning.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon set up the morning four-ball hero Sergio Garcia, who was partnered with Alex Noren.
A birdie and two top nine doubles put the Spaniard and the Swedish player in a hole they could never climb out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of the hole.
The four-man four-ball and four-man one-ball tournament is attractive and suitable for close-up viewing because the partners' cooperation, mutual suggestions, reminders and strategies can change instantly.
So far, the European team has performed better and gained a clear lead on the final day, but this four-man match also shows that people, especially people in the United States, do not suspect that the American team is eager to fight.
The European team took a 10-6 lead into the final of the Ryder Cup
After a 10-6 victory over the US team in Saturday's four-man and four-man doubleheader, Europe will enter the final of the Ryder Cup with an absolute advantage.
The intuitive duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead against Tiger Woods, with two wins, up four points from Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team tried to recover the trophy they lost two years ago in the Black Sea, defeating the mistaken American team 3-1 in the morning's four-man match.
The U.S. team fought hard in the four-man doubleheader, winning two games, but it was always unable to make up for the backlog.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in 12 singles matches on Sunday to defend the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to score four points, and he and Mourinho were known as the Tommy Morewood Cup after a booming weekend, becoming the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in the opening four games.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-man quadruple, they teamed up to be a perfect match, eventually beating the disappointing Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by a 5-4 victory.
Woods, who scarcely completed two games on Saturday, has occasionally had flashes of light, but he has now lost 19 of 29 four-man events and four-man events, including seven negative.
Justin Rose, who did not play in the four-man event this morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the four-man event, where they beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who were ranked first and third respectively, 2-1.
Although it is possible to spend a relaxed and pleasant day in the southwest of Paris, the European team is not what they want.
Three-time Grand Slam champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a good foundation for the United States on Saturday with two points.
They took the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2-1 in the four-man event and then came back to beat the Spanish team 4-3 in the two-man event, despite losing the opening two holes.
Only two quarter-finalists in the history of the Ryder Cup have qualified for the singles competition, although the host team, Fuhrer, can only defend the trophy by drawing.
However, as the runner-up in the first two days of the competition, it seems that they will be overtaken in Sunday's counterattack.
North Korea said that without enough trust, it would never be possible to unilaterally disarm.
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepened North Korea's distrust of the United States, and in this case it would be impossible for North Korea to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the World Organization's annual United Nations General Assembly, said North Korea had taken a number of friendly steps over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, demolishing nuclear test sites, and ensuring that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology would not be ramped up.
"However, we have not seen any response from the United States", Li said.
"As long as we lack confidence in the United States, we have no idea about national security, and in this case, we will not be the first bird to unilaterally disarm".
While Lee reiterated his consistent complaint about the North Korean means of denuclearizing Washington during the phase of the boycott (in which case North Korea will be rewarded for taking step-by-step measures), the focus of his statement seems to be that North Korea has not refused to give up unilateral denuclearization like Pyongyang in the past.
Li mentioned the joint statement made by the current US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during their first meeting in Singapore on June 12, during which Kim Jong Un promised to work towards achieving a nuclear-free Kim Jong Un peninsula, while Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls for the easing of tough international sanctions against North Korea.
Li said that the United States insisted on the lead in denuclearization and that the goal was achieved through sanctions and pressure by compulsory means, even opposing the declaration of the end of the war.
Liu believes that sanctions can make us surrender is nothing more than a daydream about people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our distrust of the United States.
Lee did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump, which the US leaders stressed earlier this week.
The Foreign Minister insisted that Kim Jong-un had three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding that if South Korea were on the side of denuclearization instead of the United States, then the denuclearization issue on the Korean Peninsula would not be so deadlocked.
Even so, after President Trump called Kim Jong-un a suicide bomber, Li told the UN General Assembly that North Korean artillery fire would inevitably target the US mainland, but Lee's speech was different from last year.
Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea altogether last year, was greatly appreciated this year for the courage of the UN to take disarmament measures against Kim Jong-un, but he said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must continue until North Korea achieves denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time frame for this, saying it didn't matter if it took two, three or five years.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward the measures taken against Pyongyang.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Wednesday that it is imperative to continue to vigorously implement the sanctions until we achieve final and fully verifiable denuclearization.
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously agreed to strengthen sanctions against North Korea to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile projects.
Pompeo met with Li Yong-yeon on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, saying he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said that if North Korea did not condemn him within hours of making the same demand, then some progress would have been made.
In a meeting with Wen in Xiamen this month, North Korea promised that if the United States took appropriate measures, we would demolish the missile launch site and nuclear complex.
Li said Kim told him that the corresponding measures he was seeking were Trump's promised security assurance in Singapore and the progress in normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students participate in the curriculum to learn how to get enough rest
This year, Harvard University launched a new program to give more sleep to all undergraduates in order to resist the increasingly severe male culture of caffeine consumption at night.
One scholar found that the world's top universities often have no students when it comes to how to take care of their basic problems.
The program was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who believes it is the first program of its kind in the United States.
After publishing a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning, he was inspired to start studying the course.
After the speech, a girl came up to me and asked me: "Why did I get to know this before I got to the fourth grade?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me, and he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, is designed to explain to students how good sleep habits can help them perform academically and athletically and improve their overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry and executive director of the University's Department of Health Services at Harvard Medical School, said that after finding students with severe sleep deprivation, Harvard decided to launch the program this week.
The hour-long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section of the classroom, a picture of a dormitory was shown, students taped coffee cups, curtains, training textbooks and books, listening to the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of sleep deprivation on exercise performance, and the importance of activities before bed.
In another section, students learned how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
In the classroom, a map of the campus was hung with interactive icons that encouraged students to think about their daily activities.
Well, we know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know that smoking is harmful to health", Professor Ceisler added.
He said there is now a phenomenon of pride in going to yoga with all his strength, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation will become an increasing problem.
He said ensuring sufficient sleep and good quality sleep should be a secret weapon for students to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, even to avoid gaining weight, because sleep deprivation would put the brain into a hunger mode, making people feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who specializes in chemistry and physical biology, took a class with Professor Czeisler last year, his first year at Harvard University, and helped design the course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to do everything he could to create a campus curriculum.
Next, he hopes that all graduates will complete similar courses before joining the competing institutions.
Professor Czeisler advises students to consider setting bedtime and wake-up clocks, paying attention to the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting devices, as this could lead to a loss of control of the rhythm of the day and night, which can lead to difficulty sleeping.
Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers: Mong's goal forced Gerard to fall behind
The Rangers were defeated again after Dolly Menga's goal left Steven Gerrard's broken team 1-0 against Livingston.
Ebrooks would record his first home win since a 4-1 win over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team suffered his second loss since Gerald coached 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the Super League leader Harts of Liverpool.
Monka scored a goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the team of the vagrants lacked momentum, which seemed difficult to beat.
Today the Rangers are down to sixth place, while Livingston has risen to third place, with the net winning number only behind Hibernia.
The object thrown at the end of the guest match caused the head injury to the line referee Calum Spence, which could cause further trouble for the nomad.
Geraud changed eight times and led Ayr United to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, also picked 11 Levinson players who took the Hatts last week, and he would be happy if these trained teams could hold their opponents down in every round.
The Rangers may have taken the lead, but Levinson has been exceptionally outstanding in controlling the ball.
They should have scored within two minutes, and Monga passed the ball to Scott Pittman for the first time, passing Alan McGregor to finish the goal, but the midfielder missed a great opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs's one deep passing ball passed to captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow took the lead in the back row.
The Rangers did manage the situation, but for the quarter-final, they seemed to have more faith in their own hopes.
When the game was one minute away, Alfredo Morelos collided with Steven Lawless, who was happy to get a point, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the request of the Colombian player.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Ebrooks goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by the first goal of Lassana Coulibaly and the goal in the middle order of Ovie Ejaria.
While Levenston's 34th minute opening battle may have been unfavorable to the pace of the game, no one denies their difficulty in getting to that result.
The nomads are once again deep in Jacob's elaborate defensive tactics.
When Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield did not react, and Affleck calmly judged that Monaghan would complete a simple shot.
Geraud replaced Ryan Kent with Curly Bailey at halftime, which worked almost immediately, leaving the position of the quarterback Morelos empty, but impressively Kelly blocked him from his own defensive line.
However, Livingston continued to attract the attention of fans in the way they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halcott playing one long pass in succession.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the final stage, but McGregor did well in Jacobs' attack before Leithgo broke the goal from the corner.
Ranger replacement Glenn Middleton applied for a shot again after a dispute with Jacobs, but Thomson was blinded again.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger counter
The following is the contents of the calendar of the year of the year of the year: September 30, 1882, or today, 136 years ago, is calculated... It is the day that the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the development of a device called the Geiger meter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become a mainstay of popular culture, as in the 1950 film Colorado Clock Tower, playing the roots of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who seem unlikely to be scientists:
Man: Oh, what's the point of this?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals like hydrogen.
After wearing the headset, you can even hear the effects of the atomic effects of the radiation released in the mineral.
Evans: I have to shrink, it will be especially popular!
"Hans Geiger died in 1945 just before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention named after him will live on forever.
The new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to detect and detect cancer-free cells
The new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to detect and kill the cancer-free cells.
Vaccines train the immune system to recognize non-nuclear cells and thus be used for treatment
This method requires removing immune cells from the patient's body and then modifying them in the lab.
This allows the liver to detect a protein common to many cancers and then re-inject it into the body.
One trial vaccine has been successful in a variety of cancer patients.
After using this vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize the non-nuclear cells, to treat a woman whose ovarian cancer had disappeared for 18 months.
This method requires removing immune cells from the patient's body and then modifying them in the lab to detect a protein called HER2, a common form of cancer, and then injecting it back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results of our trials show that we are about to introduce a very promising vaccine.
Professor Berzofsky explained that HER2 is a contributing factor to the development of several cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer.
Removing immune cells from the patient's body and training them to locate cancer cells using a similar method has been shown to be effective in treating leukemia.
Kanye West, who previously wore the MAGA hat for SNL, faced outrage for supporting Trump.
The result was not good.
In the studio of Saturday Night Live, Kanye West was met with a buzz during a public speech praising US President Donald Trump and saying he should be part of the 2020 election.
After performing Ghost Town's third song that night in the Make America Great hat, he began to speak out against the Republicans and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"I've had conversations with white people many times, and they've all said, 'How can you like Trump, because he's racially discriminated against?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I wouldn't have moved out of the United States long ago, West said.
SNL opened with a humorous short starring Matt Damon, in which Hollywood stars mocked Brett Kavanaugh for testimony he provided before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegations.
Although the show was not broadcast, Weston's footage was shared on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is difficult to determine whether Lock released the video to mock West.
Meanwhile, West complained to the audience that he had a difficult time in the background wearing a hat.
According to the Washington Observer, he said that they bullied me in the background.
They said, "Go out with that hat".
They bullied me!
Then they said I was in trouble.
"Hey, do you want to know what a dilemma is?" continued West. "He said that would put on my superhuman cloak, because that means you won't be able to tell me how to do it. Do you want the world to move forward?"
Try to make love.
According to Variety, his comments have caused the audience to gossip at least twice, and the SNL cast seems to feel embarrassed, one of whom told the newspaper reporter: "The whole studio is in a dead silence".
West was invited to perform as the newest replacement for singer Ariana Grande, and Grand's ex-boyfriend and rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West dressed as Perrier Bottle and sang the song "I love It" which confused many.
West received the support of Candace Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA, who tweeted: "To the most fearless of people: Thank you for your courageous resistance to the mob".
But talk show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just brave enough to do it himself, which is just a stroke of luck.
But I will not reward those who buy his music, dress or support his martial arts kit, who I believe are accepting and spreading ideology that is harmful to our community.
He is free.
We are also a motherfucker, Hunter added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and declared that he was now officially Kanye West.
He is not the first actor to change his name, and Diddy (also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy or P Diddy) has changed his name before.
Snoop Dogg, who used the name Snoop Lion for the rapper, and of course Prince, the late musical genius, who changed his name to a symbol, before the artist was known as Prince.
A case of intentional knife killing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with manslaughter on Friday in a restaurant in east Belfast with a knife wound.
Police said the location was the Ballyhackamore restaurant.
The accused is expected to appear in court on Monday for questioning in Belfast District Court.
The public prosecutor's office will review the allegations.
The game of power-hunting stars Kit Harington fiercely attacked the toxic masculinity of the monkey.
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's medieval drama series Power of the Game, and for being the sword-wielding hero of the series.
Kit, 31, has been fiercely critical of the stereotypical hard-core heroism of his character, saying that the role on screen means that young people always feel that they have to be cool to be respected.
Kit said in a Sunday Times column about culture that he believed the issue had been raised and asked how to solve the #MeToo problem.
Kit recently married Rose Leslie, who recently starred in the game show Power of Two. Kit admits that he has a very strong sense of power and needs to address this issue.
"At this moment, I personally have a very strong feeling, where is the problem with our masculinity?" he said.
What have we been teaching our children as they grow up, from the question we recognize now?
Kit believes that the toxic nature of the son-in-law is so prevalent that television may be responsible for the main reason, because the personality displayed on television is very masculine.
He continued to explain: "What are the ones that are born and what are the ones that are learned after the day?"
What is shown on TV and on the streets that makes these young people feel that they should not be acting like this and that they should be considered men?
I think this is indeed one of the most serious problems of our time, and how can we change this?
Because young people have obvious problems.
In the interview, he also acknowledged that the game of power of the season will kill the game of the year next summer, after which he will no longer be appearing in any prequel or sequel, saying that he was tired of the battlefield and the battle horse.
Starting in November, Kit will be appearing in the remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother who is a bandit.
Kit recently revealed that he feels that playing the role of a powerhouse is a game of chance, and the happiest thing is meeting his wife Rose.
"I met my wife in this TV series, and so I gave my family after me, and my life now", he said.
In the game of thrones, Rose plays Ygritte, the lover of Jon Snow's character Kit. The game of thrones won the Emmy Award for Best Drama Series in the drama category.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
AIDS: China's new HIV cases increased by 14%
China announced a 14% increase in the number of people with AIDS.
The China Defense and Control Commission reports that China has more than 820,000 people infected with HIV.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new patients were reported.
The vast majority of new infections are transmitted through sexual behavior, which is a historic change.
In the past, the main way to spread HIV rapidly in parts of China was through the transmission of infected blood.
The National Health and Safety Commission of China told a meeting in Yunnan province that the number of people infected with HIV by this method will be almost zero.
But at the same time, China's HIV infection rate increased by 100,000 people last year compared to last year.
For LGBT people in China, the transmission of HIV through sexual behavior has become a serious problem.
China legalized homosexuality in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people remains prevalent.
China's values are relatively conservative, and studies estimate that 70-90% of men have sex with men, with women being the ultimate target of marriage.
Many diseases spread due to the lack of neutral protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to the spread of AIDS drugs to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking information from Republican senators, sparking dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters condemned the publication of personal information about three Republican U.S. senators against members of the House on the lawmaker's Wikipedia page.
Maxine Waters (Democrat from Los Angeles) said the statement drew criticism from far-right pundits and the website.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter that lies, lies, are all vile lies.
The information reportedly released included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday from the Capitol Hill, where the publisher accused Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, of sexual misconduct, while an unknown attendee of a Senate panel hearing was held.
The information was leaked some time after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
According to Hill, reports from conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have confirmed that the IP address of the information-releasing device is related to Waters' office and that information from one of Waters' employees has been released.
Waters continued: "The claim of the shark is simply nonsense, a complete lie, an absolute lie".
The fact that the staff under my control were definitely not the ones who leaked the information is a lie, but it damages their identity, personal information and security.
This statement is simply nonsense, a complete lie, an absolute lie.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism from netizens, including former White House press spokesman Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote: "Her words of denial were filled with anger.
This shows that her temper is not suitable for being a member of parliament.
The most important thing to do when someone else is accused and you are unjust is to be angry.
No one is in the picture.
The motives of the accused should not be questioned.
It must be calm and quiet.
Fleischer appears to be comparing Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who appeared to be overly angry at the hearing Thursday, accused by critics.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who will replace Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
He tweeted that if that is the case, it would not be so exaggerated.
Waters said in a statement that her office had reminded her that the allegations were fraudulent and that the authorities and law enforcement agencies concerned were being held responsible for the allegations.
She continued, "We want to make sure that the culprits are found and that they are held accountable for their actions, which have had a devastating impact on me and the employees under my control".
The East Mountain of Soybean Agents 3 is back in the making: Rowan Aykinson is again shaping a funny spy image
The current films reflect some of the British Brexit implications, tending to the British position. The same is true of the English action comedy-drama film series The Bean Agent. The first The Bean Agent was released in 2003 and the second in 2011.
This joking irony is that there is no new export opportunity, and ironically, how unworthy are we?
In any case, Johnny English, who stared at the big guy, without any ability to express himself, was again allowed to mess things up. His name is more expressive, and it is precisely what the creator of this well-known comedy character, aimed at non-English viewers.
Despite his uncanny desire to dress up as a gentleman, his charm and his uncanny secret agent image, he made it clear that Kruso, the bean, and the guy who played the opening theme song of the 2012 London Olympics, Chariots of Fire, were not the only ones who could escape the stupidity of the secret agent.
Originally, he was the tourist and international mysterious man Eckinson in the Barclays TV commercials, always making a mess of things, although these ads have been forgotten in the back of the mind.
In this soya bean agent's diary, there are two bright spots when the Englishman comes out.
I like Johnny English, who was wearing medieval armor and approaching a helicopter, and who was turning a leaflet and hitting his helmet, making a ton of noise.
Eckinson's talent for action comedy is evident, but his sense of humor is quite insufficient, strange, and strong, especially for serious film brands like 007X and Zheng Zheng, which are now confidently integrated into the comedy component.
This sense of humor is aimed at children rather than adults. I personally feel that Johnny English lacks creativity and cohesion in all the bizarre outdoor events compared to the jokes made by Eakinson in the silent film.
Now the theme is the main melody of the year with the UK in serious difficulty.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the UK's super secret spy network, exposing the identities of all British agents, which caused a minor character played by the gang agent Kevin Eldon to get his mind torn.
The Prime Minister's role in the film is exaggerated, problematic, politically unpopular: Emma Thompson tried her best to portray the characteristic of Theresa May from the outside, but there is no word in the film.
Her intelligence advisor told her that all active spies had revealed their identities and that only one person could be identified from the retired agents to take over.
The only option was Johnny English, a handsome, hard-working man who has now changed his ways and is now the headmaster of a luxury institution, but who teaches privately how to become a undercover agent: the baggage here is new, because England opened a rock campus-style spy academy.
English was quickly taken back to the White House, attended an emergency conference, and reunited with his longtime friend, Bough, who was playing Ben Miller.
Now that he's a household name, he's wasting a little time on Vicki Pepperdine. Now that he's a married man and his wife is a submarine commander, the role is somewhat popular and Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a submissive.
Thus, Batman and Robin, who made a big mistake in Her Majesty's Secret Service, returned, and then they again beat the snake-beating Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the British Prime Minister is alarmed by the intrigue of the intriguing Jason Volta, played by the charming tech billionaire Jake Lacy.
The Englishmen and cowards embarked on their hilarious revelry journey: they disguised themselves as waiters and set fire to a gold-plated French restaurant; they fabricated a chaotic suicide on a luxury yacht in Volta; the Englishmen provoked a purely anarchist state while familiar with the interior of the Volta house using virtual reality headphones.
All the suspense was finally unleashed, so harmonious, so hot, but overall, it stayed only at the level of low-key children's plays.
The overall assessment is not quite the same.
Like the other two "Agent of the Peony" films, I couldn't help but wonder: Can the British film industry give Rowan Aykinson a role that suits him?
Labour denies that it has not developed a plan to keep wages at a minimum in Britain
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider implementing a radical plan that British people work four days a week but pay no less.
Labour reportedly wants companies to use the savings from AI to provide more than one day's rest for workers.
This allows employees to enjoy a three-day weekend a week while keeping the salary they bring home unchanged.
Sources said the idea was in line with the Labour Party's economic agenda and that the plan would be to lean towards British workers.
The four-day workday programme was supported by the British Trade Union Union Congress (TUC) so that workers could benefit from the economic transformation.
A senior Labour party source wanted to inform the Sunday Times that Liu expected to publish the results of the policy review before the end of the year.
This move is not possible at once, but the work system is in line with the Labour Party's objective of leaning towards workers' interests and the Labour Party's overall industrial strategy.
Labour is not the first party to support this idea, and the Green Party pledged to introduce a four-hour work schedule during the 2017 general election.
However, this plan has not yet been supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour Party discoverer said that the working system for the Four Hours of Le Mans is not a party policy and Labour has not yet considered it.
Shadow Minister John McDonnell, at last week's Labour Party meeting, specifically presented his views on the socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power from the hands of the unseen director and the fraudsters in the utilities.
McDonnell's plan also meant that existing shareholders in the water company might not be able to recover all of their shares, as the Labour government could deduct the tax on its shares for immoral conduct.
He also confirmed that plans to support workers as board members of the company and create inclusive ownership funds were in place, "giving 10% of the private company's equity to employees so that employees can draw up to £500 in annual dividends from them".
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy openly commented on whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh would affect their decision.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh forced the final vote on the nomination of the Supreme Court to be postponed by at least a week, while raising the question of whether the FBI's findings would shake Republican senators' support for Brett Kavanaugh.
In a 60-minute interview broadcast on Sunday, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican MPs John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI's investigation would affect their decision.
Kennedy Biggresham (from South Carolina) is more open about the idea.
"Of course", Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to the hearing, and I said I already talked to Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were filed and asked him, "Have you done anything?"
He is decisive, firm, clear.
Graham's vote, however, seems to have been pinned to the board.
I've got the idea for the vote for Brett Kavanaugh, and I won't change my mind even if it's a crime of poisoning fire, he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what the truth is, but what I know is that Brett insists he didn't do the filtering, Graham added. Dr. Ford in the speech refers to Christine Blasey Ford.
And everyone who said what she said could not verify whether what she said was true.
It's been 36 years.
Nothing can change.
What is the Global Citizen Music Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Music Festival, an annual music festival with a very impressive star cast and equally impressive mission: eradicate world poverty.
This year, the 17th Global Citizen Music Festival will draw thousands of people to the Grand Lawn of Central Park to appreciate performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, among others, and raise awareness of the true purpose of the event, which is to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
Established in 2012, the Global Citizen Music Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Alleviation Project, an international advocacy organization that aims to eliminate poverty by actively increasing the number of people who fight poverty.
To get free tickets to events (unless you want to pay for VIP tickets), viewers must complete a series of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling or helping people raise awareness of their goal of poverty alleviation in any other meaningful way.
But, with only 12 years left to achieve the goal, will Global Citizen succeed?
Is it possible to persuade people to act with a free concert as a reward, or just another saying that people feel they really have a role to play by signing online petitions or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million actions from supporters to help achieve many different goals.
Global Citizen said these actions have helped to promote the release of pledges and policies by world leaders worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the organization recognized 390 commitments and announcements in its operations, of which at least $10 billion has been paid or raised.
The organization expects that the funds raised so far will have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between UK investors and implementers dedicated to helping children reach their full potential and pledging $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world.
At a concert in London in April 2018, Ambassador Tacey Ullman, at The Power of Nutrition, told the audience that with the support of the UK government, donors, governments and many global citizens like you, the phenomenon of malnutrition and social inequality is about to become a landmark in history.
The organisation also said that after taking action on more than 5,000 calls for the UK government to improve the nutritional status of mothers and children, the government announced the establishment of The Power of Nutrition, a project that will intervene in nutrition for 5 million women and children.
To answer a common question on the website: What do you think we can do to eliminate extreme poverty?
Global Citizen responded: "Well, it's going to be a long and difficult road - sometimes we even fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that are before us, we will certainly succeed because we will be stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe will be the guest performers at the music festival, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The interior minister said the US will move the Navy to carry out a blockade of the pipeline to block Russian energy exports
According to the Washington Observer, Ryan Zinke, US Home Secretary, revealed that Washington could move its navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy shocks on markets including the Middle East.
Zinckey claimed that Russia's activities in Syria - especially those conducted at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian government - were but a token of exploring the new energy market.
Zinckey reportedly said: "I think Russia is meddling in the Middle East because they want to repeat the way it has done in Eastern Europe, acting as an energy agent in the southern hemisphere of Europe".
According to the official, there are many ways and means to solve this problem.
He said that the United States has the ability, together with our Navy, to ensure the passage of maritime routes and, if necessary, blockade to ensure that Russian energy cannot enter the market.
Zinckey was speaking at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that claims to be a spokesperson for U.S. fossil fuel consumers.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that the two are actually the same.
He said that Iran and Russia's economic choices were more or less to use and replace fuel tanks, and that Russia was a black horse that relied on fossil fuels economically.
The above statement is due to the Trump administration's commitment to promote liquefied natural gas exports to Europe in exchange for Russia's position as a cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the timeless Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin a monopoly market for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline is a purely economic project, aimed at doubling the existing pipeline capacity to 11 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's strong opposition to the project was entirely economic and unfair competition.
In September, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow that "I believe we all agree that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and consumers should have the right to choose their suppliers".
The US position was strongly opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the German Industrial Confederation (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, chairman of the German Industrial Confederation (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, said that if third countries interfere with our energy supply, we will face great problems.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider the 2020 presidential election.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would take seriously the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During her tenure at Holyoke Town Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
Warren said it was time for women to move into Washington politics, which requires a top female leader, according to the Congressional Hill report.
After November 6, I will seriously consider the presidential election.
Referring to President Donald Trump during his term in office, Warren said he was leading our country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about Donald Trump's measures against democracy", Warren said.
Warren was outspoken in his accusations against Trump and his nominated Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that of course we need the FBI to investigate before the vote.
However, the results of the poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own constituents believe she should not participate in the 2020 general election.
According to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58 percent of likely Massachusetts voters said senators should not run.
32% of voters supported her candidacy.
Polls showed that the majority of voters supported the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% voting in favor of his candidacy and 48% voting against his candidacy.
Other high-profile Democrats who may be running for president in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide whether to run in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin shouted out at the presidential rally for Track Palin, who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder
Track Palin, 26, enlisted in the Army in September and spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
She felt the same way her son felt, the same way he felt after returning, believing that other soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder or the families of wounded soldiers could feel the same way, she told the audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an elephant in the room (a fact that was obviously overlooked) and said that people changed after her son and other veterans returned, and they wondered if they were being treated equally as soldiers, pilots, and all other members of the military, respecting their homeland in the same way.
According to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and carrying weapons against a woman after being drunk.
The United States challenges the new asylum policy, and 18 states and the District of Columbia are supporting it
18 states and the District of Columbia supported a legal challenge to a new policy that refused to provide shelter to victims of gang or domestic violence fleeing the country.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia submitted a court-friendly briefing to Washington on Friday in support of a person seeking asylum challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been disclosed in the lawsuit against federal policy filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August - Grace v. Sessions.
Grace said she was abused by her partner Liu and her son, a member of the violent gang, but on July 20, U.S. officials rejected her asylum application.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace said that countries like El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala face widespread gang and domestic violence, which has produced a large number of people applying for U.S. asylum.
The new asylum policy in the United States overturns the decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals in 2014 to allow illegal immigrants to seek asylum from domestic violence.
In a statement Friday, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy ignores the state, federal and international legal challenges that have existed for decades.
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided based on the specific facts and circumstances of the application, which violates the above principles, the court's friend brief said.
In the brief, lawyers further argued that the policy of refusing immigrants to enter the country damages the economy of the United States, and that people are more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labor force.
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence fleeing.
Sessions announced the policy on June 11 saying that asylum could be granted to people who are persecuted or fearful of leaving their country because of their race, religion, nationality or political views because of their membership in a social group or political views.
Asylum is never about alleviating all the problems facing people all over the world every day, even all the serious problems.
With the death toll doubling, desperate rescue workers in Baru are fighting for seconds to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
The mother, Risa Kusuma, 35, said she was soothing her son with fever in an evacuation center in the severely damaged city of Baru.
The ambulance will bring the bodies every minute.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Residents returned to their destroyed homes, searching for items that were submerged in water, trying to rescue anything they could find.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake injured hundreds of people and destroyed and flooded the hospital.
Some of the injured, including the back and shoulder wounded, Twi Haris, rested outside the Palau Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the ongoing tremors.
Harris's tears filled with tears, remembering the tremor of the earthquake in the fifth floor of the hotel where he lived with his wife and daughter.
"We don't have time to save ourselves at all.
I think I was stuck in the ruins of the wall, Harris told Associated Press, adding that their entire family was in town for the wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, but there was no voice afterwards.
I don't know what my wife and children are like.
I hope they are safe.
The US ambassador to China accused China of bullying in political propaganda ads.
A week ago, a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper, boasting of the reciprocal benefits of China-US trade, and the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US media to carry out political propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned that Xi'an published a paid increase in the Daily Mail in the Huang Mai Times, Iowa's largest selling newspaper, accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections held on November 6, but China later denied the accusation.
Trump accused Beijing of trying to interfere in the US election, marking a new stage in the situation, which US officials told Reuters, and Washington's pressure on China is increasing.
Although it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a escalating trade war, with several rounds of tariffs imposed on each other's imported products.
Chinese-American experts said that at the beginning of the trade war, China's retaliatory tariffs were aimed at targeting Republican exporters who supported Trump in states like Iowa.
U.S. Ambassador to China, former longtime governor of Iowa, and China's top exporter of agricultural products, Terry Branstad, said Beijing's move hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
In a commentary article published in Sunday's Zhongshui Daily, Blanstad wrote that China is increasing its bullying by publishing political propaganda ads in our own free media.
In political propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and press freedom, and publishes paid advertising in the front page of the Maine Chronicle, Blanchard wrote.
In contrast, you rarely see the voice of opposition on the bookstands in Beijing's streets, nor can you see the true reflection of the Chinese people's disagreements about China's worrying economic development trajectory, because the media is under strict surveillance by the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that China's most famous newspapers even refused to publish his articles, but he did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republican women voters who leave before midterm will lead to Kavanaugh's defeat.
For Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, several Republican leaders have insisted on supporting and defending, and analysts warn that they will face strong opposition, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The mood that this incident sparked was so high that most Republicans on record have already indicated that they want to get the ballot.
In an article published on Saturday, Professor Grant Reeher of the University of Syracuse's Masseville School told the Congressional Hill Times that there is no way around this.
Riley said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, will be able to calm the anger of voters by working urgently to get the FBI to investigate.
Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for MoveOn, Progress, said Friday that women will never forget what happened in the past - tomorrow cannot forget, and the entire month of November cannot forget.
Despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to continue supporting Kavanaugh's nomination, leading to a march along the Senate corridor on Friday morning, with protesters chanting "Hello November!"
Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news website that the zeal and motivation for democracy is about to be reinforced.
The people of the country say that the enthusiasm is already very high; that is not true.
But enthusiasm can be even higher, especially among women voters and young voters in suburban areas, who usually don't vote when they don't like the president.
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidates, analysts warned that strong opposition would be sparked if the Republican continued to hold the vote.
According to NBC News, former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele said that this would cause chaos for the GOP.
Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, an organization that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel that it was not just about the vote or final vote of the committee, or whether Kavanaugh would be placed in a replacement seat, but also about how the Republicans handled the issue and how they treated the victims.
However, as the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh has emerged, there seems to be some disagreement among the American public about who should be believed, with a slight bias towards the latter.
The latest YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents clearly or likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35% of respondents said they clearly or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents said they believe that Kavanaugh's testimony may or may not have been false, while only 30% said they believe Ford's testimony may or may not have been false.
According to The Guardian, under Freck's direction, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made against Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in oath testimony that Kavanaugh raped her after she was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court nominee of exposing her genitals at a party in the 1980s while they were attending Yale University.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to pioneer a new Internet that is comparable to Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, recently launched a startup that tries to match Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project in the tech field, Inrupt, is a company built on the basis of the open source platform Solid by Bernas-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which information to allow access to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was for the company to rule the world.
Speaking about the startup, he said that we must act immediately.
Now is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to allow users to create their own personal online data storage pads or PODs.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, libraries and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, it can be used on the same browser at the same time.
The unique feature of personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to users to decide which people can access which information.
The company calls this feature "data empowerment".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the intention of Inrupt is to help the company bring in resources, processes and appropriate skills so that everyone can use Solid.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a number of contracts dedicated to the project's dedicated developers, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will use tools available on the Inrupt website to create their own decentralized applications.
Bernas-Lee said he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether to make a radical change in all their business models overnight.

Bernard Vann: Commemorate the recipients of the Victoria Cross of the First World War
During World War I, the only clergyman in the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross for his actions, a 100 year celebration ceremony was held in his hometown.
Lt. Bernard Vann, Rev. was awarded the Medal of Honor at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
Unfortunately, four days later he was killed by a sniper, so no one knew he had won Britain's highest military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled the memorial during a parade of the squadron in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
His grandson Michael Vann said the monument was a symbol of the monarchy, commemorating the 100th anniversary of his grandfather's medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led the army, taking the fog and crossing the Canal de Saint-Quentin in the rain of cannon and machine guns.
He then rushed to the front line, bravely leading the front line fighters into the trenches, and then fired a single shot with a field gun, defeating three sub-groups.
On October 4, 1918, more than a month before the war ended, Colt Vann was shot by a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his actions were, "I know that my grandfather's bravery will never be compared to mine, but it will keep me humble".
The march was led by the Brentwood Empire Youth Band. After the march, Michael Vann and his brother Dr. James Vann donated the flower circle.
Michael Vann said he was honored to be part of the parade, adding that the true heroes of the parade can be seen from the support given by everyone.
The show Bellator 206 that MMA fans waited all night for became the Pig Pig Page.
Imagine that you are awake all night waiting to watch Bellator 206 but you are told that you cannot watch the main event.
San Jose has 13 matches, including six main events. UK Channel 5 broadcasts the match live overnight.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for the match, the channel content was changed to make Pig Pig Page's cake, and the British audience was shocked.
Some people were awake for a night and waited until dawn, especially to watch the boxing match, but they fell out of their glasses.
On Twitter, a fan said that turning the show into an animated film was a joke that would make people feel bad.
When asked about the program's broadcast, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said that the Chinese government had stipulated that such programs should not be broadcast at 6 a.m. and that the TV station was forced to switch to children's programs.
The piglet Page, the piglet, the piglet.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that the UK audience would be included as much as possible in future arrangements.
"I think we can solve this problem when we consider rebroadcasting", Coker said.
It was Sunday morning at 6am in England, but we could only wait until Sunday when we were here to play again, which was Monday in England.
However, we are still trying to figure out how to do it.
Believe me, after the show changed, I got a lot of information and it was all unfriendly content.
We were trying to solve this problem, and we thought it was a technical failure.
But it's not, it's a matter of government regulation.
I can assure you that this will not happen next time.
We controlled for five games instead of six, and usually we all played five, and we wanted to give fans more enjoyment, but it was too long.
The situation is embarrassing.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley is self-absorbed for his causal orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley said that he felt humble from childhood because of his sexual orientation, but that was also the motivation for his success.
The 24-year-old said that after high school, he realized that not everyone is as smart as I am.
In the Channel 4 talk show Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others hope.
He also explained that after having children, he was less concerned with the issue of winning the Olympic title.
Kirsty Young, regular host of the regular youth program, has been on leave for months due to illness.
As Laverne's first host, Dale said that as he grew up, he felt inferior to others because the gay community did not accept the interaction between boys and girls.
He said: "Until today, I still feel really, really, really, really, lowly, feeling like an alternative, but that also gives me the strength to succeed".
He said he wanted to prove that his mother was a mother, so that people would not be disappointed when they knew their sexual orientation.
Daley, a two-time Olympic bronze medalist, is now a well-known LGBT activist and has appeared at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, calling for more countries to legalize homosexuality.
He said that he dared to speak up because he felt lucky to live openly without any consequences and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that he met American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black in 2013 and was shocked when he found out he was in love with this man.
Last year, Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner, who said age gap was never an issue.
Daley first participated in the Olympics when he was 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer. He said: "At such a young age, you have experienced so much, and it is difficult to find people of similar age who have similar ups and downs".
The couple had their son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, in June. After that, Dale's overall view changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would say 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
But you know, there is something more important than the Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
He took a name for his son that was the same as his father Robert, in memory of his father who died of brain cancer in 2011 (aged 40).
Daley said his father did not believe he would die, and his last question was whether he would get tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't say to him, 'Dad, you can't sit in the front row,'" he said.
"When he stopped breathing, I was holding his hand, and in fact, until he stopped breathing and was dead, I admitted that he would never be unconscious", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was my dream of a lifetime, and I never felt better than this, diving in front of the home crowd during the Olympics", he said.
And it's because of this that Proud by Heather Small became his favorite song, and he fell in love with it during the preparation for the Olympics. Now, hearing the song, he will also be one of the vibrators.
Desert Island Discs airs Sunday at 11:15 (BST) and is broadcast on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson, who felt bad about the ball, was replaced at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American player Phil Mickelson will set a record in his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he must adjust his condition to avoid playing negative milestones.
Mickelson, who took part in the biennial event for the 12th time, was replaced by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-man and four-man doubles.
The five-time Grand Slam champion not only did not become a force to be reckoned with in the United States, but spent the day at Larra and on the training ground hoping to correct his problems and return to the field as soon as possible.
Even at the peak of his career, the French National Golf Course (Le Golf National) with the steepest golf club and tense atmosphere is not suitable for the 48-year-old, where high and low rough routes increase the difficulty of shooting off track.
If the course itself is not prestigious enough, Mickelson will take the victory from the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, who has already won their entire game this Thursday against the defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday.
If the Americans start 12 singles games with a quarter-final loss, Mickelson's game will be crucial for a good start.
Forrick said he had confidence in his teammates, but he had nothing else to say.
"He understood the role he played today, and he slapped me on the back and hugged me with his arm, saying he would be ready tomorrow", Furich said.
He is very confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Famer, and has made a huge contribution to the team in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I wish he played more games, but the result is that, and I have to accept it.
Like everyone else, he wanted to make a big impression on the pitch.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup appearances.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, but his personal record has never reached this high.
Mickelson had a record of 18 wins, 20 draws and 7 losses, although Furrick said his appearance brought some invisible strength to the team.
He was funny, sour, and funny, and he liked to make fun of others, and he was a great guy in the team, he explained.
I think young players like to play him, and this week will be fun.
In addition to the competition, he brought us a lot of money.
European captain Thomas Bjorn realized that the lead position in the big game was about to be broken.
Thomas Bjorn, captain from Europe, judges from experience that it is easy to create an unfavorable situation by leading the lead with a large margin to the single-elimination final of the Ryder Cup.
Dane made his debut in the Valderrama in 1997, when the captain's side, the Seven Ballesteros, led the American team by five points, but ended up with only 141⁄2-131⁄2 victories with a very weak advantage.
After watching the 2018 games held at Le Golf National on Friday and yesterday (5-3 wins and ultimately a 10-6 lead), Bion described how you should always remind yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama and Brooklyn; although we lost at Brooklyn, we got a win at Valderrama.
History will tell me and every member of the team that it is not over.
You must do everything you can before tomorrow arrives.
Go out and do the right thing.
It wasn't over until the score was on the scoreboard.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that is also the focus of our attention.
I've always said that I'm focused on the 12 players on our team, but we are very clear about what we are about to face - the strongest player in the world.
Beyon was pleased with the players' tough competition on the golf course, adding: "Well, in this regard, I can never beat myself.
Tomorrow is another evil battle.
Tomorrow is a self-deprecating personal performance, somewhat different from the usual.
It would be great if the game went well and you fought alongside your teammates, but if you fought alone as a golfer, your overall ability will be tested.
This is the message you need to make clear to the team members, so that tomorrow they can reach their full potential.
Now, you have to leave your partner, and your partner has to leave you, each to the fullest of his or her ability.
Unlike Beyonce, Jim Furyk expected the team's individual performance to surpass that of their teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points in the quarter.
As the European team struggled to achieve the Miracle at Medinah, which ended in defeat, as part of the Brooklyn winning team, Furick was already on both ends of the final turning point, and victory was possible.
When asked how Ben Crenshaw (then captain in 1999) encouraged his teammates to take the final, he replied, "I remember every damn word".
Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you can imagine the lead-offs of Valderrama and Brooklyn.
If everyone goes in the same direction, it will put a lot of pressure on the midfield.
So our lineup has been adjusted accordingly to show up in a way that is favorable to us, and everyone knows that we are working hard to create a miracle tomorrow.
Thomas will lead the team in the counter-attack, and will play against Rory McIlroy in the final, and European players like Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the semi-final.
Speaking of singles, Bijon said that the order in which I deployed players was a decision made after considering all aspects.
The new German battleship was postponed again
According to local media reports, the German Navy's latest battleship should have been moderated in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era battleship, but due to system failures and the increase in cost, we cannot see the debut of the battleship until next year.
According to Die Zeit newspaper, a military spokesman said that the task of debriefing the new Baden-Württemberg-class patrol vessel, the Lange-Land-Pfalz, has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The frigate was supposed to enter service with the Navy in 2014, but headache-inducing post-production issues have consistently plagued the fate of the minework.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class frigates recalled by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Baden-Württemberg-class frigates.
It is understood that the frigate will have powerful firepower, a large number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signals reduction.
Other important features include a longer maintenance cycle - deployment of the latest patrol vessels for up to two years away from the port of origin.
However, the continuous extension means that the most advanced warships - which are said to enable Germany to deploy forces overseas - will be outdated by the time they enter service.
When the German Navy formally refused to de-escalate the frigate last year and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, the fateful F125 frigate was already in the news.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the withdrawal, but German media cited some critical software and hardware flaws, saying that these flaws would render the warship useless in carrying out operational missions.
The software defect will be particularly fatal as the Baden-Württemberg class frigates will be manned by 120 crew members and will only require half the manpower of the old Baden-Württemberg class frigates.
Likewise, it was revealed that the frigate was heavily overweight, which would reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tonne weight of the Rheinland-Pfalz was said to be twice the weight of the equivalent class of patrol vessels used by Germany during WW2.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the entire project - including training the crew - has also become a headache issue.
The spending is said to have reached a staggering 3.13 billion euros ($3.6 billion) while the initial budget was only 2.2 billion euros.
Given recent warnings about the shrinking German naval strength, the problem with the latest battleship has become more serious.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the German Navy had no actual ships to deploy.
The official said that the problem is getting more serious over time, and old ships are being phased out of service, but there are no new ships to replace them.
He lamented that no Baden-Württemberg-class frigate could serve the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study is underway at a manor in the Scottish Highlands, which aims to reveal how bats use the land to feed.
The research hopes that this discovery will uncover the behavior of this unique flying mammal and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will track the common wing and high-pitched wing, as well as the brown long-eared bat and Daubenton bat, at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
They will install special recorders in some key locations around the garden to track the bat's activities for four seasons.
NHS staff and volunteers will use handheld detectors to conduct a flow survey.
Professional sound analysis of all the recordings was then done to determine the frequency of bat calls and what activity the bat is performing.
The habitat maps and reports were then produced to produce detailed real-world images of bat behaviour.
Rob Dewar, natural protection adviser to the NHS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat is critical for bats and how each bat uses these habitat.
This information will help to judge the interests of habitat management, such as the latrine laying and how to best maintain the habitat of bats and other related species.
But over the past century, the number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly.
Construction and development work poses a huge threat to bats, affecting their habitat and even causing them to lose their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting, the chemical processing of paper and some building materials, and attacks by pet cats pose a risk to bats.
Bat is actually visible.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They are able to use sophisticated echo-location technology to pinpoint pests and obstacles in flight paths.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of Scotland's 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, is very serious about the issue of bat treatment.
NTS has ten experienced experts who regularly conduct surveys, check-ups of the habitat and sometimes rescue.
The organisation even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight species of bats in Scotland (total 10 species).
The estate manager, David Thompson, said the estate was the ideal breeding ground for bats.
"We built a regional bat at Threave Estate", Thompson said.
There are old buildings, old trees and all the wonderful habitats.
But there is still a lot of unknowns about bats, so the work we do here and at other estates will help us understand more about how bats can thrive.
Thompson stressed that the condition of bats must be checked before the maintenance of the estate, because if a female bat's habitat is unintentionally destroyed, it could cause the death of up to 400 female bats and bat larvae, leading to the complete extinction of the local population.
Bats are protected, and hunting, killing, attacking, harassing or destroying their habitat is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to contribute their strength.
"There is still a lot of knowledge to be learned about bats and many other species that we do not know the specific situation of their populations", she said.
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape, and lawyers are ready to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo, who was maligned by fake news for facing rape charges, said people wanted to use him to fake their identity.
His lawyer is preparing to sue the German news magazine Mirror Weekly, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, a US woman, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the weekly Sun Mirror, Ronaldo was alleged to have paid the woman $375,000 after the alleged incident, which allowed her to speak out about the incident.
Hours after the allegations were exposed, Ronaldo, 33, posted a live video to 142 million followers on Instagram, accusing the reports of being fake news.
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not going to be able to do anything.
What they said today was fake news, the five-time Golden Globe winner said in front of the camera.
They just want to use my name as a prank.
This is normal.
They want to use me to be famous, but that is also part of their job.
I am a happy person, and I am good in every way, Ronaldo added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute the accusation against the Mirror Weekly, saying that his reporting without permission is suspected of violating personal privacy.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would demand compensation for mental harm in proportion to the severity of the violation, which could be the worst human rights violation in recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents from the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorca reportedly returned to the player's room after meeting at a nightclub, where the rape took place.
According to Mayorca, Ronaldo knelt down after the incident and told her that he was a gentleman when he was 99% drunk, but now he is dragged down by the other 1%.
The document notes that Ronaldo acknowledged that the two had sexual relations, but both sides voluntarily.
Mayorka also said that she went to the police station and took pictures of her wound in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she feared retaliation and public humiliation.
Majorga, 34, said she is currently seeking to overturn an out-of-court settlement because she continues to suffer mental trauma from allegations of the impact of the incident.
The allegations were that Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the case occurred, and that Ronaldo had joined Italian luxury Juventus for a €100 million membership fee this summer.
Brexit: Britain's loss of car manufacturers is a permanent regret
British Commerce Minister Greg Clark said that the loss of the UK's position as a global leader in automotive manufacturing will be his eternal regret after Brexit.
He added that Toyota's British plant told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, Toyota will temporarily stop production at the Bernaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that Brexit without agreement and border delays could lead to job losses.
The Bernstein plant, which is responsible for Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, our plants will stop producing aluminum, Marvin Cooke, General Manager of Toyota's Bernaston Plant, said.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed concern about what could happen if no agreement is reached on the issue of cross-border trade operations in the UK after Brexit.
For example, BMW said that it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is that there may be a risk of supply chain risk in the absence of agreement.
Toyota's production line is based on a targeted timing system, and every 37 minutes orders are received from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, the UK's border could be disrupted, industry officials said, which could lead to delays and shortages of components.
The company said that Toyota's factory in Derbyshire could not hold more than a day's supply, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers plan proposed by Theresa May for the future relationship with the EU could avoid border checks if it is properly verified.
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the most successful agreement, which will both achieve the current success and allow us to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today show.
Evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers shows that we need absolute capacity to continue driving a series of significant supply chains.
Toyota did not say how long production would be halted, but in the long run, the increase in costs will weaken the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately affect job opportunities.
Peter Bouvallaris, who has been working at the Bernstein plant for 24 years and is now the joint convener of the plant, said that his members were increasingly concerned that, in my experience, once they lost their jobs, they would never return.
A government spokesperson said: "We have developed a precise and reliable plan for the future of our relationship with the EU.
The White House said Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
The White House said Sunday that as the winds of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh have not yet calmed down, Donald Trump's high-end meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed by a week.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, while the Robert Mueller Trump campaign team is accused of private Russian cases and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
Washington has debated for months whether Trump will fire the Deputy Secretary of Justice, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of Trump being impeached by the 25th Amendment, and whether he was recording his conversations with Trump on headphones.
Rosenstein denies the report.
But last Monday, in a report by the Guardian that he was about to resign, he went to the White House.
On Thursday, it was reported that he met Trump at the UN in New York at the time.
Trump said he was reluctant to fire Rosenstein, but later postponed the meeting to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christina Blassy Ford, a woman accused of sexual misconduct, would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Kavanaugh and postponed the Senate's comprehensive vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "Given all the other things that are going on, the Supreme Court may postpone a week, and the exact date is not yet set, I think it may be this week".
But we will see this day, and I will always inform the media about the progress.
Some journalists will counter this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why this is.
Sanders said the absence of a press conference was not because she hated the audience's takeover of television journalists, although she said: "I will not oppose their coverage of the audience taking over".
She then said that it would increase direct contact between Trump and the media.
She said: "President Trump has more questions and answers than any other president. But she did not cite any evidence. We have studied these numbers".
Sanders said there will still be a press conference, but if the media gets the chance to ask the president directly, it would be much better than talking to me.
We've organized as many questions as possible, and we've done so many times in the past few weeks, and when people can talk directly with the president of the United States, press conferences will be canceled.
Trump often sets up a question and answer section when he leaves the White House or attends a public meeting or press conference with a visiting policy.
Press conferences held separately are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have explained to us why this is happening, and he has appeared before the gathering of journalists without hesitation, sometimes even acting strangely.
The Minister of Health addressed concerns about Britain's exit from the EU to EU staff at the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff at the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland expressing their gratitude and their hope that they will continue to stay in Scotland after the UK leaves the EU.
Jeane Freeman of the MSP wrote a letter to the UK within six months of leaving the EU.
The Scottish government has committed to paying the fees for residence permit applications for EU citizens working in the public service sector it has transferred.
In the letter Freeman wrote: "The Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU have been ongoing throughout the summer and a decision is expected this fall.
But the British government is also intensifying its preparations for the possible no-deal situation.
I know that this time must have been very uncomfortable for you.
So I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of your nationality.
The valuable experience and skills provided by colleagues within and outside the EU will strengthen and improve our medical services work to the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland will always be your home, and we really hope you can stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defeated Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27 Saturday, and Raptors quarterback Christion Abercrombie suffered a head injury and underwent emergency surgery, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State Tigers head coach Rod Reed told reporters that Abercrombie was injured shortly before the half ended.
He ran to the edge of the line and suddenly fell down, Reed said.
Trainer and medical personnel lost oxygen to Abeclon B on the edge of the line, then carried him back to the scaffold for further evaluation.
Chris Harris, an official with the Tennessee State University Raptors, told the WSMV newspaper in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that the type/degree of the injury has not yet been determined, while the Tennessee State University Raptors are working to understand the exact time of the injury.
Abercrombie is a second-year college redshirt student who is coming here from Illinois after his first season at Tennessee State University.
In Saturday's game, he completed five shots before retiring, increasing his total shots of the season to 18.
Higher stamp duty on foreign buyers buying houses in the UK
Under the newly launched Conservative Party plan, the UK will increase the stamp duty on foreign buyers who buy property in the UK, and the tax collected will be used to help tackle the problem of homelessness.
The move would offset Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
Increased stamp duty is targeted at the non-taxed population in the UK
The Ministry of Finance is expected to raise £120 million a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, and the income tax fee will be used to help the homeless.
The move also promised to provide more affordable housing and lock in high-income people. It was seen as a way to offset Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The increased stamp duty is aimed at individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional funds will be used to improve the government's solution to the problem of lodging.
In addition to the current stamp duty, including the second set of housing and rental taxes introduced two years ago, the additional fee could be up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new London property buyers are non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first time buyers to buy a home.
Many of the richest parts of the UK, especially London, have become ghost towns, as a large number of foreign home buyers are away from the UK most of the time.
Just before the launch of this new policy, Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp duty so that more young people can buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of buying land instead of using land to maintain high house prices and urged Ms. Mei to give up quotas on affordable housing to address the stigma of sluggish housing in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of housing reform proposals that attracted a lot of attention, including rental controls and ending the impeccable move.
He also hopes to give parliament more power to build new houses.
Ms May said: "Last year I said that I would restore the dream of the British people and make the lives of every newborn better during my term as Prime Minister.
This means that the broken housing market needs to be repaired.
Britain will always welcome those who want to live, work and raise a family here.
However, it is not right for individuals who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to be unlike hardworking British residents in their difficulty in buying houses.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house is far from achievable, and the insult of lodging is still very real.
Jack Ross: Well, my ultimate goal is to become a coach in Scotland.
Sunderland head coach Jack Ross said that his ultimate goal was to one day become head coach of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish, who is trying to revitalize the Northeast team, is currently third in the league, three points behind the first place.
After leading St Mirren back to the Scottish League last season, he was transferred to the Stadium of Light this summer.
I want to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-hat, and that's how I got it. Ross wanted to introduce the BBC's Sportssound.
I watched the Scottish team grow up and I watched the games with my dad at Hampton as a child, and I always remember that day.
But only if I bring the team to a successful level, will I have such an opportunity.
Before Ross, the head coaches of Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former owner of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid of the club, which was so big and had so many famous people, and that he had previously rejected the invitation of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success now depends on whether or not I can lead the team back to the Premier League".
He said that because of the structure and facilities of the team, it is certain that they can play in the Premier League.
"It's not an easy task, but I can only lead the team back to the Premier League and I might feel like I've succeeded".
His career as a bishop has only begun three years. Ross spent time as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and worked for 15 months on the Red Heart coaching staff.
He then led Arrow from relegation to the third tier, and the following season led San Mirón from the edge of relegation to the overall championship.
Ross said he felt more comfortable now than he had before playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Recalling his experience with the Arrows, he said: "Oh, this could be a real crossroads.
I really feel that I am better suited to coaching than playing football.
It sounds strange because I'm doing well, and it's not a problem with this life, and it's a lot of fun.
But playing can be difficult at times.
There are many things to do every week.
I still feel the pressure of playing football, but as a coach, I feel good.
I always wanted to be a coach, and now I have, and this is the most comfortable day I've felt in my entire life.

The survey found that Saturday afternoon at 5:30 pm, the best way to get a glass of fresh wine water is to drink it.
Hot summer heat, bar revenue in England, and restaurant chains are under heavy pressure.
Data shows that bar sales increased by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant revenue fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of business consultancy CGA said: "The hot weather of the day, plus England's World Cup match time, exceeded expectations, and the coverage of June was repeated in July. During June, bar revenue grew by 2.8% and the restaurant was hit harder".
Restaurant transactions fell 1.8 percent in June, and the decline was even greater in July.
The bar, which is dominated by liquor and water drinks, performed best, while the restaurant's turnover continued to decline.
The bar where the main meal is served is also affected by the heat, although the impact is relatively small compared to the restaurant operators.
People seem to think about something to drink outside.
Wine and water sales across the entire bar industry grew 6.6 percent this month and food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, a leisure and hotel industry analyst, said that the trend has been continuing since the end of April.
Among the main factors affecting sales in the outbound consumer market, the biggest factors are weather and important social events or sports events.
The continuing hardship of the catering industry is not surprising, as sales fell by 4.8% compared to the same period, and the headache is the continuing increased cost pressure.
For operators focused on food, the effects of a long hot summer can be called a blizzard, and time will tell us whether the weather in August is moderate and can bring the necessary breathing time.
The entire bar and restaurant industry - including the newly opened bars and restaurants - saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, which is why the brand's promotion has slowed down.
The UK's bar and restaurant industry monitoring body Coffer Peach Tracker collected and analyzed performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion, setting a benchmark for the industry.
One in five minors stares at their parents and uses social media in secret.
The survey showed that one in five minors (aged 11 to 18) are staring at their parents and teachers and using social media in secret.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students showed that the use of fake Insta pages increased.
This news has raised concerns about posting pornographic content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a parent-managed primary parent account.
One in five minors (aged between ages 11 and 18) stares at adults using social media.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students showed that the use of fake Insta accounts (referring to the photo sharing website Instagram) has grown rapidly.
This news has raised concerns about the publication of pornographic content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a primary account for their parents, which was used to deal with the cleansing of their parents, and other secret accounts.
A mother accidentally discovered the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, and discovered that a teenager encouraged others to rape her.
The survey, launched jointly by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), found that 40% of 11-18 year olds had two accounts simultaneously, with half of the minors admitting to having a secret account.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers create and hide in a cyber space that neither parents nor teachers know about.
Elidh Doyle will join the Scottish Athletic Commission as a spokesperson for the Athletes of the Game.
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Dall is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and committee chair Ian Beattie said the move was a great opportunity for athletics coaches to learn from the rich experience at the international level.
Mr. Poirot is well known in Scotland, the UK and the world sports community, and we believe that if he joins the committee, Scotland's athletics will benefit immensely, Betty said.
"I am willing to be a spokesperson for athletes and I hope to make a real contribution to Scotland's sporting career and help provide guidance", said Durr.
The American athlete, who won four Olympic gold medals, including the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and is currently a longtime guest commentator for the BBC, has been unable to walk after suffering a brief cerebral hemorrhage.
He tweeted: "A month ago today, I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said that whether or not I will recover, to what extent, depends entirely on the time.
It was a difficult task to fully recover and relearn to walk again, but now I can complete agility training!
Thank you for your encouragement!
The use of mother as a cow in suckler ads has attracted controversy among netizens.
An advertisement by a dairy company that will compare lactating cows to milk cows has sparked controversy among netizens.
When launching the world's first wearable silent suction suction cup, consumer technology company Elvie released a music video inspired ad that showed the freedom this new suction cup brings to mothers.
Four real mothers danced to music in a crowded cow shed with grass, and a part of the lyrics were: "Oh yes, I personally raised it, but you can't see the tail, it's not my grandmother, it's my breast".
The next song is: "Pull out, pull out, hug my baby, pull out, pull out, grandma my little princess".
But after the ad was posted on the company's Facebook page, it caused controversy online.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times, received hundreds of comments, and received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom felt that this was a disdain for the dairy industry's horrors.
The decision to use cows to advertise this product was too wrong.
Cows, like us, need milk to give birth before they are pregnant, but the difference is that the cow's babies are stolen from the mother within days of giving birth, a netizen wrote.
Elvie suction machines can be placed in the breast of Elvie/Mother.
Another netizen commented: "This is undoubtedly a trauma for the mother and the baby.
Why would you use the milkman as the city cow in the suckler advertisement, and you don't want the kids to leave?
Another netizens added: "Oh, this ad is too out of touch with reality".
Others thought the ad was good, and one lady admitted that she found the song funny.
I think this idea is particularly new.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
The process of sucking milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit of a dead end, but I think it's okay.
This product is new. One netizen wrote:
Another netizen commented: "This ridiculous ad is aimed at the need to drink milk - usually in the company or in the bathroom - and feel like a cowboy.
It is not without the intention to praise or judge the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of girls showed themselves dancing while wearing a suction cup in their breasts.
The idea behind this ad came from many women who call themselves cows when they suck.
However, the Elvie suction machine is completely silent, without wires or tubes, and can be perfectly placed inside the breast, freeing the woman's hands, holding the baby, and even continuing to suck when outdoors.
Mother's partner and creative director (ECD) Ana Balarin commented that the Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product worth a bold attempt.
By contrasting milk-sucking with cows, we want to focus on the process and its problems, while showing the unparalleled sense of freedom that this new type of suckler can bring to people in an interesting and related way.
This is not the first time Elvie's sucker has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children dressed in a costume designed by designer Marta Jakubowski climbed onto the T-stage, where she wore the product.
Hundreds of children were transferred to a campsite on the Texas border
Although the policy at the border crossing is relatively unchanged every month, the number of children who are detained is still rising sharply, partly due to the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies that have increased the difficulty for sponsors to accommodate children.
Legend has it that most sponsors themselves are illegal immigrants, and they fear that coming out and adopting children will jeopardize their ability to stay in the United States.
In June, federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult family members would be required to submit fingerprints, and authorities would share their fingerprint information with the Immigration Service, which led to a significant increase in risk.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confirmed before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80% of individuals who enter illegally as sponsors or family members of sponsors, most of whom are transnational criminals.
So we are constantly chasing these people, Albersett said.
According to the staff of the asylum, in order to solve the problems of these children as quickly as possible, officials introduced new rules requiring some of the children to appear in court within one month of detention (rather than 60 days after the previously stipulated date).
Many children will not appear in person, but will instead appear in the form of a video conference call to defend their legal identity to immigration judges.
Children who are considered ineligible for relief will be deported quickly.
According to the staff of the shelter and reports from the system in recent months, the longer the children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, leading to violent behavior or attempted escape.
The defense lawyers said that concerns were even more serious in large facilities like Tornillo because the size of such a place is too large to ignore signs of child rebellion.
They added that transferring children to the tent city, where children do not have enough time to prepare emotionally and not enough time to say goodbye to friends, could add to the trauma many children have already suffered.
Syrian authorities ordered the U.S., France and Turkey to immediately withdraw the occupying forces.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their country as soon as possible, despite the eight-year war in Syria.
Mu'alim, who was also the Deputy Prime Minister of Syria, said that foreign troops will be treated accordingly if they enter Syrian territory illegally as an excuse to fight terrorism.
"They must immediately evacuate the city without conditions", Muallem told the UN General Assembly.
Mu'alim insists that Syria's war on terror is coming to an end, and that since 2011, the war has killed more than 360,000 people and displaced millions.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight the sacrifice until we clear all terrorist organizations on the Syrian territory and destroy all illegal foreign forces.
The US has more than 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, primarily responsible for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers stationed in the country in the conflict.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem said conditions allowed them to return home and condemned the spread of irrational fear by some Western countries that forced them to leave their homeland.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help promote the return of refugees", he said.
They are political masquerading as purely humanitarian issues.
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until Assad reaches a political agreement with the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations (UN) diplomats said that Russia and Turkey recently reached an agreement to establish a buffer zone at the last major rebel base in Idlib, which created opportunities for further political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented the Russian-backed Syrian army from launching a massive offensive against the province of three million inhabitants.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had a clear deadline and said he hoped the military operation would target jihadists, including militants from the Nusra Front linked to al Qaeda who have been eradicated.
The UN Special Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes that the new committee, composed of members of the government and opposition, will convene the first meeting as soon as possible to draft the post-war constitution in Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualim listed the conditions for the Syrian government to join the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited to reviewing the provisions of the current constitution and warned against interfering.
Why Trump will win re-election
According to this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless impeachment and scandal terminate his presidency early, as many liberal viewers wish.
There is no doubt that this will be the most dramatic presidential end of a term ever!
But so far, there seems to be no sign of aesthetic fatigue.
Since 2014, the viewership of the Golden Age of American Cable Television News Network (CNN) has more than doubled to 1.05 million, while the viewership of Microsoft National Broadcasting Corporation (MSNBC) has tripled to 1.6 million.
Nielsen data shows that the average viewership for Fox News' golden age has risen from 1.7 million to 2.4 million four years ago, while MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has been consistently ranked in the top 3.5 million viewership for cable television viewing thanks to the main nightly news.
For Cabinet Minister Neil Baer, producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor", who became president after the attack on the Capitol, Neal Baer said that people were attracted to him like a flying saucer because we didn't understand him.
Senior comedy writer, Neil Scovell, author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, holds another theory.
Scoville told me that she still remembers the scene of a ride in Boston on the eve of the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh".
There is no shortage of entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike other shows on television, whether this immigrant family will eventually reunite or whether the global economy will develop healthyly, this story line in Washington could determine the future of the case of Roe v. Wade.
The show is a luxury enjoyed by only the most privileged audience.
However, when you find yourself spending six hours watching a panel of experts discuss the implications of the deep-rooted background mystery used by Bob Woodward in his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 birdhaired jacket (which the Washington Post called an arrogant thick dress mystery) and the stormy Daniels' cover-up of Trump's "hysterical" mystery, you will find that this is far beyond the reach of your average citizen's knowledge.
As for me, I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
About the cast rotation and daily twists on Trump's show: "Looking for the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un, chairman of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the star of Pawn Stars", Brent Montgomery, creator of Pawn Stars, said that some of the things he was doing made it feel like a show, and he was actually pouring something on you every night.
You can't miss an episode or you won't be able to keep up.
This week I met Fleiss, who was living in an apartment on the north coast of Coahuila, and had an outdoor temperature of 80 degrees Celsius, but he hid in his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN's program.
Without Brett Kavanaugh, who faced the Senate Judiciary Committee together with him, and the Supreme Court's future, he felt he could not get out of it.
Fries told me that, well, I remember when we were planning those crazy shows behind the scenes during the day, people said, well, this is a sign of the end of Western civilization.
I thought this sounded a bit like a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Big cash is poured into the most fierce congressional midterm elections for the House of Representatives seat to fight the war
It is no wonder that the redistribution of congressional districts, which has led to the contest of two incumbent MPs for the same seat in the 17th Assembly District of Penn State, has brought in a large amount of cash sources.
The recently redesigned suburb Pittsburgh constituency became the target of Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb's race, who won another seat in a special election last spring.
Ram's challenger is incumbent Republican MP Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the original Penn State's 12th Congressional District, which overlaps with the new 17th Congressional District.
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old congressional district map was unconstitutional and advantageous to Republicans, and thus redistributed the constituencies.
The contest for new seats in the 17th District has sparked a campaign finance issue between the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) in the major party finance sector.
In the highly publicized special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March, Ram won with a feeble margin of victory, and later became a household name in Pennsylvania.
The seat had previously been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the seat with 20 percent of the vote.
Political experts have created a little advantage for the Democrats.
The United States considered sanctioning El Salvador for supporting China, but ultimately chose to give up.
The diplomatic official noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing and are barely blocked by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and then remained in Panama until the partners expelled the administration's management team.
State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials had decided to call back the head of the U.S. diplomatic mission in Inselva, the Dominican Republic and Panama over Xi's recent decision not to recognize Taiwan.
But consider sanctions against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017 for narcotics control, development and economic support.
Planned punitive measures, including reductions in economic aid and targeted visa restrictions, will strike a heavy blow against the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings continued, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar gathering held last year, which was seen as a major step forward in preventing immigrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, senior government officials had made it clear that they wanted the meeting to continue, effectively ending the idea of sanctioning El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to address a meeting expected in mid-October, diplomats said, which was a signal that government authorities were taking the meeting seriously.
Three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without being blocked or punished by Washington's latest harsh information.
A White House spokesman in Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate among the three U.S. officials -- including two diplomats who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
An outside analyst who has close ties to the government and refuses to reveal his name confirmed their claim.
Studying the history
The next thing that may need to be addressed is the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller about Trump's potential obstruction of justice, which is well documented in the public record.
Miller reportedly turned the investigation towards whether Trump was plotting Russian attacks on our election campaign.
If Congress is elected, Trump will face accountability to Congress, and when he prepares to run again, perhaps only a jury of colleagues will eventually be left.
There are many assumptions here, and I don't mean that Trump's failure is a inevitable result - nor does it mean that his failure in Europe is a inevitable result.
Everyone on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice, and these choices will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German military officials prepared to launch a coup against Hitler, assuming that the Western world would resist Hitler in Munich and support Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the best opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The historical process has always centered on these turning points, and the unstoppable progress of democracy has either accelerated or slowed down.
Today, Americans face several such turning points.
What if Trump caught Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general for the Justice Department, who was in charge of Miller's investigation?
Since the paper reported last year that Rosenstein suggested that the president be recorded in secret and suspected that Trump was unfit to serve in this position, Rosenstein has become a hotbed of hot potatoes.
Rosenstein said that the Times's claims were inaccurate.
What if the FBI's investigation into Brett Kavanaug, which we just requested, was not comprehensive or unfair - or if the Supreme Court did not recognize credible sexual assault allegations and evidence of fraud - what would we do?
First, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will be held accountable by Trump?
If the attempt fails, the Democrats will enter a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because I have already learned from Bragg.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, who had occupied the residence of my ambassador.
She survived and later immigrated to the United States. 60 years later, my mother sent me to light a Sabbath lamp on a table with Nazi labels on it.
With this inheritance, how can I feel unoptimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Ranger team is optimistic about the Vienna Rapids.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted the Vienna Rapids, who knew the victory was coming to the Austrians after a draw with Spain's Villarreal earlier this month, which would set a good stage for their European League G group stage.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season before the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can take this as a leap and get a better result.
"This is a good opportunity for us because the Virale team is strong", said Graham Dorrans, 31.
Before the game started, we believed that we would not return and eventually we won a point.
Maybe we shouldn't have stopped here, but in the end, the draw was made.
They played better in the first half, and we did better in the second half.
Thursday will be another important night in Europe.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough game because they did well in the last game, but with so many people supporting us, I am sure we can go on and get good results.
Last year was undoubtedly a very difficult year, a lot happened after my injury, and the club itself suffered some setbacks, but now we feel good.
The team was good, the players enjoyed the game and the training went well.
Hopefully we can move forward and get past the past season and succeed.
Women are sleepless because they worry about retirement savings
Although the survey participants knew what kind of care they wanted to receive, few people had discussed this with their families.
In the Nationwide study, about half of the people said they had talked to their spouse about their long-term care costs.
Only 10% said they had discussed this topic with their children.
People want families to take care of themselves, but they don't try to communicate with them, said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
How to get started, please see the footnote.
Communication with spouse and children: If you do not tell your family what you want, they will not be able to prepare well to take care of you.
Discuss with your counsellor and family the details of where to take care and how to get care, as these choices are important factors in determining costs.
Get financial advisors involved: Your advisors can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, a cash-value mixed life insurance that can be used to pay for these expenses or self-insure your wealth (as long as you have money).
Develop legal documents: Avoid legal disputes at the gates.
Arrange a healthcare agent so that you can designate a trusted person to supervise your medical care situation and ensure that professional caregivers can follow your wishes when you are unable to communicate with them.
In addition, prepare a financial authorization letter.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that you are compensated when you lose your ability.
Don't forget the little details: imagine an elderly parent with an emergency medical problem on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
In the written plan, list these details in detail so that you can be prepared.
"Who is the doctor?" asked Martin.
What medicines are you taking?
Who is taking care of patients?
Make these plans.
A man was shot multiple times with a gas rifle in Ilflercom
A man was shot multiple times with a gas rifle on his way home from work in the evening.
The victim was a man in his 40s who was attacked in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfrecum, Devonshire, and shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The shooting incident occurred around 02:30 in the summer of the UK, and police said it was a deliberate murder.
The victim did not see the face of the assailant.
The man's injuries are currently not life-threatening, and police have called on witnesses to provide clues.
The beaches and earthquakes in Indonesia
Indonesian officials said that the severe earthquake and tsunami in the city of Nibali on Friday have killed at least 384 people and the death toll is still rising.
Rescue officials could not get any information from the province of Hangkala due to communication disruptions, which is located in northern Balochistan, near the quake of magnitude 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster in Baru.
Here are some key facts about Baru and Bangalore on the island of Sulawesi:
Baru is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi island, and in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Cungala is a coastline-distributed county along the northwestern coast of Sulawesi, stretching for more than 300 kilometres (180 miles).
The county is an administrative region below the provincial level and in 2017 the estimated population was 299,200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic pillars of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Tangara.
The coal mining industry is also important in the province, but mainly concentrated in the Morowali district on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, in the last 100 years, Baru and Tanggala have been hit by the tsunami several times.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Bangalore.
In 1996, another tsunami struck western Angola, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the earthquake-prone volcanic zone of the South Pacific, and is therefore frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and beaches that have occurred in recent years:
On December 26, 2004, a major earthquake off the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra province triggered waves and tsunami in 14 countries/regions, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom were residents of Aceh province.
2005: Several strong earthquakes occurred on the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of nearby Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and a tsunami triggered by the quake struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Banton, the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mingtai Islands near Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Bidjiaya County, Azi, causing severe damage, reminding people of the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004, which also caused extreme panic among the people.
The earthquake did not cause the tsunami, but the collapse of the building also caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: A major earthquake struck Long Island, a tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, with most of the deaths occurring on the north side of the island.
The earthquake damaged thousands of buildings, causing thousands of tourists to temporarily stay.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assaulting others.
According to a report on domestic violence and resistance to arrest released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Perlin, 29, of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence.
According to police reports, a woman who was acquainted with her tried to report her suspected crime to the police, and Perin took her phone from her hand.
According to KTUU, Perin is currently detained in the Mat-Su pre-trial facility and holds unsecured bonds worth $500.
According to Web reports, when he appeared in court on Saturday, the court asked him to defend himself, and he claimed that his mother was indeed innocent.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in jail and a $250,000 fine.
At the same time, he was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which could result in a day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
However, this is not the first time that Perin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of beating his father, Todd Palin.
Sarah Palin, the mother, reported her alleged assault.
The case is currently pending before Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, a report on domestic violence alleged that Perlin alleged domestic violence and held a gun after being intoxicated by the incident.
Perlin's girlfriend claimed to have hit her face with a fist.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was denounced by the Veterans Organization for alleging that her son's violence was related to his post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during his Ira-overcoming mission.
Seismic tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people killed
The earthquake on Sulawesi, Indonesia, which erupted on Friday, killed at least 384 people.
The earthquake, which was 7.5 degrees, triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are booming, and the death toll is expected to continue to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred in the central part of Sulawesi island, northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia's capital.
Videos of disasters on social media have been a huge hit.
Hundreds of people were celebrating the holiday on a beach in the city of Palou when the tsunami struck.
Federal prosecutors seek a rare death sentence for suspected terrorists in New York
The federal prosecutor in New York wants to sentence New York suspect Sayfullo Saipov to death. The terrorist attack that killed eight people is the rare case in New York City since 1953 to be handled with this charge.
The charge alleges that in October, a 30-year-old Cyclops was driving a rented truck at the Home Depot on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, entering the bike lane, crushing pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
According to the Notice of Intent for the Seeking of Death, filed in the Southern District of New York, in order to prove the justification for the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Seppov was the victim of eight deliberate strikes and that he deliberately strikes others.
According to the court documents, both charges are punishable by death.
A federal grand jury announced weeks after the attack that Syphoph was charged with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, supporting extortion, and using federal prosecutors in organized crime cases.
The prosecutor said the attack required a lot of planning and preparation, and described the way Saipov attacked as outrageous and cruel.
The intention letter stated that the family and friends of the victims, Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, were seriously injured and lost.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last death penalty case in the Southern District of New York has been filed in the last 10 years.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York federal court was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of murder. The couple were executed for espionage against the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, Rosenberg and his twin sister were executed by electric chair.
Court documents show that Saipov was a Uzbek and showed no self-respect in the days or even months after the attack.
Police said he told investigators that he was happy with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to launch the attack after watching videos of ISIS through his cell phone.
Police said he also asked for the ISIS flag to be hung in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, the federal public defender representing Seaborne, said they were particularly disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty and not accept life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of all those involved", said Barton.
Saypov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
During a protest at a Conservative Party meeting, Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize the people's armed forces today.
The former Independent Party chief said politicians must be sensitive to the warmth of the calls for skepticism, as a member of parliament, Theresa May, said, and should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said during a march in Birmingham that if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary, Britain would have left the EU long ago.
However, the ruling party joined a separate protest against Brexit, highlighting the challenges Ms May faces in her deeply divisive line-up.
Under the pressure of the Brexit, left-wing and EU, the Prime Minister is working to adjust the Chequers plan to get it on track.
Allies insisted that despite strong opposition, she would continue to work to reach an agreement with Brussels and force the skeptical Europeans and Labour to choose between her plans and the chaotic mess.
Mr Bone told Solihull's Leave Means Leave rally that he wanted to abandon the Cheeks plan.
He said Mr Farage should be left with his colleagues to negotiate with Brussels.
He said: "If he was responsible, we would have left the EU already".
The member of Parliament from Wellingburg added: "I will support Brexit, but we need to abandon the Cheeks plan".
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "Well, we don't need world war to make it subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
There are suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote, and Mr Bone rejected the suggestion: "The idea that the British changed their minds and wanted to leave them behind is not true at all".
Conservative Brexit activist Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, and told reporters: "Oh, I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
The Cheeks are not welcome, the opposition will not vote for them, and neither will our party and activists. Remember, these are the people who cheered for us on the street, and they were the first to elect us to the podium.
Please give up the Cheeks and listen to the voices of the people.
In a message to Ms May, she added: "The Prime Minister can only keep his position if he fulfills his promise".
Mr Farage told the rallying politicians that if they intend to betray the decision in the 2016 referendum, they must feel the heat of the call.
He said, "Well now, this is about trust between us - the people and the political class".
They want to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them, 'We will not let you do this.'
In his address to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I hope you can make the political class who intend to betray Brexit feel how much enthusiasm they have to cry out for.
"We want to mobilize the British people's armed forces who have contributed to our Brexit victory and we will never rest until we achieve British independence and autonomy".
Meanwhile, the left-wing party marched in Birmingham, and held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the formation of the team this weekend, several activists waved the banner of the Conservative Party against Brexit.
At the opening of the meeting, Labour colleague Lord Adonis mocked the Conservative Party's party app for having security issues.
He added: "These people are telling us that they can have the IT system and all the technology to achieve Canada ++, frictionless borders, free trade without borders in Ireland".
Oh, this is a complete and complete mystery.
There is nothing quite as good as Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democratic senator spoke about his plans for the future in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, who is currently running in the November election, and is running for Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who served as co-chairman of President Trump's Massachusetts campaign team in 2016.
She has been the focus of speculation about the possibility of replacing Trump in 2020.
The event, held Saturday afternoon in Holy York City, was the 36th meeting she held in the form of a town hall rally since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to enter Washington and repair a broken government, with one woman at the top.
Suspected in the shooting of Sims, Louisiana State University (LSU) was arrested
Louisiana Baton Rouge Police announced Saturday that the suspect in Friday's shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference at 11am Eastern Time that the 20-year-old suspect, Dayteon Simpson, had been arrested.
The police department released a video of the shooting Friday, asking the public to help identify the man who appeared in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near Southern University on Friday morning.
According to 247sports, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday that Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death.
Wade defended his friend, and Simpson was shot.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being on the scene and to having weapons, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
It was no surprise that Simpson was arrested and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6-inch boy who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, earning 10 starts, averaging 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins Sebastian Vettel with the help of the team's instructions
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified against Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the Mercedes driver's instructions would play a big role in the race.
Starting from pole position, Potas led the way, almost crushing Hamilton in the first two rounds of defence, and also lured Vettel's teammates to attack.
Vettel entered the repair station first, Hamilton ran to the end of the car, which should have decided the end.
After one lap, Mercedes entered the stop and back onto the track, falling behind Vettel, and after a relatively close fight, in order to avoid staying still after the third tunnel double defence, the Ferrari driver Vettel reluctantly gave up the course and Hamilton regained the lead.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old when he started, was in the back row of the track and finished the first lap in 7th place.
For most of the race, he progressed full speed, and struggled to finish the race quickly, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen, and running to fourth place.
He finally entered the repair station on lap 44, and failed to improve his speed in the remaining eight laps, eventually taking fourth place with Leconine.
Hamilton said: "It was hard to get up today because Watley performed pretty well all weekend and he kindly gave me the position.
The team achieved first and second place, which was excellent.
What is body language really like?
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting that she had not disclosed a letter about Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In a speech at a gathering in West Virginia, President Trump did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate is a good indication of how vile, dirty, and hypocritical people are.
Trump said, "Well, when you see anger, when you see angry, mean, dirty, hypocritical people, something could happen, and the good things have been happening in the Senate for the past few days".
"When you hear about the release and leakage of the news, then they say, 'Oh, this is not my doing.'
This is not my fault.
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the news?
Remember her answer... did you leak the files?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak the information.
So please wait a minute.
Is it our leak... No, not our fault, he added, the senator recalled.
In July, Van Steen received a letter from Ford describing in detail the allegations against Kavanaugh, which was leaked in early September - but Van Steen denied that her office had caused the leak.
According to the Congressional Hill Times, Van Steen revealed to the committee that she did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations or leak her experience.
She asked me to keep the letters confidential, and I did so at her request.
But her denial seems not to have been accepted by the president, who commented at a rally Saturday night: "Listen, body language is really bad.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual misconduct by three women, saying the Democrats were using the accusation to their own ends.
According to Mediaite, the president said that they would take back power by any means necessary.
Look at those mean, dirty means, they don't care who they hurt, nor do they care who they overthrow to gain power and control.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 to beat the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer won the game for the Giants by two goals against Dundee.
On Saturday, the Dundee Stars won 5-3 in the second leg of the match, compensating for the regret of the Belfast Giants' loss in the Elite League on Friday.
Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier scored a goal to give the Giants a two-goal lead at the start of the game.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie played home games before Dwyer regained the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard evened the score for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals to win.
This was Adam Keefe's third defeat in the Elite League this season, as they beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth time the two teams have met this season, and the Giants have won all three previous games.
Dwyer started the opening battle with an assist from Kendall McFaull at 3:35 of the fourth minute, while Beauvillier doubled the lead after four minutes with an assist from David Rutherford.
In a tense opening battle, Sullivan took home the lead at 13:10 and Matt Marquardt tied the score to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first half, giving the Giants a lead in the first half.
The main team re-arranged the flag drum, Bouchard launched a strong offense at 27 minutes 37 seconds, again leveling the score.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the second half of the second half and score the team's fifth goal in the last half, ensuring the game's victory.
The Giants have lost four of their last five games and will play Milton Keynes on Friday at home in their next game.
Air traffic controllers used their lives to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board managed to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller who lost his life in ensuring the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of people was later hailed as a hero.
On Friday, a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi, triggering a tsunami that killed more than 800 people and left many missing.
The strong aftershocks continue to engulf the area, and many people are trapped in the ruins in the city of Baru.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues were fleeing, Anthony Gunawan Agung, 21, remained in his seat and remained firmly in the rocking control tower at Mutitara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He insisted on staying on the ground to ensure that Flight 6321 of Bazer Airlines, which was already on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
When he realized that the control tower was beginning to collapse, he jumped from the tower.
He later died in hospital.
According to Australian broadcaster ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirait said that Argon's decision saved hundreds of lives.
We are ready to take a helicopter from Kalimantan Balipaon to send Argon to large hospitals in other cities for treatment.
But unfortunately, before the helicopter reached Baru, Argon left this morning.
We are very saddened to hear this news, Syraite added.
Meanwhile, the Indonesian national disaster relief agency said that roads to towns like Tanggala, Siji and Boutong were blocked, and government authorities feared that the death toll could reach thousands.
The agency spokesman, Sudopo Purwo Nugroho, said that we believe the death toll is still rising because many bodies are still buried under the rubble and many people have not yet been found.
A wave of up to six meters destroyed the barrow, which was to hold a mass funeral on Saturday.
Military and commercial aircraft are continuously sending relief supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "An ambulance is bringing bodies every minute".
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Small markets nearby were looted.
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything it can to help the survivors, but we don't know what the search and rescue team will find.
Although this is already a tragedy, the situation could get worse.
According to CNN, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Baru on Sunday and addressed the Indonesian army: "I order you to complete all the evacuation tasks without delay, day and night".
Are you ready?
The Indonesian island of Nam Nam Nam was hit by an earthquake earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini reported a man missing after his plane crashed into an atoll lake
A New Guinea Airlines flight crashed into an atoll lake in Pacific Micronesia, and the airline previously said that 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that sank to the bottom of the lake, and that one man was missing.
New Guinea Airlines said at a conference on Saturday afternoon that it could not explain the disappearance of the male passengers.
The airline said it was working with local governments, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately disclose the identity information of the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
The plane crashed into the lake as it landed at Chuuk Island Airport, and local boats participated in the rescue, rescuing other passengers and crew.
On Friday, seven people were taken to hospital, the official report said.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still being treated in hospital, and all passengers were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the order of events are not clear.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the plane had drifted off the runway and landed in an atoll lake.
Some witnesses believe the plane was the one that made the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
Jaynes said that it was better to fly low.
Jaynes said that after the plane sank, the water inside the plane was already deep, and everyone was getting water to the emergency exit.
He explained that the passengers were terrified and shouted, and his head was slightly injured.
The US Navy said sailors who were converting the nearby dock were involved in rescue, driving a gas-filled boat, and bringing the landed personnel to shore, while the rear aircraft sank in water about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Air Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in crashes on the flight registered with Papua New Guinea National Airlines in the past two decades, but New Guinea Airlines has no passenger death record yet.
Analysts list the timeline of women being burned alive at night
Prosecutors were re-tried on Saturday for allegedly burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst for the US Department of Justice, as an expert identifier in the field of intelligence analysis, made several hours of testimony statements.
He told the jury how he used his cell phone records to match the activities of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers that night.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett reported that he received location data from several phones, which showed that Thriss was with him the night of Chambars death, which contradicts previous claims by Thriss.
Tris said he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, and the data showed that Tris's phone was in the same location as Chambers's phone at the time, so police went to Sanford to find out about the situation.
Sanford testified in court on Saturday, saying he was not in town that day.
The prosecutor asked whether the case was true, and Trice said that he was in Sanford's truck that night. Sanford said Trice was lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time.
Another paradox is that, according to Tris, they had known each other for about two weeks when Chambers died.
And the phone records show that they only met a week ago.
Rolette said that some time after Chambers' death, Tris deleted Chambers' text messages, phone calls and contact information from his phone.
Hale said that he wiped her out of her life, wiping her clean and clean.
The defendant is scheduled to begin his final argument on Sunday.
The judge said he hopes to send the trial to the jury later that day.
High Breed Hip Hop Combination: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wanted to inject positive messages into their songs and change people's negative perceptions of hip hop music.
High Breed hip hop compilation comes from Bristol. They say hip hop music originally rapped political content in songs to solve social problems, but now it has broken away from that form.
They want to trace their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Hip hop combo The Fugees and Common have recently seen a resurgence in the UK thanks to the performances of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
And a black man?
A New York nanny sued the employer and the couple after receiving a racist text message.
A New York nanny was beaten after a mother of her child complained that her mother was a black mother after receiving a message sent by her child, and the couple filed a lawsuit alleging that their family was discriminated against.
Both couples refused to admit racial discrimination, calling the case blackmail.
In 2016, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed disappointment when she discovered that the other was black before she went to the childcare provider Giselle Maurice.
No... - Another black mother wrote in a text to her husband Flakesman.
However, the text message was sent to Morris twice by mistake.
According to the New York Post, Mrs. Morris was fired by Mrs. Humphreys Flakesman, who felt embarrassed after realizing she was unwell, citing the poor performance of the soon-to-be-departing African-American nanny, who was waiting for a Filipino.
Mrs. Flakesman paid Morris a day's salary and then ordered a Uber to take her home.
The day before, Morris was suing the couple, demanding that they pledge to stay with the employer's parents for up to six months in temporary work for the initial employment and pay compensation of up to $350 per day, despite the lack of a contract.
Morris told reporters at the New York Post on Friday that he wanted to tell them that you wouldn't do that, and added that he knew that was racial discrimination.
The couple countered the lawsuit that they had no racial discrimination, saying that terminating Morris' employment was entirely reasonable and that they feared they would not be able to trust her after being offended.
My wife didn't want to send her any messages.
She has no racial discrimination.
We all have no racial discrimination", her husband Joel Plasco told The New York Post.
But would you be sure to hand the child over to someone who has offended you, even if it was an unintentional move?
Have you just had a baby?
Please, probably no one will.
Plasco called the case a blackmail case, saying that her wife gave birth to her child two months ago and that the situation is very difficult.
Oh, would you hire someone like that?
That is not a wise move, the investment banker added.
While the case is still pending, the opinion courts have quickly begun to condemn the couple's behavior and logic on social media.
The latest letter reveals that the publisher of Paddington Bears is worried that readers will not accept a bear who will speak.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by readers, revealed in the letter that it was difficult to imagine the feelings of the first reader before the book was published.
Now the Paddington Bear has been a huge success, and it's really funny.
Speaking of her father, she said that her father was a photographer for the BBC who later wrote this children's reading inspired by a toy bear, and he was always hopeful about his mother's rejection of the work. She added that his father died last year, and the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book is said to be a happy half-life.
Speaking of the Paddington bear, she said that it was a very important part of our family and that her father was proud of the success he finally achieved.
"My father was a very quiet person, never bragging about himself", she said.
But because the Paddington Bear is too real for him, it's like your child has accomplished something: you're proud of them, even though it doesn't belong to you.
I think that's how he sees the success of the Paddington Bears.
Although this is a crystal of his creativity and imagination, he always attributes his success to the Paddington Bear himself.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors ultimately could not save her life.
Nad called as usual and said that it was bad and she had never expected it to be so bad, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
And then I got a call from Nad, saying that my daughter had only a few minutes left and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
I did that.
I said, "Dear Zasey, I love you very much".
I will be with you soon.
I will always be with you.
The medication that the doctor gave her to maintain her heartbeat was slowly failing.
She died early, and it was over.
Knowing that all this has happened, I can just sit there and wait.
I can't scream, cry or cry because my family and friends are all around me.
I have to stay calm.
Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, finally immersed in the pain of losing her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, seemingly calmly forgetting the ordeal she was going through.
No one can see her, she said.
I lowered my head and my eyes were flowing downward.
I know it's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt a strong sympathy for Nad.
He needs my understanding and care.
I know how much he loves his daughter.
The grieving woman posted a card to persuade those who had lighthearted thoughts to change their minds
Two women who lost loved ones tried to stop others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on Wales Bridge, with words of encouragement and phone numbers, to help those in need find support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler suffered from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any other parent to experience the pain I endure every day", she said.
Mrs Davis lives in Lydney, and her 45-year-old son is a promising cook with an infectious smile on his face.
"Everyone knows he's a laughingstock.
People always say that his smile makes the whole house happy.
But he gave up his job and soon died, and he went to a particularly dark place to hide.
Tyler's brother was just 11 when he discovered Tyler had taken his own life in 2014.
Davis said: "I've always been worried that his suicide would have a strained reaction.
So Davis made the card, and I wanted people to know that someone would be willing to help you, willing to listen to your advice, even if we were friends.
Don't keep silent, you need to speak up.
Mrs Humphreys was a longtime friend of Mrs Davies, who died shortly after her mother and her husband left her, and now has a 15-year-old scene.
She explained that Mom never told us what she felt was depressed or depressed.
Just days before Christmas, we noticed that his mood was not very right.
On Christmas Day, the children opened their presents and he had no eye contact, and his mood had fallen into the lowest valley.
She said her husband's death brought them great trauma, but they still had to move on: after his death, the sky in the house collapsed.
We all want to die of grief.
But we still have to continue living and continue fighting.

The FBI has opened an investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's future.
I thought that if we could really get what he wanted - a time- and scope-limited investigation - maybe we could recover a thread of unity, Flake said Saturday, adding that he was worried the committee would take this opportunity to begin to break down the deep-rooted party line.
Why do Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the timing.
There are only five weeks left before the November 6 midterm elections, and if the Republicans do not perform as well as we suspect, their efforts to push the Supreme Court candidate will be severely impacted.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators constantly to lobby for Kavanaugh, who worked for the Bush administration in the White House and through Bush met his wife, Bush's private secretary Ashley.
What will happen after the FBI releases the report?
The Senate will vote, and currently the Senate has 51 Republican seats and 49 Democratic seats.
It is unclear whether Kavanaugh will win at least 50 votes in the Senate to break the tie with Vice President Mike Pence and confirm the nomination of the Supreme Court candidate.
The number of North Korean deserters under Kim Jong Un's regime has dropped sharply
A South Korean lawmaker said that since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, the number of North Koreans who have defected to South Korea has declined.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the Korean Unification Service as saying that last year a total of 1,127 North Koreans defected to South Korea, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key reason for the decline in the number of deserters was the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in the costs charged by the smuggling groups.
North Korea has no public comment on the development plan.
The vast majority of North Koreans who defected to South Korea eventually obtained South Korean citizenship.
South Korea says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally to South Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the deserters fled to North Korea through China, because the border line with China is the longest and it is easier to cross than the heavily defended demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China often forcibly returns the fugitives because it considers them illegal immigrants, not refugees.
In recent months, relations between North Korea and South Korea have improved significantly, although technically, they are still at war.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries held talks in Pyongyang to open talks on the deadlocked denuclearization negotiations.
The improvement in relations between the two countries was the result of a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, during which the two sides largely agreed on efforts towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Lee Yong-ho accused that no progress has been made since the meeting ended because the United States is still imposing sanctions.
"If the United States is not trustworthy, we cannot ensure that our security is guaranteed, so it is absolutely impossible to unilaterally lift the nuclear weapons embargo", Lee Yong-hook said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and unfit to serve as a Supreme Court justice
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was hysterical and unfit to serve as a Supreme Court justice.
Pelosi said this during an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I can't help but think that if a woman has this behavior, they would describe it as 'hysteria,' Pelosi said, referring to the testimony Kavanaugh made Thursday in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh's mood is out of control, and he has filed a complaint against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who claims he did not have sexual abuse as a child.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was out of control, and when discussing his family and high school life, he almost shouted and even spoke out several times.
He also explicitly condemned the Democratic party that attended, saying the allegations were made by a freakish united-person attack by the Liberal Party organization, which was angered by the Liberal Party's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot run for the Supreme Court because it shows that he has a bias against Democrats.
"I think his testimony and his attitude toward Clinton and the Democrats shows that he is not qualified enough", she said.
Asked whether he would impeach Kavanaugh if the charges were finally confirmed, if the Democrats won a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected.
Pelosi said: "If what he said to Congress or the FBI is not true, then he is not only unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, but also unfit to serve on the court he is currently serving".
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington DC.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned that Kavanaugh might rule against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case because he belonged to the conservative judiciary.
Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court rulings while confirming the hearing.
Now, it's not appropriate to let a hysterical, prejudiced person serve on the court, and we want to say a word: 'Isn't that good?'
Women need to exercise their power.
It was a slander of justice, and the anger that has been spreading for months, even years, that she would not be able to escape without crying out.
Steinem told me 45 years later that when we are angry, we cry.
"I think that's normal, don't you think?"
She continued, "A lady who helped me a lot, she was the manager of a company, and she said she would cry when she was angry, but she discovered a trick, which is that when she got angry and started crying, she would say hello to the people who were talking to her, and you would know that I was sad because I was crying".
I'm angry.
Then she continued.
I think it's just great.
We use tears to express anger, partly because we fundamentally misunderstand tears.
One of the things that impressed me the most was that in one of my early years, a male-dominated company, I once cried out of unspeakable anger and was grabbed by an old woman - a manager I had always been a little afraid of - who dragged me down the stairs.
She warned me that you should never let them see you cry.
Oh, they don't know you're angry.
They will think you are sad and happy because they beat you.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, ran for president with Gary Hart.
In 1987, Hart dropped out of the race after being involved in an extramarital affair on a merchant dinner ship named Monkey's Boat, and Schroder was frustrated with the idea that he should personally practice running for president.
That wasn't a thoughtful decision, and 30 years later she smiled at me.
There were seven other candidates running at the time, and they didn't need another candidate either.
Some call this the Snow White Princess and the Seven Dwarfs.
As she is in the late stages of her campaign, Schroder is lagging behind in raising funds, so she vows not to run unless she raises $2 million.
This is undoubtedly a battle that must be won.
She found that some supporters donated $1,000 to male candidates, but only gave her $250.
Oh, they think I need a discount? Oh, Schroder suspects.
When she announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was plagued by a variety of complex emotions - gratitude to supporters; disappointment with the system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and to target target targeted voters rather than representatives; and anger at sexism - she began to cry.
Schroder recalled the media's reaction to her saying, "Oh, you should think I'm mentally broken".
Oh, you might think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
Oh, she cried?
What benefits will China-US trade war bring to Beijing
Experts say the US-China trade war is on the rise, and although the war has only just begun, in the long run, the differences between the two countries may be more favorable for Beijing.
Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump warned for the first time that tariffs on China's main export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum, were about to be imposed.
The trade war escalated sharply this week, and the new tariffs will tax half of the goods imported from China into the United States, affecting the wave and the value of $200 billion (€150 billion).
Beijing has retaliated in the same way every time, and recently raised tariffs of 5% to 10% on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to fight back against the United States and the world's second largest economy will never retreat in the short term.
Giving Washington concessions meant meeting their demands, but publicly giving in to the US was too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts said that if Beijing can play this hand, the pressure of the US trade war could reduce the degree of mutual dependence of the economies of the two countries and bring positive support to China in the long term.
Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher in Asia at the Center for New American Security, said that if Washington or Beijing were to make political decisions quickly, it could cause economic chaos between the two countries, which is actually more dangerous than the situation that has been recognized before.
Foreign Minister said Syria is ready to welcome refugees back home
Syria said it was ready to allow refugees to return voluntarily and called on people from all walks of life to help rebuild their homes after more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem told the UN General Assembly that conditions in Syria were improving.
"Today, due to progress in the fight against terrorism, the ground is becoming more stable and safe", he said.
The Syrian government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists and restore them to normal.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees are now ready. Refugees who have fled their homes are forced to leave their homes because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures against their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their homeland since the war broke out in 2011.
The other 6 million people who remain in Syria still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime welcomes other countries' help in rebuilding their homes.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or help from the state to support insurgent activities.
The European team won the Ryder Cup in Paris
In the 2018 Ryder Cup held at Le Golf National outside Paris, Europe defeated the United States with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5.
The United States has now lost six straight European lands and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn took the lead with 14.5 points to beat the United States and regained the European title.
American star Phil Mickelson struggled for most of the game, losing directly to Francesco Molinari after hitting the 16th hole, the third pole.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5-4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson, 2-1 behind Ian Poulter of England, is expected to play in his final Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a Spanish player who has participated in eight Ryder Cups, is a senior who became the highest winning European in history with 25.5 points.
I don't cry normally, but today I can't stand it.
This year is too difficult.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I am happy and happy to take back the trophy.
This is the honor of our whole team and I am happy to be able to do my part, Garcia said with excitement after winning the European competition.
He passed the torch to his fellow player John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, a legendary golfer, 2-1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"I've watched Tiger Woods from childhood to adulthood and I'm very proud to beat him", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost four matches in France, and this time with a record of 13-21-3 set the record for the lowest Ryder Cup.
This statistic is odd for the greatest player of all time, as he is said to have won 14 important tournaments after Jack Nicklaus.
The Americans were not optimistic for the whole week, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who scored high quality goals throughout the game.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I am proud of you all, and you are fighting hard".
This morning, for a while, we put a lot of pressure on Europe.
We're done.
A tribute to Thomas.
He is quite good as captain.
The 12 players played very well.
We will regroup the team, I will join the PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we will continue to move forward.
I love these 12 people and I am honored to be their captain.
We must pay tribute to them.
We were defeated.

According to British media, the Deputy Secretary of Naval Operations, General William Moran, said that even as the US Navy is revitalising its forces to respond to increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the US continues to focus on the Asia Pacific region - the Pentagon expanding its reach to include the Indian Ocean, Asia Pacific - as its naval focus.
According to the British Defense Weekly website, China is a strategic competitor in the new defense strategy announced by the United States earlier this year.
The US Navy has since restored the second fleet to take a more direct approach to Russia.
The move has raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts, who fear the U.S. Navy may move away from the Obama administration's strategy of rebalancing the Asia-Pacific.
But General Moran said the focus of the US Navy remains on the Western Pacific.
At the roundtable discussion on how to address the challenges of the open sea, organized by the National Bureau of Asian Studies in Washington, on January 24, 2018, he said: "For us, there has been no significant change".
Moran said: "The focus is still on rebalancing, shifting focus or whatever you want to describe it".
But he acknowledged that the United States has close ties with Europe.
He said: "We will continue to monitor the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do".
While Moran pointed out that the overall policy regarding Russia falls within the purview of the US Secretary of Defense, he warned: "The Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history proves that if we conflict with them, they will be very tough".
General Moran said that as part of the U.S. resumption of operations against Russia, China and other competitors, the U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying troops in a brand new mode of operation, which will help prevent the opponent from reaching the U.S. carrier battle group or other assets where they will be deployed at any given time and place.
He said: "Oh, our Navy and Marines support it - the concept of unpredictability, not being in the same place over and over again, almost like a slogan - this is our practice".
The first attempt at this new approach was the aircraft carrier battle group, the Jharri Drummen, whose early deployments included working visits to the port and patrols in areas normally only passed by, the report said.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is working to ensure that allies know that these warships will continue to patrol in traditional areas, and is also working to address logistics and home connectivity issues for new deployment procedures.
Michael Nunun, Commander of the Royal Australian Navy, will also speak at the event, saying that the Australian military can cooperate with the US carrier battle group without fail.
He said that this situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase nine ships equipped with the Aegean Shield combat system.
Many airlines will increase or restore fuel surcharges from October 5th, and will have to pay more for flights starting next Friday.
Yesterday, foreign airlines such as Xiamen Airlines, Okay Airlines and others announced that from the ticket date of October 5, 2018, the domestic fuel surcharge for 800 kilometers will be charged for each passenger on the following routes: 20 yuan per fuel surcharge and 30 yuan per fuel surcharge for each passenger on routes over 800 kilometers.

Japan's Ito Tsun Business on Friday acknowledged a $1.3 billion loss in investments in China's China Stock Exchange, which was cut off from its largest corporate investment transaction due to the impact of China-US trade tensions.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man walked through the headquarters of the company.
Murud said the US grain sector was hit hard by the trade war and that its financial transactions in agriculture had been suspended.
Earlier, some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies and others have warned about the impact of China-US trade friction when they published their latest results.
The United States and China impose tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods on each other, and US President Trump threatened that if the dispute is not resolved, the scope of the tariffs will be expanded to all Chinese exports of US goods worth more than $50 billion.
Isuzu Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Minister of Commercial Finance, said that the trade dispute could have a greater impact on China's economy next year.
Itotsuo Business and Thai Bee Group invested $10 billion in China in 2015 and acquired 20% of its shares.
Hachimura said that the business of Ito Tsun has lost 143.3 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) in this part of the holding, believing that the price of Xinjiang shares will not recover in the near future.
Itotsuo business maintained its profit forecast of 50 billion yen for the financial year ended March 31, 2019.
China imposed a 25% import tariff on US soybeans in July to curb the Chinese government's move in the trade friction.
Our cereal business has been hit by the friction of trade between the US and China, said the Finance Minister, Yao Yong.
He said that Kauai has stopped financial transactions on his own account since September.

China News Network November 5th, Comprehensive report that the midterm election voting in the United States has entered the countdown.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic opponents actively waved tears at their core voters.
Both parties pointed out that voter turnout will be the key to the right-wing election situation.
Reportedly, 48 hours before the US referendum, Trump was busy attending the Republican candidate's rally, while former President Obama went to Indiana to stand for the Democratic candidate for the Federal Senate, Joe Donnelly, who was in a hurry to vote, and shouted to the crowd for his final appeal before the election.
On November 4, Trump came to the Georgia state ballot box for Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, and he said: "You have to go to the polls on Tuesday, you have to vote".
The contrast between this election cannot be clearer.
The political enthusiasm of the voters has risen to a rare peak, and early voting in some states has been far more than usual.
The sitting president of the United States faces the first round of the midterm elections, and the seats of the Congressman of his party are often reduced.
According to a new poll released by The Washington Post and ABC News on Thursday, while the Democratic Party's Federal House of Representatives election situation remains favorable, Republicans can benefit from economic assessment and Trump's strict focus on border security.
Polls showed registered voters preferred Democratic House candidates to Republicans, at 50% to 43%, but the 14 percentage points of lead in August was still down.
Another poll conducted by NBC and the Wall Street Journal also showed that Democrats still lead Republicans by 7 percentage points.
It is reported that Obama told the crowd at the inauguration of Senator Donnelly: "When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, there will be consequences".
Democracy cannot work when people can only lie and self-abandoningly.
The only way to stop these Republicans is now to vote for you and your vote.
The Democratic Party faces the toughest election situation in decades in the Senate, with the Republican Party currently holding more than half of the 51 seats.
But the House of Representatives is more favorable, and Democrats need to win another 23 seats to take control of the 435-seat House.
According to analysts at the predictive election site FiveThirtyEight.com, the chances of the Democrats winning the House of Representatives are as high as 85%.

People's Net Beijing November 5th, Wang Xiaojun) Under the current wave of Chinese mass startups and Chinese innovation, more and more technology companies are starting to put importance on patent research and development and related protection work, deepening the potential value of patents and taking over market dominance.
Similarly, many tech companies have encountered a wave of infringements in terms of patent technology licensing and patent technology use.
At the end of 2017, three people from Guangdong Province, Liuwei, Ho Chao, and Rai, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against China's IPCC development company Beijing Xiaoxing Technology Limited (later known as China Xiaoxing Technology Limited), operator China Xiaoxing Technology Limited (later known as China Xiaoxing Technology Limited), distributor China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China China
The three plaintiffs requested a court order that the three defendants immediately stop the manufacture, sale, promise sale and use of the plaintiff's patent practices.
On October 30, 2018, the China Arbitration Documentary Network published a civil ruling on the patent dispute between Liuwei, Ho Chongqing and Beijing Xiaochun Technology Limited, among others, revealing details of some cases in which Diti is accused of patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs argue that the patented and inventors of the patented car service system and method based on mobile terminals, and the entire operation of the application of the car in the DIDITY APP, corresponding to the technical program of patent protection involved, constitute patent infringement.
However, during the court's periodic hearing, Xiaoxiao Technology considered that Guangdong Pacific was not a suitable defendant, it only provided free downloads of the app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app app
Second, the violation was not committed in Guangdong.
In accordance with the law, infringement of the patent in question should be fully implemented in the place where the patent method in question is applied, so the court objected to the jurisdiction of the court and requested that the case be transferred to the court of the defendant's domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the alleged infringement of the App Products on its web platform, and the plaintiff did not correctly list the defendant Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
The defendant's residence in Guangdong Pacific is in Guangzhou City, within the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant claimed that XiaoxunTechnology transferred the case to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for consideration, based on insufficient evidence, rejected the objection raised by the defendant XiaoxunTechnology Limited to the jurisdiction of the case and assumed the costs of receiving the case of jurisdiction objection.
The other details of the case have not yet been released, and journalists will be closely watching the details of the follow-up to Didi's patent infringement case.
Interview with the CEO of the Australian Federal Organisation for Scientific and Industrial Research: The results of the China-Australia Science and Technology Cooperation are remarkable
China's scientific and technological development has been rapid in the past few decades, and Australia and China have worked together in the field of science and have achieved rich results.
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Australian Federal Organisation for Scientific and Industrial Research, said in an interview with China News Agency in Beijing that cooperation in the field of technology in Australia is alive and well, from tackling climate change to the Tetnaku project.
As the largest national research institution in the Australian Federation, CSIRO has achieved numerous innovative research achievements in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials, astronomy and others that are world-renowned.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"This is a lasting friendship, which includes a tradition of trust and long-term cooperation with partners", said Kim Marshall.
In May, China's 500-meter ball-shaped radiation telescope - China's Tianjin Eye - installed the first international 19-wave L-band receiver.
This is the most advanced 19 wave beam pump receiver in the world today, developed jointly by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said the successful development of the receiver was based on CSIRO's years of technology accumulation, and that once FAST was enabled, the speed of the orbit would be increased five to six times, while expanding the scientific observation objectives.
"This is a force CSIRO contributes to FAST.
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO also works closely with Chinese scientific institutions in the construction of array radiation telescopes for square kilometers, research and development of new fuel technologies, energy saving and emission reduction.
The scientific research of the past often focused on the problems of a century later, and now more scientific research forces are needed to solve the problems that lie ahead.
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a series of challenges in development.
Extreme weather, for example, occurs frequently around the world, drought and flooding have led to reduced food production, and food shortages have severely affected human development.
At the same time, the problems of population explosion, aging and chronic diseases are also the serious challenges facing us today.
The cooperation between China and Australia in recent years has been focused primarily on solving these current problems.
Marshall said CSIRO is a collaborative effort with the National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology in Qingdao, the International Centre for South Hemisphere Marine Research, which focuses on observing the El Niño phenomena and the Ladina phenomena, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather and establishing extreme weather forecasting facilities; CSIRO and the Institute of Mechanical Engineering developed a new variety of cereals to overcome extreme weather and could also mitigate the food shortage caused by extreme weather.
In the current environment, technological innovation is difficult to do alone, requires extremely high costs and there are many problems to solve, so cooperation is especially important today.
Marshall said that the closer cooperation, the more likely it is to make breakthrough progress, which is also the meaning of strengthening cooperation between the two sides under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative.
We are working to strengthen bilateral cooperation, which for us is mainly in the field of technology.
For example, CSIRO has developed a method of gold purification that does not use chlorinated gold, and because the traditional chlorinated gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries are hoping to find a method of gold purification that is less polluting the environment.
We are willing to bring this technology into China, which is one of the results of our cooperation with China.
On 29th, 2018, the Baboon Silk Road Tourism Promotion Baboon Project Cooperation Talks were held in the city of Urumqi, Xinjiang, where guests could appreciate the developmental achievements of Baboon while also appreciating the local cuisine and feeling the rich historical culture.
In the month leading up to the event, Bogota has launched a series of high-density tourism promotional activities along the Silk Road in eight cities along the Rainbow, Pindang, Lanzhou, Singkat, Srinagar, Xining, Zhangjiajie, Hamim and others, laying the foundation for the successful holding of the 2018 Bogota Silk Road Tourism Promotion Project Cooperation Talks.

At the meeting, the Tourism Development Commissioner of Baoding City signed a strategic tourism cooperation agreement with the Urumqi Tourism Board in the two places.
At the same time, several travel agencies in Xinjiang signed tourism cooperation agreements with the Baoding Dawang River Tourism Area, the Farmen Temple Buddhist Cultural Area, the Taobao Mountain Tourism Area, and the Guan Shan Prairie Area.
Chen Maong, Chairman of the Committees for Tourism and Development of the Baoding City Market Promotion Department, said: "In the United States, some tourist resources complement the Baoding, and we went all the way to promote tourism in Baoding, mainly introducing the human treasures, food treasures, natural scenery, etc., and selected more than 500 photos to let customers feel the beauty of Baoding.
The event focused on tourism resources, tourism projects, tourist lines, and other activities, and through the broadcast of tourism promotional films, cultural tourism resources and projects, organizing tourist photography exhibitions, producing promotional exhibitions, distributing promotional materials, and connecting tourist cooperation exchanges, the company promoted the overall image of the tourist industry, high quality tourist products and luxury tourist projects, consolidated the customer base market in Xinjiang, fully appreciated the brands of the Chinese company, enhanced the influence and popularity of the city of Xinjiang in the Northwest region, and attracted more tourists to the Xinjiang tourist experience.
The Deputy Director of the Office of Public Procurement and Commerce of the city of Baoding said: "At this event, all departments, all county districts and all development areas of Baoding actively interacted and coordinated the implementation of a large number of good projects and big projects.
As of now, 41 signed projects have been implemented, involving a total amount of 260.43 billion yuan.
In recent years, the company has focused on building international cities along the Belt and Road Initiative, the leading cities in the equipment manufacturing industry, the leading cities in the historical culture and the beautiful cities of happiness in the residential and commercial sectors, continuously enhancing the industrial cluster, logistics hubs, integrated services, open high ground, human concentration, and accelerating the pursuit of transcendent and high-quality development.
The total output of the region reached 218 billion yuan in 2017, an increase of 8.7%.
He has been honored with more than 20 national-level honors, including the National Civilized Cities, National Ecological Garden Cities and Chinese Residential Environment Awards.
The Standing Committee of the Urumqi Municipal Commission, Deputy Mayor Shinai Min explained that Urumqi, as a major town on the Silk Road, has special geographical advantage, since ancient times it has connected Tian Shan North, communicating Xinjiang and mainland, and important passage through China to Central Asia, Western Asia and Europe, is an important window for China's opening to the West and cultural exchange with foreign economic and investment environments.
The event focused on equipment manufacturing, logistics trade and tourism industry, and with the opportunity to cooperate and cooperate in a broad sense, the colors of the city were bright in Urumqi.
During the talks, local customers in Xinjiang signed six projects with the districts of Baoding County, involving RMB32.5 billion.
On that day, foreign guests from Kyrgyzstan's representative of the Visa Board in Urumqi, Russian New Siberian Law Limited, Tajik Chamber of Commerce in Urumqi and Russian Chamber of Commerce in Tashkent attended the talks.
About 500 people from the department and enterprises, including the Urumqi City Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Commerce, the Agricultural Bureau, the Tourism Bureau, and media attended the talks.
The revitalization of the Northeast is about the development of the country.
Industrial enterprises in the North East are more important than the foundation, and for the North East, innovation is development, and innovation is the future.
The Secretary-General was shocked to see whether the old industrial base could be re-energized and released.
North Korean Foreign Minister Lee Yong-hoon told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen North Korea's distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for North Korea to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Li Yong-yeon said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken very friendly steps over the past year, including halting missile and nuclear tests, demolishing nuclear test sites, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
But we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States, he said.
If you don't trust the United States, you don't have confidence in our national security, and in such a situation, we can't unilaterally give up our weapons.
Although Lee Yong-hyun repeatedly complained that North Korea opposed the United States' nuclear phase-out, his speech was significant because there was no complete unilateral rejection of nuclear decommissioning, as North Korea had before.
Li Yong-yeon mentioned the joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Trump on June 12, when Kim Jong-un agreed to the efforts to nuclear-armed the Korean Peninsula, and Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States also refused to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States insisted on going nuclear and increasing sanctions pressure to achieve the goal in a high-pressure manner, and even refused to issue the Declaration of the End of the Korean War.
The idea that sanctions can make us kneel down and ask for forgiveness is that those who don't understand us are dreaming.
But the problem is that these continued sanctions deepen our distrust.
Li Yong-yeon did not mention the plans for the second delegation meeting, which the US president mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he stressed Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Wen Han during three meetings in the past five months, saying: "If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea and not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so persistent".
China announced that it has reduced import tariffs for 1,585 tax purposes since November 1, 2018.
Since this year, China has actively reduced import tariffs.
On May 1, the total tax reduction on drugs will be reduced to zero for 28 tax purposes, including all common drugs, including anticancer drugs and biocidal drugs with anticancer effects, and Chinese pharmaceuticals with actual imports.
At the same time, the value added tax burden on the production and import of anticancer drugs was significantly reduced.
Tax cuts on 218 tax-related cars and parts were introduced on July 1.
After the tax cuts, the Chinese car repair tax rate is lower than the average in developing countries, in line with the reality of China's automotive industry.
This tax reduction will promote structural adjustment and resource optimisation, accelerate win-loss, help improve the quality of products and services, and hopefully to some extent promote price adjustment for cars, giving consumers more benefits.
On July 1, the tax on 1449 tax purposes for everyday consumer goods was reduced.
The tax cuts on everyday consumer goods are closely related to the good life of the people.
This tax cut is not only large in number but also powerful, with an average tax cut of 56%.
Tax cuts on everyday consumer goods directly benefit the consumer and promote domestic industry to increase competitiveness.
On November 1, the tax reduction will be implemented on industrial products such as mechanical and electrical equipment, parts and raw materials for 1585 tax purposes.
The appropriate reduction of import tariffs on some domestically needed industrial products will attract more foreign investment, increase effective domestic supply, assist in the upgrading of industry, while helping enterprises allocate resources globally, reduce production costs and reduce the pressure on the domestic environment.
The relevant officials of the Committee's Office of the State Council of China said that the above four autonomous tax cuts and the third step of the tax reduction implemented on July 1 of this year under the scope of the information technology agreement expanded negotiations resulted in a reduction of the total level of tariffs in China from 9.8% to 7.5% from last year.
The adjusted overall level of tariffs is slightly higher than the EU, lower than most developing countries, at a medium to low level, and basically matches the status and development stage of developing countries in China.
The person in charge explained that the overall level of tariffs, as one of the important indicators of the degree of openness in the Chinese goods trade area, should be adapted to the stage of economic development in China and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China's trade in goods is the world's first in scale and already has an economic base for further expanding the open market, but there is still a gap in the quality and benefits of trade development compared to developed economies, and therefore the overall level of tariffs should be reduced appropriately.
Tariffs are a means of protecting compliance, and the level of tariffs should be adapted to the competitiveness of industry, to encourage good competition, to protect too much and to improve quality.
The adjustment of the tariff rate is to match the needs of production and consumption.
The focus is on reducing the large domestic demand, the commodity tax rate that helps to upgrade the transformation of industry, efforts to increase the demand of the people, the import of products with focused characteristics, the increasing awareness of enterprises and the public, and the need to meet the upgrading of industrial structure and consumption structure.
The tax cuts should take into account the affordability of financial revenues and industrial development.
In the choice of specific goods and the amount of tax reduction, the two markets at home and abroad should be coordinated, the two aspects of up and down flow, the two relations of production and consumption, to maintain the steady and good development momentum of China's economy.
The person in charge emphasized that this year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, and China's initiative to lower the total level of import tariffs is a major initiative taken in accordance with China's own needs to achieve high-quality development, which is conducive to the unification of the use of both international and foreign resources, promoting the improvement of the quality of domestic supply system and meeting the consumption upgrading needs of the people's masses.
This action and initiative demonstrates China's determination to pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win, strong support for economic globalization, firm upholding the principles of free trade and the multilateral trade system at the heart of the WTO, and continuing to draw on the development momentum of openness to the world, and allowing China's development to benefit the world better.
Serbia declared itself in the highest state of readiness. The President of Serbia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
According to a report from the Office of the President of Serbia, given that Kosovo forces have taken the passage of the reservoir at the Gazzovada hydroelectric power station, which is controlled by Belgrade in northern Kosovo, Serbian President Vucic ordered the country's armed forces to enter the highest state of war.
On September 29, Minister of Defence of Serbia, Vuřin, declared that the Serbian army had entered a state of complete combat readiness.
Woulin stressed that Serbia will continue to monitor the situation in Kosovo as long as the order issued by Vucic remains in effect, and Serbs will respond regardless of where things go.
According to Russian news agency TASS, on September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he had informed the current situation with the US and Russia and Europe and would travel to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Putin to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When asked whether Serbia needed Russian military support like Syria, Vucic replied: "I don't want any major military conflict on our territory".
Vucic also said that Serbs entered a state of complete combat readiness only to form a deterrent to prevent the conflict, but it was also a clear warning: no violence in Kosovo will be tolerated.
The Serbian military's increased readiness is linked to two major moves in Kosovo.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, the Albanian people have been arresting Serbs living in the northern region of Kosovo, who have not violated any law.
Vucic said that the situation in the region has been escalating since the Serbian government's head of Kosovo and Metohija office, Marco Yuric, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo army on March 26 this year, and that Serbs have been subjected to inhuman arrests and deportations.
More than 100 people, including the RSU Special Forces, armed police and snipers, of the Interior Ministry of the Republic of Kosovo, which was announced earlier, occupied positions near the reservoir of the Gazzovda hydroelectric power station, entered the ecological and sports center near the northern embankment of the Kosovo region and blocked all roads nearby, which were originally controlled by Serbia.
Vucic noted that this military adventure operation in Kosovo, carried out under the auspices of Western countries, and the actions of the Kosovo army without prior notification to Serbia, violated Article 9 (1) of the Brussels Agreement and violated the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military technical agreement between the Secos.
Vucic has already addressed NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, criticizing Western countries for their false statements on Kosovo.
The root of the conflict today is still centuries of historical grievances between the two Sa'a tribes in Kosovo.
There are various claims about Kosovo's belonging, Serbs and Arabs.
Serbia considers Kosovo to be the birthplace and cultural cradle of the nation, as Serbia established its most powerful state here in the 12th century, while the Arabs migrated in large numbers only after the Ottoman Empire invaded and the Serbs were defeated.
The A's insist that the original tribe of Illyrians who lived in Kosovo in the 4th-5th centuries BC were the ancestors of the A's, and therefore Kosovo has been the territory of the A's since ancient times.
Subjective political divisions have led to intense clashes between different ethnic, religious and cultural groups, and to intense opposition between Serbs and Arabs in Kosovo.
In 1912, the Kosovo Avars first declared Albania's independence.
After World War I, large numbers of ethnic Arabs living in the Balkan Peninsula migrated to Turkey, and the Serb population rose relatively, and the Serbs saw the practice of taking back their land as a mere possession, but the Arabs saw it as a plunder of Serbian heresy, and the two-tribal contradictions intensified.
Kosovo has become the Balkan hotbed of the drug.
In 1999, Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army clashed with Serbian troops and police, which led to NATO forces bombing the Southern Alliance of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Kosovo War broke out.
On February 17, 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.
Although there have been rumors that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, it has not been able to sign due to historical national grievances and geopolitical backlash, which are subject to multilateral forces such as the United States and Europe.
A month ago, Vucic first made clear his claim to isolate Serbs and Ars within Kosovo, and once again to open up the contradictions between the two ethnic groups.
Power communication is still interrupted, and the difficulty of rescue of the tsunami accompanied by the strong earthquake in Indonesia is heavy
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early hours of 30th, a strong earthquake and tsunami that triggered the death toll of 420 people in the province of Sulawesi province of the country, Bangalore province, on 28th.
Wilem Rampangilei, head of the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency, said the figures were only preliminary statistics for the city of Palou, the capital of Central Sulawesi province, about 80 kilometers from the quake, because of the lack of large search and rescue equipment, and many hotels, shops and warehouses that were damaged by the earthquake had not yet been searched.
Local time: September 29, 2018, Indonesia's Baalu, a bridge destroyed by an earthquake and tsunami, collapsed for several sections.
Due to severe damage to power and communication facilities, the earthquake affected the province of Cingapura and the neighboring Sigi region, which remain unconnected, the island of Cinga remained untouched and the death toll cannot be counted.
According to media reports, the Indonesian vice president, Kara, said the death toll was thousands.
Power outages, communication outages, road blocks, airport damage... the difficulty of rescue work after the powerful earthquake and tsunami is heavy.
Due to power outages, some hospitals and rescue sites in Palou need to be powered by fuel.
The roads entering and leaving the city were blocked by landslides, and large transport vehicles including petrol vans could not enter, which made the fuel supply very tight.
Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs, Agus, said that emergency relief supplies such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food and household items, which the ministry had transported from neighboring South Sulawesi and Kolomonos provinces to the affected areas, had not yet arrived in the affected area due to road damage.
The rescue materials being transported from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster area via Air Force transport aircraft.
Given the damage caused to the command tower and runway at Palou Airport during the earthquake, all commercial flights have been suspended to ensure safety and ensure rescue, and military aircraft are only used to transport rescue supplies and personnel.
Minister of Political, Legal and Security Affairs of Indonesia, who was in charge of rescue in the earthquake zone, Viranto, demanded that electricity supply and commercial flight services at the airport be restored as soon as possible to ensure that rescue facilities such as hospitals are operational and that more rescue personnel and volunteers and aid supplies can be transported to the disaster area.
On 28th, a series of strong earthquakes occurred in the province of Cingapura, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, including a magnitude 7.7 earthquake that triggered a tsunami at 17:02 local time, causing major disasters in the city of Palou, Cingapura county and Sigi region.
China News Agency Beijing October 1 (Reporter) Sunny sunshine, sunny sunshine, full sunshine... Recently, Beijing continued to open the most beautiful blue sky model, leading the people of Wuhan to show pictures on social platforms, and continue to shine happiness in the screen, calling the blue sky white cloud, the blue sky and the American sky line, this is the best film in Beijing.
Since August, Beijing has hosted the brightest blue sky.
Within the city, people can be seen anywhere, anytime, with a smartphone or a camera camera camera.
On social platforms such as Weibo, Weibo, Weibo, and Weibo, you can see the palace, the Tian'an Gate, the bird's nest, the gaps in the cameras of netizens everywhere.
Some netizens said that such a bright flash flash was the best city propaganda film in Beijing; and some netizens said that if such a blue sky long-term brush screen, people with spinal cord disease can be cured; and others hope that the blue color will make the sky blue for the fourth season in Beijing.
Why do people in Beijing love the blue sky so much?
It is only because the people who lived in this city suffered from fog that they especially longed for blue skies, and after Beijing sounded the "Blue Sky Defense War", the fog has decreased and the blue sky has increased, and the people look happy in their eyes and hearts, and the happiness gained is also a huge part.
On the day of National Day, Beijing weather is nice.
By 8 a.m., the vast majority of the 35 air quality monitoring stations across the city were green with a green-light green.
The contest for the most blue sky photography on social platforms, which was voluntarily organized by the public, is still ongoing.
Why is the sky in Beijing so blue recently?
According to the relevant head of the Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, in August this year, Beijing's average concentration of PM2.5 particles was 35 micrograms/cubic meter, setting the best record in almost five years.
PM2.5 real-time concentration in September was even higher than the current frequency.
One of the major factors that led to the emergence of the most blue sky is the overall favorable weather conditions in recent times, and more importantly, Beijing has been steadily implementing air pollution governance, has pushed forward the Clean Air Action Plan for the past five years, and has continued to release environmental benefits, which have reduced the total emissions of pollutants in the region, which have laid the foundation for continuous improvement of air quality.
Beijing officially launched and implemented the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 in 2013.
According to the plan, the official continued to guide the non-capital function evacuation, promote energy cleanup replacement and pollution reduction work, and eliminate a total of 4923 coal-burning boilers.
Beijing has also become the first major city in mainland China to achieve full network natural gas conversion.
Data shows that the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased by 35.6% between 2013 and 2017; the number of days reached the air quality standard increased by 50 days; the number of days in the first grade increased by 25 days; the number of days of heavy pollution decreased by 35 days and the incidence of heavy pollution significantly decreased.
While the air quality continues to improve, Beijing's official, based on a new round of PM2.5 source analysis, released the Beijing City of Blue Sky Defense Triennial Action Plan in September this year. The focus on the current governance phase and pollution characteristics, focusing on the areas of prevention such as diesel trucks, dust, volatile organic matter governance, optimizing the adjustment of transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land structure, strengthening regional unit defense control, focusing on strengthening the refined management of cities, promoting comprehensive green development, striving to make the most blue sky monkey in Beijing city, no longer the rarest and precious monkey, so that it returns to the background of people's photo book and not the main role.
During this Golden Week of National Day, relevant departments such as the City Tourism Committee, Industry, City Administration, Public Security, etc. will strengthen enforcement inspections of the day-night market for tourism, focus on tourism and black elephant disorder, and will impose severe penalties on violators according to the law once verified.
Yesterday morning, the city government held a conference on illegal day trips to deploy special actions to further crack down on illegal day trips.
The meeting revealed that the city has launched a strictly illegal one-day tourism campaign since July 28, focusing on black tickets, black guides, black companies, black cars, black shops and the interwoven interests of the black network.
The special operation has been carried out so far, the city has accepted 39 complaints of one-day travel, a decrease of 63%; this year, the city has accepted 270 complaints of one-day travel, a decrease of 62%.
In the past two months, 248 black cars were seized throughout the city, 158 tourist passenger traffic violations were seized, 29 shopping black shops and performance venues were closed, 13 black companies were seized, 27 black guides were seized, 26,000 ads were seized, 31 illegal daytime travel billboards were demolished, 3 bus passports were seized, 1789 cases were seized, 181 cases were filed by various functions, from heavy fines to 4,480,000 yuan, 111 people were detained for travel violations.
After the illegal day-trip disorder was cured, the market order of day-trip disorder was steadily improving.
In recent years, the city has steadily increased its efforts to curate illegal day trips.
In 2016 and 2017, the city tourism commission received 1612 and 897 complaints of day trips, which decreased by 79% and 44% respectively, but illegal day trips still continue to bounce back and form a black box, black guide, black society, black car, black shop, black net and other interest chains intertwined with the black box.
Specifically, illegal travellers on the streets are known as black tickets, illegal websites that publish fake tourist information, illegal travel agencies or non-tourist agencies that operate illegally, or individuals who operate illegally, or guides that employ unauthorized travel licenses or illegal practices, or vehicles that use them that are not qualified to transport tourists or vehicles that provide travel services to illegal tourists.
In this special operation, the city continued to intensify fixed inspections and mechanical patrols of illegal day trips, targeting high frequency and impactful tourist route sites for illegal day trips, and the relevant authorities sent a team of campers to make daily ambushes, finding evidence of violations of the law after strict inspection.
Among them, the black car park and the black shop park are two of the main focuses of the special operation.
It is reported that without black cars, illegal day trips cannot be made, black cars are easy to spot, remember and find, and are fixed assets with a higher value for each individual.
The relevant departments use road traffic monitoring detectors to increase the regulation of buses and buses on the main routes, and with technical and intelligent means such as technical protection and property protection, they can detect black cars in time.
Tourism shopping malls and black shops are also a focus due to the small number of seating operations.
To strengthen the tremor and the strength of the fight against illegal gambling, every violation of the law was found in the special operation, and each functional department gave strict penalties from heavy to heavy according to the law.
In August, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to illegal gambling, which discussed measures to combine administrative punishment with criminal conviction.
The city tourism commission said that in the future more formal travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out day trips to Beijing, increasing the supply of regular day trips to further clutter the living space of illegal day trips, specific schemes are currently under study.
In addition, the City Tourism Commission is continuously improving the electronic travel information system of the tourism team, ensuring that each team is integrated into the electronic travel single platform regulation.
From a tourism symbol to a digital economy symbol, what has Wu Town experienced in these years
As the permanent venue of the World Internet Congress, how the summit dividend is received is of great concern.
In the five years since the first World Internet Congress, the city has seen changes.
In 2014, there were only 12 businesses related to the digital economy and the Internet in the entire town, and by the third quarter of this year, there were more than 500.
This is a summary of the development of the digital economy in U Town.
The Internet conference was held to inspire local businesses to accept the digital economy and digital wave, and the desire to transform and upgrade enterprises was strong, and traditional manufacturing enterprises increased their investment and research and development in the field of machine switching and intelligent management.
Wu Town Party Committee Secretary Liu said that Wu Town will build a new economic empowerment center in the future.
The development of the digital economy is inseparable from infrastructure support.
This year, Wu Town launched 5G pilot work based on the realization of 4G communication network and free WiFi full coverage.
At the same time, the city of Yangtze, where Wu Town is located, became the first county-level city in the country to build a dedicated international Internet data channel and also became a hotbed for Internet industry development.
Since the first World Internet Congress, Yangzhou has introduced a total of 565 digital economy projects, with a total investment of 377.25 billion yuan, and the core manufacturing of the digital economy achieved a total output value of 8.7 billion yuan in the third quarter of this year, an increase of 13% in value.
Before the war, the town of Wu was a tourist symbol, but later it became a symbol of theater and culture. Because of the Internet Congress, it has now become a symbol of the Internet and the digital economy.
The secretary of the Yangtze Municipal Commission, Sheng Yongjun, believes that the dividend of the World Internet Congress accumulates over time, and therefore, it is necessary to build a platform to accept the overlapping of elements of talent, projects and technology from all sides.
Shenzhen, a native of China, has been working abroad for 20 years, and has returned to his home country to start his own business due to his association with the Internet Congress.
On December 2, he entered the fourth Internet Light Expo with high-capacity anti-fouling digital technology solutions, which were favored by many customers.
Shenzhen chose to start in U Town not only because of the family and home issues, but in U Town, recruiting is easier than I thought, our application also landed quickly, and we have our application in the U Town Smart Parking Project.
A street in U Town, which shows the spillover effect of the Internet Congress.
This highway runs through the town of Yangon from north to south, connecting not only tourist attractions, but also an industrial highway.
On its basis, the U Town Avenue Creative Center should be operational.
The journalist learned that in the future, the U Town Avenue will be the main site for the development of the rural industry, leading the way in the application of smart healthcare, smart retirement, smart governance, and other results, bringing together 80% of the city's GDP and many high-level talents.
At least 410 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake that triggered a tsunami in Indonesia
According to the Directorate of Public Information of the Jakarta Police Department, on the evening of 29th, the earthquake in Central Sulawesi province has killed 410 people, of whom 97 have been identified.
Another 29 people were missing and 540 injured.
Pallu Airport is still closed.
Positive treatment, survival rate of premature babies 29 weeks and older in China is 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries.
China New Internet Shanghai September 30th, National Children's Medical Center (Chenqing Roong) and the Pediatric Hospital affiliated with the University of Patan announced that it has introduced advanced methods in Canada in the program of improving the quality of premature births and preterm births in the Chinese NICU residence in Guangzhou.
The results of the project showed that, with positive treatment, the survival rate of premature babies 29 weeks and older in China reached 98%, which is the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in the survival rate of premature babies and premature babies without complications in very young fetuses.
For the past 20 years, the Chinese government has been focusing on the treatment of newborns.
Currently, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71‰, significantly below the national average, reaching the advanced level of developed countries.
China's NICU Residential Hospital's Pre- and Post-Premature Childhood Quality Improvement Project has significantly improved the quality of life of premature babies through four years of tireless efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, Director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the University of Zhengzhou, said to reporters that while improving survival rates of premature babies, attention to reduce survival rates of premature babies, reduce complications, improve the prognosis of neurodevelopment, improve the overall outcome of the patient, is important for improving the overall survival quality of premature babies and population quality, which is an important concern of the domestic and foreign pediatric community, and is also a key concern of this project.
Through four years of tireless efforts, the project of improving the quality of premature babies in the NICU residential hospital in China, which has included tens of thousands of premature babies aged 33 weeks and below, has reduced the mortality rate of premature babies of childbirth age and birth weight by one-third in the country, while significantly lowering the incidence of severe complications of premature babies, significantly improving the quality of survival of premature babies.
The project established a national network of collaborative improvements in the quality of newborns, introduced the concept of collaborative quality improvement, radiated 25 collaborative hospitals across China, established a set of collaborative methods to improve the pre-natal prognosis and improve the level of newborn care.
The University of Patanch affiliated pediatric hospital is joining forces in the field of neonatology across the country to develop guidelines for the diagnosis of neonatal infections based on the accumulated experience of the project, and provide reference and guidance for the standard clinical treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in the framework of the China Pre-natal Quality Improvement Project, the pediatrics institute introduced the EPIQ method in 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces across the country, working to address the problem of premature infant infection in the newborn care facilities in China.
With over a decade of continuous improvement, Canada's survival rate of premature babies without complications has increased by about one-third. Canada is now one of the best countries in the world for premature birth.
The EPIQ method has now been applied to all NICUs across Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
The pediatric hospital revealed that the results showed a 35% decrease in infection in premature babies after two years of EPIQ intervention, while the use of antibiotics decreased by 20%.
In the future, the Pediatric Hospital of the University of Patan will continue to promote and implement this method nationwide, with a view to reducing the incidence of all complications in premature births and improving the quality of treatment for newborns nationwide.
Currently, there are differences in the level of relief in different regions of China and the disparity is indisputable.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important building unit of the National Children's Medical Center, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role in radiation, and this study covers several western provinces such as Xinjiang, Guangzhou, Guangdong, and Guangxi, in order to gradually promote homogenization and standardization of neonatal therapy nationwide.
It is understood that the University of Patanch affiliated pediatric hospital is joining forces in the field of neonatology across the country to develop guidelines for the treatment of neonatal infections based on the accumulated experience of the project, and provide reference and guidance for the standard clinical treatment of neonatal infections in China.
According to the announcement, in 2019, the coordination center, located in the China Neonatal Collaboration Network of the University of Patan, affiliated with the Pediatric Hospital of the University of Patan, will combine 63 hospitals nationwide to carry out the next phase of national quality improvement in order to promote the standardized development of the level of neonatal treatment in China.
Zhang Taore, director of the Shanghai City Health and Life Commission, said that Shanghai could be the center of Asia, not only reflecting research, but also the construction of the entire service system, and the quality of service and service outcomes should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China's medical level.
Xinmingping: Build a monument to the heroes of the war in your heart, written on the fifth anniversary of the martyrs.
On September 30, the eve of the Republic's 69th birthday, we welcomed the fifth anniversary of the martyrs, and Xi's Equality Party and national leaders came to Tianmen Square to attend the wreath-laying ceremony to honour the heroes of the people.
At this moment, wherever you are, please pay tribute to Ingrid.
Memorial Day is a re-awakening and a wake-up call.
The history of each martyr is a living history behind the names of each martyr.
They have a hot youth, a true love, and a family that is attached.
Yet, because they were convinced that the supreme justice of our faith, the truth of the universe, was right, they were willing to sacrifice everything to save the next generation from suffering.
"One day I will survive, one day I will cry out to China.
Through time and space, the warriors set up a spiritual road sign to guide them in the direction they were going.
Where did you come from, where did you go, what kind of person you were, how did you read, how did you learn, and how did you get the answers?
The memorial is so intense, and the most important thing is to build a monument to the heroes of the war.
According to incomplete statistics, about 20 million martyrs have dedicated themselves to national independence, people's liberation, and the country's strong heroism since the Revolutionary War.
For various reasons, many of the initiates did not even leave their names.
Countless people are passionately pouring ideals with blood and blood, practicing the faith with life, remembering their English name, inheriting their spirit, which is the root and soul of protecting the nation.
This monument to the heroes of the war is a monument that will not allow any damage or destruction.
For some time, there has been a surge of historical nothingness and entertainment.
The distortion of history, the violent destruction of practices, the challenge of justice and conscience, the misjudgement of values, and the public outrage and awareness of the whole society.
The heroes cannot forget.
To act against those who touch the bottom line, and cannot be heard, we must dare to light the sword and defend the dignity of the rule of law and justice.
On May 1, the Hero Martyrs Protection Act officially came into effect.
From the judicial practice, the verdict in some cases is very quick, both effectively maintaining the image of the brilliant and the glorious hero and releasing the positive energy of reverence.
A nation with aspirations cannot go without heroes, and a nation with ideals cannot go without a leader.
Remembering the heroes and calling them heroes has become a universal social consensus.
Currently, there are millions of memorial facilities across the country, and more than 100 million people visit the Shrine of the Martyrs every year.
The human heart is the strongest cornerstone.
To honor heroes, defend heroes, learn heroes, love heroes, and integrate the spirit of genius into the blood of the nation, a monument to heroes will stand firmly between heaven and earth, deep in the human heart.
Reuters Brussels, September 28 - After Italy defied the EU's demands and surprised the market with a massive budget deficit plan, the EU took a non-confrontational position on Friday against Italy, but the EU may take a more radical position if Italy adheres to its bold goals.
Italy's sceptical government aims for a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP over the next three years, indicating that debt cuts are not yet available if the deficit reduction requirements are met.
Moscow, Economic Affairs Commissioner of the European Commission, said on Friday that we are not interested in the crisis between the Executive Committee and Italy, and that he has taken a cautious response because the EU's recommendations and sanctions may have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will convince Italy to adjust its budget plans before Italy formally submits it to the EU Executive Committee in October.
The government announced its plans, and the euro fell to its lowest level for almost two weeks on Friday, while the Italian bond yield hit a three-week high.
If the deficit targets remain unchanged by the October deadline, the EU Executive Committee may reject Italy's draft budget, something that the Executive Committee has never done for any country.
The vice-chairman of the EU Executive Committee, East Blowsky, later said at a meeting in Riga, Latvia, on Friday that Italy's current fiscal plan appears to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Convention, referring to the EU's fiscal regulations.
But he did not say what the reaction would be for the EU.
Bidders can submit their application to participate in this open tender by October 26 this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture ranked China as one of the priority markets for exporting Russian agricultural products.
The Russian Agricultural Supervision Agency announced in May that Russian food exports to China exceeded 1 million tons for the first time this agricultural year, setting an innovation record.
The agency predicts that China could enter the top 10 Russian food importers.

Nearly 1,000 state-owned tourist areas lowered ticket prices, more than half of them more than 20 percent lower
[Summary] As of September 28, 981 sites have been implemented or notified to society as free or reduced price measures (free 74 and reduced price 907); all such sites have been reduced prices in Yunnan Shilim, Dali Three Towers, Yulong Snow Mountain, Guangxi Zhongjiang, Fujian Taipei Mountain, Hunan Zhang family, Hwangsi Warrior Mountain, Jiangxi Three Chin Mountain, Xinjiang Kanas.
To implement the implementation of the Central Economic Working Conference and the implementation of the Government Work Report and the implementation of the decision-making process, the National Development and Reform Commission issued guidance on improving the price formation mechanism of state-owned tourist areas on 28 June. The guidance on reducing the price of tickets of key state-owned tourist areas on the basis of the following guidance (abbreviated as "guidance") demands that the price formation of key state-owned tourist areas on the basis of reasonable definition of the price formation of tickets, innovative price management methods, strict implementation of pricing procedures, etc. be perfected and ensure that the price of key state-owned tourist areas on the basis of a significant reduction of the price of key state-owned tourist areas on the basis of the obvious results by the end of September.
Actively working in accordance with the requirements of deployment, a number of key state-owned tourist attractions have been reduced in price.
As of September 28, 981 sites have been implemented or notified to society as free open or discount measures (free open 74 and discount 907) from all over the world, of which 159 are 5A, 5A, 534 are 5A, and 693 are combined, representing 70.6%.
Out of the 907 sites that were priced down, 491 decreased by more than 20%, representing 54.3%, and 214, representing a decrease of more than 30%, representing 23.6%.
Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi, and Pyongyang provinces have the highest number of discount zones, of which Yunnan has over 100 discount zones, a total decrease of more than 30%.
The government of 8 provinces, districts, cities, and regions of Anhui, Chongqing, and others have all reduced prices for 5A-level scenic areas.
The discounted prices were applied to the highly socially concerned areas of Yunnan Shi-Ling, Dali Three Towers, Yulong Snow Mountain, Guangxi Zhongjiang, Fujian Huawei Mountain, Hunan Zhang Family, Hunshan Huai, Jiangxi Senzing Mountain, Xinjiang Kanas.
The price of tickets for state-owned tourist areas gradually returned to the reasonable range, which is conducive to driving tourism from ticket economy to industrial economy, small tourism to mass tourism, tourism to tourism transformation to the whole region, conducive to forming a positive cycle of optimization of the tourism supply structure and steady expansion of tourism consumption demand, promoting sustainable healthy development of tourist areas and tourism.
The National Development and Reform Commission also stressed that the price regulation of the scenic areas should be strengthened, and the services should be improved in the scenic areas, so as to ensure that prices are not reduced.
In addition, the issues of the reduction in the price of tickets for individual tourist areas reflected in the recent media, such as too small and not to reduce the price, have been examined by the National Development and Reform Commission, which has requested that the treatment be taken seriously and that social concerns be addressed in a timely manner and the reduction be implemented effectively.
The Office of Trade Promotion is conducting a systematic short- to medium-term optimization work
The Trade Investment Promotion Bureau of Macau has submitted a short- to medium-term optimisation work report on the "significant investment migrants" and the "technical migrants" and has been continuously listening to social opinion and continuously optimizing the content of the report and related work, in addition to the work currently under the report.
The Trade Promotion Bureau will introduce the relevant optimization work to the whole society as soon as possible.
Five of them were short-term measures implemented during the year; five were medium-term measures implemented during 2019; one was long-term measures.
In addition, the Trade Promotion Office also undertook a comprehensive review of the internal management system, as directed by Liang Viet, the Director of Economic Finance.
Five short-term measures implemented during the year include:
1. carry out review work. Priority review of individual cases that are due to expire after seven years, cases mentioned in the report of the Commission and new cases of renewal. If there are any unfortunate events or signs of violation of law, it is necessary to forward the case to the relevant judicial bodies to follow up the processing;
2. Field inspections of projects involving large investment in immigrant projects. More than 20 investment projects have been inspected as of late September;
3. A comprehensive review of the current review system. Six principles of the investment project have been re-established in the review of the "Major Investment Immigrant" application; while the review of the "Technical Immigrant" application will improve the relevant approval mechanism through clearly favorable elements for the development of Australia and the conditions for prioritizing talent. At the same time, a list of the top five priority industries for bringing talent has been prepared annually to accompany the direction of the administration of the special district government and to more targeted talent adoption;
4. Continuous increase in information transparency. Including the gradual publication of the rules, rating standards and ratios of the plan from the fourth quarter of this year, and further refinement and public approval data;

Experts of the national filmless-madding field observation and exchange activities for the mould entered the test field to hear the representatives of the team of Chinese Institute of Engineering Yogishuang.
Xinjiang Xiaoi, China, September 30, 2020 (Xinjiang) Dongdan Wang Xiaoi) is located in Xinjiang Xiaoi County, the experimental base for the cultivation of non-membered cotton, the non-membered cotton is popular, the cotton is no less than the ground cotton next to it.
From September 27 to 28, a national non-membrane field-based moulding workshop and exchange event was held in Shaanxi County.
The reporter learned at the observation meeting that the main non-membrane cotton technology system, with Cotton Cotton 619 and its supporting cultivation measures, initially achieved the goal of non-membrane cultivation of cotton fields, reducing the contamination of the ecological environment and the residual cotton of Xinjiang cotton fields, and making significant progress in the research and demonstration of integrated technology of non-membrane cotton.
The academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, a renowned cotton genetic breeder, the chief scientist of the modern agricultural industrial technology system of the country, the cotton system, told Zhuong Ma, the party secretary of the University of Jiangnan Agricultural Forest, about the growth of non-membrane cotton.
The integrated technology we have developed without the use of membranes can fully achieve the cultivation of cotton without the use of earthen membranes, can completely solve the problem of residual contamination and achieve green planting of cotton.
Prof. Yoruba Shung, from the Chinese Academy of Engineering, explained.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton producing region in China, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, the area of cotton cultivation in Xinjiang was 35 million tons in 2017, accounting for 61% of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of earthenware into China in 1982, the surface area of various crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million tons, and the annual use of earthenware is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, cotton earthenware coverage reached 100%, and cotton earthenware coverage accounts for about 60% of Xinjiang earthenware use.
The production of non-film cotton is tested, and the cotton production can reach 320 kg to 350 kg of silicon.
With the increasing amount of landfill in Xinjiang, low residual landfill recycling rate, gradual increase in soil residual volume, and a series of problems such as soil structural destruction caused by residual landfill, which seriously affect agricultural sustainability.
The residual membrane not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a major impact on the quality of cotton fibres.
At present, more than one third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have been mechanically harvested.
In 2017, Xinjiang machine harvested about 14 million tons of cotton.
The machine harvested cotton yielded a large amount of surface area, the shredder on the cotton stock, the rust in the raw cotton shredder is difficult to remove during the raw cotton processing process, and it cannot be completely removed during the subsequent textile processing process, which seriously affects the quality of textile products.
On September 28, a national non-film-based field of mould observation workshop and exchange event was held in Shaanxi County.
To focus on solving cotton field membrane pollution, simplifying cotton planting technology, and improving cotton field efficiency, Yooh Tree quickly led his team through eight years to implement cotton cotton 619 tonnes non-membered cotton technology, adding to the green development of agriculture in Xinjiang.
Yoruba Shinshan introduced that by innovating new breeding ideas, we cultivate 619 cotton in the new range of cotton cotton that is particularly ripe, salt-resistant, low-temperature, and richly produced.
In the southern region of Xinjiang, the 619-year-old plant has achieved a series of support measures such as mechanical support for seeding without membranes, deep improvement of seedlings, deep burial of the drop pipe under seeding conditions, suitable seed density screening and reasonable chemical regulation.
Currently, the non-membrane demonstration base has been established in Akso, Kurle and Aral, with a production capacity of 4,800 kg per hectare.
The production of non-permeable cotton has achieved a high yield, yield, environmental protection and overall efficiency improvement.
Zhang Zhenhai, agricultural technician at the Agricultural and Agricultural Department of the Xinjiang Production Construction Troop Third Division, said that through the research and demonstration of non-membered cotton cultivation technology for nearly six years, the production of non-membered cotton can be fully achieved from 320 kg to 350 kg of cotton production, or even possibly higher.
The potential for the spread of non-film cotton cultivation technology is great.
Zhang Zhenhai believes that currently, non-membrane cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual contamination, but there is still a gap in the current economic benefits of soil cultivation.
Supporting the purchase price of cotton will be beneficial for future promotion.
Yoruba Shun said that next step, he and his team will continue to do in-depth research and extensive promotion of the application of non-film coating, to strengthen the industry and to fully solve the soil pollution caused by the earth's crust.

External aid accused of playing fake ball North control responded that there was no need to have a fake - China New Network
Yesterday afternoon, Beijing Control Football Club (abbreviated as North Control) responded officially to the news that the team's former foreign supporter, Anichebe, alleged that the team allegedly played fake balls. The North Control issued a statement saying that there was absolutely no case of any fake balls on the club side, which was entirely a lie fabricated by Anichebe himself during the arbitration process to cover up the fact that he had violated his contract and for his personal unjustified economic purposes.
At the same time, the Northern District Court said it would reserve the right to pursue the liability of the parties concerned by all means.
According to the British Daily Mail, Nigerian player Anichebe has accused FIFA of allegedly playing fake balls against Beijing North, which he played for last year, including the Beijing Derby in round 21 of the 2017 season.
It was the crucial stage of the Beijing and Super Cup, when the game ended in a 0-2 draw against Beijing and Anishebi.
The official response from the Northern Control club yesterday was to the Nigerian player's claims.
The statement said that after internal investigations before the club, there was no case of playing a fake ball in the games in which the team participated.
Anishebe joined Beijing North in June 2017, and in December of the same year, he refused to return to winter training without any justification.
Currently, the disputes between the two sides have been submitted to FIFA, and arbitration is underway.
The statement also mentioned that the much-awaited false ball allegations were actually lies that Anishebe fabricated during the arbitration process to cover up the fact that he had publicly violated his contract and for his personal unjustified economic purposes.
Its defamation of clubs and defaming Chinese football is aimed at obtaining unjustified economic benefits.
The club does not accept any organization or individual who, for their economic interests and personal grievances, makes unfounded accusations, slanders, defamations and defamations against the club.
Therefore, the Northern Control side said it would reserve the right to pursue the liability of the parties concerned by all means.

Chinese journalists were taken away by police at the British Conservative Party Annual Meeting, and China apologized
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, a spokesman for the British Embassy responded to a question from reporters about a Chinese journalist being taken away by police during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party.
The spokesperson noted that we requested the Conservative Party Human Rights Committee to stop interfering in China's internal affairs and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, and asked the conference organizers to apologize to Chinese journalists.
A reporter asked that during the Conservative Party's annual meeting on September 30, the party's Human Rights Committee held a siding meeting on Hong Kong issues, inviting the Hong Kong opposition to speak.
A Chinese journalist was taken away by the police during the meeting.
Please ask what comments you have.
The spokesperson responded that Hong Kong has returned to its homeland 21 years ago, and the practice of one-state dual-purpose pipeline has been a huge success, and Hong Kong's development achievements have been universally recognized.
Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, and Hong Kong affairs are purely Chinese affairs.
The Conservative Party Human Rights Committee used the party's annual meeting as a symbol of anti-China separatism, and China expressed serious concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We are firmly opposed to anyone and any organization interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any way.

China-US relations are our common asset and need us to look after them together.
He said he hopes that the two countries will have the wisdom to maintain the healthy and stable development of China-US relations with practical actions and jointly promote China-US relations to continue in the right direction.
Wang Xi stressed once again that China must go out on a different path of development from the traditional great powers.
This Chinese-characterized road determines that China will not and cannot repeat the overthrow of the strong country, and that China will neither become the United States, nor challenge the United States, nor replace the United States.
In his speech entitled Opportunity or Challenge, Partner or Opposition, Wang said that the deep symptom of the problem currently facing is that some American friends believe that China will also be strong, even challenge and replace the leadership of the United States in the world.
"This is clearly a major strategic misjudgment.
But this self-imaginative speculation is spreading, he said, and it has amplified existing contradictions, raised new doubts, and made it more difficult and more resistant to resolve specific issues between China and the US.
Wang Xi pointed out that China is on a path of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had a gene that extends outside.
I believe that countries can live together in harmony and exchange knowledge.
China will neither move in the past, present or future, nor demand that other countries copy China's practices.
Earlier, Wang Yi said that China-US cooperation would be a win-win, and opposition would inevitably lose.
China has always been committed to developing a healthy and stable long-term relationship between China and the US, achieving conflict-free, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.

There are 70 short-haul trains per hour from Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North and Fuda to West Qinlong every day, and large areas allow residents within the Bay Area of Hong Kong to come to the port.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, arrives at the port and is preparing to go to the top of the mountain to meet his Hong Kong friends.
Mr. Liu said: "The national holidays and Hong Kong are both holidays, and we intend to challenge ourselves to see if we can walk the 50-kilometer long island route!
He explained that if the high-speed rail is not open, easy to get to and from, and there is plenty of time, they would not dare to try this long distance hiking activity easily.
Ms. Liu, from Dongguan, came to Hong Kong to compete for the piano with her 10-year-old son on the high-speed train, and she proudly told reporters that her son had studied piano for three years and felt it was meaningful to spend National Day in this way.

Under the trade agreement annex announced Monday, the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain President Trump's ability to implement a 25% tariff threat on imported cars while essentially exempting passenger cars, pickups and auto parts from Canada and Mexico from tariffs.
If Trump imposed the so-called "Chapter 232 tariff" on cars for national security reasons, Mexico and Canada would have a passenger car quota of 2.6 million exempt vehicles exported to the United States each year.
According to the attached arrangement, pickaches produced in both countries will be completely exempt from tariffs.
If Trump imposed tariffs on cars, Mexico would receive a tax exemption quota of $108 billion per year for auto parts, and Canada would receive a quota of $32.4 billion.
Both quotas are well above the existing production levels of both countries, providing room for growth for exports to both countries.
Reuters Washington/Mexico, September 28 - Mexico said Friday that after days of debate, the administration of US President Trump and Canada are making real efforts to resolve trade policy differences, which will make the outside world look forward to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a trilateral agreement.
While details are lacking, the obvious progress made above is enough to prompt the Mexican and US governments to suddenly stop publishing the text of the bilateral trade agreement and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the US government had made a new counter-proposal to the Canadian government, and said he would continue to push all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Mexico's Minister of Economy, Ildefonso Guajardo, said the time to submit the text of the bilateral trade agreement to Mexican and US legislation was delayed because the Canadian and US governments were very serious about trying to reach an agreement.
Guaraldo said that in the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a text of a trilateral agreement or whether we have to publish the text of the bilateral agreement.
Guaraldo said that his U.S. and Canadian counterparts specifically asked him to delay the publication of the text.
A spokesman for the USTR's Office of Trade Representatives did not comment on the text of the bilateral trade agreement between the US and Mexico and the consultations between the US and Canada.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Foreign Minister's Office did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
According to foreign media reports, two lions playing together in a nursery in the suburbs of Pretoria, South Africa, it is difficult to see any anomalies, but they are not alone.
The University of Pretoria announced: "This is the first ever artificial insemination of a young lion - the first pair in the world".
Scientists at the school are working to study the reproductive system of the African lion mother.
Ganswint, director of the University of Pretoria's Institute of Mammals, said the two young lions born on August 25 were healthy and normal.
His team finally achieved this breakthrough after 18 months of intensive testing.
Ganswint said in a media interview: "We have extracted semen from a healthy male lion.
Next, researchers performed artificial insemination for the hormone in the body of the lion when the hormone content was the right level.
Gunswitt said: "I'm lucky that the result was successful.
He said that the researchers had tried several times, but unexpectedly, they did not spend much energy.
He said the previous study broke repeatable proof, and scientists hope to use this technology to save endangered large cat species.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature notes that lions have become extinct in 26 countries in Africa, and the total number of surviving wild lions has decreased by 43% over the past 20 years to about 20,000.
The African lion is listed as endangered by the organization.
Ganswint said: "If we don't do something about these animals, they will face extinction".
He said that this new technology does not have to allow lions to be fed, but only to inject sperm into the bodies of fertile female lions, as was done in North America and Europe with captive elephants.
South Korea's September export decline was the largest in more than two years, but analysts blamed the decline on fewer working days and said that despite rising trade tensions between China and the US, global demand for South Korean goods remains strong.
Indeed, South Korea's exports increased on the last day of the month.
In addition, initial value data released earlier showed a double-digit increase in exports in the first weeks of September before long holidays.
South Korea's September export comparative decline was the largest since July 2016, a decline greater than the 5.7% decline forecasted by the 11 analysts surveyed by Reuters.
The initial value announced on Monday showed that September's exports amounted to $50.6 billion, down from $51.2 billion in August.
Despite concerns that the escalating trade dispute between the US and China could also lead to other Chinese neighbors who depend on exports, South Korea grew 7.8% against China in September, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month.
South Korean exports to the United States fell 11.8%, due to declining oil sales.
Overseas sales of Korean memory chip and petroleum products grew 28.3% and 13.5%, respectively, despite market concerns that the so-called chip chip chip supercycle cycle may have already peaked.
However, the impact of the trade conflict will be difficult to avoid, as South Korea's exports are largely dependent on the US and Chinese markets.
Imports fell 2.1 percent to $40.8 billion, not much lower than the 3.1% growth forecasted by the Reuters survey.
The trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that the global manufacturing industry will continue to thrive thanks to the US and EU countries, which is a favorable factor for South Korean exports.
The statement noted that the increase in export prices caused by the rise in the price of crude oil will also benefit exports in the second half of this year.
But the continued trade conflict between the United States and China, plus the increased market volatility after the US rate hike, are negative pressures on exports.
The average weekday export in September increased to $2.6 billion, to $2.1 billion in August.
This year, the Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26, so there are only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.
South Korean exports for September 1 grew by 4.7% compared to the same period last year.
According to the Japan Journal/Markit Procurement Manager Index, manufacturing activity in South Korea picked up in September, but was supported by domestic orders as orders from China and Japan fell, which may cloud the prospects for further exports.
North Korean media criticized the US for not relaxing sanctions against North Korea
North Korea's Labor News reported a signed commentary on September 30 that criticized the United States for not relaxing sanctions on the North while seeking dialogue with the North, saying it was a self-contradictory practice.
The article said that US Secretary of State Pompeo on 14 said that the key to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the implementation of the sanctions against North Korea, stressing the unchanging position of the United States to continue to implement the UN sanctions resolution.
In a joint statement from the North-South Singapore, the two sides pledged to establish a new North-South relationship that would be in line with the aspirations of the people of the North and South Korea who hope for peaceful prosperity.
The US has increased pressure on sanctions and demands dialogue, and this is undoubtedly contradictory.
If new relations are to be established, if a permanent peaceful establishment is to be established on the Korean Peninsula, and if the Korean Peninsula is to be completely denuclearized, trust building should be put first, starting with what can be done, and solved step by step.
The article also said that the US should understand that sanctions imposed on North Korea are not effective.
The article says that even the North Devensk, which preceded the tank tank, has made the US Army applaud.
The National Interest Magazine quoted the US Navy as saying: "We will encounter a powerful potential adversary. Just look at the North Korean Devensk submarine".
The current commander-in-chief of the US Navy in Europe, Fogo, also praised the submarine Devensk.
He said: "The submarine is impressive. Look at the development of the Russian Navy and how it uses resources, and the main effort it has made in research and development is first of all to strengthen the submarine fleet".
But the National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains its advantage over Russia in this area.
Fogo said: "I believe that Western countries still have an asymmetrical advantage".
Earlier, it was reported that the Russian Navy will deploy the tank tank tank tank tank in 2019.
The new Siberian submarine, the Krasnoyarsk submarine, and the Alhangelsk submarine are all multi-purpose submarines of the improved type of the M-class, with a discharge of 13,800 tons, a depth of 520 meters, a crew of 64 people, and underwater speed of 31 knots.

Recently, Chinese President Xi Jinping invited Russian President Putin to attend the Fourth Eastern Economic Forum.
This is his first time attending the forum.
Ignore the threat from the United States!
The EU or Iran will reach an agreement on crude oil procurement
The US government announced yesterday that it would resume a new round of sanctions against Iran in November, and even urged other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
However, the US allies seem not to listen.
According to the New York Times, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed in an interview on the 29th that despite the threat of sanctions from the United States against any country doing business with Iran, Tehran is close to reaching an agreement with the EU on the sale of crude oil.
The central purpose of the agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, which will replace transactions in the dollar in e-currency or in fiat currency.
The purpose of this approach is to try to circumvent the United States and prevent the United States from obstructing financial transfers.
Meanwhile, while the EU is working to push for the agreement, some French and British officials also fear that if it is achieved, it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the US against the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal.
In an hour-long interview, Zarif's words sounded more optimistic than in recent months, according to US media.
Because the agreement has the ability to strip away the traditional allies of the United States, effectively breaking the US' attempts to cut Iranian income.
This will ensure that we sell oil and profit. According to Zarif, countries have the legal right to trade with Iran under the agreement reached in 2015.
Federica Mogherini, EU foreign policy chief, also said that no sovereign country or organization can accept others to decide who they can trade with.
However, she also predicted that before the next round of sanctions was imposed by the US government in November, US leaders could take a series of financial measures aimed at targeting banks, businessmen and countries that have business ties with Tehran.
In May, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds of the deal's flaws, saying that the agreement could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US subsequently threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other commodities from doing business in the US.
This threat has forced some companies to evacuate Tehran and the Iranian currency has plunged.
Airlines Bus Company and French oil giant Daval have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iran.
British and French officials have said that the US government may be taking over the upheaval.
However, according to a recent Turkish media report, the US sanctions do not seem to have had much impact on Iranian oil exports.
Iran's oil minister Zane Gein revealed yesterday that no country except South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani both believe that the US has committed a series of actions aimed at seducing Iran into breaching the agreement.
Zarif also laughed when asked whether the United States would overthrow the current Iranian government under increasing financial pressure, saying that it was a regime change strategy, which was the real purpose of the US.

The journalist learned from the National Health and Health Council that the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in China has decreased compared to decades ago, while the incidence of obesity has increased significantly.
Experts point out that maintaining a healthy weight is the most important idea, and the most important idea is to cure diseases without any illness.
According to the National Commission for Health and Wellness's recent release of the China Youth Health Education Core Information and Explanation (2018 edition) "The key to maintaining a healthy weight is a sound diet and scientific exercise.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are all bad for health.
The health risks behind the fat monkey should not be ignored.
Ding Steung, director of nutrition and health at the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control, said that being overweight is harmful to teenagers' normal growth and development, adversely affecting their psychology, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and even leads to high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high blood fat in children.
At the same time, teenagers who are overweight are prone to prolonging into adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes in adolescents after adulthood.
Deng Xiaoping said that the nutrition and health status of Chinese residents in 2010-2012 showed that China's children aged 6-17 years had a 9.6% overweight rate, and the obesity rate was 6.4%, and the two combined were 16%.
At the same time, childhood adolescents are overweight, with boys being more likely than girls, cities being more likely than rural areas, and the prevalence of obesity has increased significantly in recent decades.
How do teenagers cope with being overweight?
Zhang Zhang, deputy director of the National Sports Agency's Center for Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion Research, noted that the main reasons for teenage obesity are excessive heat intake and lack of physical activity.
For this simplicity of obesity, scientific exercise should be focused on along with reasonable dietary control.
Zhang Liu pointed out that maintaining a healthy weight is the most important concept, and that the most important part is the comprehensive comprehensive education of schools, parents and students, the spread of the dangers of overweight and obesity, and the improvement of prevention awareness among adolescents.
Adolescents should regularly undergo physical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight, and early find out and scientifically judge whether overweight and obesity problems occur, so that timely interventions can be taken.
For adolescents who are already overweight, Deng Xiaoping recommends that, in addition to the scientifically proactive planning of diet and exercise, adolescents in a special physiological stage should avoid using hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and lose weight, and should not blindly take weight loss medicines.
Reuters, Sept. 28 - Facebook (FB.O) said Friday that the hackers stealing digital landing codes that allowed them to access nearly 50 million user accounts, involving an unprecedented face-to-face, was its worst security breach ever.
Facebook has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, saying it is not yet clear whether the attackers abused any accounts or stole personal information.
The company has not found the location of the hackers, nor is it certain whether the hackers targeted specific victims.
Initial analysis showed that this was a large scale attack.
Executive Director Zuckerberg said in a press conference that the incident was really serious.
A spokesman for the company said his account and that of Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg were also affected.
Facebook shares fell 2.6 percent on Friday, dragging down the main stock index on Wall Street.
A US congressman said Friday that the attack could increase the outside world's cry for data privacy legislation.
This is another sad piece of evidence that Congress needs to take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users, Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement.
Federal Trade Commission Commissioner Rohit Chopra tweeted that he hopes to get an answer on Reuters' reporting on this security breach.

The newly revised Shijiazhuang-Geizhou Waterway Hub Shipping Schedule (hereinafter shortened to Shipping Schedule) officially began to be implemented on October 1, and the Shipping Lifting System officially unified with Shipping Schedule after two years of trials.
On the first day of implementation of the new regulations, navigation in the waters of the Three Gorges-Guzhou River is in good order.
The Changjiang Shandong Aviation Administration released its first safety inspection plan on September 30 at 21 and carried out safety inspections on 160 vessels, a total of 124 vessels qualified for safety inspection.
On October 1, 14, the aviation department arranged the first filtering program after the implementation of the new regulations.
After the new regulations were implemented, the safety inspection plan was published at 9am and 21pm daily, and the filtering plan was published at 14pm and 20pm daily, making it easier for ships to flexibly arrange the filtering plan.
The Regulation of the Shipping Regulations adds to the principle of the ship filtering of ships classified as controlled ships, which clarifies the priority order of the ships according to the positioning of the ship's hull and lifting machine functions, respectively, and adjust the short-line passenger ships that filter to the same priority grade as the demonstration ship and the integrity ship.
This is also the official alignment with the boat's schedule after two years of test operation.
The large long-range demonstration vessels and new energy powered vessels in the Kauai River and Three Gorges basin were also given priority status for the first time.
At the same time, the Zhongchang Shipping Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regulatory Regula
This move is beneficial for ships to choose the right water to stay in, reducing the buffer area for the vessel to stay in.
The regulatory framework also proposed measures based on existing characteristics of filtering and waiting for filtering, such as the cancellation of declarations of violations by vessels and the delay of filtering 24 hours.
After the water accumulation of the Three Gorges, the conditions of the Ku Zhong shipping have improved, which has facilitated the rapid development of the Yangtze shipping.
Data shows that the volume of cargoes shipped by the Three Gorges and the Gezhou ships grew from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons in 2017, respectively.
The tri-state lifts have been tested for two years, carrying 5,767 passengers, 16,220,000 passengers and 171,280,000 tons of cargo.
Chen Jingyu, deputy director of the Three Gorges Administration of Navigation, said that the regulation of the Shipping Regulations has a positive role in promoting the integrity of the filtration management, maintaining the order of the two hubs, easing the pressure of ships in Shipping Zone, and improving the navigation capability.

With the approval of Prime Minister Li Keqiang, the State Council issued a press release on the decision to further simplify the approval process and the management of the license catalogue for production of industrial products for reducing pressure.
The decision was taken by the Ministry of Finance to further reduce the management of the production licenses for industrial products, abolish the production licenses for 14 categories of industrial products and transfer the production licenses for 4 categories of industrial products to the quality and technical supervision department of the provincial government under the management authority of the production licenses.
The reform will reduce the pressure on products under license management for production of industrial products from 38 classes last year to 24 classes today.
Liu decided to clarify and simplify the approval process for products in the catalog.
One is to convert the pre-certification product inspection of the certification body organization into a product inspection qualification report issued by the qualified inspection testing body when the company submits the application.
Secondly, after the product review, which is licensed to the quality technical supervision department of the People's Government (PMO) at the provincial level, except for hazardous chemicals, the company submits the application and product inspection qualification report and commits to guarantee the quality safety of the product, the production license can be obtained only after the formal review qualification, and then undergo the field review within the stipulated time.
Third, the different categories of products in the enterprise production and operation directory, in accordance with the principle of the one-to-one certification, when applying for a new license or applying for a license for exchange, a license is issued simultaneously.
The decision was made to request that the regions and relevant departments strengthen their efforts to promote pressure reduction catalogs and simplify approval procedures.
Increasing the strength of the workforce of the undertakings' commitment to public and postponed on-site review, strengthening credit supervision and restraint measures, implementing the responsibility of the entity for corporate quality, and revoking production licenses once and for all for false commitments that do not meet the requirements.
The products that have been abolished for the management of licences for production of industrial products, and the effective reinforcement of post-procedure regulation, and products that involve public health and safety and environmental protection, can be converted into mandatory certification, list positive lists and publicity to society, uniform certification standards, reasonable reduction and certification testing projects, mandatory certification fees are the burden of all levels of finance according to the system.
Support measures were taken to encourage companies to voluntarily certify themselves, promote brand establishment and market expansion.
To promote the improvement of the quality of industrial products, standards should be advanced internationally.
Fully play the role of third party social organizations to ensure the safety of quality of industrial products.
To improve the standards system for products that retain industrial product production license management, to exercise industry regulatory advantages, to strengthen who approves who regulates who approves who regulates who assesses the responsibility of who approves, to dynamically assess product quality safety risks, to reduce the pressure on the directory in a timely manner, to reduce approval authorization or to switch to certification management.
China's overall PMI ratio improved in September, while the PMI ratio for manufacturing fell.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China on September 30 showed that China's overall PMI output index was 54.1%, 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points higher than the previous month and yearly average values, indicating that the overall production and operations activity of Chinese enterprises remained stable.
The manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which constitute the comprehensive PMI output index, were 53.0% and 54.9% respectively, down one litre in the same period.
Among them, the PMI of Chinese manufacturing was 50.8%, and the ring-ratio fell by 0.5 percentage points.
Liu Qing said that the PMI of manufacturing this month is mainly characterized by five aspects:
One is the overall stability of the manufacturing base.
Of the 21 industries surveyed, 14 industries with PMI are in the expansion zone, and manufacturing industries such as pharmaceuticals, specialty equipment, electrical machinery and equipment have a higher operating level of 53.5% and a faster growth rate.
The second is a small fluctuation in supply and demand.
Production and new orders indices were 53.0% and 52.0%, respectively, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, and supply and demand continued to remain in a downward state, but expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and import index were 48.0% and 48.5%, respectively, below 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points in the previous month, respectively, and the economy fell to year-on-year lows.
Four, increase the cost of raw materials procurement for enterprises.
The price index for import and purchase of primary raw materials was 59.8%, up 1.1 percentage points from the previous month, and the price index for export was 54.3%, which remained level with the previous month, which was the highest point of the year.
Five is that large enterprises operate steadily and that small enterprises continue to improve their operating conditions.
The PMI of large enterprises is 52.1% and is stable with the previous month, and this year the index has always been in the expansion range of 52.0% and above, and the production index and the new order index ratio have both improved this month, which is the main driver of the manufacturing industry to keep expanding; the PMI of medium enterprises is 48.7%, down from 1.7 percentage points last month, in the contraction zone; the PMI of small enterprises is 50.4%, above 0.4 percentage points last month, up two consecutive months.
The Chinese non-manufacturing business activity index was 54.9% in the month, up 0.7 percentage points from the previous month, and rose for two consecutive months.
Liu Qing said that the non-manufacturing industry as a whole continues to maintain a steady pace of development towards good.
The index of business activity in sectors such as road transport, securities and real estate continues to be below critical points, and the total volume of business has decreased.
Reuters News Agency, Nov. 5 - The president of the Central Bank of Japan, Heda Toriyama, said Monday that the central bank was aware that the long-term implementation of an ultra-loose monetary policy could squeeze the interest rates of financial institutions and could undermine the stability of the country's banking system.
But he said that given the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the central bank of Japan needs to maintain its large-scale stimulus program while closely monitoring the benefits of its policies.
The Central Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under the continuing monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected, said Yang Hide-ta Tōhō in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions take risks more actively to compensate for the effects of the decline in interest rates caused by the low interest rates over the years, the banking system could become unstable once there is a serious negative shock.
Although these risks are not large at present, the central bank will closely monitor the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures, Liu said.
Records of the meeting of the Central Bank of Japan, which were released earlier on Monday, show that at the September meeting of the policy committee of the Central Bank of Japan, the cost of long-term easing policy was discussed.
The meeting records show that a member said that if the economy continues to expand, the Bank of Japan will have more room for policy flexibility in the future.
The meeting records show that another member said that given the limitations of the policy duration, the committee should discuss how long the central bank of Japan can sustain the stimulus policy.
Heida Toriyama said that the central bank of Japan will assess the financial risks of the easing policy, while also considering the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic outlook, which could affect global demand due to China-US trade friction and increasing protectionism.
The impact of such issues on the Japanese economy is temporarily limited, said Tan Tan Tan Tan.
"But how the problem continues, the impact on the Japanese economy could increase", he added.
It is necessary for Liu to continue to pursue a strong monetary easing policy while considering the positive and negative impacts in a balanced way, Liu Heida Tongan said.
Despite the growing disadvantages of the radical stimulus program, such as the long-term low interest rate erosion of financial institutions' profits, low inflation forced the Japanese central bank to maintain the program.
The Japanese central bank last month maintained monetary policy; in the face of the risks posed by the global trade war, Heida Toriyama ruled out the possibility of a recent rate hike.
On June 1, 2018, the company's logo on Cardiff and Tesla electric vehicles in the United States was released.
Under a settlement agreement, Tesla and its executive chairman Musk agreed to pay $20 million in fines to financial regulators, and Musk will resign as chairman of the company but remain as CEO.
The settlement agreement will be the pinnacle of Tesla's two-month unrest.
The settlement agreement, which the SEC disclosed Saturday, will calm investors.
Investors were concerned that the protracted legal battle would only further hurt the electric car company, which is still at a loss.
The SEC sued Musk Thursday for fraud, saying his tweet on August 7 misled investors.
The tweet said he was considering privatizing Tesla at $420 per share and had received funding.
The SEC said the tweets were baseless and the market turmoil they triggered hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the deal could boost Tesla, which has been hit hard by Musk's recent actions.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common's asset management, said the settlement should put Musk under more scrutiny, while not taking any destructive measures to drive him out of Tesla's pipeline.
The asset management company holds shares in Tesla's battery manufacturer Panasonic.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to regulate Musk's communications with the outside world.
The matter was quickly resolved on the terms agreed, in accordance with our market and in the best interests of our investors, including Tesla shareholders, Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday's allegations led to Tesla's $7 billion market cap evaporation, which was $45.2 billion on Friday, down from $47.5 billion for General Motors.
The SEC withdrew the demand in the settlement agreement to remove Musk from the company's position as head of the company.
Many investors say that the punishment will be catastrophic.
I think this is the best possible outcome for all concerned, said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a neutral rating and said the SEC's punishment for Musk was a slap in the face.
He is still important to Tesla as CEO.
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement agreement, nor immediately responded to a request for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
Beijing Morning Post (Reporter Wang Liu) Beijing Morning Post reporter learned from Beijing Construction Group yesterday that one of the core building groups of the Beijing World Parks Festival Park in 2019 - Beijing World Parks Festival Theater Square Project will adopt a multi-colored ETF puzzle film structure for the first time. The 5440 square meter film structure will present six colors of deep red, deep green, orange, blue, red, green, and present a butterfly wing molding under the pull of the Lasso steel thread.
According to Zhang Bao, project manager of Beijing Construction Group, the construction area of the arena is 4,500 square meters, the total installed steel capacity is 1,182 tons, the steel structure roof is supported by a suspended steel tray with 26 layers, and the shape of the butterfly wing is shown below the strap of the Lhasa steel thread.
The brightly colored roof looks like flowers, a dancing butterfly, and the bright colors do not fade due to the passage of time and the wind and snow.
Previously, single-color ETFE membrane structures were widely used in bird nesting and water cube engineering, but multi-colored puzzle ETFE membrane structures are the first in the country.
The reporter learned that because there are very few suppliers worldwide with the capacity to produce multiple color film structures, the material for each inch of film structure is very valuable.
Liu Chang Bao said that to avoid overlapping and friction problems in the position of the tip of the lever, the innovation will also be to adopt the structure of the lever double fork ear lever, which will ensure that the lever ends in the correct position through customary fixed plugins.
The construction of the Beijing World Parks Forum 2019 is currently underway.
Among them, the International Palace Project has completed the hanging of all the rose petals.
The planned project will be in place by the end of October.

The death toll from the strong earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 420 and there are no reports of Chinese civilian casualties yet
The official Indonesian news agency Antalya cited figures released by Wilem Rampangilei, head of the country's disaster management department, at midnight on 29th local time, that the number of deaths from the powerful earthquake and tsunami in the central Indonesian province of Sulawesi has risen to 420.
The official said that this was only statistics for the city of Palou, the capital of Central Sulawesi province, not including the district of Tanggala and the nearby Sigi region where the earthquake occurred, as the two areas are still disconnected and have not received reports of casualties.
Because many roads in the city of Palou were severely damaged, heavy machinery was difficult to access, and search and rescue work was very difficult.
To ensure relief, the Palou airport, which began closing late on the 28th, was closed after reopening on the 29th, and all commercial flights were suspended after the journalist had already issued a boarding pass for the flight from Jakarta to Palou that evening.
After the earthquake and tsunami, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia was able to verify the situation of Chinese citizens in the disaster area through various channels.
As of now, there have been no reports of Chinese civilian casualties.

Serpalo said the problem facing Russian scientists is how to balance the economics and safety of the aircraft.
He said that the characteristic of ultra-fast aircraft is the huge noise impact.
Serpalo said the institute is working with the Moscow Aviation Academy and the Topolev Design Bureau on the development of a full range of civilian ultrafast aircraft, including commercial commercial and large passenger aircraft.
General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private enterprise conference, instilling strong confidence in the private economy moving towards a broader stage.
Xi Jinping's Secretary General stressed that letting entrepreneurs drop their ideas and move forward with light weight has sparked a strong resentment among large entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
The market dynamic comes from people, especially entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurship.
In the 40 years of reform and opening up, tens of millions of entrepreneurs have created stories of innovation, the growth of entrepreneurs groups, and the continuous push for the breakthrough of China's economy.
For some time now, people in society have made some negative and suspicious statements about the private economy.
The so-called "private economy off the field" theory, "new public-private partnership theory" and other misconceptions have raised concerns and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment affect some exporting companies; rapid adjustment of demand structure leads to transformational upgrading pressures; some policies are not coordinated with each other, the effect of policies is overlapping, or the way of working is simple, causing some original intent is good policy to produce the opposite effect, etc.
The intertwined factors, the private economy faced difficulties, some private enterprises faced difficulties, and entrepreneurs expressed a lot of anxiety.
In this context, correcting the misconceptions about understanding, undoing the entrepreneurial thinking packaging, making enterprises work together to develop, government work together to promote development, and the confidence of the market and development expectations have a particularly profound real meaning.
The meeting again emphasized the three important conclusions that have not changed: The status and role of the non-public economy in the economic and social development of our country has not changed!
From the deep promotion of the power of easing the regime, the establishment of a list of powers to creating a rule of law environment that protects the legitimate interests of entrepreneurs, creating a fair competitive market environment, shaping an atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs throughout society, the importance of the Party Central to entrepreneurs and the strength of the system has been unmatched in recent years.
The talks were more specifically about strong policy initiatives to support the development of private enterprises in six areas and launched a series of practical actions aimed at easing the burden of private enterprises.
These are great encouragement to the entrepreneurial community and give more hope to the whole society.
The fog is out, the direction is set, the key is to implement it.
To continuously create a better development environment for the private sector economy, help private enterprises solve development difficulties, help achieve China's economic transformation and upgrade; to make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legitimate operations, feel respected in social life, and inspire innovation vitality and creative potential.
China's economy is entering the process of high-quality development, which requires more entrepreneurs to show their ambition and provides greater space and stage for entrepreneurs to play creatively.
We have reason to believe that with further deepening of reforms and breaking down barriers, the private sector economy will open up better development prospects and development opportunities and move towards a broader stage.
In Mongolia, 46 regulatory certificates have been verified in connection with the import and export link.
China News and Information (Reporter Li Eping) News on November 5th, China News and Information Customs said that starting today, except in special circumstances such as confidentiality requirements, 46 regulatory certificates on local import and export links have been verified online.
In-Mongolian enterprises can apply paperless documents to customs to declare the documents, avoiding the problems of previous on-site merger, paper applications, and repeated submissions.
It is understood that the time of preparation of single certificates for all types of single certificates required for import and export links before declaring the customs tariff is a major factor affecting the overall customs tariff time. To squeeze the customs tariff time and reduce customs fees, the certificate must be reduced.
Previously, 86 regulatory documents required for customs verification of nuclear weapons in the import and export link were involved in 19 sectors.
It was reported that this time, according to the principle of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the cancellation of the
Customs said that in the past, companies had to go back and forth and submit paper applications to the relevant department's on-site office halls, and the process was long and impossible to track the status of the audit in real time.
Now enterprise users can directly log in to the portal website through a single window and apply online.
After the audit was approved by the certification department, the electronic data of the certificate was transferred to customs and the entire process of declaration, audit, customs and feedback of regulatory documents was carried out online through a single window.
Exports to China have increased 20 times in four years or more related to the youth of the nest
Exports to China have increased 20 times in four years. Analysis: The increase in youth in the nest is related to the gap
Korea's exports to China exceeded $100,000 last year, a roughly 20-fold increase from four years ago, reported Korea Associated Press on Thursday.
The analysis suggests that this increase is related to the increase in the number of young people in China who are not in the nest, which leads to the hot sale of convenient food and the increased attention of young people to nutritious meals.
The data was released by the Korean Food Distribution Agency for Agricultural and Aquaculture (AAT) on 5th.
Last year, South Korea's exports to China amounted to US$10,033.9 million and weighed 218.59 million kilograms, up 2,094% and 3668.8% respectively from 2013.
The analysis suggests that the increase in sales of Korean soybeans in China is linked to the increase in the number of young people in nest nesting, which leads to the promotion of convenience food and the increased attention of young people to nutritious meals.
As of this year, Chinese households have broken 200 million barriers, and are expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020, and local food businesses have also been targeting the introduction of various convenience foods by the Zhongshan family.
In addition, the analysis also said that avian influenza is the biggest barrier to entry into the Chinese mainland market.
A bird flu outbreak in South Korea from November 2016 to April last year led to a total ban on imports of the species to China, leading to a sharp decrease in exports, aT said.
China's exports to China amounted to $840,000 in 2016, and due to avian influenza, exports plummeted to $100,000 last year.

National Flag Raising Ceremony Celebrating National Day at the mouth of the river on the border with China
I can't imagine such a spectacular flag-raising ceremony in the border region being more shocking than watching the flag raise on the mainland.
Mr. Zhang, who came from Sichuan to visit the mouth of the Yunnan River at the Chinese border, and more than 500 troop officers, residents and Chinese foreign tourists together watched the flag-raising ceremony at the gate of the country on the morning of the 1st, celebrating the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The River Gate is the largest gateway in Yunnan section of the China-Vietnam border, located in the Red River province of Yunnan, in the province of Yunnan, facing the river from the Old Street city of Vietnam.
As the construction of the national Belt and Road Bridge continues to deepen, the flow of imports and exports from the river to the port has steadily increased as one of the easiest passages to connect China to Southeast Asia.
At 7:30 a.m. that morning, the sun had just risen, and the border area near the mouth of the river had gathered local residents and foreign tourists to the river to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 7:45 p.m., the flag-raising ceremony began in time, and the team of the National Gateway Command team was spirited to accompany the flag to the flag-raising platform at the speed of the Cantonese.
After the commander reached the flag lifting instructions, the flag lifting arm strove out an arc, the bright five-star red flag, like the wings of the Yangtze, generally stretched out the flag, accompanied by the melody of the national anthem.
The ceremony of raising the national flag at important times such as New Year's Day, Spring Festival and National Day of China is not only a demonstration of the Chinese image, but also inspires the patriotism of the people of the border region.
The officers of the ceremonial squad who participated in the flag-raising ceremony said.
It is reported that the National Guard Team, which is responsible for the flag-raising ceremony at the mouth of the river, consists of more than 40 officers from various positions at the border control stations of the river, from the three-person flag-raising group to the full-scale military team, which has had a history of more than 60 years and has carried out national-level foreign service missions more than 70 times since its formation.
The revised Personal Income Tax Law adjusted the standard for taxpayers resident in China to 183 days from one year to the next.
The relevant officials of the Ministry of Finance and the National Tax Administration of China said on the 30th that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing to offer preferential arrangements to people abroad, including people in Hong Kong.
The person in charge said that the regulations for implementing the current personal income tax law have special preferential provisions for the taxation of foreigners, and that individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived for more than five years and have their income from outside China can only pay personal income tax on part of the income paid by entities or individuals in China.
Part of the foreign payments does not require paying personal income tax in China.
The Ministry of Finance, the National Tax Administration, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Commerce also issued notices that expanding the scope of the pre-tax policy to extend the scope of foreign investors to distribute profits to direct investment is temporarily not imposed.
The profit distributed to foreign investors from resident enterprises in China for direct domestic investment is limited to the scope of the pre-tax income tax policy, and the incentive program for foreign investment is extended to all projects and fields where foreign investment is not prohibited.
During the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, some positive messages were released around the issue of the Korean Peninsula.
President Moon of South Korea reiterated North Korea's irreversible nuclear abandonment resolve and said that US President Trump and North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong Un may meet before the end of the year.
The State Department then said Secretary of State Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to push for the implementation of the Singapore summit pledge made by the US leader.
From the beginning of this year until now, North Korea has broken the ice and opened the path of dialogue, the leaders of North Korea and the United States have held meetings, the great trend of calm in the peninsula has continued, and the principle of dialogue to solve the peninsula issue has also been upheld.
First, the essence of the issue of the Peninsula is that the security issue is the same. The key is to achieve peace on the peninsula and to properly and equitably address the reasonable security concerns of each party, rather than one side pressuring the other and one side stressing their demands.
Second, in the dialogue on achieving the denuclearization of the peninsula, there was disagreement on the steps and ways to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, and the long-standing lack of political trust between the North and the United States remains a strong belief that the first and second parties will be able to achieve the same.
At the Security Council's public meeting on the Korean Peninsula in New York, held yesterday, the different voices expressed around the issue of sanctions against the DPRK again highlighted the unchanging nature of these two points on the peninsula issue.
US Secretary of State Pompeo insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula is completely denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov stressed the principle of action-based response to action-based sanctions, noting that the weakening trend should be in line with the pace of North Korea's gradual abandonment of nuclear weapons.
There is no doubt that all parties concerned should continue to fully, completely and accurately implement the Security Council resolutions, but pressure is not the purpose, enforcing sanctions and promoting political solutions are the requirements of the Security Council resolution, both cannot be overridden, and cannot be chosen only one way.
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, given the positive progress currently made in North Korea-North America relations, China believes that the Security Council should consider the timely launch of the reverse clause, encouraging North Korea and relevant parties to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back, every step forward in the process of denuclearization and peace process of the peninsula requires sufficient political courage from all sides.
Currently, faced with the growing expectations of the international community to promote political resolution of the peninsula issue, all parties concerned should show political resilience, make political decisions, implement commitments, solve problems, continue to take the step forward, along with advancing the process of denuclearization of the peninsula and establishing a peace mechanism on the peninsula, jointly launching permanent peace on the peninsula.

Health centers and health stations provide flu vaccination services especially during the National Holidays
The Health Department ordered 150,000 doses of the 2018-2019 four-price flu vaccine this year, and at this stage priority is given to free vaccination of high-risk people, to vaccinate against influenza during residents' holidays, and the health centers and health stations under the jurisdiction of the Health Department will provide vaccination services from 9 am to 1 pm on the National Holidays (October 1 and 2).
In addition to the above measures, the health centers and health stations under the authority of the Health Authority have extended the hours of flu vaccination service from Monday to Friday to 8 pm after the launch of the plan. As of September 30, at 4 pm, 4,158 people have been vaccinated, up from 3,714 in the same period last year.
The free vaccination subjects included Macau residents: 6 months to 18 years of age, 50 years and older, pregnant women, all chronically ill patients, including obese people (i.e. body mass index BMI 30 or above), and staff from daycare, kindergartens, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, all health workers, and Macau residents working at the gambling venue.
At the same time, the Health Department considers it necessary to vaccinate other people, including the public sector, and the Health Department will actively contact the relevant authorities after obtaining a list of vaccines arranged by the health center.
To facilitate vaccination and reduce the time for vaccination in shifts, the Health Department will send healthcare workers to primary schools, primary schools, kindergartens and daycare centers in Australia to collectively vaccinate infants, middle school and young children, teachers and staff, and will also arrange for collective vaccination in senior citizens' homes and homes for disabled people, in larger public sectors or other institutions.

The Health Department reminds residents that people who were vaccinated against influenza between September 2017 and August 2018 and who were vaccinated against influenza between September 2017 and August 2018, will still need to be vaccinated against influenza in September 2018, as the influenza antigen composition of the 2018-2019 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine has been updated, targeting the Northern Hemisphere's 2018-2019 winter and 2019 summer seasonal flu.
The peak flu season in Macau usually occurs between 1 and March each year, later than in temperate regions such as northern China and Japan, and the Health Department urges people at high risk and those in frequent contact with high risk to get vaccinated as early as possible after complications such as influenza infection occur in the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese people and chronic patients.

Reuters TOKYO, Oct. 1 - A quarterly survey report released Monday by the Japanese central bank showed that confidence among large Japanese manufacturers in September reached a year-on-year low, due to rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affecting production, which put pressure on enterprises.
The survey shows little that the escalating global trade friction has hurt the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-scale trade war has hit the business prospects of the enterprise, which could threaten the spending of capital.
Active capital spending is a highlight of the Japanese economy.
The survey called into question the view that the Bank of Japan's robust economic expansion would help accelerate inflation to reach its 2% target, although there were signs that companies were gradually passing costs on to customers.
Manufacturers' confidence has stalled due to the slowdown in exports and weak factory production, which has sparked concerns in the global trade war, said Nan Wuji, chief researcher at the China China Gold and Mineral Resources Institute in Yangzhou.
Confidence is still high. And as business profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to fall.
Short-term surveys show that the large manufacturing economy assessment index in September has deteriorated for the third consecutive quarter from positive 21 to positive 19 from three months ago.
The market's predicted average value is positive 22.
The large non-manufacturing economy assessment index in September declined from positive 24 in the June survey to positive 22, deteriorating for the first time in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey was positive 22.
The survey showed that the average of the indicators for the assessment of the economy of large manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries in December remained stable.
Investors are not interested in the decline in the short-term business economy judgement index, the Japanese stock market index. N225 rose to a high of 27 years on Monday, and the continued devaluation of Japan helped improve the export earnings prospects of Japanese companies.
Capital expenditure is stable.
Despite the decline in business confidence, the latest shortsightedness highlights the robustness of corporate capital spending plans, which are driven by capacity renewal and increased investment in robots and automation to address the labor shortage caused by ageing populations.
The Central Bank's short-term survey showed that large enterprises plan to increase capital expenditure by 13.4% in the current fiscal year ending March 2019.
The previous short-sighted survey was 13.6%.
Nan Wuji said that all enterprise capital expenditure plans for the financial year grew by 8.5%, approaching the pace of Japan's bubble economic era.
He said that given the increase in profit forecasts from small businesses, there is still room for further growth in capital expenditure, but this largely depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence.
Short-term surveys show that the ability of enterprises to transfer costs has improved, and the output price index of large enterprises is positive 7, which is an encouraging sign that Japan's efforts to combat deflation have made progress.
The index for measuring the employment situation of large enterprises reached negative 23, the most compact level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.
Benefiting from strong corporate spending, Japan's economy bounced back from the contraction in January this year in the second quarter.
But the escalation of summer trade friction and disruption of supply chains by natural disasters have clouded Japan's export-dependent economic outlook.
In terms of dollars, the growth rate of services imports and exports was 16.4%.
The Ministry of Commerce website press release quoted the head of the Department of Commerce and Industry as saying that the total volume of emerging services imports and exports exceeded 1 trillion yuan in August, and the growth was faster than the overall.
Out of these, the total export volume of emerging services imports and services reached 11,383.9 billion yuan, an increase of 20.9%, which is 10.4 percentage points higher than the overall growth rate of services imports and exports, and the share of emerging services increased by almost 3 percentage points.
In terms of services exports, service exports continued their rapid growth momentum since 1 August, with exports growing at a rate higher than imports by 5.7 percentage points.
Among them, the top three growth areas were telecom computer and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, and insurance services, with growth rates of 61.1% and 38.8% and 26.5% respectively.
The head of the Department of Food and Trade also noted that the share of emerging services imports increased gradually in August.
From August 1 to August, emerging services imports grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6% of service imports, up 1.6 percentage points from the same period last year.
Among them, financial services, IP usage fees, telecom computer and information services imports increased by more than 20%, at 47.1%, 23.3% and 23.2%, respectively.

Oil prices or the launch of the National Day of Self-Driving can be filled in advance.
China New Net Beijing, September 30 (Reporter Liu Yu) On September 30th, 24th, a new round of oil price adjustment window will open in conjunction with the National Day holiday.
Many agencies predict that oil prices will rise sharply, achieving a triple-digit yield.
Owners who plan to drive themselves can fill their cars with oil before the price increases.
According to data from the RONSAI information measurement, the domestic oil equivalent is expected to increase by about 190 yuan/tonne; the increase in the TKOI information measurement is 220 yuan/tonne.

As of September 28, the US WTI crude futures yielded $1.13 and reported $73.25 per barrel.
Brent crude oil futures earned $1.0 and reported $82.72 per barrel.
From the international standpoint, tensions over Iran, the overall trend in oil prices, and the US sanctions over Iran have been overshadowed, and the OPEC production reduction meeting has subsequently explicitly rejected the increase in production, giving market confidence and steady oil price movements.
Chen Wen, an analyst for the oil products of TZ Creators News, said just now.
In retail terms, the prices of petrol No. 92 and No. 95 at Beijing's China Petroleum and China Petroleum Gas Station are currently at 7.66 yuan/liter and 8.15 yuan/liter respectively.

The 69th International Space Congress opens in Germany - China New Network
News Agency Germany Can't Come to May October 1 (Reporter Lin Zhang Zhenjong) The 69th International Space Congress was held in the Beijing International Exhibition Center in Germany on October 1, attended by more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and enterprises, experts and young students from all over the world.
In a speech at the opening ceremony, the president of the International Space Federation, Jean-Yves Legar, said that global space affairs are no longer limited to a handful of countries and institutions, and that this year the number of participants increased significantly compared to the previous one, indicating that more and more institutions and people are joining them.
He called on countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation and jointly promote the development of space affairs.
Zhang Qian, Deputy Minister of Industry and Information at the Ministry of Industry and Information of China, Director of the National Space Agency, presented China's space program during the exchange event and said that China will expand international cooperation in the space field and contribute to human space affairs.
Representatives of China Space Technology Group, China Space Technology Group and other relevant organizations, as well as representatives of private enterprises, presented the latest achievements of China space, including various types of launch rockets, satellites and space technology applications.
The International Space Congress, held annually since 1950, is the largest event in the world aviation community.
The five-day conference was jointly organized by the International Space Federation, the International Academy of Space Sciences, the Center for Applied Science and Microgravity Research at the University of Bologna and the International Space Law Society.
Reuters Beijing, Nov. 5 - A press release issued by China's Foreign Trade Center on Sunday said that the GCC shows that China's foreign trade situation remains complex and dire, and 80.6% of enterprises expect exports to be better or even in 2018.
But given the continuous increase in the cost of integrated elements such as domestic raw materials, labor, and the increased external environment affected by China-US trade friction, the exhibiting companies also felt that the export situation for next year was not optimistic.
At the press conference closing the 124th GCC, the GCC Deputy Secretary-General, press spokesperson, and Vice Director of China Foreign Trade Center Xu Xiao said that the number of foreign buyers to GCC exports and purchasers to GCC exports were relatively small.
The number of buyers attending the meeting was 189,812, from 215 countries and regions, down 1.11%.
Exports were worth RMB 20644 billion (US$29.860 million), down 1% from the previous year.
From the market perspective, the exchange rate for Japan, ASEAN, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China
From an industry perspective, transportation tools, mechanical equipment, building and decoration materials, electronic consumer and information products, toilet equipment grew 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1%, and 7.6%, respectively, while textile clothing and household appliances declined 13.0% and 6.7%, respectively.
Xu Xia said that as a sign of the weather and wind direction of China's foreign trade, the attitudes of buyers and exporters and exports of the GCC data indicate that China's foreign trade development is still facing many uncertain factors next year.
But with the profound advancement of structural reforms on the supply side, and the recent introduction of policies such as the establishment of a stable and stable economy in countries and regions, the new dynamism of China's foreign trade development is accelerating and the diversification of enterprise markets is continuing to make new advances, which are important foundations and strong conditions for foreign trade development.
The overall factors are expected to keep China's foreign trade imports and exports steady throughout the year, and the quality and efficiency will be further improved.
China's General Customs Administration announced that US dollar exports grew 14.5% in September, imports grew 14.3% in September, and the trade surplus in September was $31.69 billion, the highest growth rate in September and trade surplus since February this year.
Despite China-US trade friction escalating, China's export performance in September was still significantly above expectations, and the booming external demand, the overlap of yuan exchange rate devaluation or the main supporting factors before the imposition of tariffs in the United States, also showed to some extent the resilience of China's foreign trade, but the impact of the China-US trade war on confidence and the impact on the industrial chain is not small. Analysts believe that the challenges of China's foreign trade may manifest in the fourth quarter or next year.
Reuters' investigation showed that the US fund manager suggested in September to increase cash holdings and continue to maintain a cautious stance as the US and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs, and there were no signs of easing the dispute.
But according to the recommendations of the 12 fund managers involved in the survey, the North American asset allocation increased to the highest level since June 2017, while holdings in the UK, euro area and especially emerging markets decreased.
The global share allocation ratio averaged 56.6% and bond ratio was 35.5%, basically consistent with last month's survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash distribution ratio has increased to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager at a large fund company said that some economic data has brought confidence to the market, but the trade war remains the biggest concern, so it is best to be prepared to enter when the market falls.
But the fund manager still preferred stocks in September, especially U.S. stocks, even if U.S. stocks were considered price-high.
Today, the first major national exhibition on import themes in the world - China International Import Expo - officially opened in Shanghai, China's open landmark, in anticipation of the public.
An exhibition is like a window sill that allows the world to get to know a city and a country better.
Through this window, people see China opening up to a higher level of China; and through this window, welcoming the world to China's mutual win-win with China reforming and opening up and re-emerging.
Opening up for a country is like breaking a butterfly, and although it will be painful for a while, it will be a new birth.
General Secretary Xi Jinping summed up the path of openness and pointed out one important reason why China is so successful.
Recalling 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which dared to enter the world market and the ocean, despite the filters and waves, always faced all the risk challenges with an open gesture, constantly releasing internal vitality and constantly improving competitiveness.
It can be said that China has strongly interpreted the value and meaning of openness with its own realistic achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point, the exhibition on imports was a major decision taken by the Party Central, with comrade Xi Jinping at the center, to promote a new round of high-level open outdoor activities, a major initiative of China's initiative towards opening up the world market, and a practical action by China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization.
The list of exhibitors from all countries is dynamic and a challenge to be asked for, which is the greatest affirmation and best response to China's open economy in a broader, broader field and deeper development.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries are building high walls of trade protectionism, backing the old path of unilateralism, which has increased international concern about the prospects of free trade and added uncertainty to the warming world economy.
In such a context, Huangpu Jiangsu's event reflected China's defense of free trade, letting the world see an open market, sharing China's confidence and responsibility for the future.
Walk fast alone, walk far.
China is open to embracing the world and not only has strongly promoted its own development, but also has brought great opportunities to China's countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the co-creation of Belt and Road, launched the launch of the Asian Investment Bank, established the Silk Road Fund ... China has provided a range of international public products, provided real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, so that enterprises can join China's development of the fast car, the car, the car.
The Expo is also such a public product, a major platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions, with high quality products and services of all kinds, have taken a new step in the Chinese market.
In addition to the enterprises of the countries, the real beneficiaries are domestic consumers.
By building this platform, which is optimized and optimized, multicanal quality supply for consumer upgrades is provided, meeting the needs of the people's mass for personalization, diversity and differentiation of consumption.
As China opens its doors, the bigger the doors, the more goods flow, the more things are used, and the stepping stone towards a better life will be stronger.
From a more macro perspective, the significance of the Expo has gone beyond the economic and trade spectrum, but instead looks to the future, conveying the concept of openness, inclusion, inclusiveness, balance and win-win, and forming a consensus to meet today's challenges.
The world is good, China is good; China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to the Expo bringing the world greatness and fulfillment; we also aspire to a higher level of opening up China to the world and work together to build a bright future for the community of human destiny.
Foreign media: The United States has reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[Abstract] The agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and the imposition of tariffs on cars that are not temporarily produced in Canada.
According to foreign media, a Canadian source revealed late on September 30 local time that the United States and Canada had reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement was revealed to include Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and the imposition of tariffs on cars that the United States does not temporarily produce in Canada.
On August 27, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary agreement on the principle of renewal of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement before the August 31 deadline set by the United States, extending the negotiating deadline to September 30.
Earlier, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said that Canada will only sign favorable agreements, focusing on substance rather than timing. We will continue consultations, hoping to reach an agreement that is in the national interest of Canada.
Over 90% of Brazilian women voters say that the presidential candidate does not consider the needs of women.
According to South American News Network, data recently released by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) shows that over 90% of Brazilian women do not think that presidential candidates consider the needs of women.
The report said that the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million at present, and if women from all over Brazil are brought together to form a nation, the country's population will rank 13th in the world, more than twice the national population of Spain.
In Brazil, women constitute 52% of the total voters, while men account for 48%, while women constitute only 10% of the Brazilian Congress, although the proportion of voters is very high.
Out of 193 countries worldwide, Brazilian women are ranked 154th in political participation, higher than Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women still have not succeeded in getting the rights they deserve.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori points out that this phenomenon exists because of the interaction of ancient patriarchal societies, racism and capitalist values.
Politics should be based on nationalist proposals for civil rights, identity, access to public goods and the formation of a single society by multiple social groups. But politics in Brazil belongs to a monopoly group, and the majority of the population is not represented.
A previous study by the Brazilian Institute of Motor Vehicles (Locomotiva) also found that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that politicians who are elected represent their rights, 90% of Brazilian women disagree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93 percent disagree with the current government's policies.
"We need to reverse the problem of women's representation in parliament, and Brazil's political system remains affected by inequality. So far, there is still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in Brazil's political sphere", said Natalia Mori.
Despite the lack of rights for women, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76 percent of women believe they can play a role in democratic elections and 72 percent of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to reduce the number of women suffering from prejudice.
On October 1, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn flag-raising ceremony to welcome the 69th birthday of the new China.
More than 80 representatives of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, news agencies, financial institutions, Chinese investment enterprises, the Warsaw University, the Confucius Institute and foreign students attended the event.
On October 1, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a flag-raising ceremony to welcome the 69th birthday of the new Chinese.
After the flag-raising ceremony, Chinese Ambassador Zhang Yi said that on the occasion of the 69th birthday of the great homeland, we held the flag-raising ceremony in foreign countries, a profound patriotic educational event.
Although we have been abroad for a long time, we are a great homeland.
Zhang said that the Chinese people are closer than ever to achieving the great goal of national revival, closer than ever to the center of the world stage.
Our mission, responsibility and work is more honorable, difficult and burdensome than ever before.
Zhang Xi stressed that we should not forget the beginning, remember the mission, promote the development of the Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han
The T2 terminal at Guangxi Zhengjiang International Airport was officially opened on 30th.
The secretary of the Zhengzhou Municipal Commission of the Communist Party of China, Liu Liang, said that the new terminal will be able to meet the annual passenger throughput demand of 12 million times, building new advantages in Zhengzhou air transport, and is of great significance for further improvement of Guangxi Jianghai sea link, rail link, water land link, airport junction quadrilateral and modern trilateral transportation pattern.
This year, Jungle is expected to receive 90 million visitors.
The project to expand the terminal and support facilities of the T2 terminal and terminal at Zhejiang International Airport in Zhejiang is a major public benefit project for the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Guangxi-Shuang Autonomous Region and an iconic project for the construction of Zhejiang International Tourism Resort.
The project was commissioned in December 2015, with a construction area of 100,000 square meters, a total investment of 3258 million yuan, and after its completion, it can meet the demand of 12 million passenger passengers per year, starting at 1012 thousand passengers, and 95 thousand tons of mail passengers.
On that day, more than two hundred flights landed at the T2 terminal at Zhejiang International Airport in Zhejiang.
The new terminal building was inspired by the water-filled skies of the Zhongshan Mountain, and looks like a water-filled mountain.
According to the report, the new terminal of Zhongqing Airport will meet the peak traffic of almost 4,000 people entering and leaving the port every hour, using intelligent baggage sorting systems, security integration platforms, facial recognition and other smart airport technology means, and planning for a variety of business areas including catering, grocery, tax-free and leisure entertainment.
With growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets largely uninspiring, the United States is increasingly becoming the main driver of global economic growth.
On September 23, 2018, a container cargo ship parked in the port of New Jersey, USA.
But because the current growth in the United States is due to the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts, the economy of the country is also closely monitored by the outside world.
As the United States is recovering full employment, economic downturn is inevitable.
He said the only question was when it would happen, and in his opinion, it might only be ahead of time or afterwards.
Although Barclays is optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook for the year-end, the bank acknowledges that it is more difficult to make predictions for longer periods.
The current growth spurred by fiscal policy will be difficult to sustain in the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost economic growth potential, economist Liu Barclay said in a study report.
The risk of a hard landing in 2020 will increase, they said, in the face of lack of investment growth.
A series of business surveys will show that the major economies are in the economic cycle phase at the end of the third quarter.
The Eurozone and US manufacturing surveys, which are due to be released next Monday, will be of interest and the services survey will be published on Wednesday.
But next week's data will inevitably focus on the non-agricultural employment data in the United States, which will be released next Friday, and will provide clues as to whether the tight job market is driving a substantial wage increase.
Its importance is not only important for the profitability of enterprises and consumer purchasing power, but also because of the pay jump or the rise in overall inflation that could cause the Federal Reserve officials (FED) to be alarmed.
The salary will be of great concern, as it may rise again significantly from the previous month.
The increase in September may not exceed 3% from the same period last year, but we can expect it to break through next month, the Dutch international group ING economists wrote in a research report.
With the Chinese and Asian holiday periods causing the region to lose data next week, the European political bureau could be a source of market volatility.
The Italian government has ignored the financial commitments made to the EU before, and other EU members will have to quickly determine whether Italy's decision will be strongly opposed. Tricia does not support the decision and wants to abide by EU rules.
As Brexit negotiations enter a critical stage, the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party in Birmingham may also be a fireworks display.
At the same time, with Brazil's highly anticipated presidential election next weekend, concerns about emerging markets are unlikely to diminish.
[Abstract] After completion, the ship will be delivered to the East Sea Division of China's National Oceanic Administration for use. Chen Chen, Director of the Ocean Precautions Monitoring Division of the Ministry of Natural Resources, said that the ship will be put into service and will be of significant significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the advancement of global ocean observation.
On September 29, China's first 3,000 tonne large floating vessel was sunk by the Yang Red 22 torpedoes at China's Wubo Group.
Once completed, the ship will break the bottleneck of equipment currently in China's major floating-point, sub-sealed-point, recycling, and salvage work.
The Sun Red 22 turbine is mainly used for maintenance of floodmarks/submarines regularly, regular placement, recycling, emergency placement, recycling, and recovery of floodmarks/submarines, and has the ability to perform comprehensive marine survey tasks such as intermittent surveys.
The new ship is 89 meters long, 18 meters wide and 7.2 meters deep, with a cruising range of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Liu, Deputy General Manager of Wubo Group, said: "The Yang-Weng Red 22 is China's first large floating vessel and the only domestic large floating vessel with a lifting capacity of 10 meters, which will further enhance China's large floating capacity".
It is understood that the ship will be delivered to the East Sea division of China's National Oceanic Administration after completion. Chen Chen, Director of the Ocean Precautions Monitoring Division of the Ministry of Natural Resources, said that the ship will be put into service and will be of significant importance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the advancement of global ocean observation.
The ship, which has large floating-plate repair operations and integrated marine survey capabilities, is the first integrated vessel in China dedicated to the China-Far East floating-plate operation and marine integrated survey.
With such flagship, our ocean observation and ocean investigation will have a powerful leverage in the future.
China New Network Qingdao October 1 Influenced by the sound of Taipei, the 2018 International Limit Sailing Series, scheduled to start on September 30, Qingdao Station, Mazeo Cup, postponed the first day of competition to October 1, and a pre-race meeting was held in the O-Sail Center in Qingdao before the race.
The storm's strong winds continued to blow in the harbour pool, with maximum wind speeds reaching up to 24 knots, the launch signal delayed from 1pm on 30th for almost 90 minutes, and the wind speed was still not reduced. The race's referee, Anne Mdrand, announced the cancellation of the first day of competition, which will be postponed until 1st October afternoon.
The strong winds blowing from the shore continue, and the sea conditions are really too strong.
Mdrand explained: "In such a situation, no one knows when the wind is blowing towards the racing boat.
Closer to the city, cancelling the race is the wisest option given the current wind conditions.
There is still a certain disappointment for all the crew who are ready.
The racing boat is ready to stop, and we are in good shape.
"But I know that the change of the game is the right choice, and I hope that today the wind will be less, we can get a hand in it".
Omega Wilkinson, the star of New Zealand's hope for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, said: "Loss of a day's time makes the game even more interesting.
Because today's match will increase, and there are only two days left to play.
Everyone will be especially busy.
Despite the strong winds, Pierre Ives Durand, the French ABM team's captain, said in a pre-game appeal that he had a warm relationship with the game's host city, Qingdao. Five years ago, the international extreme sailing series itself suffered an accidental injury, a broken muscle, and thanks to the treatment of the competition medical team, he was able to stand on the field today after five years.
The International Boat Series was founded in 2007 and is a World Sailing League event, alongside events such as Volvo, America's Cup, and the World Sailing Tournament.
The Qingdao Station competition will feature a flying phantom with a double-body wing.
2018 is the eighth year of the event for the sailboat to land in Qingdao, and Qingdao Station is also the host of the series.
Despite the ongoing shaking of global financial markets, the Hong Kong Financial Administration said on Monday that the foreign exchange fund's investment income in the third quarter of this year decreased by 97% year on year, but performed better than last quarter, due to the high tide of overseas stocks and significantly reduced foreign exchange losses under the China-US trade war.
According to the latest data from the Gold Administration, the foreign exchange fund recorded investment income of HK$1.6 billion in July and September 2018, significantly lower than the HK$61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Chen Deong, president of the Bureau of Mines, said in the legislative assembly that at the beginning of the Sino-American trade war, the Hong Kong and emerging market stock indexes were at odds with the US stock indexes, and after the US stock market index continued to peak until late September and early October, market sentiment began to reverse, as investors gradually realized that the trade war was also detrimental to the United States itself.
The change in market sentiment is good, and if the trade war is only one-sided, it will not help much to solve the situation.
But he also pointed out that if the China-US trade war is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise.
In the third quarter, the foreign exchange fund's loss in Hong Kong's stock investments contracted 8% to HK$4.7 billion compared to the previous quarter, while the foreign exchange investment gains increased by 172% to HK$12.8 billion; the foreign exchange loss of HK$16.2 billion, bond gains of HK$9.7 billion, decreased by 24% and 31% respectively, reflecting the general increase in the dollar as the main currency during the quarter and the US interest rate rose by 3 cents in September.
The foreign exchange fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong.
Hong Kong has implemented a link exchange rate system linked to the dollar in terms of portfolios since 1983.
Regarding the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen said that economic and asset market uncertainty increased and downside risks increased, but Hong Kong's financial system is stable, well defended and has plenty of earthquake resistance.
Hong Kong has a rich international investment position, with a net foreign assets worth of $1.4 trillion equivalent to four times GDP, 2.5 times Singapore's and 0.6 times Japan's, and it has enough leftovers to deal with the downturn or reverse cycle.
Recently, the interest rate of the HKD continued to fall and expand with the interest rate difference in the dollar, Chen Deung pointed out that the exchange rate of the HKD had risen by more than 400 basis points on September 21, the market generally believes that the increase is mainly related to the interest rate of the HKD, after which the HKD rose to the level of near 7.80-7.84, until the recent decline of the interest rate of the HKD continued to fall, with the interest rate of the dollar expanding, may attract the market of the HKD to buy interest rate activity in the dollar, which triggered the opportunity to exchange the weak currency again greater than a period of time.
But he believes that as the interest rate cycle of the Hong Kong Bank begins and the interest rate normalisation continues, the situation of future interest rates in the Hong Kong currency below the interest rate in the US dollar will change.
The interest rate in the Hong Kong dollar will be more in line with the trend of interest rates in the US dollar, and we must be more careful about managing risks, be prepared and deal with market fluctuations.
Due to the abundance of capital in the port, the interest rate declined further, with the three-month decline of 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, with the dollar interest rate spread from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the monthly decline of interest created a new five-month low, with the dollar interest rate spread from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
The current exchange rate in Hong Kong has been close to $7.85 trillion for most of the month from May to September.
During this period, due to factors such as the outflow of some of the proceeds from the interest rate and large stock auctions after the end of the auction, the weak parties were triggered several times in May and August after the first exchange of guarantees was triggered in April.
The Bank of China bought and withdrew dollars in the HK$ at the level of 7.85 in accordance with the contact exchange rate system to maintain the HK$ exchange rate stability.
The Bank bought about HGA521 billion in May and August under the weak-side swap guarantee mechanism.
Is there any benefit to foreigners from the new tax law?
When asked by the journalist, the relevant head of the Ministry of Finance and Taxation said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing to offer preferential arrangements to people abroad, including people in Hong Kong and Australia.
A reporter asked that the newly revised Personal Income Tax Law would adjust the standard for taxpayers in our country from one year to 183 days.
Please ask if there are any concessions available to foreigners, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, when the next step is implementing the law.
The person in charge replied that the current regulations for implementing the personal income tax law have special preferential provisions for the issue of paying taxes to foreigners, and that individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived for more than one year or less and have their income from outside China can only pay personal income tax on part of the income paid by entities or individuals in China.
The official said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing to provide preferential arrangements for people abroad, including people in Hong Kong and Australia.
The Moon Moon Center, which has no gates: Quality certification promotes quality improvement.
With the economic boom of the mother-and-baby market, which has expanded from the north to the third and fourth tier cities, there have been various grades of lunar societies in the area.
The current hot lunar meeting has met the consumption needs of the masses, with fees ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan, but at the same time it is in a awkward situation.
The National Market Regulatory Agency recently launched the 2018 National Quality Mango Series of events, and journalists came to visit a five-star Mango Center in Tianjin to experience the certification of maternal and infant care services.
The general lunar center provides services such as newborn care, nutrition meals, postpartum plastic repair.
In the center, the reporter saw that nurses check the condition of newborn breastfeeding every day, and professional caregivers provide care services for newborn babies such as washing, caressing.
At the same time, to meet the needs of the new baby, services such as early wound care, mid-to-late-month beauty care, and care programs such as Chinese medicine treatment beauty, help us restore our body shape.
A new mother who lives in the village told reporters that she had only booked a month or so in advance.
Monthly services directly affect the comfort and physical recovery of mothers during their months, and some small monthly services are limited to simple monthly services, with the dangers of de-sanitary non-normative disinfection, easy cross-infection, and un-scientific diet.
The head of the lunar center said that they are the only one of all five-star lunar centers in Tianjin city that has received the B-level service certification.
Liu said that while some customers initially did not understand the meaning of B-level certification, the certification pushed back strictly standardized process management to benefit customers and is important for the long-term development of the enterprise.
Panlifen, Deputy Director of the Certification Regulatory Department of the National Market Regulatory Agency, said that service certification is a new type of certification system based on customer perception, focusing on the degree of satisfaction of quality management and service characteristics of the organization, and is an important part of the national quality infrastructure, which has a positive role in enhancing the quality of service delivery ratio and enhancing China's international competitiveness in services.
Starting in 2004, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification program has gone through a process of gradual development from nothing, emerging a series of services certification such as financial services certification, maternal and child care service certification, after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification, health service certification.
According to the National Directorate of Market Regulation, there are currently more than 130 service certification bodies in China, more than 2,000 service certification personnel, and nearly 8,000 valid certificates.
Panlifin said that further guidance and promotion of the development of service certification should be given, gradually expanding the coverage of service certification in health, education, sports, finance and e-commerce, and fostering supply-side reform and quality improvement in the service industry.
Reuters Hong Kong, November 5 - Hong Kong housing prices fell for two consecutive months after peaking, and Hong Kong Financial Administration President Chen Deong said Monday that it was still time to see if the housing market had entered the downstream cycle, and if confirmed, a tightening policy on further relaxation of the reverse cycle measures could be considered at the appropriate time.
Chen Deong also pointed out that if the price of buildings were to be reversed, the first people affected by the impact would be people who are employed at the peak of the housing market, but there is expected to be a sharp drop in housing prices, such as during the Asian financial storm of 1997, and the opportunity for citizens to significantly cut the price of selling property is very low.
Senior officials of the Gold Administration led by Chen Deong attended the legislative briefing meeting and said that if the housing market is in a downturn cycle, it can be gradually relaxed when appropriate.
But now we see only a few weeks of data, it's too early to say whether to relax, and it will take more time to see if the housing market enters the downstream cycle.
Since October 2009, the Gold Administration has introduced eight reverse cycle measures to drastically tighten mortgages on all types of property, including reducing the number of mortgages, requiring mortgage applicants to undergo rigorous stress tests, and so on, to improve bank risk management and earthquake resistance.
With Hong Kong officially entering the rate hike cycle, the private housing price index for Hong Kong in August and September saw a two-month downturn, and the monthly drop in September expanded further to 1.44%.
But the cumulative increase in the third quarter of this year was still 10.2%.
According to the Financial Services Authority, the household financial situation of Hong Kong's ability to measure its financial risks against earthquakes remains healthy, and in the second quarter of this year, the proportion of households living in homeless homes in Hong Kong reached 66%, which is 60% higher than the 2009-11 average; the average number of new batches of mortgages and the supply and interest rates of new batches of mortgages were 47% and 34%, respectively, and the 64% and 41% respectively improved significantly in 2009-11.
But Chen said that high earthquake resistance does not mean that the already employed citizens will not be affected by the economic downturn, because property valuations will fall and those who buy buildings at peak times will take the first step.
While the Bank's lending to mortgage lenders is tightly regulated by the Gold Board, mortgage lenders can also get high yields through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Chen Deung said that the current number of mortgages offered to developers, along with mortgage loans, can reach 85-90%, and if the price of buildings falls by 10%, negative assets will appear (i.e. the market value of real estate will fall below the level of the total unpaid mortgage loan).
However, the Vice President of the Banking Bureau, Zhang Heng, noted that the authorities estimate that the total number of mortgages offered by developers is high, accounting for only 2-2.5% of the total bank mortgage, which is still low.
At the peak of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of the supply of buildings.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong has recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive seasons.
China News Agency Beijing October 1 (Xinhua) e-commerce retail export enterprises on October 1 launched another wave of tax benefits, involving value added tax, consumer tax exemption and other aspects.

China New Network Zhonglinhyu on November 5th, after a dispute over the distribution of funds, a man from Penning province killed and dumped his lover, then escaped to the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia.
On 5th, the journalist learned from the Public Security Office of the East Shaanxi district of the city of Purdue, Mongolia, that the man was successfully caught after a joint investigation by the police in both places.
On June 26, 2018, a woman disappeared in the city of Yangsan, Penning province, and her family alerted the local police.
The police investigation concluded that this was not a simple case of missing persons, and that the missing person was most likely killed by someone who loved him.
On October 30, the task force found that the suspected criminal Wang Mao may be hiding in the East Shaan area of the city of Zhongduong, and East Shaan police immediately organized a thorough police force to cooperate fully with the investigation of the case by the police in Penning.
After five days of reconnaissance, the civil police finally figured out where Wang's foot was and conducted detailed examinations of his relatives.
On November 4, the two police forces joined forces to arrest suspected criminal Wang Wu in a mining accessory shop in Dongsheng district.
According to Wang, he had a relationship with the victim, and because Wang's sister had a large sum of money in his name, they decided to take the money for themselves.
On June 22, 2018, Wang and Wei were divided over the control of the money, and Wang killed Wei in a taxi cab and dumped the body after decomposing it.
Currently, the suspected criminal Wang Liu has been handed over to the Penang Police.

Systemic scarlet fever is a chronic, multi-organ, chronic suspicious disease that was once considered incurable.
The mechanism of their onset is unknown, diagnosis is questionable and there is no effective treatment.
Recently, researchers from the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University, Zhang Liang and the team of the director of the Center for Rheumatic Immunology at Beijing University People's Hospital, Kastong-Zong discovered that there are molecular variations of human immune globulin that increase systemic red spot hypersensitivity, and that variation is involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is a major cause of systemic scarlet fever.
According to Sun Xiaojun, one of the authors of the article, the Chongqing team collected nearly 2,000 large samples of systemic red spot lupus patients and conducted research, and found that the occurrence and severity of inflammation such as inflammation, arthritis, arthritis, vascular inflammation, and other inflammation that produced disease-causing cells and a wide variety of diseases in patients with immune globulin variations.
Through various research methods such as immune cell tracking, animal testing, sequencing, and others, the team discovered the immune signaling pathways that activate this immune molecule variant and promoted the mechanism of B cells secretion of various antibodies of their own.
The reporter learned that the two teams have joined forces to fully exploit their strengths, achieving a close combination of basic research and clinical applications.
The Zhengli team is dedicated to the identification of B lymphatic cell immunity and immunoactivation research, while the Chongqing team has been engaged in clinical research on systemic red spot lupus for a long time.
The study, one of the results of the two teams' years of collaboration, recognizes for the first time in the academic community that immune globulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic red spot lupus, and lays a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted therapy.
This is not a shortcut, but a legal action.
The lawyer brought the case to court with an axe?
The news was really exciting and exploded in the legal circle.
The Fujian City of Quanzhou Law subsequently fined the lawyer involved 500 yuan and recommended in writing that the Quanzhou City Bar Association conduct an investigation.
According to the Xinjing newspaper, the official press release of the Law Association of the city of Quanzhou issued yesterday said that the actions of the two lawyers did not involve violations of the law and could not be punished according to the law.
According to multiple reports, the management of the Law Society of the City of Quanzhou is not to shorten or fight, but has been approved by the Quanzhou Central Council.
Events that could have triggered tensions within the legal community were finally properly resolved.
The reversal of the situation was based on a more complete truth-based return: the axe carried by the lawyer involved was the same style and model as the murder weapon of the accused, but without the blade, only as supporting evidence in the context of the evidence, and without intimidating the movement or endangering the security of the court.
To determine whether the lawyer involved's conduct was illegal, there are four very important details that need to be considered: one, the local court has only shown the photo of the axe at two previous hearings, from the point of view of defense, showing that the original material of the axe was necessary; second, the axe was not to be purchased until an hour before the hearing, and the lawyer was not willing to seek the consent of the judge but was objectively unable to contact the judge; third, the entire axe was not overused or improperly used; fourth, the lawyer first publicly admitted the error and apologized to the court.
Taking these facts together, it can be seen that the lawyer involved was not wearing a hatchet to the courtroom, but only to defend himself.
After clarifying the whole fact, the Quanzhou Municipal Law Association did not go ahead with the matter, but took the decision not to be punished under pressure.
This decision has also been tested by facts and law.
As for the ax that will be brought to the court without the permission of the court, as a tool for controlling, it is indeed easy to cause unrest and misunderstanding.
For safety and prudence reasons, the previous fine and judicial recommendations of the Central Court of Quanzhou are not worthy.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from taking legal advice from lawyers, the Supreme Court issued the Judicial Police Safety Inspection Rules of the People's Court in 2014 and established the principle that lawyers do not need to conduct personal safety inspections.
Since the rule was issued, the general counsel has rarely taken the form of an incident that could compromise the security of the court due to security breaches.
In such individual cases like Quanzhou, misunderstandings are easy to eliminate as long as they are communicated in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
The Bar Association, as a self-regulatory organization in the legal profession, has the dual mission of punishing wrongdoing and safeguarding the law.
In the past, individual law organizations have suffered from chronic illness due to their preference for punishment, lack of security and lack of protection.
The decision of the Quanzhou Law Society, regardless of the process or the outcome, is commendable and set an example for more law firms to properly perform their duties.
What tax benefits will affect our money bags from October 1?
Xinhua Xinhua Shanghai October 1st, Reporter Sanh) The new personal income tax law will come into effect from January 1, 2019, in order to allow the general public to enjoy tax deductions as soon as possible, from October 1st, the earned wages actually received by taxpayers will be deducted from the previous wage earnings at the starting point of 5,000 yuan per month and the new tax rate table will be applied.
With the fall of the new regime, what benefits will affect the money bags of the masses?
Benefit one: The tax deduction on wages is clear
Taxpayers who receive payroll after October 1 can deduct the basic deduction of 5,000 yuan per month and apply the new tax rate table, and most taxpayers have different tax reductions, especially for middle and low income people.
According to the tax reduction chart for different income groups, the monthly income of people who deducted from the three-year ban on gold and silver was 8000 yuan, 10000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, 50000 yuan, the amount of tax after tax should be paid 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan, 9090 yuan, respectively, compared to 3500 yuan at the beginning of the month, the corresponding tax reduction ratio was 73.9%, 61.1% and 49.0% respectively, 18.8%.
It is worth noting that due to the holiday season, wages that should have been paid in October by the end of September, according to the law, can be applied to the new basic deduction of fees and tax rates.
To this end, the accounting software for deducting the customer used by the tax department for the uniform promotion of taxation has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax payment still needs to be declared within the statutory declaration period.
Benefit 2: The low tax rate grade gap is significantly increased
In addition to improving the starting point, a new tax rate table will be applied from October 1.
The seven tax rates on wages and salaries that were previously consistent with the previous one have not changed, but the tax rate range has changed significantly, the three low tax rates of 3%, 10%, 20% have expanded significantly, the 25% tax rate range has been reduced, while the 30%, 35%, 45% tax rate range has remained unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law also adjusted the tax rates for the production and operation income, with the lower threshold of the top threshold of 35% being raised from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan.
This means that individual business owners and individual joint ventures will benefit from the tax reform.
From the forecast of individual tax deductions for taxpayers in Shanghai, the dividend of individual tax reforms, especially for middle and low income people, will be felt fully by the taxpayers.
The head of the personal income tax department of the Shanghai City Tax Office of the National Tax Office said Lammin.
Benefit 3: Tax services are easier and optimized
Since the publication of the new Personal Income Tax Law, the tax department of Shanghai has carried out a series of comprehensive and broad tax propaganda campaigns.
On the one hand, policy advice on the priority tax sources and key enterprises is carried out one by one, point by point.
The Pudong New District Tax Office visited large enterprises such as Apple Trade, Shanghai Limited, Paypal China Network Technology Limited, Red Star, and Keloon Home Group Shares Limited, which have large employees, large workloads, large tax amounts, tax department's active advice and answers to confusion; the Xue District Tax Office visited large labor enterprises in the region, China Zhi Financial Consulting Limited, China Zhi Shanghai Economic Technology Cooperation Company, etc., to gather business concerns in time, respond to business requests, solve business difficulties.
On the other hand, the tax policy of full-scale, multi-dimensional and stereo taxation is being pushed to the taxpayers of the general public.
Use the official website of the Shanghai Tax Service, Weibo Public Number, Weibo and other channels to push policy hotspots in time to ensure policy propaganda is in place.
At the same time, on September 28, Shanghai Taxation WeChat Public Service launched 12366 smart consulting platform, which launched a tax reform promotion service aimed at the integration of smart tax reforms with the help of artificial intelligence + smart tax consulting.

But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to replant the main crops of the former agricultural regions of the United States in 2019: corn and wheat.
American farmers have grown soybeans this year over corn for the first time in 35 years.
The plan to replant other food crops is because American farmers are in trouble selling soybeans in the context of US President Trump's trade war with China.
China typically purchases about 60% of U.S. soybeans exported, but due to trade wars, almost zero purchases of U.S. soybeans have been made in recent months, causing soybean prices to fall to a decade-low.
Thomas plans to grow more wheat next year, hoping to grow more by reducing reliance on crops that rely on China's demand.
Thomas said that the soya price hike has brought us a painful blow.
He said that China had no need to buy soybeans near its farm, and the current price was $7.10 per ear of rice, while the price needed to cover the cost was $8.50.
American farmers have set a record for soybean cultivation this year, and harvests are expected to set a record.
At a time when it was so easily hit, they were hit by the trade war.
Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, and China imposed tariffs on imports of US soybeans in July.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release the first forecast report on planting area next year, which will include considerations of the impact on tariffs.
The forecast is expected to confirm the expectation of the civil authorities that the area for soya seedlings will be reduced.
According to a report seen by Reuters, on October 19, Inform Economics expects corn planting area to increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019, while soy planting area will decrease by 7% to 83 million acres.
Informa also expects the area of wheat cultivation in the United States to increase by 4%.
The area of soybeans grown before the retaliatory tariffs was introduced this year has risen to £89.6 million, up from about £15 million a decade ago.
Corn cultivation has increased by less than 5 million pounds since 2008 to 89.1 million pounds, and this year wheat cultivation area was 47.8 million pounds, near the lowest level in 100 years.
Aaron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Growers Association, owns 3,600 acres of total cultivation, and this year he will spend nearly half of it growing soybeans, but plans to cut it down in the future.
He said his farm in northern Illinois could increase the area of corn plantation by as much as 20 percent; the state is the largest soybean plantation in the United States.
The unit production of soybeans per acre is less than corn, but the required chemical fertilizer is also less, which makes soybeans generally less expensive to grow.
If farmers move to end-value corn, it may increase costs, but it will benefit some businesses, including Anderson Inc's fertilizer sellers.
Andersons CEO Pat Bowe told Reuters that he expected the replanting of corn to be beneficial for the use of chemical fertilizer.
Bayer also expects to benefit from farmers' transfer of corn.
The Director of the Bangkok Garoon Man Airport Management Office, Satirawa, called a development briefing on 29th, apologizing for the incident at the airport of a Chinese citizen, and said Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists, and relevant departments will strengthen management, raise service awareness, and prevent similar incidents from occurring.
On the 27th, security at the Guangdong airport reportedly clashed with a Chinese man who was denied entry.
Sintilava said that the security involved was in serious violation, the airport administration has suspended him and established an investigation committee to investigate the matter according to the procedure, if it is true that the security will resign.
Currently, the Thai Immigration Service has arranged for the man to return to China by plane.
Sintilawa apologized for the incident, saying that Thailand attaches great importance to the incident and is willing to do everything possible to reduce the impact of the incident on the tourists being beaten, and will send an apology to the parties through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that Gongman Airport is willing to provide convenience for Chinese tourists who are going to Thailand, and the Thai Immigration Agency has joined forces with the five major international airports in Thailand, including Sunanp, Gongman, Chiang Mai, Pugi, Hoai and others in Bangkok to set up special entry corridors for Chinese tourists.
He said that the next step for the airport administration would be to revamp the landing signage area, clarify the landing signage fee and improve the quality of service and communication skills of staff.
The Chinese Embassy in Thailand first contacted the parties after learning about the incident and learned about the situation.
At the same time, the Thai Immigration Office, Airport Administration and Tourism Sports Department have submitted a request for interception, requesting that Thailand investigate the incident and severely punish offenders, and will continue to communicate closely with Thailand, deal with the matter properly, and defend the legitimate interests of the parties.
China International Times: Defending multilateralism, China's knowledge and skills are united.
In a time of unilateral reversal, international rules and multilateral order are under attack.
In a way, the intersection of unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible great nation, China, with its ideology of supremacy, common ground and robust action, will work with the international community to uphold multilateralism and promote multilateralism.
Faced with new challenges in the new situation, China has made a strong voice about the direction and path of development of multilateralism.
As State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in his General Debate Speech at the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should be firmly rooted in cooperation and win-win goals, based on rule-making, fair justice and effective action.
At the same time, China called for the construction of a global development cooperation framework that would complement the United Nations as the core, North-South cooperation as the main channel, South-South cooperation as the complement, and called for all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's thinking and crying reflects the mainstream voice of the international community.
As the 73rd President of the United Nations, Espinosa, said, under the current situation, the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and uphold the rules-based international system more than ever.
International Monetary Fund President Lagarde said that the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the global economic and political forces, some emerging markets and developing countries have emerged to play a greater role in major international multilateral mechanisms, providing new development momentum for multilateralism facing headwinds.
Standing up for this dimension, China's advocates of building big families instead of puzzle circles, insisting on multilateral ideas such as co-operation and co-operation rather than winning and winning, and adhering to the trends of the times, are the inevitable choice to address global challenges and solve the world's difficult problems, representing the common demands of most countries in the world.
There is an advanced idea, more solid action.
China's Belt and Road Initiative has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China's joint initiative for international and regional cooperation, such as the Belt and Road Co-Building Initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the 16+1 Cooperation Initiative, promotes international regional cooperation, perfectly complements existing international institutions and order, brings innovative vitality to multilateral cooperation and contributes to the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.
As a defender of the international order and practitioner of multilateralism, China's actions on the UN multilateral stage are becoming increasingly powerful.
To pivot to international hotspots, to tackle climate change, to participate in peace actions, to make a strong effort to reduce poverty and alleviate poverty, and to help other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As UN Secretary-General Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the global trust deficit increases, and populism and polarization tend to rise, the world's demand for multilateral cooperation is most pressing.
At such a historic juncture, the international community needs to come together to turn consensus into action, firmly defend multilateralism and jointly promote the construction of a community of human destiny.

The fifth month of the Disability Speakers Month is coming.
In recent years, the topic of adolescent sex education in China has been widely discussed, but the challenges for adolescent sex education with disabilities remain tough.
Recently, a seminar on comprehensive education challenges and practical strategies for people with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to conduct sex education for children and young people with disabilities became an important topic of the seminar.
The report on gender-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of children with disabilities and adolescents published at the meeting showed that children with disabilities suffered a higher proportion of sexual harassment and sexual assault than healthy children.
More attention is also given to the protection of disabled children, adolescents and society.
The workshop aims to explore the three aspects of family support, school education and institutional services in China to promote comprehensive education for children and adolescents with disabilities, providing support to children and adolescents with disabilities from the source, so that they have the right to enjoy love as others do.
Experts believe that the Chinese public's awareness of disability has remained on an in-depth level ever since.
Influenced by factors such as traditional concepts, China is not yet deep enough in the comprehensive education of disabled people, especially children and adolescents with disabilities.
But in recent years, with the support of UNESCO and public interest groups, the practice and path to achieving full-cycle development of sexual and reproductive health education for disabled people in China has developed well.
The report shows that children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical disabilities have more difficulties than the general public in gaining sexual knowledge and understanding intimate relationships, but overall they have developed towards facilitation and enrichment.
The Seminar on Comprehensive Education Challenges and Practice Strategies for People with Disabilities, co-sponsored by the Shanghai Humanitarian Fund, the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the International Disability Alliance (France) Beijing Representative Office, and the United Nations Population Fund Representative Office in China, aims to explore the full cycle of gender and reproductive health education practices and pathways for the full development of disabled people in the context of the Greater Strategy for Health China, and to promote special education and integration education policy makers, educators, researchers, social service organizations, parents, and stakeholders representing the rights of disabled children and adolescents to comprehensive international education policies and health; and to exchange broadly on disabled children and adolescents' practices, strategies, challenges and resources in domestic sexual education, and to discuss and support blueprinting future development of comprehensive education
Reuters Beijing, September 30 - The Central Bank of China released data on the forecasted short-term net outflows of foreign assets on Sunday, showing that as of the end of August this year, the central bank's foreign position on long-term contracts and futures contracts for the currency was zero for 12 consecutive months, and there were still no positions in the month.
The Central Bank's previous data showed that as of the end of August last year, the central bank held a total of $604 billion in foreign currency positions against futures contracts and futures contracts for the currency, which remained unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the size of the empty position measured at SDR (special withdrawal rights) was SDR 4276 million.
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange futures position has remained zero.
The Central Bank first released the data in late March 2016; data showed that the foreign currency of the Central Bank had a multi-position position of $2.43 billion against long-term and futures contracts for the currency at the end of February 2016 and a blank position of $28.9 billion.
The first time the September data released at the end of October of the same year showed a net increase of $164.01 billion to $453.01 billion.
The central bank had previously stated that the long-term and futures position of foreign currency in the currency mainly reflects the long-term foreign exchange operations conducted by the central bank with commercial banks to meet the needs of foreign currency liability portfolio security and will continue to provide long-term hedge products on the principle of real demand, while the long-term operations of the central bank have less impact on the size of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20, the K158 train, Jo, a high school student in Yangzhou, took the car to Yangon.
One of the ladies on the train bought a ticket without a seat, but took her seat: "Hello, shoot, shoot".
After two hours of driving, the train manager advised him that an hour was still ineffective.
In the end, a male passenger with the car was unable to see the lift.
From a sentimental point of view, although the end result is that the perpetrators are mostly condemned by the public, punished by the public security department's administration, and even included in the blacklist of integrity, the public still feels unable to explain the hatred.
Why can't they stop their immoral and even illegal behavior on the spot and punish them after the fact?
And how is it that the unreasonable behavior of the monsoon dam is only brought up by a male passenger who is uncomfortable in the way?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance trains are equipped with passenger guards, while short-distance trains generally do not; even passenger guards and passenger guards are more concerned about the possible reluctance of the passengers without taking forced evacuation measures.
The recurring incidents of horoscope have made people aware that it is necessary to force the horoscope to be removed or even punished before it can act as a shock.
This requires that our passenger trains dare to take strong measures in time, and that trains without passengers should deploy passenger police as soon as possible to ensure timely stopping and combating violations.
On October 1, the first day of the National Day holiday, vehicles headed towards Matsun Pan headed through Sichuan's North Kawasaki Autonomous Region to Mao County were on the rise.
At 13 o'clock, the North Kawasaki police received a call asking for help, saying that their family had a traffic accident in Shandong Pan, and that due to limited medical conditions in the area, they urgently need to be sent to Shangyang for treatment.
When the road to the Yangtze Lake and the Yangtze Lake were implemented, the traffic controller asked the police to allow 120 ambulances to pass.
After receiving the call for help, the on duty civilian police quickly reported the situation to the brigade, and after Captain Huang Shengmen simply understood the situation, he immediately arranged for the police stationed at the control point to contact the applicant, requesting that all possible escort work be done.
The vehicle entering the control lane at the time was more than a thousand vehicles, and after contacting 120 ambulances, we immediately arranged for deployment after arriving in the northern part of the state at about 15 o'clock.
Captain Liu of the squadron in the northern section of the bridge explained that the ambulance had to bypass the Ring Lake Road from Tangian and the road was very narrow, to prevent vehicles that entered the road from running in pairs, the police took an hour ahead of the start, middle and end of the road to implement the segment controls on the vehicle, and reminded passing drivers to leave all the roads open to miss the ambulance.
Subsequently, the drum squad's civilian police also temporarily stopped the vehicle entering the control lane, and lined up to allow 120 ambulances to arrive.
At 15 o'clock, a Kauai U licensed ambulance entered the territory of Kauai, and a police car was sent by the Kauai Police to escort the ambulance back to the control lane.
It is understood that only one vehicle can pass through the area where the Zhong Lake Road is located, and the Civil Police have temporarily controlled the places in advance, ensuring the smooth passage of 120 ambulances.
When we reached the village of Ten Mile, there was a road that could not be missed, so the police contacted the two village committees in advance, took the village road and banned social vehicles from entering.
It took just 40 minutes for Liu to get 120 ambulances from the North Kawasaki Interstate Police to drive into the normal road on Provincial Route 302.
Liu explained that under normal circumstances, the entire passage of time would take four hours.
The arrangement has succeeded in getting the patient valuable treatment time.
It was reported that at 17:20 the critically ill were sent to the hospital in time for treatment.

The reporter learned that the police had to wait an hour to catch the two men and finally got a win in their case.
Two suspects are currently under police review.
Ben Ehtem warned the prosecutors that the question of who is suspect among the crowd is simple for the civil police.
If you catch thieves more, you will find that their eyes, their religious and ordinary passengers are different, and in addition to looking at their pockets and backpacks, they also like to drill into the crowd rather than hide from people.
The police also told reporters that the suspects' cars often have no purpose and like to wander around the station and follow the object after finding the object stolen.
"Oh, these are all experiences, and it's been a long time since drying clothes, naturally you know".

Activate rural consumption, purify markets through normalization mechanisms, guide healthy consumption demands and increase the sense of access for farmers to consumption.
Data shows that the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released, with retail sales of rural consumer goods growing 10.5% in the first half of this year, up 1.3 percentage points from the town.
In one of the poor villages in the western province, the village has only one convenience store, and in the store, some goods seem to have met, the Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese Chinese
In recent years, similar phenomena have been exposed frequently, some rural counterfeit goods near the names, names are similar, packaging is similar, false and unpredictable.
A consumer survey report released in a western city showed that the problem of counterfeit goods is serious for rural businesses, with 66% of users buying counterfeit goods in the supermarket under the town line, of which more than half are food.
The relevant sector is fixing the rural market, year after year, why is Li Gong-yong still beating?
Unlike urban markets, farmers' rights awareness is relatively weak, and many rural areas are remote, in blind areas where regulatory power is insufficient, so that fake goods have fertile soil.
One product is multi-headed, some departmental price management, some production, some pipeline market, function cross, year after year, a wind of centralized governance, fake goods hide from the wind, slowly emerge, just after the old fake, new fake emerges.
Lack of long-term regulatory mechanisms, difficulty in cleaning rural markets, low illegal costs and high profits have led some illegal traders to turn their heads in the slums and villages, and some rural areas have become waste markets.
From the warmest to the most prosperous, large farmers are moving towards developing consumption.
The day before, the Party Central and State Council issued a number of opinions on improving the mechanism to promote consumption, further stimulating the consumption potential of residents. Among them, they proposed to promote the consumption gradient upgrading of rural residents, with the aim of making large farmers consume energy, consume energy, consume energy, and make rural consumption really flourish.
On the one hand, we need to deepen reforms, eliminate the multi-portal and multi-portal governance disadvantages, improve the quality of food and product safety and network of product quality supervision, and constantly compress the space for counterfeiting and counterfeiting in rural areas.
On the other hand, to increase the enforcement force, to regulate the hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia, and never allow fake deception to spread in rural areas.
The strict punishment of the farmer is the protector of the farmer, and no matter how hidden the counterfeiters are, should not be the reason for the production of counterfeit goods. The relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, the regulatory power of the base should be reduced, which link is in trouble, and responsibility should be taken, so that the counterfeiters and counterfeiters are nowhere to hide.
Strict access to the market, strict qualification checks on production operators, keeping the market circulation, getting products right and clear, thinking of ways from the source and root, making legitimate distributors safe to operate, making farmers buy.
Activate rural consumption and drive healthy consumption demand.
With the upgrading of consumption, many farmers are not only looking for a healthy diet, but also a high quality of life, such as culture and health, and cannot compare rural markets with low-quality, cheap, and cheap paintings.
This needs to promote e-commerce to extend to large rural areas, promote dual-linked sales channels in cities and towns, promote the combination of online industrial development platforms and online e-commerce trading platforms, support the expansion of new business models of consumption to rural markets; promote conditional towns to organically combine commercial logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing; strengthen rural modern distribution network system, optimize integrated storage facilities resources and effectively reduce rural distribution costs.
Creating a clear and secure market environment for rural areas, allowing farmers to consume without worrying, rural consumption can become more prosperous, and increase the sense of gain and happiness of farmers' consumption.

Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.2% in July compared to the previous month, a higher than expected increase, warming the market's expectations of a rate hike for the Canadian Central Bank next month.
If the rate increases are true, it will be the central bank's fifth rate increase in a little over a year.
Analysts at Reuters previously predicted growth of 0.1%.
Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 of the 20 industries achieved growth.
The data is noteworthy because the central bank expected earlier this month that temporary factors could drag the third quarter GDP data.
The president of the Central Bank of Canada, Polloz, promised Thursday that the central bank will continue to raise rates gradually and will pay close attention to economic data.
The next announcement of interest rates by the Central Bank of Canada will be on October 24.
Due to Canada's economic recovery and near-record low unemployment, the Central Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at the Kainvest macro, said that the country's economy is expected to grow at a GDP per capita rate of about 2 percent in the third quarter.
This will be above the expectation of the Central Bank of Canada's 1.5%, and will therefore be another reason for the Central Bank of Canada's expected rate hike next month, Liu said in a report.
The overnight index swap shows that the market forecast for the rate of interest rate hike for the Canadian Central Bank in October rose from 76.46% to 78.27%.
The Korean dynasty first jointly explored the Han River entrance in 65
The Ministry of Defence confirmed that the Korean people launched a joint survey of the waterways entering the Hanjiang and Linjiang rivers on the same day.
The initiative is a preliminary preparation for ensuring the free navigation of civilian vessels on both sides.
The Korean Ministry of Defense's briefing to the media that day showed that this was the first joint survey of the port of Hanjiang since the signing of the Korean War ceasefire agreement in 1953.
The Korean government signed a military agreement in September this year, agreeing to jointly explore waters such as the Han River entrance and port from November to ensure environmental protection and tourism development in the future.
In October, the Korean government planned a joint survey of the waters at a general level meeting.
On November 5, the joint expedition in the waters of the Korean peninsula officially began.
The Joint Expedition consists of 20 members of the Korean military, experts and others.
According to the Ministry of Defence of South Korea, during the visit, neither side carried weapons and prohibited the use of words that stimulated the other.
Because there is no military dividing line near the entrance, the area was an accidental high-altitude area, but through joint exploration, it will become a new peace area in the future.
The water area of the joint Korean expedition is about 70 km long and about 280 km2 in total.
The Ministry of Defence of South Korea said that South Korea will send six reconnaissance ships to explore the depths of the sea, providing basic information for safe navigation in the waters; after the investigation is completed, it will provide navigation maps for civilian vessels.
The Korean government held a summit in Pyongyang in October 2007 to reach an agreement on jointly using the Hanjiang and Linjiang sea ports, but subsequent talks were hampered by tensions on the peninsula.
According to the Korean War military agreement signed in September, future ships of both countries will need to notify each other in advance before navigating in common waters.

At the same time, the embassy assisted the families in launching the searchers in Mon, and actively engaged in the searchers in Mon and Chinese companies, providing effective clues and providing relevant assistance to the many Blue Sky rescue teams who went to help the rescue in Mon.
With the Embassy's strong push, Moon Moon sent a rescue team for the first time and promised to exempt search and rescue costs.
The General Police Office and General Emergency Directorate instructed the police and emergency departments of Kusugul Province to search and rescue.
As Lake Kusugul is located at the border with Russia in northern Mongolia, the terrain is remote, the land is sparsely populated, transport and communication are extremely uncomfortable, and Mongolia is currently in the harsh winter, temperatures are low to about 20 degrees below zero, the local police and emergency services overcame great difficulties, mobilizing almost all the police and deploying local herders, by riding, walking, visiting herders, and so on, carrying out a wide range of carpet search and rescue around the two lost positions.
At the same time, due to the special situation in the pastoral area, the Monfong has been launching searchers through a broadcast cycle for several days.
The staff of the domestic Blue Sky Rescue Team has also come to participate actively in the rescue along with Moon.
The safety of the two missing persons has always touched our hearts.
The two have been missing for more than a decade now, and the embassy has received some hints, but they have not been found, and the search and rescue operation is still underway.
The Embassy will always be committed to the principle of human nature, continue to pay attention to this matter, encourage the parties to continue their search and rescue efforts and provide maximum assistance to the families of the parties.
The embassy urges the Mongolian compatriots and businesses to contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia first if they have any leads.
The former guard claims Michael Jackson had a ribbon stuck to his nose for making headlines
Michael Jackson's former bodyguard claimed that the late singer deliberately performed strange acts in order to deliberately incite the media.
Matt Feeds, now a real estate developer and owner of a martial arts/dance chain, told the Huang Capital newspaper that Jackson believed that his personal obsession with his character would end if he was no longer a buffalo in the public eye.
He reportedly wore a mask and put a ribbon on his nose to spark a heated debate to make headlines.
We will tell you the truth. You can have your own point of view.
"He knows how to manipulate the media". He knows exactly how to make headlines, said Feeds, who was Jackson's defensive coordinator for 10 years. "He's wearing a mask on his face, or sticking a ribbon on his hand, or sticking a ribbon on his nose", he said. "In 90% of cases, this method works. He would say that he wants to be the biggest ribbon in the world his whole life".
He added: "The result of the election was against the will, which is very sad".
Feeds also spoke about allegations of child sexual abuse by Wade Robson and James Seefchak against Jackson, which have been broadcast on the highly controversial Emmy Award-winning documentary "The Dream Island Girl".
Robson and Seafunk both claimed that they were abused by Jackson for years as children.
Feeds claims that "the whole pedophilia thing is nonsense... this guy has multiple girlfriends and is legally married to Lisa Marie Presley, and this is his life".
He claimed that Jackson's abuse of children on the Dream Island ranch was impossible because his mother was barely on the farm.
"They say there are a lot of boys around, but it's not true", he said.
Jackson Winehouse denies all allegations about the late star. Jackson denied all allegations against him before his death in 2009.

He said: "We recently took strong measures to force the retirement of a considerable number of tax officials, and we will not tolerate this behavior.
Nearly half of the retired officials are those arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation for allegedly receiving illegal benefits. One of them was arrested for taking 15,000 rupees. One official was accused of possessing a huge source of assets unknown.
In June this year, the government forced the retirement of 15 officials of the Central Commissioner for Indirect Taxes and Customs on charges such as bribery, receipt of bribes, smuggling and even conspiracy. Before that, the government had forced the retirement of 12 senior officials of the State Tax Department under Section 56 J of the Central Public Service Employees Pension Rules on charges such as corruption, sexual harassment and large unknown assets.

A woman in Maine received 500 letters from Joint Health Insurance within five days.
Stephanie Ray said her mailbox was blown up by letters from insurance companies from Thursday to Monday.
The first wave of the news started last Thursday and I received 46 letters, she told cable news network. I immediately called the Joint Health Insurance and informed them that I received 46 letters with the same content.
But the letter still came through, and as of Monday, more than 500 letters had been received.
The letters were mailed to her son who lives in a private care home with autism, she explained. But when she unsealed the letter, she did not mention her son's name, but said that the respected Maine Department of Health and Public Services, Cincinnati, was in charge, she told local media.
The letters were about claims of $54 or $0 outside the scope of the joint health insurance investment, Ms. Ray said.
When she asked why she received a bunch of letters from United Health Insurance, she was told that it was because of the coding issues, she said.
In a statement, United Health Insurance informed the cable news network that they are solving the issue and could not provide further details given the privacy requirements.
"We have identified the root of the problem. We deeply apologize for the incident, and we have contacted the family and asked about their situation", the health insurance company said.
Ms. Ray said that at the bottom of each letter there was a message calling for people to implement paperlessness. "I think they sent the letters and wasted half the trees of the forest", she said.
Antonio Brown claims he is not ready to retire
Antonio Brown said he would not retire from the NFL, and just days ago, he tweeted that he had left the NFL.
The four-time All-Pro receiver tweeted Thursday: "Oh, I'm in a very good condition now, why should I retire now?"
Brown was accused of indecency by two women. He was released by the New England Patriots after playing a game last week. In the last six months, Antonio Brown was dropped by three different teams.
Brown, who lost his Nike sponsorship last week, said he would start in Miami and train one day a week in high school.
Brown, 31, also had a fight on Twitter with L.A. Rams safety guard Whedon Whedon, who frequently came into contact with him when he was with the Baltimore Ravens.
HSBC transforms crime detection tools to start new business
British hedge fund group (HBS) has converted algorithms used to detect financial crimes into a means to open up new business opportunities, which were forced to be established earlier by money laundering scandals, the bank's head said.
The system combines relevant data on customer banking operations and company ownership with public data on the position of director, identifying potential customers for HSBC staff and providing a way to connect with them through existing customer relationships.
HSBC's overall revenue strategy is to make more profits from its massive physical networks and customer data, and using data and artificial intelligence to try to increase revenue is also an integral part of the strategy, and improving overall revenue is a top priority for interim CEO Noel Quinn.
"This is the first time that financial crime prevention has been used for commercial purposes, and the business itself is low-risk and quick to get results", said Stuart Nevison, global head of HSBC's customer network bank.
HSBC declined to disclose how much profit the new system is expected to bring, but said the overall network profit profit profit initiative has generated hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue.
This is also an important step in HSBC's efforts to maintain its global operations, and some analysts and investors have previously said that the bank should scale down or withdraw from markets where profits are lower than the cost of capital, such as the US market.
In 2012, HSBC reached a $1.9 billion settlement agreement with the US authorities after failing to stop drug traffickers from laundering money through its Mexican subsidiaries. Hundreds of millions of dollars of the forced investment in financial crime compliance were part of the agreement.
The system can achieve its original design goal by mapping the relationship between individual customers and companies, looking for abnormal transaction patterns, or by digging up previously unknown links between the two.
The system has freed up the workforce of more than 400 employees who no longer have to manually check transactions and records, but take on more customer service, said Adrian Rigby, chief operating officer of HSBC's trade business.
Niveson of HSBC noted that they suddenly realized that if the tool was modified slightly, it could be used to find more attractive potential customers, and not as a red flag for illegal searches.
"We've gotten customer data sets, combined them with data from UK company registries, and then reversed the potential of previous algorithms to find customers, which could be achieved through registries, company development or links to existing customers", said Pennywise.
The tool has mapped 22.5 million UK entities and individuals and can identify a link network in three minutes, and bank staff often spend three hours manually mapping, he said.
Rouhani said Iran received a promise that the United States would lift all sanctions in exchange for dialogue
European countries are eager to negotiate with Iran, and have hinted that if Tehran is willing to negotiate, the United States will end the sanctions against Iran, President Hassan Rouhani said.
According to Rouhani, the European signatories to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal urged him to meet with US President Donald Trump and promised Washington would lift all sanctions in exchange for dialogue.
The three countries of the Six Nations - the German Prime Minister, the British Prime Minister and the French President - insisted on holding the meeting, saying that the United States would lift all sanctions, the Iranian President said.
He said he rejected the proposal because the negotiations would be conducted in the face of the US's extreme pressure and sanctions on Iran, and there was no way to predict any outcome.
Trump quickly denied any relief to Iran and said on Twitter that Tehran had asked him to lift the sanctions as a condition for dialogue, but he refused.
Rouhani also said in the statement that many countries expressed support for Iran in one-on-one talks during the UN General Assembly. We discussed several issues with the countries, all of which condemned the withdrawal of the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and its pressure actions. This was a huge success for Iran.
Government launches consultation on reviewing dog law
The dog law in Scotland is under review due to concerns about animal control and owner blame.
The Scottish government has launched a consultation to seek public opinion.
The Scottish Minister for Community Safety pledged to ensure community safety and keep people away from the blame of the owner, in order to determine whether laws against dogs that are out of control need to be amended.
Scottish MP Ash Denham said: "We are currently conducting two reviews of the dog law because we are absolutely determined to ensure community safety and keep people away from the blameless dog owners and their uncontrolled dogs.
The consultation is aimed at seeking feedback on how to improve the implementation of the Dog Control Act 2010 in Scotland, and next year we will review all dog control legislation more broadly to assess whether it needs to be amended.
Dog breeding carries a certain responsibility, including keeping your dog under effective control, and I encourage anyone interested in this area to respond to our public consultation.
The public consultation will continue until January 15, including proposals to strengthen and clarify existing regulations, such as whether a national dog control database should be established.
After legislation was passed by the Scottish Parliament, the Commissioner for Oversight has been hearing testimony from victims and parents of children who have been attacked or killed by dogs, urging the government to review the dog law.
Members of the Scottish Parliament were told that there was a pressing need for reform of the regulations to protect vulnerable people and children.
The committee learned that in Glasgow and Clyde alone, 1,417 people were sent to hospital emergency rooms last year after being bitten by dogs, including 255 children.
912 people were treated at Lanarkshire National Health Service and 439 at Ayrshire National Health Service, both of which were the highest numbers in four years.
In July, the committee's members concluded that the current dog law was not in line with the purpose and called on the Scottish government to review all dog law.
Jenny Mara, head of the committee, said that the dog law in Scotland was not in line with the purpose. There are still many cases of dog attacks against children, but the existing laws that may prevent these attacks are almost never implemented or understood.
It is clear that the current dog law has not worked. The current dog law needs reform urgently so that we can properly treat uncontrolled and dangerous dogs, and we can try to build a system to prevent our children from being harmed by dogs.
The advice, published on the government website on Friday, reads: "The effective enforcement of the Uniform Code is key to solving the problem of dogs in Scotland".
The review focused on measures that could be taken to help aid enforcement agencies such as local authorities use the power in their hands to maintain community security.
Saudi Arabia issued tourist visas for the first time, abolishing the rule of the Abaya robe
Currently, Saudi visas are issued only to foreign employees, their families and Muslim pilgrims.
Saudi Arabia said Friday it would open up the ultra-conservative kingdom to holidaymakers for the first time with tourist visas to promote economic diversification and reduce dependence on oil.
Launching tourism is one of the core elements of Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision Reform Plan 2030, which aims to prepare the largest Arab economies to develop in the post-oil era.
Just two weeks ago, the US government accused Iran of launching a devastating attack on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure, which disrupted the global energy market and raised concerns about wider regional conflict.
Opening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country, said Ahmed Khatib, Director of the Tourism Authority of Jharkhand in a statement.
Visitors will praise... the five UNESCO World Heritage Sites we share are full of vibrant local culture and stunning natural beauty.
According to Khabib, Saudi Arabia will open online applications for tourist visas to citizens of 49 countries on Saturday.
Khalib said Saudi Arabia would also relax the strict dress code for foreign women, allowing them not to wear the Abaja robe, which remains the public dress Saudi women must wear.
However, he added that foreign women will be asked to wear modest clothes, but no details were given.
In this desert kingdom with numerous Bedouin sites and archaeological sites, visas are currently limited to foreign employees, their families and Muslim pilgrims to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
Saudi Arabia began issuing temporary visas to tourists last year to allow them to participate in sports and cultural activities to kick-start the tourism industry, a rare initiative.
But this serious kingdom prohibits drinking and has strict social norms, which many see as a barrier to tourism.
Prince Mohammed is trying to change this situation through a comprehensive liberalisation movement that has brought new cinemas, concert and sports banquets to Saudi Arabia.
Observers said that international criticism of Saudi human rights records, including the horrific murder of critic Jamal Khashoggi last year and repression of women activists, could further undermine foreign tourists.
Concerns about regional conflicts may also weaken Saudi tourism attraction after the September 14 attack on state-owned oil giant Ameri Petrol.
The government said it hopes that by 2030, the tourism sector's contribution to GDP will reach 10%, compared to only 3%.
It is said that by 2030, Saudi Arabia aims to attract up to 100 million domestic and foreign tourists per year.
But Saudi Arabia currently lacks infrastructure and cannot accommodate so many tourists, officials estimate that the country will need 500,000 new hotel rooms in the next decade.
The government said that the tourism industry is expected to create up to 1 million tourism jobs in the face of high-level youth unemployment.
Saudi Arabia has invested billions of dollars to build tourism from scratch.
In 2017, Saudi Arabia announced a multibillion-dollar project to transform 50 Red Sea islands and other original sites into luxury resorts.
Last year, the Kidia-Jin Entertainment City project was built near Riyadh, which will include a high-end theme park, motorsport facilities and a hunting area.
The country is also developing historical sites such as the hundreds of years old Ma'ad Shaleh, the site of the sandstone mausoleum left over from the same civilization that built the city of Petra in Jordan.
Facebook hides the number of points in the new test in Australia
Facebook said today that it has begun to hide the number of points of approval for the dynamics published in Australia, and that the test is intended to alleviate social pressure and may be promoted globally in the future.
From today, Facebook users in Australia can no longer see the number of reactions to dynamics posted by others and the number of video views, but they can still see how others react to their own dynamics.
"We don't want people to feel like Facebook is a competition.
"We want to test how people use the new version. We want to spend some time observing the user feedback on the new version to see if it can be promoted", the company said.
Facebook has more than a billion users worldwide, but the social media giant is also under pressure to prevent the platform from affecting users' mental health.
According to the Australian Cyber Security Commissioner, one in five children in Australia report having been subjected to cyber violence.
Before making this decision, Facebook tested a version of hidden likes on the wall of another important social media platform - Photos - in July.
The photo wall testing started in Canada and has since expanded to Australia, Brazil and several other major user markets.
Facebook said the test was to get some information through small scale testing as soon as possible.
"Although testing of the photo wall is already underway, Facebook and the photo wall are different platforms, so we may get different test data", the company noted.
The social media giant has not confirmed how long the test will last.
"We wanted to know if removing the likes would improve the user experience and limit other positive interactions", said Mike Garrick, head of Facebook Australia.
Lorenzo strengthened to Category 4 hurricane in the eastern Caribbean
The National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Lorenzo strengthened to Category 4 on Thursday, with the storm's powerful waves likely to affect the Windward Islands and parts of South America.
The hurricane eye is located about 1,660 miles southwest of the Azores Islands at 11 p.m. National Hurricane Center time. Eastern Summer Time is updated. The storm moved northwest-northwestward at 14 miles per hour, with maximum sustained winds of 145 miles per hour.
The storm is not expected to land in the coming days, but Saturday's winds, which are heading northeast, may bring Lorenzo closer to the Azores Islands next week. Weather forecasters predict the storm will weaken to below 3 degrees on Monday.
The storm-induced waves could cause life-threatening waves and high currents in the Windward Islands and northeastern South America.
Lorenzo was the second Category 4 or higher storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. Dorian reached Category 5 near the Bahamas.
According to Philip Krausbach, a meteorologist at Colorado State University, 16 named storms have been produced in the Western Hemisphere since August 21, including the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Basins.
Philip Krausbach tweeted: "This is the largest recorded life-force named storm in the Western Hemisphere between August 21 and September 21, breaking the old record of 15 named storms created between 1984 and 2002.
Patriotic missile systems entered Saudi Arabia after Iran attacked an oil facility
After regular inspections of patriotic missile batteries at the Turkish military base in Gaziantep, Turkey, the U.S. soldiers debated.
The Pentagon announced Thursday that the United States plans to send a patriotic missile battery, radar system and about 200 support personnel to Saudi Arabia as a result of the attack on Saudi oil facilities earlier this month.
Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman wrote in a statement that Defense Secretary Mark Esper had approved the increase in troops in preparation for the deployment order. Although no decision has been made on the deployment, they will remain in a state of high alert.
The increased military force included two patriotic cannon batteries and a final high-altitude regional defense system, also known as the SAD anti-missile system.
The SAD anti-missile system is one of the most advanced missile systems in the world, capable of targeting incoming missiles and destroying them in the air. The SAD interceptor bomb is launched by launch vehicles and uses dynamic energy to strike ballistic threats to destroy the target.
Importantly, these initiatives demonstrate our commitment to regional partners and security and stability in the Middle East. Other countries have accused Iran of causing disasters in the region, but we hope they will help strengthen Saudi defence capabilities, Zhou Hoffman wrote.
The UN world leaders said President Donald Trump had criticized Iran's role in the attack on Saudi oil facilities. The UN General Assembly said on Tuesday that they should pressure Tehran to participate in diplomatic negotiations.
Trump called for action from all nations. No responsible government should finance Iran's killing. Sanctions will not be lifted unless Iran stops its dangerous course, but will only be harsher.
On September 14, the strike at the world's largest crude refineries and oilfields forced Saudi Arabia to shut down half of its production operations. The drone attack, which resulted in the biggest price hike in decades, again raised concerns about conflict in the Middle East. Although countries widely believed that Tehran should be responsible for the attack, Iran has always insisted that it was not involved.
A high-tech jumper crashed into a large tow truck on the California highway and died
The 28-year-old woman and seven others jumped at about 2 p.m. Thursday, California Highway Patrol Public Information Officer Ruben Jones told US cable news network.
The people took off from the Lodi Jumper Center. The cable news network has contacted the agency to comment.
Jones said the storm was strong and the woman collided with a truck while the jump team landed near Lodi Airport.
The TV station interviewed Lisa Reyes, who was driving on Highway 99 with her father and brother on board when the woman crashed.
She told the TV station: "The man struggled in the wind, but her body was falling at a very, very fast speed".
The Central Coast transformation of child rapists disguised in court ordered to look directly at the victims
In May 2017, the man, wearing a suit of tree-leafy colored disguises, grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind and dragged her into the bushes on her way to a school on the Central Coast.
He then tied the girl to a tree and sexually assaulted her.
Shortly after his arrest, police searched one of his homes and found many items related to the investigation of the case.
The man accepted seven charges related to the attack, in addition to three other charges of seduction and sexual assault committed by the man against another 11-year-old girl between August 2016 and April 2017.
The 12-year-old victim was walking along a path when she turned around and saw him suddenly emerging from the bush with a large branch and a knife in his hand.
The man was wearing a tree-leaf-colored disguise.
Although the girl repeatedly asked the man to stay, he still locked her neck with his hand and dragged her into the bushes.
The man said to the girl: "Oh, boo, don't cry. Don't cry, or don't blame yourself for being rude to you".
He tied the girl's hands and feet with a nylon strap in his right hand, then tied her to a tree, violating her for almost an hour. After he let the girl go, she ran to school crying.
The man arrived at the workplace at about 9:30 am and before that, he could not answer several messages and calls from his colleagues.
His clothes were covered with mud, haystacks and bark, and he claimed to have had a road rage accident, braking with another driver, driving the car into the bushes and overturning the roadway.
The sentencing hearing for the man will continue on Tuesday.
No federal charges have been filed after California police shot black men.
Federal authorities refused to file civil rights lawsuits against the Sacramento police on Thursday against the unarmed black man who shot and killed, sparking protests and pushing for changes to state laws restricting law enforcement agencies from using lethal force.
The U.S. Federal Prosecutor's Office and the FBI said the federal review of the 2018 shooting of 22-year-old Stephen Clark showed that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute two police officers, Trens Mercadent and Jared Lovinet, who would return to police duties.
In March, the California Attorney General's Office declined to bring criminal charges against two police officers after nearly a year of investigation into the case. Attorney General Havel Becerra noted that evidence showed that the two officers had reason to believe their lives were threatened because the man was approaching them and suspected of carrying a gun. The investigation found that he was carrying a cell phone at the time.
On Thursday, Sacramento Police also issued a statement saying that their internal investigation found no conduct by the two officers that violated the police department's rules or training requirements.
"Although no police were found to have violated the regulations of the police department during this incident or the process that led to this incident, we are still determined to implement new strategies to prevent such tragedies from happening again", said Daniel Hahn, the head of the Sacramento Police Department.
Clark's brother, Frank Clark, posted dynamics on Facebook Thursday, saying he was meeting with federal and local authorities at the time. "These people" - in terms of accountability - are completely out of office", he wrote.
Authorities said police were convinced that Clark was holding a handgun when he approached police, and that he had fled the police chase and ran to his grandmother's backyard. Police caught him after receiving reports that someone broke the glass of a car and the glass slide door of an elderly neighbor's house that evening.
Clark was approaching two police officers when the police fired seven shots at him.
Federal investigators examined relevant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, live video and recordings, police reports and autopsy reports, to determine whether the police involved intentionally used force beyond an objective reasonable limit.
Last month, lawmakers added an amendment to the law on the use of lethal force by the oldest U.S. law enforcement officer, which will become the strictest law of force in the country after all police officers are trained.
California's old standard makes it very difficult for police to prosecute shooters, and even more difficult to convict police. This is based on the principle of a reasonable fear of being shot, which is that if prosecutors or review commissioners believe that police have reason to worry about their own safety, they can use lethal force.
The new law came into effect on January 1, requiring police to use lethal force only when necessary to respond to the lethal threat posed to police or those around them.
Pope Francis warns tech executives to use AI to achieve public interest
Pope Francis warned tech executives, diplomats and financiers on Friday that creating AI and other forms of digital development races increase the risk of social inequality unless the work has an ethical assessment of the public interest.
Francis spoke at a meeting in the Vatican attended by government representatives, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists and ethicists. A small number of scholars and Catholic bishops attended the public interest conference in the digital age.
The Vatican hopes to take a seat in the debate about the prospects and dangers of AI, and this three-day conference is the latest proof of this idea.
The debates included technological advances in war, the increasing reliance on machines for future work, case studies of the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand, and decisions made by social media companies after the video of the massacre was circulated.
In his speech at the conference, Francis praised the potential of technological advancement and pointed out that machines kept workers out of danger and avoided unilateral labor in the early years of the Industrial Revolution. But Francis also warned that increasing reliance on robots for profit could deprive people of the dignity of their labor.
He warned: "If technological progress is the cause of increasing inequality, then technology is not a real progress". "If so-called technological progress becomes the enemy of the public interest, then the whole society will unfortunately degenerate into a barbaric era ruled by the strongest laws".
The conference organizers said they wanted to use the expertise of the participants to find suitable advisers for the Catholic Church on high-tech issues in the future.
The House voted Friday to block President Donald Trump from issuing a national emergency declaration, which Trump hopes will be used to fund his proposed border wall.
The Democratic-controlled House passed a resolution ending Trump's operation by a vote of 236 to 174 and sent it to the president. Eleven Republicans and one Independent Party member expressed support for the resolution. The Senate passed the measure by a vote of 54 to 41 as 11 Republicans joined the Democratic ranks.
Trump may veto the resolution, which would be his sixth time as president to block legislation in Congress. In March, he vetoed a measure ending the state of emergency.
Both Houses of Congress seem unable to reach the two-thirds majority needed to overturn the veto.
Failing to get the funds needed to build the desired southern border wall from the Mexican government and Congress, Trump declared a national state of emergency in February. The Trump administration plans to allocate $3.6 billion from military construction funds for border projects.
Democrats accuse Trump of not only circumventing the Congressional purse but also using critical defense funds to create unnecessary obstacles. A small minority of Republicans in the House and Senate also expressed concern about Trump's statement that would lead to future Vietnamese rule.
Republicans in some of the Senate elections next year are under enormous political pressure to vote on a state of emergency.
Google launched its 21st anniversary graffiti: Stories you didn't know
Google celebrates its birthday with a graffiti today. The graffiti is a computer photo in the style of the 90s, with a Google search page and a date tag on September 27, 1998, surrounded by Google colored colored paper. The search results page will show a smaller graffiti, with Google logo designed to be a 21 digit shape tag. The search giant was founded 21 years ago by Larry Page and Shergey Brin, who were students at Stanford University in California. However, September 27 is not Google's real birthday.
If you think that the company's birthday is the company's birthday, then Google was born on September 4, 1998, however, the company never celebrated its birthday on this day, at least not in the form of graffiti. Until 2005, Google celebrated its birthday with graffiti on September 7 and then changed it to September 27.
Initially, the search engine was called the Crawler Crawler Crawler Crawler Crawler Crawler, and later renamed the Google Crawler Crawler Crawler Crawler Crawler.
"We named our system Google because it was a common spelling of Google" or "10100", which is in line with our goal of building a large-scale search engine, Shergey Bryn and Laurence Larrie Page wrote in a paper published in 1998 about the introduction of a large search engine prototype.
The company was founded thanks to the $100,000 investment of Andy Betolsheim, co-founder of Solar Computer System; in June 1999, the company raised $25 million from Redwood Capital and Keynesian Capital. Google moved to the Shandong office that same year, where it remains today. In 2001, the company's technology was patented.
From a web search engine to a large corporate group, Google is a subsidiary of Google. Today, Google operates globally in more than 100 languages, answering trillions of search queries every year.
Google wrote on our story page: "The relentless search for better answers remains at the heart of everything we do. Today, Google has more than 60,000 employees in 50 different countries, from pipes, Android to heartbeats, and of course Google Search, developed hundreds of products for billions of people worldwide. Although we abandoned the Lego server and the company added only a few dogs, our enthusiasm for building technology for everyone has been with us from our dorm rooms to our garage until today.
Trump denies Iran claims the US proposal to lift sanctions has lowered oil prices
On January 10, 2019, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani delivered a speech at a ceremony in Tehran, Iran.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani claimed Friday that the US proposal to lift all sanctions against Iran in exchange for negotiations led to a drop in oil prices. President Donald Trump and the US State Department later denied these claims, causing oil prices to bounce back from low points.
The latest price of West Texas medium crude oil futures fell to $55.91, down 0.9%, down to $54.79. Brent crude oil futures prices fell to $61.89, down 1.4%.
According to Reuters, Rouhani said on his official website that the German prime minister, the British prime minister and the French president were both in New York and insisted on convening the meeting. The United States said it would lift the sanctions.
Trump later responded to Iran, and of course not! He said Iran hopes he can lift the sanctions so that a meeting can be held.
According to Bloomberg News Agency, the US State Department said the report was baseless and added that the US was determined to reduce Iranian regime oil exports to zero.
On September 14, a series of drones attacked Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, forcing the country to cut oil production in half, after which Rouhani commented. The United States and some European countries, as well as Saudi Arabia, blamed the attack on Iran. Tehran denies that it played any role in the incident. The Trump administration also announced plans to deploy US troops to the region.
The State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment from US consumer news and business channels.
John Kildov, the revivalist capitalist, said that the easing of tensions in the US may not be seen well for a long time, which will prompt the return of large quantities of oil to the market.
"This refers not only to Iran's production and exports, but also to the millions of barrels of oil in floating oil storage facilities and the millions of barrels of oil waiting for customs clearance in Chinese ports", said Ban Ki-moon.
Trump last year ordered the United States to withdraw from the nuclear deal signed by Iran, the United States and five other countries, which lifted sanctions against Iran in exchange for commitments to halt its nuclear program.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has been the target of U.S. sanctions for decades, with Washington accusing it of recently attacking oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, which Tehran denies. Iran also shot down a U.S. military drone and announced plans to execute 17 suspected U.S. spies.
Afghanistan strengthens security in response to presidential elections
Afghanistan has launched a nationwide security operation to prepare for Saturday's national presidential election.
The government will arrange about 100,000 security personnel to guard the polling stations to respond to the threat posed by the Taliban.
Many voters - especially those in rural areas - will stay home because of fears of reprisal, while others say that the voting system is designed for those in power and not for the poor.
Royal News: How the Princess of Wales Angrily Deals With the Enmity of Family Members
On Thursday, the Duke and Duchess of York announced that their eldest daughter, Princess Jones, was engaged to her boyfriend, real estate tycoon Edward Mapely Moss, 34, who will marry Mapely Moss next year as the ninth heir apparent to the British throne. The couple said in a statement: "We are all excited to start this journey together.
We have many similar interests and values, and we know that this will be very beneficial for us in the years ahead of love and happiness.
Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, the Princess of Wales' parents, also expressed their excitement.
The Duchess of York tweeted: "I know how my mother feels, so I shed tears of joy. I am proud of this news.
Andrew and I are the luckiest people because we have two wonderful nieces.
This royal wedding will be an opportunity for the entire royal family to reunite again, hoping that this will completely restore the relationship between Phineas and the Duke of Edinburgh.
Since Sara became involved in one of the biggest scandals in the Royal Family's history, her relationship with other members has become unusually difficult.
In 1992, five months after announcing her separation from Prince Andrew, a photo of her and her young financial adviser, Anne, taken at a holiday villa in Saint Tropez, was unveiled.
Among these photos, there are images of John Bryan, a millionaire from Texas, kissing and sucking the Duchess's ankles and legs, and Prince Philip is said to have reacted most strongly to the scandal of the Duchess's grandson.
However, he was reportedly shocked by the behaviour of the Duchess of York, who claimed that her mother was the victim of the behaviour that made her feel unpopular.
Kate and William: The couple's shock habits are exposed
The Duchess's spokesperson could not comment, but a friend of Fiona said: "It is no secret that the daughters of the Princess are very bored with the way the members of the royal family treat their mothers.
Some of the bills she received were rather shady.
They have been blaming their father for allowing this to happen, especially Jones has been begging Prince Andrew not to treat their mother as a deported person.
In October last year, at the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank, Philip and Sarah were photographed together for the first time in 26 years.
The second wave of major strikes in Oregon
State University staff complained that the main focus was on low wages and lack of dignity in the work. The pay gap was staggering. About half of these workers earned less than $40,000 a year (hundreds of people earned less than $25,000 a year). At the same time, the average annual salary of the university president was $500,000 and the annual salary of four university sports coaches was slightly lower, totaling $1 million. Although the salary of school administrators is six figures, overall administrative expenditure remains high, and one-sixth of the secret staff are eligible for food stamps.
As Alexander Segula, another information technology worker at Portland State University, said: "Well, I am willing to go on strike because I think it's unfair that the wages paid to people can't guarantee the lives of the cities they serve".
With inflation rising, the cost of living in Oregon soaring, and staff in distress, management has barely expressed sympathy. Contract negotiations that began in February were interrupted in mid-August. At that time, employers made some particularly excessive suggestions to slightly increase the cost of living, rejecting the qualifications requirements of long-term university staff, and employees considered the meal fee as disrespectful and even cruel treatment. Fulmer said: "There is a written class system in the university. We are at the bottom".
He continued: "For decades, education workers have been attacked. We finally stood up and fought back. Business executives can face class discrimination and the middle class being squeezed when they see their relatively jealous salaries increasing at a rate higher than inflation. But what happens in education, workers will not continue to tolerate. "
Oregon State University staff isn't the only group to take action. Oregon is now a barrel of fighting fireworks, and the insurance wire is burning and hot and bright. Grocery store workers at Fred Meyer's supermarket chain are actively campaigning against employers, although there are no formal strike plans yet, but tensions are escalating; their union, the Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 555, has called for a joint boycott and has filed a report on unfair labor practices against the chain.
In the healthcare sector, if the local 49 members of the International Federation of Service Employees of the Kaisa Medical Institution of 4,500 service workers do not reach an agreement before the expiration of their existing contracts in October (just to temporarily avoid them by passing a new interim agreement), the approval rate is 98 percent. In other areas of the industry, the Oregon Association of Nurses, representing more than 120 nurses at Astoria Hospital, is stuck in negotiations with the hospital management department for a contract that expires on the 5th of the month and the time is very pressing.
Burley explained that the momentum of the labor movement in Oregon is very strong and is indeed very thorough. This is part of the wave of labor growth across the country. What people see is economic instability, real wages are falling, and the solution is collective action in the workplace.
It is unclear to what extent this collective action will be carried out this fall, but if the major strike returns to the Northwest in 2019, it is certainly appropriate. We can only hope that this spirit of action will spread further to the Midwest agriculture, southern manufacturing, Texas oil fields, Appalachian coal mines, Northeast construction, Silicon Valley tech giants and any other sectors and industries in between. God knows, everything will pay a price.
Political Civilization: The new awards programme is designed to eliminate Westminster's divisions and honour politicians who have shown politeness
The new award program is designed to recognize politicians who have been polite.
After the parliamentary session, Westminster opened a week of uninterrupted debate.
During this week of debate, MPs were outraged by threats and remarks by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and others.
To combat the divide, the Political Civilization Award announced last Friday that an annual prize of £3,000 will be awarded to political figures for charity.
Boris Johnson has been criticized for his tone in the House of Commons
When announcing the award, Lord Stewart said: "Everyone agrees that British politics is facing a crisis of trust and a crisis of civilization.
The UK's Brexit debate is growing fierce, and divisions and pain are increasing, and we firmly believe that politics must respond, not react to these trends, but resist them.
These awards are a small attempt by a group of people to get the public's attention - whether political factions differ or not - to politicians who defend their cause in a more formal and polite way, and politicians who can transcend the differences that affect us all, to engage and cooperate with people".
The nominations will be announced in cycle six and the awards ceremony will be held in March next year.
Former Cabinet Minister Amber Ladd, in an exclusive interview with the Standard Evening Post today, accused Johnson of using provocative language that did incite violence.
Johnson said he regretted the threat against MPs.
Jesse Phillips scared the mother of a deadly threat to her mother after receiving a threat of death from a fear of mother.
Labour MP Jesse Phillips - another critic of Johnson - said on Thursday that a man was arrested after trying to open the door to her constituency office, allegedly when the man shouted he was a fascist.
Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Joe Swenson spoke to police after her young child was threatened.
Ellie Cooper, daughter of Labour MP Yvette Cooper, posted a quick spread post on Twitter describing her concerns about her mother after Cox's murder. Ellie Cooper accused Johnson of inciting violence against MPs with her speech.
For example, the income gap in the United States is the highest ever.
Last year, the income gap between rich and poor was the highest since the U.S. Census Bureau began statistics on income in 1967. Washington and New York state are the largest income gaps.
The United States may be the richest country in the world, but it is also the way it is: super-rich people can continue to grow and thrive in any way, and a poor family often relies on the monkey to finance medical bills. Economic imbalances affect both wealth and income, which is at an all-time high.
One way to measure income gap is the Gini coefficient. The Gini coefficient is 0, representing absolute average, and the maximum is 1, representing the hypothetical scenario that a household has all the income in the country. For the past 50 years, the Census Bureau has been tracking this indicator. The Gini coefficient in the United States was 0.397 in 1967, but has risen to a peak of 0.485 in 2018.
There are also other countries in the world with even more significant income gaps, including some fairly strong economies. For example, the World Bank estimated the Guinea coefficient in South Africa in 2014 to be 0.63, while the Guinea coefficient in Brazil in 2017 was 0.53. In contrast, the Guinea coefficient in all EU countries is below 0.4.
New data shows that the areas with the greatest income gap are often rich areas, including Washington, D.C., New York, and Connecticut, and of course some poor areas, such as Puerto Rico and Louisiana, U.S.A. While the economic equality in Utah, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota is highest, these five states are among the most vulnerable to poverty.
Census Bureau data also showed that the growth of median household income stalled at over $62,000. This is the highest level measured by the US Community Survey, but the growth was only 0.8 from 2017 to 2018, a significant decrease from the previous three years, and this figure is almost non-existent when inflation levels are taken into account.
New statistics are likely to guide the Democratic nominees for next year's presidential election, and Democrats often support more taxes on super-rich people and big companies.
This could also undermine the ideological basis behind the corporate tax incentive policies implemented by the current government, which were approved by Congress in 2017 to convince multinational companies to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States while also sending income to the middle class and poor. In fact, these policies seem to only bring extra income to executives, while most other Americans miss the benefits of economic growth and record low unemployment.
A North Carolina man draws five times in the same lottery draw
A North Carolina man has drawn five times in the same lottery draw, including the grand prize of $163,634.
Garland Lancaster of Pickville told a North Carolina education lottery official that while he was staying with the Weissam Brothers company in Pickville, he bought five cash lotteries with his own five-set number, which could be drawn five times on Monday night.
When the lottery was drawn, my wife helped me write the number, and Lancaster said, "Oh, when my wife handed me the paper, I checked the lottery and I couldn't believe it. One line matched five numbers, the other line matched four numbers". I shouted, "Oh, I won! I won!"
Lancaster had a row of five numbers matching the middle prize numbers, for which he won $163,634 in prize money, while the remaining four numbers matching the numbers of their respective middle prize numbers won him $250.
The winner said he intends to use the money to pay his bills and to renovate some houses.
Tristan Thompson, the ex-boyfriend of Corel Kardashian, left another highly provocative comment on her photo wall, which was previously rumored to be about to be mixed up with Kardashian.
Tristan Thompson, the ex-boyfriend of Cole Kardashian, left another highly provocative comment on her photo wall, and there were rumors that he wanted to be with Kardashian.
Earlier this year, the 35-year-old star completely abandoned the National Basketball Association player after Thompson was accused of having an affair with family friend Jordan Woods - before Tristan had cheated when Cole was pregnant with their daughter, Tru, who was nine months pregnant at the time.
One discovered that Tristan left another warm compliment on the front page of Cole's photo wall.
Tristan, 28, refused to give up easily, however, leaving an embarrassing overstatement on his latest self-portrait of his ex-girlfriend.
In this blurry photo, Cole stands before the rising sun and writes as a mother: "I wish you the courage to explore every dream you have".
In a public commentary, Ritterstein wrote: "The sun shines brightly on the beautiful you [diamond face symbol]".
Fans were angry with the comment, and someone replied: "Oh yes, the diamond you dropped".
Tristan betrayed her when Cole was nine months pregnant.
Another fan warned: "You roll out the photo wall".
The third person wrote: "Cole, don't be so mean".
Just days ago, Tristan wrote: "The perfect skirt, with a heart-shaped eye-face next to it, is located below one of Cole's other reality shows photos, a photo she modeled for Gaels jeans.
Earlier this month, Tristan spent £400,000 on a Porsche for Cole, on Drake's advice, to try to merge with Cole, the Sun newspaper revealed.
Earlier this year, he was accused of spying on a friend of the Cardassian family, Jody Wood.
After his rap partner urged him to come back for a big move, Tristan decided to pick the nice gift, which was supposedly a Porsche 911.
Finally, his friends said Tristan won Cole's invitation to attend a cocktail dinner at her home on Tuesday - a step away from getting back together with Cardassian and their 17-month-old daughter, Tru.
A source said that Puterstein and Drake were good friends and that he had been asking Drake for advice when he planned to catch up with Cardaysan.
Tristan's infidelity has broken Cole's heart
"Dreck told him that if he wanted to catch Cole back, he had to do everything he could.
"Although it may not sound very reasonable to exchange a casual dinner for a trendy supercar.
But after Tristan did this, Cole did not immediately lay out the red carpet for him.
The couple are the parents of 17-month-old Tru.
In the new season of reality show "The Real Housewives of Kaddish" and the 16th trailer for the series, Cole Caddish wept silently over the betrayal of boyfriend Tristan Thompson.
The Sun newspaper revealed last month that Tristan had planned to invite Cole on a romantic trip to Greece after taking an oath: "Oh, I will bring my family back".
Although Cole was heartbroken by Tristan's continued betrayal during their courtship, earlier this year he invited Tristan to their daughter Tru's first birthday party.
However, the star's family reality show and a team of Kardashians later revealed that the incident ended with Cole having difficulty accepting Tristan's infidelity.
Children's Hospital refrigerator malfunction: 56 children with cancer have lost their stem cells
A malfunction in the refrigerator at Children's Hospital Los Angeles caused damage to 56 children's blood stem cells, which were collected and stored for future use at the start of each patient's tumor treatment.
In a statement, the hospital wrote: "We deeply apologize for the pain or confusion caused to the patient and his family. If you do not receive letters or calls from our team, your children will not be affected".
All patients have received basic treatment, except one patient. Chief Medical Officer James Stein said that the patient did need to recover stem cells.
The letters sent to the families of patients in early September informing them of the loss of stem cells were accidentally sent to the children, not the parents. The hospital has also apologized to the parents, saying that it will monitor the transmission of the message.
The hospital said that the damage to long-term storage stem cells did not harm the health of any child. The hospital has also provided assistance to families who want to collect again. But the process of collection may be more difficult.
One patient said he was "outraged". 13-year-old Sean Anderson Corona was treated with stem cells after being diagnosed with stage 4 neuromomal cell tumor (a cancer often found in the adrenal gland). The boy stayed in the machine all day, and the machine collected stem cells from his blood. Then the machine re-injected the blood into the body.
"I'll try to sleep, but my body will start to get sick, and then I'll go crazy and cry", Corona told ABC-7.
In November, Corona will have no recurrence of cancer for three years. But his mother Elizabeth Anderson said she was worried that if his cancer recurred, it might not be possible to extract more stem cells from his blood.
Stein said that only if the patient's disease recurred and requires stem cells would the patient be recommended to recover stem cells.
He said: "Well, we think this is almost unlikely, so we will not ask anyone to do this in advance".
The hospital has replaced the refrigerator, and the sensor monitoring and alarm system has been upgraded.
"Obviously, this is a huge expense for us", said Stein. "We will personally contact each family directly to ensure that all their questions are answered".
Prince Harry attacked Princess Dafa's mother-in-law walking through the Angolare district
This was the sixth day of the Duke of Sussex's visit to Africa with his wife, Meghan and son Archie. But on Friday morning Prince Harry returned to Angola alone, intending to inherit the legacy of his mother, Princess Diana.
Harry, wearing a bright blue protective vest provided by the Halo Trust, successfully inherited his mother's legacy. Twenty-two years ago, Princess Diana left her mark on a similar road, passing through an area of deadly landmines buried in Angola, which were left behind during the Civil War. This became one of the most iconic images of her short life.
On 15 January 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales, wearing a protective vest and mask, visited a lighthouse in Angola's Wanbo province, which was cleaned up by the Charity Trust.
Diana had been working hard to eliminate such weapons of war, but she had not been able to do so during her lifetime, and she died only months before the International Convention against Mine Accidents was promulgated in December 1997.
Twenty years later, the world still cannot escape the threat of landmines. Prince Harry detonated a newly discovered mine, responding loudly and clearly to his mother's wishes.
Prince Harry said that the mine was a wound from war that has no cure. Through the mine, we can help the local community achieve peace, and peace will bring opportunity.
Prince Harry exploded the latest detected landmine in Angola.
Thomas Cook Pension Trustee Plans Spending Rescue Agreement
The Thomas Cook-led pension fund has begun negotiating a deal with professional insurers to save the retirement plan benefits of the bankrupt tourism group.
Sky News learned that Steves Steer, chairman of the board, is negotiating a buy-and-let deal with several companies that will free the majority of the 140,000 members of the Thomas Cook pension plan from a significant reduction in pension payments.
Any transaction with the insurance company could involve spending cuts, much smaller than the 10% spending cuts triggered by transferring the pension plan to the Pension Protection Fund lifeboat.
The discussion is still in its very early stages - even if successful - until the agreement is reached after the Pension Protection Fund evaluates the Thomas Cook program.
Thomas Cook's owners are facing an investigation into the reasons for the group's bankruptcy.
The investigation could last two years, and if the Thomas Cook scheme does introduce a pension protection fund, spending on about 10,000 pensioners will be reduced by 10% in the future.
According to reports, several pension risk transfer experts, and at least one new "superfund" integration company, are negotiating the agreement with Thomas Cook's trustee.
Four days after the UK's longest-running travel company went into a hiatus, news of trustees' efforts to ensure member welfare sparked an international repatriation scheme that resulted in thousands of unemployed people.
Thomas Cook's deep bankruptcy triggered a fierce blame game, with board members, government ministers and auditors all requiring explanations for the group's actions in the months leading up to its bankruptcy.
According to the latest data, four pension plans of Thomas Cook are adequately funded, with an excess of £100 million under the Pension Protection Fund.
They have assets worth about £1.5 billion in total.
However, Sky News revealed last month that the trustees asked Thomas Cook to add more favorable terms to the rescue deal, which complicated the deal.
Thomas Cook's bankruptcy ended his 178-year deal with insolvency, prompting government bankruptcy services, accounting regulators and an influential committee of MPs to launch an investigation into Thomas Cook.
Ministers have set up a task force to deal with the crisis, which has made creditors lose their profits after the group went bankrupt.
So far, less than half of Thomas Cook's overseas British customers have returned to the country.
Just hours before his bankruptcy, Thomas Cook issued a final plea to his lending institution to reduce the funding demand of £200 million.
What is the problem with Thomas Cook?
Negotiations ended on Sunday evening, but no agreement was reached, and Thomas Cook was forced to seek new funding of over £10 billion, which was its last crazy. Before that, the company lost £1.5 billion for six months and the situation in the deal was deteriorating.
Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 by a 32-year-old furniture carpenter, a former Baptist minister, who introduced the idea of a day train journey from Leicester to Rafflesburg, which required only one ticket per person.
Thomas Cook has come a long way since then, becoming one of the world's largest holiday companies, marking its 175th anniversary three years ago.
A spokesperson for the Pension Protection Fund said: "Some bankruptcies, such as the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook, were the reason for the creation of the Pension Protection Fund.
"We provide financial security for the future of the members of the fixed income pension scheme, and the members of the scheme should be confident that we will protect them".
A spokesman for the Thomas Cook Pension Trust declined to comment on Friday.
The image shows newborn rhino's nose-pissing and exploring new homes.
The baby named Stella was born earlier this month at the Cotswold Wildlife Sanctuary in Oxfordshire, and was the first female baby born to Monty and Ruby.
The young is healthy and well cared for, as can be seen from the photos, it is curious about its surroundings and sleeps with the mother on a grass bed.
In 2009, mother Ruby and another female named Nancy joined the zoo in hopes of having the first baby rhino in Monti.
In 2013, Nancy gave birth to the next female cub named Astrid, and Stella was the third female cub born in 49 years of the park's construction.
Jamie Craig, the director of the Cotswold Wildlife Sanctuary, said: "We have had great success in breeding existing rhino populations.
Munstra is the sixth child of Nancy and Ruby, and our bull Monty has proven to be an excellent father.
He is the perfect combination of a ruling bull and a caring parent.
It is particularly satisfying that Ruby gave birth to a calf, which is crucial to the development of the breeding program, and that Stella will eventually be transferred to another group, hoping to become a successful mother herself.
Ruby had previously given birth to two male cubs, Ian in 2015 and Alan in 2017. Alan remained at the park while Ian was at Turin Zoo in Italy.
When Allen was only a week old, he weighed about 11 pounds.
Captive births are considered extremely rare. Females reproduce only once every two and a half to five years, so the window of opportunity for successful reproduction is limited.
According to the park, female rhinoceroses usually have to be 16 to 18 months pregnant before they can produce their next young.
It is considered to be one of the longest animals in land mammals, after an elephant, which is 22 months pregnant.
The newborn rhinos can only stand within an hour of birth. After birth, the rhinos will immediately try to suck, although their legs may be slightly unstable during the first few days.
It will absorb about a year's milk under the mother's watch.
Their relationship is very close, and the young rhino will stay with their mother for at least two years under her protection. The female will actively protect their offspring and if challenged, they will intimidate their opponents.
Alex Minassian, a man who volunteered to be alone, told Toronto police that he was a member of the 4chan website organization.
The man in the picture allegedly killed 10 pedestrians in Toronto, told police he was a member of an online sex-crazed men's organization.
Alex Minasian, 26, said he was a member of the 4chan website's non-voluntary singles forum.
After the April 23, 2018, attack, he now faces 10 homicide charges and 16 attempted homicide charges in Canada.
When asked about the dead, he told the police: "Oh, I feel I have accomplished my mission".
After the incident, people became concerned about the online world of loneliness, anger and anti-feminism.
Minassian said he had contacted a killer in California who was angry at the woman who rejected him.
He was accused of driving a rented pickup truck into a crowd in a busy community in northern Toronto. Eight women and two men were killed in the crash, with ages ranging from 22 to 94.
Minasian has not yet filed a defence. His trial began in February, but the publication ban on him being questioned by the police has been lifted today. The police interviewed him hours after the attack.
Minasiang said he never gave up his girlfriend and was a boyfriend, admitting that he used the van as a weapon and said he wanted to launch more attacks.
He said: "Well, a few other people I know online feel the same way, but they are too timid to take action to expose their anger".
Minnesotans call themselves "incel" - short for "incel" - a term that stands for "incel" - a non-voluntary single person movement that is an online subcultural group associated with the deadly attacks in Toronto and attacks in California and Florida. The group promotes the idea of hatred of women, that men have the right to have sex with women.
Sociologists and other scholars from this group believe that the term "non-voluntary single parent" has become a popular term for anger among certain men who are angry at being rejected by women and tend to generate violent retaliatory ideas.
On online forums, people with an interest in sex sometimes use the terms "child" and "child" as disparaging slang, referring to men and women who are more active in sexual life, respectively.
Minasiang said he discussed his sexual misconduct on 4chan, a site that has become notorious for extremist views.
The US court line fears shooting repeats, banning clown and clown viewers from watching Joe
The largest independent theater in the United States forbids viewers dressed in jeans to watch the critically acclaimed Joker - the story of the super-replicant incarnation in the Batman film. Although the theater has already banned viewers from wearing masks or colored faces, safety concerns remain.
Most of the American courtroom has banned viewers from wearing masks, painting faces or carrying toy weapons, due to the major shooting in Aurora, Colorado, during the 2012 release of another Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises. The gunman dressed in clown costume, shot the audience and threw tear gas, killing 12 people and injuring 70.
However, the Landmark Theatre announced this time that it would not allow Joe's dressed audience to watch the limited-rated movie The Joker.
"I hope the audience is more relaxed when they see the film", Ted Mondov, chairman and CEO of the Landmark Cinema, told Hollywood reporters.
The company is headquartered in Los Angeles and has 52 theaters in 27 regions nationwide, making it the largest professional movie theater line in the United States.
Meanwhile, the largest chain cinema in the United States, the American multi-purpose cinema in Kansas, reaffirmed that the cinema prohibits wearing masks, colored faces or any objects that cover faces, but welcomes viewers in costume.
The ban on masks and fake guns was more of a practical safety consideration, but as the release of the Joker movie approaches, people fear it will trigger a simulated shooting incident. The Los Angeles Police Department said that on the day of the premiere, police will stand tight around the theater to wait, while the Emperor movie theater, the second largest chain of theater in the United States, said that security measures were being implemented in cooperation with NATO.
The US Army even advises soldiers to beware of the involuntary single men, usually men who are unhappy because they don't get the chance to date, who worship clowns and may imitate his cruel behavior.
The Joker, directed by Todd Phillips and starring Jacqueline Phoenix, was scheduled to hit theaters nationwide on October 4, and was expected to hit box office records again. The film's protagonist is a descendant of a man with a mental disorder, who becomes a killer demon, green hair, grayish white, and the ultimate enemy of Batman.
The Clown was well received after its premiere at the Venice Film Festival and won the Golden Lion Award, the highest prize. It is a psychological thriller adapted from the comic book of the same name. Some critics worry that the film may have a negative impact because the film's protagonists are sympathetic rebels and the violence is too real. However, the film's main creative team said that the audience of the work is adults who can clearly tell whether or not.
Midway Broadcasting Corporation announced today that Mrs. Melody Spann Cooper, chairman of the company, will publish a highly anticipated new book to help women entrepreneurs and executives develop their careers. The Women's Friendship Success Trading Guide shares her many insights and insights, including how women can speak up for equality at the negotiating table and how to use the Women's Alumni Relations Network to advance career development.
In his book, Spann Cooper frequently quotes rumors and jokes to explain controversial topics, including the #MeToo movement and the presidential campaign defeat of Hillary Clinton and its impact on the empowerment of American women.
In 2017, Spean Cooper delivered a groundbreaking speech at the National Association of Women Entrepreneurs in Chicago, promoting a sense of self-exaltation, and the author's self-published book was the crystal of the speech.
Businesswoman Christy Hefner, daughter of Hugh Hefner, founder of the Plum Plum Company, said that the Plum Company's success guide to female friends is interesting and helpful. Melody combines personal misadventures, success stories, and setbacks with real-world experience. From how to express their ideas at meetings to when it is appropriate to make friends, everyone can benefit greatly from Melody's story.
As chairman of Midway Broadcasting, she bought the controlling stake in the company in 1999 and successfully rose to the top of the elite women's broadcasting company in the United States. Midway Broadcasting is a leading women's family media company with multiple broadcasting and interactive platforms under its umbrella.
T. Shaun Taylor, co-author of the book, is a journalist, author and founder of Tree Top, a full-service media consulting firm.
Romania spent billions on military bases in the Black Sea
According to the focus news agency quoted by the Times, Romania will spend €2.5 billion to modernize the military base in the Black Sea to counter Russia's growing influence in the region. Documents published by the local news website show that the Mihail Kogrignihanol Air Base, located about 200 kilometers east of Bucharest, will conform to NATO standards. It will accommodate up to 10,000 NATO F-35 fighter jets. Plans are underway to build a military mini-city with a kindergarten, sports club and hospital.
The base has become the center of NATO's increased activities in the Black Sea, while the Black Sea has become a key area of tension between Russia and the West. After Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin began using the deep sea base in Sevastopol to carry out naval missions in Syria to increase naval strength in the Black Sea. Russia also obstructed transportation in the region, capturing three Ukrainian ships in the Red Sea last year.
Romania and Bulgaria, former Soviet allies, joined NATO and the European Union after the Soviet Union collapsed. In response to Russia's actions, they demanded NATO strengthen its presence in the region. In February, 500 US troops arrived at the Romanian air base. The British Air Force's European Typhoon Fighter Squadron has been stationed and completed deployment. Since April, these Russian fighters have intercepted several times. Georgia, located on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, is also concerned about Russia's ambitions. It is not a member of NATO, but has participated in NATO military exercises. NATO Secretary-General Janis Tolberg said in March that North Korea was preparing to join the North Asian Expedition when it visited Kyrgyzstan. Ukraine has also participated in the North Asian Expedition since 2014.
Ukraine is once again in the throes of scandal over the new Berlin Wall
Boroshenko, who was eager to win President Trump's support, was increasingly worried that political opponents would block his reelection, paving the way for Giuliani to pressure the then-Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Yuri Lukashenko, to investigate Joe Biden and his son and help him get reelected.
But it is unclear how the Trump administration hopes to help him turn the tide before the two rounds of the Ukrainian presidential election in March and April this year. In any case, he was hit hard and lost to Zelensky, whose officials soon became the new target of the Trump team to strike Biden.
While Democrats want President Trump impeached for his involvement with Ukraine, the president and his allies have countered with the self-made Ukraine scandal. They reiterated a disclosed claim that Ukraine colluded with the Clinton campaign team to reduce Trump's chances of running in 2016, and claimed that Biden used his vice presidency to prevent Ukraine from investigating his son, with little evidence.
Over the years, the Ukrainian people have grown tired of seeing their leaders constantly use their power and privileges in exchange for personal economic or political interests; today, most Ukrainians are indifferent to the possibility of the worst scandal against the Trump administration in the White House since President Richard Nixon was overthrown in the Watergate incident in 1974.
Ukraine, which was once the center of attention of few Americans, is now the center of Washington's attention, which is a very confusing feeling in Ukraine. This feeling is also a sense of pride, and after hundreds of years in the shadow of Russia, the powerful neighbor to the north, Ukraine is no longer considered a dead body, but incredibly has become a turning point in the destiny of the most powerful country in the world.
This week, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin tweeted a sharp message saying that the prospect of Ukraine being the country that led to the impeachment of the US president is not great. But he added: "Now everyone knows our resilience".
Brother of Pakistani netizen Kardel Baroh sentenced to life imprisonment for honor killing
Karder Baroh, who was famous for his social media photos, was hanged in July 2016.
The brother of Pakistani social media star Carndale Baroh was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison on Friday, the country's most notorious murder case.
Baroh rose to fame for her humorous self-improvements, which were not considered anything by Western standards, but were considered provocative in Pakistan, which hated feminism so much, that she was hanged in July 2016.
Her brother Mohammad Wasim was arrested. A few days later, he said at a press conference that he did not regret anything he did, admitting that he murdered his sister, and that the behaviour of his sister was intolerable.
His lawyer Sadal Mehmud told AFP that the court in the eastern city of Multan had found his party guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment, a highly impressive verdict.
He said: "If the situation allows, he will be acquitted by the High Court, yes".
Earlier, Baroh's mother, Anwar May, told AFP that she hoped her son would be released without charge.
"My son was murdered and my daughter was killed", she said.
Baroh's murder made international headlines and again called for action to combat the spread of the so-called "honor killing" epidemic, in which a victim, usually a woman, is murdered for violating the social norms of fatherhood.
Women were burned, shot, stabbed and beheaded for crimes such as glorifying their gender and bringing shame to their families for free choice of husband or mother in the Baroque case.
This murder is usually committed by relatives. Under the Pakistani Blood Debt and Retaliation Act, they can seek forgiveness from relatives of victims.
Three months after Baroh's murder, Parliament passed new legislation that would sentence those who kill in defence of their honour to life imprisonment.
But whether murder is defined as a felony is decided by the judge, which means that the killer can claim different motives in theory, but still get amnesty.
In the Baroh case, her parents initially insisted that they would not forgive their son.
But once they thought they were sad about losing their son, they changed their minds and said they hoped he would be forgiven.
The international community's reaction to the murder prompted the Pakistani government to take an unprecedented step to declare the government jointly with parents as the heir to the victim, but this forced the case to continue.
Some of Baroh's well-known acts include performing strip dances for the Pakistan cricket team and wearing a coveted orange red dress on Valentine's Day.
Her behavior has received some criticism and threats, but many, including young people, believe that the Kim Kardashian-like figure can be seen as a bold political act that empowers women and creates a new situation for the country.
The roots of the smear killings are in tribal social norms, which remain prevalent throughout South Asia and specifically regulate the behavior of women, although men may also be victims.
Three Scottish students were named best students in Europe
Three students from the University of Dundee in the UK were named the best graduates in Europe.
In the 2019 Global Undergraduate Student Award, three students at Dundee University were named the best graduates in Europe in their respective fields, while five other students at the university also received recognition from the judging panel.
Scott Sherrick graduated with a degree in molecular genetics, winning the European Best Graduate Award in Life Sciences; Chester Comford pursued a Master of Science in Mental Health Care, winning awards in nursing, midwifery and specialized health care; and Laura Nebbs won the Visual Arts Award.
Despite the fact that all three students qualified for the global finals and lost in the final fierce competition, 3,500 students from all over the world participated in the finals.
Professor Blair Graub, Vice Chancellor for Education at Dundee University, said: "To reach this stage, our students and graduates face competition with the world's top university students.
Thousands of students around the world are encouraged to compete for undergraduate awards, and the representation of students at Dundee University among these winners reflects the quality of our students and the level of education they have received here.
I warmly congratulate Scott, Chester and Laura on their extraordinary achievements, as well as other highly acclaimed students representing the Dundee.
Five other students from Dundee University have also been recognized in the world's top undergraduate student awards, which recognize their top academic achievements and share them with a global audience.
The five students who received the award were: Nicholas Garagall and James Osborne (both for Life Sciences), Florence Chae Shigawa (specifically for Medicine), Kathleen Scott (anatomy) and Yoko Ono (philosophy).
The selection further praised the academic performance of the best undergraduate students in the school and helped students and recent graduates from around the world build bridges of collaboration.
The palace of the Queen of the Ancient Order of Stones
An international team of astronomers used the Sparrow, Cake and Twin Telescope to discover 12 galaxies that existed about 13 billion years ago. This is the oldest known galaxy cluster to date. The largest of these is the cluster found 10 years ago by the Sparrow Telescope, named after the Queen of the Japanese Mythology. This discovery suggests that a massive galaxy structure like the Star Cluster existed only 800 million years before the formation of the universe, and only accounts for 6% of its present age.
In the present universe, galaxy clusters may contain hundreds of galaxies, but how they formed remains a major question in astronomy. To understand the formation of galaxy clusters, astronomers search for possible origins in the ancient universe. The original galaxy clusters were a clustered system of dozens of galaxies in the early universe that gradually formed a galaxy cluster.
The team of astronomers was led by Yu Kiyama, a researcher at the Japan Academic Revival Institute at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, who explained that the Zhou-Pai galaxy is a rare and special highly dense system of galaxies that is very difficult to find. To solve this problem, we used the wide field of view of the Sbarou telescope to map the vast sky and look for the original galaxy.
On a map of the universe drawn by the Sbalou telescope, the team discovered a suspected galaxy z66OD, which was 15 times denser than the normal galaxy of the time. Subsequently, the team used the Keck Observatory and the North Twelve Telescope to make follow-up spectral observations, confirming that the 12 galaxies existed 13 billion years ago, the oldest known galaxy cluster to date.
Interestingly, one of the 12 galaxies in z66OD was found in 2009 by the Sbarru telescope, and contains a large amount of gas. Zheng Zhengmei, a team member of the National Observatory of Japan and Tokyo University who discovered the galaxy, mentioned that it is possible to find a galaxy near a massive celestial body such as Zhengmei in the vicinity of the galaxy. However, we were surprised that Zhengmei was not at the center of the galaxy, but was at the edge of the galaxy 500 million light years away. Ironically, the mythical queen of Zhengmei is also said to have lived a life apart from the world. Zhengmei continued: It is not clear why Zhengmei is not in the middle. But these results will provide important information about the relationship between the galaxy and the mass of the galaxy.
Nancy Pelosi becomes the protagonist of her daughter, Christine Pelosi's new book
A new book about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is about to be published, written by a woman who knows her daughter, Christine Pelosi.
The Times Book Publisher announced Thursday that Nancy Pelosi's Roadmap will be released on November 26. The work of Chris Pelosi will tell how a mother of five became the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives and her current leadership of House Democrats under the Trump administration. According to the Times, Chris Pelosi's new book will intertwine her mother's career and personal experience of the House of Representatives.
Christie Pelosi is currently a Democratic strategic analyst, and has written the campaign training camp and campaign training camp 2.0 series. Pelosi's sister, Alexandra Pelosi, is a filmmaker and journalist who has made several documentaries about contemporary politics.
Warren donated the money to an anti-abortion charity.
When Senator Elizabeth Warren (Democrat from Massachusetts) bought drinks from two girls who ran a water-resistant booth in August, she may not have realized that the $10 she bought would be donated to an anti-abortion charity.
Our daughters think Warren is friendly, and she's a Trump supporter, and one of the girls' fathers, Dan Mitchell, told the Washington Freedom Star. She walked over and told us she should vote for her. Our daughter told us she was a good person, but we didn't agree with her politically... because she argued that women have the right to choose abortion, we said we should donate her money to an anti-abortion campaign.
On August 8, Warren stopped in front of a water tank on a campaign bus trip in Iowa, with two 11-year-old children on the stand: Sienna Michaels and Audrey Billings.
When you arrive in Harlan, Iowa, and have a drink before a water heater, you will make a major structural change when life gives you a break! Warren tweeted.
The two children were pleased to see a presidential candidate. After the photo was released, a girl named Michaels urged her parents to vote for the Massachusetts senator in 2020. However, the parents explained Warren's position on abortion. The girls and their parents decided to donate to the Foundation for Life Education and Defense, a nonprofit organization that supports anti-abortion legislation.
Michelle said: "My daughter told us that she wanted us to vote for her. We talked about abortion and said that maybe we should donate money to anti-abortion causes, and my daughter totally agrees".
Why there is a need to reclassify herpes virus and Zika virus: the impact of biotechnology
The latest research suggests that the way people perceive the structure of viruses needs to be re-adjusted, because their structure is actually more diverse than previously understood, and these findings may have a significant impact on our understanding of how they form, evolve and infect their hosts, and how their vaccines are designed to respond to them.
In the 1950s and 1960s, scientists began obtaining high-resolution images of viruses, discovering the detailed structure of the virus coat; the coat is made up of an outer protective layer of multiple copies of the same protein, used to protect the genetic material of the virus. Most virus coats are typically spherical, presenting a twenty-faced symmetrical structure, like a twenty-faced necklace.
Clothes are the protective layer of viruses, and when scientists discovered the structure of clothing, they proposed that clothing has different sizes and carries different numbers of genomes, so the virus can infect the host in different ways.
Why is this important?
When designing drugs for viruses, scientists can now consider their different structural shapes to improve efficacy.
Two researchers at the Institute for Virus Information, Anthony Luke, a theoretical biophysicist at San Diego State University and Rayton Diwallock, a mathematical physicist at York University in the UK, concluded that many viruses had been basically misclassified over 60 years, including common viruses such as herpes simplex and Zika virus.
Although we have obtained structural images of low temperature electron microscopes, the researchers have not mathematically described the different viral structures.
Luke mentioned: "Well, we discovered six new protein compositions for the twenty-sided clothing. Therefore, many viruses do not only adopt two widely known clothing structures. There are now at least eight ways to design their twenty-sided clothing.
The researchers used the generalization of the principle of par-equivalence to observe how the protein wrapped the twenty-fold coat.
Their results, which will be published in the journal Nature Communications on Friday, September 27, also suggest that viruses belonging to the same structural spectrum will adopt a consistent twenty-sided clothing layout based on their protein composition, which provides a new approach to studying viral evolution.
Application of biotechnology
Structural biologists can now use this information to reclassify the structure of viruses, which will help reveal the molecular and evolutionary relationships between different viruses.
It will also provide guidance for new molecular containers designed for applications in nanotechnology and biotechnology, and will help scientists identify specific strategies for protein assembly in clothing. This could provide a more systematic approach to developing antiviral vaccines.
Luke said: "We can use this finding to target the assembly and stability of the wardrobe to prevent virus from forming when the host cells are infected by the virus, or to break it down after the virus forms. This may help to characterize and identify the anti-virus markers of the virus that share the same twenty-faceted body layout".
This new framework incorporates previously isolated viruses, provides new predictions of the structure of viral mantles, and identifies common geometric patterns in the long evolution of viruses infecting all organisms from humans to bacteria.
Diwalok noted that the new blueprint also provides a new perspective on the evolution of the virus, showing a new path from simple viral evolution to larger and more complex viruses on the evolutionary time scale.
Application of building
Geometry can also be used in new building design and construction.
Inspired by the geometrical dome of the geometrical curve designed by renowned architect Buckminster Fuller, structural biologist Donald Caspar and biophysicist Aaron Kruger introduced a geometric framework for classifying viruses according to the geometric framework of viral mantle since the 1960s. However, with the gradual advancement of molecular imaging technology, including herpes virus and Zika virus, the reconstruction of 3D viral mantle has moved away from this classic geometric framework.
Luke explained that the study of the ribbon would introduce a more general framework than the classic Caspa-Crueg structure. It is based on the maintenance of local peaks formed by proteins interacting within the ribbon. This method discovered six new types of twenty-sided ribbon layers, while recovering two classic layers from the Caspa-Crueg based on high-density and measured polygons.
A priest in Wisconsin who sexually abused boys was sentenced to 30 years in prison
A former priest accused of sexually abusing boys decades ago in Wisconsin was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
Thomas Erickson, 72, was sentenced to life in prison on Thursday for two counts of sexual assault of a child, both in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when he was a priest at St. Peter's Catholic Church in the winter of the 20th century.
Four men testified in court on Thursday, accusing the sexual assault of affecting their lives. One of the victims was publicly exposed for the first time.
Erickson apologized to the victim in court, saying he was beginning to realize the impact of his actions on the victim. At least 11 men claimed they were abused while Erickson was a priest.
Erikson was removed from the priesthood in 1988.
Too much of this stuff can damage the liver
Made from the bark of the carrot tree, meat pie is a popular seasoning, flavoring ingredient in various foods, and has even become a unique flavor in itself.
This spice has some impressive health benefits, such as reducing the risk of developing life-threatening diseases such as heart disease, cancer and even diabetes, and therefore, it is inevitable to be popular.
But don't rush to the conclusion that too much is harmful to the body. In this case, if the human body consumes too much meatloaf, there will be some side effects. We should ensure safety.
Although it may help reduce the risk of cancer, it is unfortunate that it can also cause cancer. According to animal studies, too much soybeans common in meat can increase the risk of cancer if consumed too much. Scientists say that in the long run, soybeans can damage our DNA, causing cancer.
According to studies, too much soybean intake can also lead to liver toxicity and damage. This is based on several studies on the effects of too much soybean intake on the human body.
It is thought that excessive intake of meatloaf can cause fatal conditions and cause mouth ulcers. It is thought that this is because meatloaf contains meatloaf, which is a compound that causes an allergic reaction in humans after consuming it in large quantities. However, only people who are allergic to meatloaf can get mouth ulcers.
This is more of a common precaution because the meat is substantially thin, easily inhaled, and can cause coughing and vomiting.
For many people, carbohydrates are beneficial because they reduce blood sugar. This is very good, especially for those with high blood sugar. However, too much intake can cause too low blood sugar in the body, which leads to a series of new health risks.
Tennessee abortion awaits trial and judge's decision
In a 48-hour abortion pending trial in Tennessee, a federal judge must decide which expert he wants to hear.
In a four-day trial that ended Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee tried to prove that the law requiring women to visit clinics at least 48 hours apart would give them time to reflect on their decision to abort, and that it was beneficial for them. The acting attorneys of five abortion clinics (the state has seven abortion clinics) argued that the law would not bring any benefits but would instead create a huge burden.
Experts on both sides agreed that some women seeking abortion were not sure about the decision, while some women who aborted later regretted their decision. But experts disagreed that this segment was less than the proportion of women seeking abortion, and that the Tennessee 48-hour waiting period had no effect on these women.
On Thursday, the state's attorney introduced a study in Utah on the 72-hour waiting period effect. The study found that 8% of women who went to the clinic for the first time said they no longer wanted to seek abortion.
When asked about the study, Anthony Biggs, a social psychologist at the University of California, San Francisco, agreed that some women would change their minds about abortion or they would have a negative opinion at first. But she noted that the study did not prove that Utah's mandatory waiting period changed women's minds, nor did she find it beneficial for women in other ways.
Biggs also confirmed that there is no evidence to date that abortion leads to mental health problems for women. She said that a national study compared women who had successful abortions before the end date of abortion to women who had been denied access to the clinic after the end date, and found that the two had no difference in the ratio of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.
In a cross-sectional questioning, Biggs noted that the study did not track the mental health outcomes of women who changed their minds after a waiting period, although only three women were found in the study. She countered testimony earlier this week by Priscilla Coleman, a psychology professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, who said abortion was linked to mental health issues.
Coleman testified that she believes that most scientific literature related to abortion supports the political tendency towards abortion.
On Thursday, a gynecologist in Memphis testified for the state, joining a highly controversial network group that tried to block the effectiveness of abortion medicines. Dr. Britt noted that through this work he personally contacted women who changed the idea of abortion.
Tennessee's waiting period law went into effect in mid-2015, and Pedrassa said he has witnessed many women who tried to block abortion after taking abortion drugs. Among these women, he testified, who once again changed their minds and eventually completed abortions. Even with a waiting period, this shift in thinking will still occur.
The head of the clinic confirmed earlier that the waiting period can bring economic difficulties and stress for women. The head also said that the two consultations required brought a coordination challenge for both patients and the clinic, which led to abortion being delayed beyond the 48 hours prescribed by law, forcing some women to seek surgical abortions, which increase the risk of complications. A small number of women are forced to wait and exceed the time they can abort.
According to the Gutmach Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, 14 states across the United States have enacted laws requiring women seeking abortion to go to abortion clinics twice, and Tennessee is one of them.
When deciding whether a waiting period violated the U.S. Constitution, District Judge Bernard Friedman had to determine whether it brought an excessive burden on women seeking abortion. Some subjective criteria led to the repeal of some waiting periods laws, while others continued to be maintained, depending on the actual situation in each state.
On Thursday, after the parties had submitted the evidence they had, Friedman said he would make a ruling as soon as possible.
The problem is endless, the fire at the French chemical plant is extinguished
As the stench continues to spread to large parts of the country, French authorities and Normandy residents are cleaning up the remnants of the factory fire.
A Lubrication Plant in Rouen caught fire on Thursday, and no one was injured, but residents on both sides of the Seine River in the vicinity expressed concern about the potential health risks and consequences.
The head of the local administration said on Friday that after nearly 24 hours of effort, the fire was extinguished on Thursday night.
French authorities warned that after the fire was extinguished, a special odor could be spread to neighboring areas.
French Interior Minister Christophe Castane said that people with health problems should stay home until Friday night.
The cause of the fire is under investigation. The plant is listed as one of the highest industrial sites at risk in Europe.
Liquefied natural gas investment record and China's highest growth in 2019
Liquefied natural gas investment has reached $50 billion since the beginning of the year, setting an all-time high, International Energy Agency Director Fatih Birol said at an industry conference.
This year, the investment volume of 2019 broke the record for the first time - $50 billion, Bloomberg said at the Liquefied Natural Gas Producers Consumer Conference in Tokyo, citing Reuters' comments.
Unsurprisingly, the driving factor behind investment growth is Asia's growing energy demand; China is expected to surpass Japan to become the world's largest importer of liquefied natural gas.
The biggest growth in liquefied natural gas comes from China. In the next five years, one third of global liquefied natural gas demand will come from China alone, said Mr. Banbiror. He added that in five years, China will become the largest importer of the fuel.
It is no wonder that the investment volume has increased, and the United States and Canada have completed most of the investment.
In a report released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration in December 2018, it was predicted that by the end of this year, U.S. liquefied natural gas export capacity would double to 8.9 billion cubic feet per day. This would also make the U.S. the world's third largest liquefied natural gas exporter after Qatar and Australia. By 2030, U.S. liquefied natural gas exports are expected to increase from 3 billion cubic feet at the beginning of 2019 to 17 billion cubic feet per day.
Canada currently has only one liquefied natural gas project under construction - Canada Liquefied Natural Gas - but its final annual capacity could reach 28 million tons. The project cost $31 billion and is led by Shell, with minority shareholders including Malaysia State Oil Company, China Oil, Samsung and South Korean Natural Gas Company.
Meanwhile, Qatar is also stepping up efforts to maintain its first position in the global liquefied natural gas export competition. Currently Qatar and Iran share the world's largest offshore gas field, the Northern Gas Field, and Qatar has lifted the ban on new drilling for the gas field, with the goal of increasing annual export capacity by 43%, to 1100 million tonnes per year.
According to the forecast of the world's leading business information service providers, the global demand for liquefied natural gas is expected to reach 5.5 billion tons by 2030.
Viola Davis recorded Jimmy Cummings live show, exploding the true-hearted journey of playing Michelle Obama
Viola Davis felt some pressure to play Michelle Obama.
The actor said on Thursday on the Jimmy Cummings live show: "Oh, I'm scared.
Last month it was announced that Davis would star as the former first lady in the series "The First Lady" adapted by Entertainment Time Television. Davis said the script was great, but she keenly realized that acting wasn't that easy.
She told host Cammore: "Oh, I don't care what I've accomplished this year, I've won an Emmy, an Oscar, and two Tony Awards, but if I do this, it will be a defining moment in my life".
Davis said she was waiting for her PR agent to call her and say goodbye, I'm Michelle Obama and I'm gonna kill you.
Davis also considered the audience in the sixth season of the "Final Season" of "Forever Out" (Final Season).
"Listen, I don't want to drive those who are watching me crazy", she said.
Judges concerned about the choice of drinking on the night of teenage abuse
A teenager assaulted his lover and the judge sentenced him to death, while expressing concern about the teenager's choice to drink before the assault.
A 19-year-old man, Killian Clifton, beat up a 17-year-old teenager, whom he believes was responsible for causing his separation from his ex-girlfriend.
The Royal Court of Oxford learned that Clifton had been drinking and making liquor at Fat Fox Bar in Waterington, Oxfordshire, shortly before the violence occurred in March last year.
Judge Nigel Daley told Clifton, who confessed to the actual physical harm (abh), that alcohol played a significant role in the violence that night.
But he talked about Clifton's choice of drinking: Did you drink Coca-Cola and Italian almonds? I'm surprised you're not sick!
Clifton, from Charing Grove, was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for 12 months, ordered to complete 15 days of renovation work and 160 hours of unpaid work and paid £750 in compensation.

Colombian President says: Head of Los Pelososos crime group in Colombia was beaten
The top leader and founder of the Los Pelosos crime group was killed in an operation led by the National Police of Colombia, President Ivan Duk announced Friday.
The gang is one of the most notorious criminal organizations in the Andes, and the fighting in which it participates has cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in the region bordering Venezuela and the country's east.
Luis Antonio Quintro, known as Pacra, was a left-wing opposition leader who led 440 gang members, the government said.
Pakra, 49, who was wanted by police for terrorism and murder, was located in North Santander province on Thursday.
Our goal is clear and clear: to completely defeat the organization, said Duke in a statement issued in the United States that he had traveled to the United States this week to attend the United Nations General Assembly.
Kintaro is responsible for the organization's killing of several human rights activists and community leaders, the statement added.
Duke has been criticized by some in the international community for not taking more action to stop the killing across the country and for avoiding extreme acts.
Another Los Pelosos' leader was also arrested in the operation, the statement added, but did not mention details of Kintro's death.
How dare you? In a speech at the United Nations, Tombery encouraged climate change protesters in the Netherlands.
On Friday, thousands of Dutch teenagers went on strike to protest global climate change, blocking local traffic, and asked their leaders how dare they do this? They quoted the screams of Swedish radical environmental activist Greta Tumbery in a UN speech.
On September 27, 2019, in The Hague, Netherlands, a protester held a portrait of the Swedish radical environmental activist Greta Thumbbery during a march, calling on the government to take action against climate change. Reuters/Peroška Vandervoord
The number of people attending the parade in The Hague exceeded expectations, with organizers estimating the number of protesters to be around 35,000. The police were forced to change the route of the parade and direct the protest squad to locations that could accommodate more people.
Tunbery, 16, gave a passionate speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York this week. On Friday, millions of people worldwide went on strike to join the climate change protest to promote the UN Climate Action Summit.
"When people continue to join the protests, strike protests will have a big impact, not only on today but also on the future, and we can see people from all walks of life coming in", said Randel Rustema, a protester in Beijing.
Protesters walked through the city center, waving flags and holding pictures of the tomb, with the sign on their hands: "Come for the beautiful grata, come for the stupid old antique, and come for us to die because of age, we die because of climate change".
I understand their concerns and believe people have heard their appeal, Prime Minister Mark Punt told reporters at a weekly press conference when protesters were marching near him. "We have put forward some costly plans to address these issues. But the way to implement it is flexible, and it can create jobs. "
The summit was launched with a brief speech in Tungbari, which was intended to mobilize governments and businesses to break the international record of carbon emissions, despite decades of warnings by scientists about the effects of climate change. Global carbon emissions reached record highs last year.
Oh, that's all wrong. I shouldn't be sitting here. I should be studying across the ocean, and you want to find us young people. How dare you do that? She said this with passion and a voice that stared at her.
The Netherlands has 17 million inhabitants, and renewable energy generated less than 7% of its total energy in 2017, compared to 15% in Germany and more than 50% in Sweden.
The Dutch government has pledged to halve 1990 carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, but only achieved 13% reduction by 2017.
On Friday, Tungbury also participated in the climate protest in Canada, when the leaders of the United Nations Civil Aviation Organization were holding a meeting in Montreal to discuss the emission reduction targets for the air transport industry.
Suicide has surged and the situation in the military is not optimistic
This year, the suicide rate among active duty soldiers has climbed to a new record high, and the continuation of this situation is deadly, Pentagon officials said, the situation is frustrating and is currently being actively addressed.
Data released by the Pentagon on Thursday showed that the suicide rate and total suicide rates in the Army, Navy and Marine Corps are on the rise, while the suicide rate in the Air Force alone is on the decline.
Earlier this month, the Navy reported that three crew members serving aboard the aircraft carrier George H.W. Bush had taken their own lives within a week, highlighting the difficulties faced by the service personnel in identifying potential problems and finding ways to prevent suicide.
Asked about the suicide of the carrier crew, Defense Minister Mark Espel said: "Oh, I wish I could tell you that we have found the answer that could prevent the armed forces from committing suicide in the future. But we have not found the answer. We are in the dilemma of the national youth suicide trend that some say".
The number of suicides in the U.S. military increased from 511 in 2017 to 541 in 2018. According to the Pentagon, the highest risk factor is young recruits, with at least 60% choosing guns as a method of suicide. The number of suicides in the Army increased from 114 to 139, the number of suicides in the Marine Corps increased from 43 to 58, and the number of suicides in the Navy increased from 65 to 68, while the Air Force decreased from 63 to 60.
Elizabeth Van Venk, director of the Pentagon's Office of Army Resistance, said: "Our numbers are not moving in the right direction". She said that most soldiers are treated differently than civilians, adding: "It's hard to be satisfied".
Military and defense leaders expressed disappointment and were determined to take more measures to improve the resilience of the troops, train soldiers on how to cope with stress more effectively, and encourage troops to seek help when needed. Van Venk said the military was also considering strengthening training on the safe storage of weapons and drugs for the troops. She said that there were no uniform rules or regulations between departments requiring locking or other control measures, but some states or bases had their own limits.
She and Karen Owens, director of the Office of Suicide Prevention, said it was difficult to identify prisoners who may be in pain or have suicidal thoughts, and that suicide was sometimes a sudden impulse decision with little warning in advance. They said it was difficult to find the cause of suicide because there were too many stressors that caused suicide.
They also acknowledged that the service personnel were reluctant to seek help because they feared that this would affect promotion or security checks. The military leaders said they must do more to address the issues that are seen as hindering development.
Marine Corps Commander General David Berger said: "In addition to physical health, gun practice training, training and education, the Marine Corps must also discuss life difficulties, mental health and suicide freely. We must build a community to seek help and assistance in making important decisions as Marine Corps and Marines".
This year, for the first time, the Pentagon included statistics on military spouses and family suicides in the category of consideration. Van Venk said that the latest figures were for 2017, but officials are working to improve the ability to collect data about families.
According to the data report, 186 families committed suicide, 123 of them were spouses and 63 were families between the ages of 12 and 23.
The vast majority (nearly 70%) are female spouses under the age of 40, while 70% of families who die by suicide are male. About half of those who die by suicide are over the age of 18, and for those who are younger, the majority of suicides are young people between the ages of 15 and 17.
Seth Meyers laughed at Donald Trump's impression of tangos and cash.
On Thursday, Late Night Show host Seth Meyers brought a moment of relief for a week that was so overwhelmed by mass shootings, and he nodded to Donald Trump, but he couldn't stand the laugh in the middle of the game.
The comedian mentioned the scenario of Trump visiting a hospital in El Paso, Texas, where victims of mass shootings over the weekend were being treated, and his campaign still owes the city more than $500,000 due to a political rally in February.
The event also generated a one-time lag money due to the failure to pay on time.
"Oh, this is Mr. President's consistent tune", Mayes said. "I was surprised that his presidential office desk was not flooded with unreturned DVDs".
Then he began to imitate Trump in the 1989 hit movie Tango and the Cash Box, but he soon became self-absorbed.
A man was thrown into prison after a bullet was found in the woman's skull
A man in Georgia was sentenced to 25 years in prison for shooting his girlfriend after his girlfriend realized she had left a bullet in her head and survived while she was being treated for a headache.
According to news media reports, 39-year-old Gerant Kayne was sentenced Thursday for the felony charge of possession of a weapon in the 2017 attack on 42-year-old Nicole Gordon.
Gordon, who suffered from severe headaches and memory loss, was examined by a doctor last year and a bullet was found in her skull.
Gordon told police that she did not remember being shot, but did remember the fight with Kane, when her car window broke and she passed out. She thought she was broken glass and was parked in Kane's mother's house.
Men's fashion show at Paris Fashion Week T show was a surprise
As Miss Liu sang in her 2008 hit song "Roman's Death": "Go, go, fashion baby".
One editor said that a male model kept these words in mind, and his T-show blurred the other models, and he was the closing model for the 2020 Spring series of John Galia Nomagila during Paris Fashion Week on Wednesday.
The 20-year-old model, Leon Dam, conquered the audience with his unique T-Texas cat step, he stepped forward, stepped forward with his legs, and stepped forward with his hands, with his hands and feet, and with his eyes, he kept a strong conning courage.
He wears a belted shirt, white shorts and knee-length boots, and wears a schoolgirl hat, the style has caused a sensation online. In a video of a cat walk show, he appears to be smiling at Anna Wenthorn when she passes him by.
Many praised the young German model, who was a contestant for the Gil Sand, Fei and Korean hard-hitting men's clothing brands, and was known for her unique sense of fashion.
Actress and star Lisa Lena, who is married to Bobby Fulley, described Leon as her soulmate, while fashion designer and singer Rihanna focused on him on the photo wall application.
After the release of the video of the male model Leon's walk-in show, one fan wrote on Leon's page: "The video and off-site really stands out". Another fan also said: "The great Leon, while the make-up artist and giant Pat McGraw provided makeup for his performance, is also the make-up artist of the show, leaving him with the expression of lightning and flame.
Perhaps the highest praise comes from Tim Bronx, the special editor of the fashion website Fashion Business Review.
You were a young man with no name when you left, but you were a hot star when you came back! "Branks wrote in the title of the Photo Wall App on Wednesday, citing a classic line from the 42nd Street block of cinemas.
He added, "Oh @leondame, the cat's going to be amazing. @maisonmargiela I think what they say is true. No one is like Dam with a wind blowing!
Magnetic storms will occur in late September
According to the Space Weather Forecast Center of the National Institute of Atmospheric and Marine Research, magnetic disturbances are expected to occur on September 27-29. High-speed solar winds may cause moderate magnetic storms (G2).
The Russian Laboratory for Research on Solar Activities at the Levlevchev Institute predicts that the disturbance will begin on the evening of September 27 and reach its peak the next morning to noon. The planetary index can jump to the 5 Kp horizon.
Geomagnetic storms affect people with cardiovascular system problems. Doctors warn that some people may experience heartburn, blinking eyes, headaches and distraction. Magnetic disturbance usually affects people with mental disorders.
If there is a more serious disturbance, the power grid will also fluctuate. The satellite signal that provides navigation information will also be weak.
The spectacular polar light that appears in the sky above the two poles is the most beautiful sight of this phenomenon.
Sony is working with Disney again to launch the third installment of the Spider-Man film trilogy.
Disney and Sony are now freezing, and the Spider-Man is back in the ring.
The two companies announced Friday that they would be working together to shoot the third film in the Spider-Man franchise starring Tom Holland.
According to a press release released by both sides, the as-yet-untitled film will be released on July 16, 2021, and is produced by Disney-owned Marvel Pictures and its president, Kevin Figg.
According to the press release, Amy Pasca will also produce films through Pasca Films, as she did in the first two films directed by Hollande.
"The journey of Spider-Man will continue in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and I am very happy to continue working for it, and I am thrilled for the entire Marvel industry and myself. Spider-Man is a powerful idol and hero whose story spreads around the world and is loved by audiences of all ages.
The agreement also allows Spider-Man to appear in future films of Marvel.
Fig admitted that this collaboration made flying the wall unique among superheroes.
"The Spider-Man Monkey is the only superhero who has superpowers and can transcend the cinematic universe, so as Sony continues to develop its own Spider-Man universe, we never know what surprises the future will bring", he said.
It has been more than a month since the end of the Spider-Man trilogy, when the two companies reportedly could not reach an agreement on the sequel to the previous film Return of the Jedi and Return of the Jedi expedition.
The problem is that Disney, who has the role, wants to co-finance future films with Sony, which has agreed to acquire Marvel in 2009 before Disney acquired the home of Mickey Mouse.
Hollywood Reporter noted that both sides had good reason to cooperate. The Heroes Expedition is Sony's highest-grossing film ever, while Marvel can maximize its product promotion and maintain creative control.
Hollande himself was pleased with the end of the deadlock, and he expressed his joy on the Photo Wall app.
EU and UK negotiators in Belgium are working to reach an exit agreement
The EU's chief negotiator for Brexit talks began with British officials in Belgium on Friday to seek a Brexit deal; the deadline for reaching the agreement is now about a month away.
Michel Barnier met with Brexit Minister Stephen Buckley in Brussels, and Buckley insisted that any agreement should exclude Ireland's strict border protection measures. This strict border protection measure, which effectively ensures the soft border between Britain and Northern Ireland after Brexit, has become a major barrier to negotiations.
Barkley said that while Britain is committed to reaching an agreement, he said there is little time left.
"I think there is a long way to go, and I think it is a crucial moment for negotiations", said Buckley.
The deadline for Brexit is October 31, but a new law in the UK prohibits British Prime Minister Boris Johnson from leaving without a trade deal, nor does it allow the British Parliament to approve Brexit without a trade deal before October 19.
Last week, EU negotiators said they were willing to accept an alternative to border protection measures, but Irish representative Simon Coveney said on Friday that London had not yet submitted a serious proposal.
He said: "Unless there is a serious proposal as the basis for negotiations, the current huge differences will continue to exist".
The negotiator also said that there was little time left, and that the British Prime Minister and his team were responsible for making a serious proposal.
Johnson's office said Friday that reaching an agreement was still a difficult task.
From the Irish point of view, we certainly think that delaying Brexit is better than no deal, said Mr. Corwinney, but I think the reason behind the request for delaying Brexit is justified.
EU President Jean-Claude Juncker said he and Baneere are doing everything possible to reach an agreement, and if they fail to reach an agreement, they are wrong in the UK.
Irish Prime Minister Vallard said he was pessimistic about whether a Brexit deal could be reached, but he would urge British leaders to come up with a plan at the UK Brexit summit on October 17.
The Brexit deal is actually an international treaty, and Mr. Zhuvalladka said that it is not something that can be changed in the dark or that can be changed in the dark.
Scientists' confusion: giant planets orbiting tiny stars
Scientists discovered that a giant wooden planet in a galaxy 30 light-years away from Earth revolves around a tiny red dwarf, completely disrupting the existing theory of planet formation, and scientists were surprised.
A picture of the gaseous giant planet GJ 3512b orbiting the red dwarf star's host star was published on September 26, 2019.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planets orbiting them, but the stars observed are not very large compared to the size of the planets, the researchers said Thursday.
The star, named GJ 3512, has about 12 percent the mass of the Sun, while the planet around it is almost half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system.
Yes, it was surprising, said Juan Carlos Morales, an astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Sciences in Spain, whose team published the results in the journal Science and Technology.
The surprising reason for the discovery is that theoretical modeling suggests that low-mass stars typically have asteroids like Earth or small Neptune. But this time we found a Jupiter-like gas giant planet orbiting a very low-mass star, added Tom Morales.
Using the telescope of the Spanish astronomical observatory of Caracalla, researchers discovered the mainly gas-filled wooden planet, which orbits its main star in a circular orbit for 204 days.
The mass of the red dwarf stars is very small, and the surface temperature is relatively low. GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the Sun, but smaller than even larger planets, GJ 3512 is only 35% larger than Jupiter.
Red dwarfs release less energy, so the light emitted is very faint, and their surface temperature is low, about 3,800 degrees Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3,527 degrees Celsius). This also explains why red dwarfs are micro-red, said Tom Morales.
There is evidence that another planet is orbiting the red dwarf, and that another planet may have been discovered in the star system, which explains the elliptical orbit of the wooden planet, Morales said.
The planet and its surrounding stars were born from the same disc of interstellar gas and dust. According to the most widely accepted model of planet formation, the core accumulation model of the star was initially formed from solid particles in the disc, and gravitational attraction of planetary embryos could gather the surrounding gas to form an atmosphere.
Another model relative to it is called the gravitational instability model, which may explain this unusual galaxy.
In this case, the original planetary disc around the young star may have a larger mass than expected and a lower temperature, says Tom Morales. This will make the disc unstable, resulting in dense regions that form clusters. These clusters can continue to grow until they shrink and form planets.
School strikes in schools around the world take to the streets demanding climate action
On Friday, children around the world launched another wave of school strikes demanding action on climate change, their first major action since the issue became a top issue on the agenda of the United Nations world leaders this week.
More than a year ago, the "Friday" movement, launched by Swedish teenager Greta Samberg herself, emerged as a rain-and-spring boom, with millions of students taking to the streets of cities like New York City, attracting the attention of developing African countries.
Some of the initial protests began in New Zealand, according to Samberg, where organizers estimate 170,000 people marched across New Zealand. Cities in Italy, Finland, Nigeria, Austria and India also held marches.
Friday's protest followed a week-long climate negotiation held in New York at the United Nations, which included a speech by Samberg that sharply condemned the lack of action by world leaders.
"You stole my dreams and childhood with your empty words", she said Tuesday. "The eyes of the next generation are on you, and if your choice disappoints us, I can say that we will never forgive you".
Protesters cited a report last year by the United Nations calling on governments to take measures to prevent global warming above 2.7 degrees Celsius, warning scientists that this would have dire consequences for human life and the planet.
Sauber and the young people inspired by her said they would not stop the weekly classroom strike until they saw the greenhouse gas emissions that lead to climate change decrease.
In the Nigerian capital Abuja, Oradosu Adineek went on strike on Friday for 46 consecutive times. The activist posted pictures on Twitter of students wearing blue school uniforms and banners that read "Climate change is happening and it's not happening anymore".
Hundreds of climate strike organizers gathered in Lausanne, Switzerland, in August to prepare for this week's event, and thousands marched in the city, local reports said.
Thousands more are expected to take to the streets of Helsinki, Finland, local media reported that the Helsinki school will allow students to participate.
After his visit to the United Nations, Mr. Samberg remained in North America, planning to participate in the climate strike in Montreal, Canada.
Serena Williams was fined $10,000 for allegedly damaging the Wimbledon tennis court
Tennis legend Serena Williams, the seven-time Wimbledon champion, was fined $10,000 for allegedly damaging the London practice grounds with a ball.
According to the Associated Press and the cable news network in the US, the All England Club, which hosts Winnet, fined Williams for allegedly causing damage during an outdoor practice match on June 30.
The 37-year-old tennis star, interviewed by reporters after winning the quarter-final against Alison Reese on Tuesday, appeared to laugh at the fine.
When asked about the penalty, she said: "To tell you the truth, I didn't really want to ruin the pitch. I just threw the ball and then I got fined".
Williams said she didn't know how this would damage the stadium.
She told reporters: "Oh, I mean, if you could tell me how I caused damage, I would be grateful. I have always been a vengeful person. Maybe I am very strong. But I don't know.
Williams is competing for her eighth straight WWE title, and she will be hosting her 24th Grand Slam. In the singles semi-final on Thursday, she will face Czech player Babula Strikova.
Last year, a referee at the US Open accused Williams of communicating with his coach during the match, which Williams defended and was fined $17,000.
In the case, the referee sent three violations to Williams: the first was that she accepted the violation instructions, the second was that she interrupted the pitch because of emotional frustration, and the third was that she accused the other of cheating while confronting the referee.
Many Williams fans claimed that the referee's response was too harsh on her, especially considering the exciting times in the history of the sport for male players.
"Do you know how many men do worse than that?" said Ms Williams to U.S. Open officials who entered the stadium after she clashed with the referee during the match.
Williams is not the only one to be fined at this year's Opening Day, but her penalty amount is the highest.
Italian selector Bior Fanini said after losing to US player Tennis Sandgren in the third round on Saturday that the penalty should be a $3,000 fine for blowing up a tennis court.
Australian footballer Nick Kirgios was fined two times for violating sports ethics, one for $3,000 and the other for $5,000.
The Songhua People's Choir suspended last night's concert: Friday and Sunday performances were canceled
Rock legend Zhou Hohsun-Hun is touring the United States. In Houston, Texas, Roger Daltrey was forced to cancel the concert halfway through. The 75-year-old singer said to the disappointed audience: "Oh, I think it's best to say goodbye". The band has performed eight songs, but promised to come back one day. The audience reviewed the development of the band by watching videos and reviewing how it developed on the stage.
After playing the classic 1982 track "The Excellence", Daltrey announced his retirement. He had been having trouble speaking, apparently following strictly the advice of his surgeon.
The British star told the audience that he could not finish the show: "Oh, if I continue to perform for you, I will get hurt. I feel better to say goodbye... Last time I stayed in the hospital for a month, I don't want to go anymore. Sorry.
Pete Johnson explained the situation to the audience: "It looks like he can't continue performing, and I'm afraid ...
The band left the stage, and intended to work hard to complete the rest of the show without Roger.
When he returned, Thompson said: "Oh, I'm really, really sorry. Roger is now mute".
It's obvious that before the show, he saw a doctor, and you know, he sang well on tour. I don't know what happened. He was doing his best.
Oh, I'm really sorry you couldn't see the show tonight... We're missing something, it's Roger's show and it's in bad shape.
The audience fully supported him, cheering for his 74-year-old, and he explained everything that had happened, and how the band hoped to return to fulfill their commitment to the performance.
"Well, we'll announce our date of return as soon as possible". said Johnson. I'll explain... we're playing one day, resting one day. This is because Roger's surgeon insists he needs to rest one day...
I swear to you, we will come back and we will not let you lose your tickets. I love you and I am sorry to disappoint you.
After the show, the upcoming Friday and Sunday evening concerts in Dallas and Denver were cancelled.
Their next gig will be in San Francisco on October 9. The band will begin their UK tour in Manchester on March 16, 2020.
Michael Schumacher's agent issued a statement about his physical condition
An official statement about Michael Schumacher's health has been released. According to Gong.bg, the legendary figure has been recovering for almost six years after being injured in a skiing accident in the Alps in 2013.
A few weeks ago, global media reported that the former pilot had been hospitalized in a Paris hospital. Shabine Kom, Schumacher's long-time agent and longtime friend of the Schumacher family, issued a statement.
"Michael's health is not a public issue, so we will not comment on it, just because we need to protect Michael's privacy as much as possible. We know that this is difficult for some people to understand, but we do it in full accordance with Michael's wishes, and we appreciate your understanding".
She also revealed that Schumach was a very sensitive person. He did not want his name to be in the headlines, and even avoided public exposure before the incident happened.
The agents urged people not to believe any photos of leaks on social networks and yellow magazines around the world.
Authorities are investigating a fatal car accident in the Los Angeles National Forest and have found bodies
Police are investigating a fatal car accident in the Los Angeles National Forest on Thursday afternoon.
According to police, a car with bodies was found underneath the Los Angeles Forest Highway and the Grand Toungga Canyon Road.
Initial reports on the spot said the car may have been there for some time.
It is not clear how the vehicle was found.
Is a world without nuclear weapons far from reachable?
Seventy-four years ago, two nuclear bombs exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing hundreds of thousands.
After that, the threat of nuclear war will follow as long as there is conflict between the great powers.
Although various treaties try to contain this threat, there are now about 14,000 nuclear weapons in the world.
Thursday is the International Day for the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, but the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons seems increasingly difficult to achieve.
So, do countries have the political will to abolish nuclear weapons?
Meghan was willing to move and insist on giving up her pursuit while fulfilling her royal duties.
Meghan Markle decided to move forward and persist in her pursuit of her royal duties while she was still in the royal family, and as a member of the royal family, she wanted to be a role model for young boys and girls.
The 38-year-old Duchess of Sussex reportedly made the above remarks earlier this week during a visit to South Africa with her husband Prince Harry at an event to inspire women entrepreneurs on the Cape Town Woodstock Exchange.
Woodstock Exchange is a UK-based technology hub that promotes skills development and market access by helping entrepreneurs, especially women, gain skills, resources and support.
At the Women Entrepreneurs Association meeting, the 38-year-old former actress met with several female entrepreneurs in tech, environmental protection and fashion industries and praised their efforts to inspire the next generation of creative thinkers.
In a conversation with the founders of Women in Science and Technology, Megan strongly advocated empowering young women and girls, expressing her hope that young men will also be empowered.
Nadia Moussaji, a South African engineer, social entrepreneur, co-founder of engineering women, mother of two, revealed: "We recognize the importance of not only educating girls but also being an example for boys, we are influential women and should be an example for boys to admire, according to the People's Daily.
"We both have sons, and we must remember that we are not only the example of girls, but also the example of boys, not only our sons, but also the masses".
She added that we didn't feel any level of ideology because of Meghan's presence, because it was a gathering of women who talked about the difficulties we face and the mission we need to complete to move forward, grow and change our society.
Modis Modise, founder of Skills Training Company Simodisa, said that although Meghan is a member of the royal family, she is determined to keep moving and not give up her pursuit of her innermost self.
She spoke of her responsibility as a mother and Duchess and her desire to achieve her innermost desire, not to give up pursuits because she is Duchess, Modice recalled.
"You have to be true to yourself".
She said the Duchess urged them to continue to deepen their new ideas and said how they would continue to push and move forward, making it clear that they were doing this to set an example for others.
Modi added that she was not referring to being a member of the royal family, but to doing so when faced with challenges in everyday life, and admitted that she felt a little awe of Meghan.
She is spreading a graceful spirit and is accepting the task with such graceful gesture, said Mumidis.
As the founder, many of us have created amazing achievements, but meeting a member of the royal family is a bit daunting. She is very accommodating. She is a member of the royal family who is accommodating.
Megan also revealed that she enjoys the pressure of being a professional mother, admitting that she feels that being a member of the royal family and caring for her children is a burdensome but very exciting thing.
Megan told Laura Rosmarine, CEO of Cape Innovation Technology, the mother of two children: "I'm only five months old now. As a professional mother, traveling with a child is a mess, but it's all so exciting.
Sometimes you deal with something hard, but when you meet people and you can positively influence them, you say, "Oh, oh, it's worth it".
Megan then went to the city's "Heaven and Earth" institution, which trains and hires women with HIV.
She brought some of Archie's baby clothes, including one with the future-fashioned "Future" embroidered in her and the unconquered "Future" embroidered in her and the items she had donated from her mother's friends.
A couple were sentenced to six years in prison for putting a five-month-old baby in a handbag and throwing it in a garbage can.
The body of a five-and-a-half-month-old baby was thrown into a garbage bin, and on Thursday, her parents were sentenced to six years in prison without any defense for the alleged infant death.
The Los Angeles County District Attorney announced that Adam Manson, 34, and Keanna Williams, 32, did not plead guilty to one count of child abuse and death, and denied a special charge that they caused the death of their son Jackson Manson.
Manson and the Williams couple initially pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The prosecutor said the two found their son dead on New Year's Eve while they were drugging in a car hotel in South Los Angeles. The prosecutor added that they placed the child's body in a trunk and dumped it in a garbage bin near Cranstown Square in Purdue.
In late April, authorities cancelled the search after weeks of searching the Coronado El Sobrante landfill. The child's body has not been found.
Police said in a statement at the time that they were deeply moved to end the search for Jackson, but noted that they could not locate the dump site accurately and there was no reasonable reason to continue the search.
The supply of medicines in the UK under no deal is still unclear
The UK government regulators said that if there is no deal, the government would still need to do a lot of work to ensure that the country has an adequate supply of medicines.
In a report released on Friday, the National Audit Office said that the government's additional leased capacity for trans-English Channel freight could be in place by the end of November (one month after the exit deadline of 31 October). There are about 12,300 medicines registered in the UK, of which 7,000 come from the EU or transport through the EU, most of them have to be transported across the Channel.
According to the UK government's predictions, the worst case scenario is that drug shipments could be halved on the first day of a no-deal Brexit and could take a year to recover. It is said that the time is extremely urgent if transportation issues are to be resolved by the end of October.
The report also noted that the information on the amount of potassium in drug reserves is not complete, but the reserves are increasing daily. As of September 20, suppliers reported that 72% of drugs have six weeks of reserves.
Without an exit agreement, the UK health sector will work under highly uncertain circumstances, and the difficulty of fully implementing the planned programme is enormous, the government regulator wrote.
Meg Cyril, chair of the Committee of the Audit Supervisor, expressed deep concern about the content of the report. She said she had seen the UK government miss the deadline countless times, but this was particularly worrying.
"If the government messes up this, it could have serious consequences", she said.
Dr Richard Tobet, from the British Pharmaceutical Industry Association, said that while businesses are preparing for Brexit, there are some things that are not under the control of companies.
He said that if Britain really wants to leave without a deal, businesses need to know more about the relevant situation and how to use the additional freight capacity the government has prepared.
He believes that the best way to protect patients is to ensure that an exit agreement is reached.
Cleveland police are labeled as "failed" by inspectors in every aspect.
The Cleveland police, who were embroiled in the scandal, have become the first police force to be labelled with a "failed" label by inspectors in every aspect.
The Queen's Majesty's Police and Fire and Rescue Services Oversight Bureau assessed its overall work and three key areas, and reviewed its capacity to reduce crime, ensure people's safety, operate efficiently and treat the public and staff.
The results of the investigation showed that special measures should be implemented against the force, and the police chief, police and crime commissioner were consulted by the National Committee and asked them to ensure that the plans for major improvements were implemented.
If there is no improvement, the Minister of Home Affairs can intervene to solve this problem.
A series of scandals have plagued the squad, including Hartlepool, Redcar and Cleveland, Stockton and Middlesbrough in the north east of England.
Over the years, six police chiefs have been replaced.
In 2012, former Sheriff Sean Price was fired for gross misconduct; seven police officers are being investigated after a journalist's phone was illegally wiretapped, and there have been longstanding complaints of racial discrimination among the squad.
Recently, the Inspector General of Police said that the way police work is unimaginably inefficient and police must share laptops and cameras.
British police inspector Phil Gomley said it was a failed force, and the situation has been getting worse and worse for the past two years.
Tissue Valley Mayor Ben Huang said that the report said that the police force was the worst in the country's history, and that the official confirmation was that the police force was seriously involved, and that the Ministry of Interior now needs to intervene.
He added: "There is no doubt about it. This is the fact that the white paper black letter is described in this report.
"These results are one of the most painful and shocking things I have ever read".
Cleveland was one of 15 units recently inspected by HMICFRS inspectors and the only one not qualified in all areas.
Gomley added: "The troops have not given proper priority to crime prevention. Lack of strategic direction and insufficient resources allocated to defense work. Failure to provide adequate protection to vulnerable groups such as children. Lost the opportunity to protect them and put them at risk".
He said that the senior leaders did not always show the same level of moral behavior, and the misconduct of the senior leaders of Franklin was very serious, affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the troops.
He added: "The unit has not consistently been fair and respectful of the staff, and has not communicated effectively with the staff or understood the staff; the process is considered unfair and the understanding of the staff is insufficient to support the staff".
Despite the seriousness of the investigation, the force has received some praise for its handling of serious and organized crime, but it must improve the way it investigates crimes.
Police and Crime Commissioner Barry Koping said: "I am very concerned about the disturbing part of this report.
The recent performance of the force is too bad.
He said he had been assured by current Sheriff Richard Lewis that he would take immediate and swift action once he realized these mistakes.
The UK Home Office has ordered Cobing to respond to the report within 56 days.
Lewis said the report was like setting a boundary line for the force, adding: "Improvements have been made, and I am fully responsible for pushing these obvious needs. In the five months I have been in office, I have met with outstanding police and staff at all levels, seeing the efforts and determination of the police on the front line, committed to protecting life safety and protecting vulnerable people".
If there is no substantial improvement fast enough, the government may intervene, such as a prison that collapses.
But so far, politicians have never asked the police force to implement this measure, inspectors said.
Keith Malthaus, Minister of Crime, Security and Fire, said he encouraged Sheriff Liu to act quickly to correct these errors and will closely monitor the position, adding that transparency and accountability are key to building public confidence in the police.
The Manelli Christian School: Several sixth-grade boys in Virginia are accused of trapping black girls forcing their haircut
A black middle school student in Virginia accused three white boys of trapping her and cutting off her neck. The incident occurred at the Manelli Christian School, where Vice President Mike Jones' wife, Karen Jones, taught.
A 12-year-old student at the private Christian school, Amarie Allen, said the boys caught her on the playground while she was resting in class, saying her neck was ugly and curled, and then cut her neck.
Looking down at her face, Amelie told WUSA-TV, owned by Columbia Broadcasting Corporation, that they were constantly laughing at me and insulting me. They said I was ugly, and I shouldn't have been born. They said I wanted to draw attention from others.
According to WUSA reports, one boy allegedly held Amari's mouth, another boy held her hands behind her, and another boy cut her neck with a scissor.
Amari did not tell her family about this until her grandmother found her hair was shortened.
"I just sat there after they laughed and ran away", said Mary.
The incident happened on Monday, but the mother-of-one said she didn't tell her family until Wednesday because her grandmother noticed her hair changed. She said she feared retaliation for telling the truth.
Amari's grandmother Cynthia Allen said, "It's so heartbreaking. I hope the school can get rid of these students. I hope the school takes action".
Amari's family costs her nearly $12,000 a year to attend the school, and the school became famous after Karen Jones taught art at the famous anti-gay school earlier this year.
In a statement, the Manelli Christian School said that we place great importance on the mental and physical health of students and that we have zero tolerance for any form of bullying or violence. We are deeply concerned about these allegations and are currently communicating with the families of the victims, gathering information and providing support to the best of our ability. We also contacted law enforcement to request a thorough investigation, and for more information please consult the Falfex County Police Department.
Although the school has zero tolerance for bullying, Amarie said the boys had tortured her before. She said that before the boys took her lunch and cursed her.
Amari's family met with school officials on Thursday and the investigation is ongoing.
Iran releases the British tanker Stana Amprio
Iran released a tanker with the British flag last Friday, which was seized two months earlier by Iran for allegedly entering Iranian waters in violation of international law.
According to the state news agency, the Iranian Port and Maritime Administration confirmed that the tanker named Stana Amprio left the port of Abbas at 9 am.
Eric Hanel, president and CEO of Swedish Oil Transport Company (the ship's operator), also confirmed that the ship had been released.
Eric Hanel tweeted: "The Swedish Oil Company and the UK Northern Ocean Authority confirmed that Stannar Amprio and his crew have been released.
On July 19, the vessel was seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard after allegedly violating international maritime law entering Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz.
However, the seizure of the vessel was widely seen as retaliation by Iran against British forces after British forces seized a tanker in Gibraltar that allegedly transported Persian oil to Syria in violation of international sanctions. Despite the efforts of the Trump administration to extend the detention period, the vessel was released in mid-August.
According to The New York Times, Steiner Amprio was officially authorized to leave on Monday, but remained at the port until the investigation into the ship's conduct was completed.
The tanker has left the port of Abbas and is heading to Dubai to have its crew board for medical examination and reporting. Khan Khanel said the family of the crew had been informed and the company was currently arranging to return its important crew as soon as possible.
The tanker was the victim of escalating tensions near the Persian Gulf, the United States and Iran shot down each other's drones near the Persian Gulf, and at least two tankers were blown up, and the Trump administration blames Iran for this.
The Trump administration recently accused Iran of attacking oil facilities in Saudi Arabia with drones, and Tehran denies any connection to the incident.
Prime Minister Modi paid tribute to Jak Sharak on Twitter, calling him a true global politician, a friend of India.
Prime Minister Modi expressed his condolences over the passing of former French President Jacques Chirac, saying India mourns the passing of a true global politician and friend.
Jacques Chirac, who expressed his support for India's nuclear tests in 1998, died Thursday at the age of 86. He served as president of France from 1995 to 2007.
I deeply condolish the passing of Jak Sharak, India's mourning for the passing of a true global politician. Indian Prime Minister Modi said on Twitter that as a friend of India, he played a decisive role in establishing and building the Indo-French strategic partnership.
India and France established a strategic partnership during Jacques Chirac's first visit to India in January 1998. In 2006, he visited the country again as president.
Akshara is said to have been in poor health for a long time.
Uganda: Government launches oral self-test test box for HIV
The Ugandan Ministry of Health has launched an oral HIV self-test test box to ensure that citizens - especially male citizens - can get tested for HIV.
The goal of the program is to reduce the number of new HIV infections in 2020.
OraQuick oral HIV self-test test kit, produced by Orasure Technology, is designed specifically for vulnerable groups such as young people aged 18 to 24, adult males and sex workers.
Young people aged 18 to 24 are our current target group. Young people of this age group are our target group, and of course anyone over 18 should be included in the consideration category. We currently do not have evidence of infection of minors as stipulated in the Constitution, but as more evidence surfaces, we will move towards this goal. For men, we will hand over the test box to their mothers and then to their sexual partners, mainly sex workers, and the head of the HIV testing service technology for vulnerable people such as HIV testing service said yesterday.
Convenience to use
The self-test box previously provided required testing for HIV through blood, but the oral self-test box can only be tested through oral fluid.
The test box is made possible by testing for antibodies - natural guards who resist infection. If the human body is infected with HIV, the antibodies to the virus will be present in the blood and saliva. The test box is tested for antibodies in the mouth.
According to data from the Uganda AIDS Commission, Uganda has 1,000 new cases of HIV infection and 500 new cases of AIDS deaths every week, which means 53,000 new cases of HIV infection and 23,000 new deaths every year.
Dr. Diana Atwan, the Permanent Secretary of Uganda's Ministry of Health, said that the product will be launched in a timely manner and will help people fight AIDS better.
However, she urged men to take HIV testing seriously.
She added that 14% of those infected still do not know they have HIV, and more work needs to be done to take care of this segment of the population.
So the question now is how we should use this innovative technology. For me, it is actually like this... How are we now creating demand beyond the testing boxes, especially for those 14% patients who are not getting the care they deserve?" said Dr. Zhu Atwan.
However, health officials warned that strict food prohibition would be imposed for 15 minutes before testing.
Mr. Tashi said that the relevant studies indicate that there were no suicides and the Ministry of Health is confident in avoiding this possible tragedy because testing is voluntary.
Dr. Atvan said that in addition to educating users through images and videos, government and private institutions (including all pharmacies) should also provide 24-hour free telephone consultation services.
Research shows that HIV infected and non-infected people tested using OraQuick HIV self-testing test cases have more than 99% accuracy of the test results.
Qatar World Championships athletes feel the heat
At the opening World Championships in Athletics on Friday, many participants have met their most challenging opponent: the hot weather in Qatar.
The humidity in Doha is suffocating, with temperatures of around 38 degrees Celsius during the day, and athletes and athletics officials are discussing the weather in Doha, which is why they are worried about some events.
Marathons and running events are held at midnight, thus minimizing the negative effects of high temperatures.
Although the high temperatures affect players competing inside the Halifax International Stadium, which has indoor air conditioning and maintains temperatures around 21 degrees Celsius, the players still need to adjust training arrangements because the training ground is outside.
"We're from a tropical country, too, but it doesn't matter", Bahamian coach Ronald Cartwright told Reuters.
"Hey, here, you walk outside like someone's giving you heat. I guess that's why we're doing the midnight race".
Athletics officials pledged to provide more medical and safety measures for marathons and runners.
International Athletics Sports Management Organization - International Athletics Federation said the women's marathon, which was scheduled to start on Friday midnight, will be held as planned, as temperatures are expected to be below 30 degrees or around 30 degrees.
The agency said its medical representatives had assured athletes that they would monitor the weather throughout the day and report to the teams, ensuring that the event was run at an acceptable level of health risk.
Athletes who participated in indoor events said that the high temperatures should not have a huge impact on their performance, but they also admit that training is especially exhausting.
I was lit up during the training because the humidity was too high, and I was sweating and sweating", said Rai Benjamin, 400-meter sprinter.
I feel like I just finished my bath. But I think it shouldn't be so bad because there is air conditioning in the room.
Ryan Krauss, the 2016 Olympic champion, said he had to heat the ball to about 38 degrees Celsius every time to keep it moist while training in high temperature and humid environments.
The normal temperature of the ball is much lower than the opening point, and once you take it out, it gets wet and dripping, said the American athlete. "This is worse than the rain down the basin... we have been overcoming this situation too".
European pole vault champion Amanda Duplantis, who regularly trains in hot weather in southern Louisiana, said that wet weather proved helpful for training because the grip was made stronger after applying the lubricant powder to the hands.
But for other athletes who regularly use sticky spray to increase grip, jumping high lever makes it harder to grip lever in this humid environment, he said.
"I understand that people who use sticky sprays often have problems because the senses of the hands become slippery and sticky", Duplantis added.
Locksmith arrested and major prison security vulnerabilities are worrying
Recently, a British jail locksmith was arrested for fear that the keys to the jail cell were being copied, and taxpayers were paid £500,000 to replace all the locks in the cell.
The Queen's Majesty's Wandsworth Prison reported to police because they feared that some of the 1400 prisoners in the prison were being sold copies of the key.
This suspected security flaw will lead to the replacement of the 3000 and the lock, which may be the door lock inside and outside the cell.
Police arrested a man in his forties on September 13 in the prison on suspicion of conspiracy to unfairly serve public office. The man was from south-west London and worked for Government Facilities Services Limited, which provided maintenance services to 52 prisons in the south of England.
The police investigation has raised concerns that some key prints may have remained in the clay before the real key replica was made.
However, the head of the prison stressed that they found no evidence that any prisoners obtained the keys.
Wandsworth Prison is a Class B prison in south-west London, with a maximum capacity of 1,628 inmates, and is one of the largest prisons in Western Europe. It was built in 1851 to house convicted male offenders and male offenders awaiting trial.
A spokesman for the prison administration said that the Queen's Majesty's Wandsworth prison had raised the security level of the gate, and that a special identity check was currently underway due to a security incident. During the investigation, the police were unable to comment further.
The Speaker of the House warned Trump to stop attacking whistleblowers
They said President Xi's remarks today constituted intimidation of witnesses and should be strongly condemned, which hampered the Congressional impeachment investigation. We condemn the president's attack and call on our Republican colleagues to condemn it as Congress must do everything possible to protect this whistleblower and all whistleblowers.
The statement said that Trump is now fully aware that our committee is seeking testimony from the whistleblower and others cited in the whistleblower indictment announced today in the House impeachment inquiry, and that our country's law prohibits any act of deterrence, intimidation of witnesses or otherwise pressure witnesses to testify before Congress.
They added that any officials who knew about the committee's investigation, including those who knew about the whistleblower's allegations, would not be intimidated, retaliated or threatened with retaliation, and all witnesses must be able to testify in Congress.
The statement was issued on Thursday, coinciding with the week that whistleblowers accused Trump of causing a wave of outrage in Washington, alleging Trump had abused official power in the upcoming 2020 election to seek the intervention of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, while the White House took steps to cover it up. White House text recordings of a July phone conversation released Wednesday show that Trump repeatedly urged the investigation of Zelensky by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
There is no evidence that Joe or Hunter Biden were wrong.
Just before whistleblowers submitted the whistleblower complaint to lawmakers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday that Trump had betrayed his oath of office and announced the official launch of the impeachment investigation into the president.
Michelle Obama praised Meghan Markle for her encouraging voice in the photo wall app
Michelle Obama on Thursday kindly tweeted on the Photo Wall app, praising Meghan Markle, saying that the Duchess of Sussex is a thoughtful leader who is breaking the codes to make the world a better place.
The Duchess and Prince Harry are currently on a 10-day royal tour of South Africa with their son, Archie Harrison Montbaton-Winza, who attended a youth reception earlier this week and met with the Obama Foundation leaders.
The former First Lady of the United States wrote in a tweet: "Thank you very much to my friend, Her Royal Highness, Duchess of Sussex, you are a thoughtful leader who is breaking the codes and making the world a better place".
Michelle Obama added: "Whether she met with the leaders of our Obama Foundation @ObamaFoundation or helped girls around the world seek education, she inspired many people.
Megan, who played the golden-clad lawyer Liu, is a freelance editor for Liu's British fashion magazine, and she interviewed Michelle Obama for the magazine's September issue. The two ladies enjoyed the conversation, and the former first lady reviewed her experiences as a mother and the changes that brought about her.
Michelle Obama said in an interview: "Motherhood has always been a master class for learning to let go.
As a mother, I understand that most of the time my responsibility is to give my children space to explore and develop, to make them who they want to be. Not what I want them to be or what I want them to be at the age, but what they are deep inside.
Michelle Obama, well aware of the pressures of being under the spotlight around the world, gave the Duchess some advice in an interview with the magazine "Good Governor".
"The pressure that you feel from yourself and others can sometimes be very great", she said. "So my biggest advice is to let go and not rush into anything".
She continued:
My first few months at the White House were concerned about my daughters, making sure they had a good start at school, and after meeting new friends, I devoted my whole life to more ambitious work. I think it's okay, and even good.
Hero moment: Police rushed to busy speeds to rescue a stray puppy
It was a heroic moment when a policeman rushed to the busy highway to rescue the next injured puppy.
Video taken by Joseph Puglia's travel recorder shows that Joseph Puglia saw the puppy jump off the police car within seconds of being hit by another car.
The policeman who worked at Pineapple Park, Florida, wrapped the injured puppy in a first aid kit, put it in his own van, and quickly sent it to the nearest animal hospital.
Puglia told ABC News: "I was really feeling better until I saw the puppy start breathing".
Thank God, the puppy survived the ordeal, only suffering from a slight rub.
"Oh, we gave him a nickname, Lucky Dog, and I think that name will never be appropriate again".
The puppy was sent to a local animal shelter, where his rescuer was hailed as a hero.
But Puglia insists that he is just doing his job.
The officer added that if the Animal Service Center could not find the owner of the puppy, his family would be happy to give the lucky dog a home.
For the first time since WeWork went bankrupt, the open market for shares has hit a brake on a company that is not profitable.
Reuters reported that the company's response to its initial public offering in the US was flat, especially when it was losing, which cast a shadow over its first public offering calendar for the rest of the year.
Surprisingly, the sudden delay in WeWork's first public offering of shares highlights how the market is eroding confidence in companies and investors seeking funding.
The market for first-time publicly-traded shares continued to punish Peloton Interactive Inc (PTON.O) on Friday, the second day it began trading, as the fitness company's share price fell to $24.74, down 4% from its current share price on Wednesday's first-time publicly-traded share price.
In the past, open market investors typically expected companies to be profitable about 18 months after their initial public offering. This time frame has been relaxed as capital managers are eager to add revenue-growing businesses to their portfolio.
However, recent transactions seem to indicate that the uncertainty of the economic outlook is causing investors to be more provocative about the loss-making businesses they are willing to support.
Peloton reported that the company's revenue grew rapidly, reaching 110% growth rate in the fiscal year ending June 30. But the company's operating leverage also showed negative value, with operating expenses up 147% from the previous year.
SmileDirectClub (SDC.O), a loss-making dental firm, became the first dental firm to be listed in the U.S. earlier this month. Data from the research firm's capital recovery shows that for the first time in three years, the issuance price of publicly traded shares will exceed the target range and close on the first trading day.
The average return on initial public offering in 2019 is currently about 9%, down from 30% at the end of June and 18% about two weeks ago.
In the United States, much of the third quarter focused on an unsuccessful transaction, the first public offering of WeWork's parent company's We Company program.
The company had originally planned to hold its initial public offering in early September, but postponed its IPO plan to later in 2019, and subsequently replaced the CEO and said it was reviewing the IPO timeline.
Endeavor Group Holdings (EDR.N), an entertainment and talent brokerage firm backed by Hollywood heavyweight broker Ali Immanuel, decided to abandon its first public offering at the last minute due to the market situation, which had previously had a losing record. In early 2019, Uber Technologies (UBER.N) and Lyft Inc. (LYFT.O) had not yet clear profit timetables, and learning from the two companies, investors had begun delaying investments in companies with a history of serious losses. This was a conversation between bankers, directors and senior management teams, who would say that these were isolated, incomparable losses, or that our mood swings occurred, so we needed to conserve and use a different strategy, and the company's main security company, Huawei, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China
Jonathan Van Nesgang and Nancy Pelosi are promoting a project
The star of the show, Jonathan Van Ness, appeared on the floor of the US Congress on Thursday, discussing the bill of equality with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Democrat from California).
The Equal Rights Amendment will provide non-discriminatory protection for individuals of gender minority groups in matters such as credit, education, employment, housing, federal financial assistance, jury services and public facilities.
The bill would amend the Civil Rights Amendment Act of 1964 to include sexual orientation and gender identity in the list of protected categories.
Van Ness recently publicly admitted to being HIV positive, first sharing a video of himself in Congress with a cat, explaining in the text that he had met with the Speaker of the House to discuss the bill of rights, living together with HIV carriers and getting PrEP, a HIV-prevention drug:
He then shared a longer post depicting the scene of two people holding hands, urging his followers to brave the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (a Republican from Kentucky) and press the Republican Senators to submit the bill to the Senate vote:
Pelosi introduced the Equal Rights Amendment on March 13. The House passed legislation in May. The bill has not yet been submitted to the Senate.
In August, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to fundamentally determine the legalization of anti-gay discrimination in the workplace, and argued in court friendship that federal laws that discriminate against employers in the context of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were not intended to protect individuals from being dismissed for sexual orientation.
Earlier this year, Pelosi held a meeting with Van Ness and three other co-stars of the Pumpkin Rescue Team, as well as Representative Alexander Ocasio Cortez (Democrat from New York), discussing the policy and pushing the bill.
On Thursday, Pelosi shared a photo of her and Van Ness shaking hands warmly on the balcony, thanking him for voicing his support for the struggle:
David Aidenburg is making a brand new documentary about animals and colour
David Aidenburg is 93 years old, but this iconic natural master is still young.
He launched the groundbreaking Nike documentary "Our Planet's Milk", which was a huge success and the popular star will return with another series: "The Color of Life".
This time, the father of two will study how animals use color in their lives with a high-tech camera built specifically for the show.
The British Broadcasting Corporation revealed that the star's aim was to show off the invisible color world, which sounds very attractive indeed.
While fans are looking forward to releasing the series soon, it seems that we all need to wait patiently because it will not be available on our screens until 2021.
But we are convinced that it is worth the wait.
Earlier this month, David was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the TV Choice Magazine in London at a prestigious ceremony.
So far, the 60-year-old national treasure has brought cheer and laughter to millions.
When collecting his medals, the reporter said enthusiastically: "Yes, it is true. What I do is not always so interesting, sometimes people hear things they don't like!"
But it is an honor and a great joy.
The winner was mentioned in the TV Choice Magazine: "Sir David Aidenburg is still working, studying and doing shows, and he is not only a British hero but also a global icon".
This week, David was again praised for having a polar exploration ship named after him.
The star, along with Prince William and Queen Kate, attended the naming ceremony at Berkshire's Berkshire Camel Ride.
He said: "The world is facing all sorts of tricky problems, which is not news for any of you, and the young people of today are the ones who will inherit the world.
The tricky issues require a lot of research and factual solutions.
This is what this amazing expedition ship will do, find out the facts, seek scientific methods to deal with the problems facing the world today, and in the future more and more people will do so.
The Color of Life is expected to air on BBC Two in 2021, while retaining global copyright, according to NAIFI.
The husband of the murdered MP Joe Cox said not to use my wife's name to get political scores
Jeremy Corbyn criticized Boris Johnson last night by posting a video of the murdered MP, after Joe Cox's husband said his wife's name could not be used to get political scores.
The video of the Labour leader cuts clips from Mrs Cox's post-mortem prayer service and is captioned: Boris Johnson does not care about our street violence.
Critics said Corbyn was using the murder of Joe Cox to get cheap political scores, while Joe Cox's husband Brendan Cox said that Labour leaders were mistaken in describing hate speech as a simple political party issue.
Mr Cox said: "Jeremy is right, the best way to respect Joe is to defeat hatred and division. He believes that MPs have a special responsibility and it is right".
But Jeremy is wrong to summarize hate speech as a simple political issue for a political party. Although Joe is an ardent Labour Party member, there are things that must go beyond party politics.
Cox also shared a post saying that Joe Cox's name was not just a political scoreboard and that he was accompanied by a caption. Thank you. The video of Mr. Corbin talking about Mrs. Cox was launched three years ago in the West Yorkshire constituency by a far-right radical and people reacted strongly to Corbin.
Speaking about clips about Mrs Cox, Johnson and the female MP, Corbyn said: "The Prime Minister knows these words will promote violence and have serious consequences. The Prime Minister wants to divide. It is clear that he does not care about our street violence".
He continued to criticize Johnson and called for the establishment of a Labour government
Corbyn added: "Many people are deeply concerned about Boris Johnson's comments, which are being interpreted by far-right activists. When women MPs who threatened to kill him asked him this question, Johnson ignored them. It was shameful".
Meanwhile, Conservative MP and Minister of Commerce Nadine Zahavi said: "It is a big mistake to use Joe Cox like this, because her family has clearly asked her not to do so. Please stay away from politics".
If you had a little respect, Jeremy Corbyn, you would have withdrawn the video. Before that, the British Parliament had launched a debate on some remarks this week, Johnson said in the debate that the best way to pay tribute to Mrs Cox was to complete the Brexit. Joe's sister, Kim Lidbit, called for a reduction in extreme remarks, saying that this was unfavorable to Joe's children.
Jo's sister told the Independent TV: "I talk openly about some of the odd things about Boris Johnson - I just think that this way is not going to help the situation. I can say what I think is right and what is wrong, but I will try to try to do it in a cautious way".
Labour MP Yvette Cooper's daughter publicly said yesterday that she has always been concerned about her mother's safety given the way people talk about politicians.
The House accuses Trump of the border wall issue, but he plans to use a one-vote veto
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives attempted to overthrow President Donald Trump again by using emergency power to attack military bases such as schools and casinos to pay for the construction of the border wall he promised for a long time.
The bill was submitted to Trump with 236 votes in favor and 174 against, but he will certainly veto it, just as he did a similar measure in March.
The Senate passed the bill last week, but more than a dozen senior Republican lawmakers condemned Trump.
Friday's vote was different because the government recently released a list of 127 military construction projects totaling $3.6 billion that will be cancelled to pay for the construction of the border wall, including many in Republican constituencies and states.
Brazil says its offshore oil spill in the northeast is not the fault of Brazil
On Thursday, Brazil's environmental protection agency - Brazil's Environment and Renewable Natural Resources Bureau said that analysis of large oil leaks on the beaches in the northeast showed that the leaked crude oil was not domestic production.
The agency said in a statement that they had been investigating oil leaks on several beaches in the northeastern states since September 2. Local media published several photos of the beaches covered with black ash produced by the oil leak.
Oil spills spread along the coastline of northeastern Brazil, covering a total length of more than 1,500 kilometres (932 miles), affecting local wildlife and contaminating many of the country's scenic beaches, including Fortuno Beach in Sierra, and Marago Junction Beach in Aragon.
Brazilian state-owned oil holding company - Brazilian State Oil Company said in a statement that molecular analysis of crude oil showed that the leaked crude oil was not produced or sold by the company.
Crude oil is usually checked before export to ensure that it meets the standards of refineries that receive the crude oil. Crude oil produced in different oilfields can be identified based on a range of chemical components, including sulfur content, hydrogen content, acidity and viscosity.
Brazilian oil regulator - Brazilian National Petroleum Administration Director Sergio Odonei noted that the agency believed that a tanker far from the Brazilian coast may have leaked oil, but added that this possibility has not been confirmed. A statement from the administration said that no reports of leakage from any oil drilling platform in the country were received.
Some beaches were contaminated with oil and were sent to rehabilitation centers after being rescued in northern Rio Grande. The bodies of some other animals were also found, the Brazilian Environment and Renewable Natural Resources Agency said, but did not disclose the specific species or death toll.
Brazilian state oil company said in a statement that while the company was not involved in the oil spill, it was also involved in the cleanup work, and about 100 employees were helping clean the beach.
Skoda provides voice digital assistant for drivers
Skoda will launch a digital assistant that can be started with voice commands. In an announcement on Wednesday, the Czech automaker said that drivers can use the phrase "good" to start the digital assistant.
The system supports six languages and can perform a range of tasks, including navigating to destinations and searching for music. The system will initially be configured in Kamiq city SUV and compact sedan Scala. According to the annual report of Skoda, since its acquisition by the Volkswagen Group in 1991, the Skoda brand has delivered 125 million vehicles worldwide in 2018.
The company's virtual voice assistant also reflects the efforts of other manufacturers in the automotive industry. For example, some BMW cars are now equipped with smart personal assistant valves, which can be started using buttons, call or hello, and the BMW valve phrases. The driver can use voice commands to start the seat heating function, get information about tyre pressure and adjust the temperature inside the car.
On Thursday, Jack Palmer, senior connected automotive expert at SBD Automotive, sent an email to CNBC, saying in a statement that "voice is the ideal vehicle for communication".
"If most of the commands from the driver could be received through virtual assistants without the touchscreen and buttons being put on, the current prevalent driver distraction problem would be greatly reduced", Palmer added. "The car manufacturers have realized this and are competing to integrate their solutions with consumer electronics companies like Google and Amazon or collaborate with them".
The actions of companies such as Skoda and BMW suggest that the way people interact with cars may change. Car analyst Hannah Casey, of Market Intelligence firm Imminent, told CNBC via email that a recent report by the company highlighted why nearly 40% of American consumers who own cars want to use personal digital assistants in their cars. She added that this creates more opportunities for the future development of automotive digital assistants.
Ghana: Watching the World Day of Rabies
Akra held an event on Wednesday to mark the 13th World Day of Rabies, actively calling on pet owners to vaccinate their pets to protect the safety of citizens.
The theme of the event is Vaccination: Eliminating Rabies, organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in cooperation with the Agricultural Veterinary Office.
The purpose of the event was to highlight the important role of large-scale vaccination against dog rabies in eliminating Ghanaian rabies.
Mr. Abebe Hale-Gabriel, Assistant Director-General and United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Representative in Ghana, said in a speech at the meeting that the problem of rabies could be reduced to the maximum if vaccination was intensified and stray animals were kept away from humans (especially children).
He said that according to the Global Strategic Plan for Zero Death from Rabies to 2030, 500,000 people die from rabies every year, 40% of whom are children living in Asia and Africa, and he called for comprehensive measures to address this situation and protect children from rabies.
Mr Hail-Gabriel said that most stray animals are infected with rabies, which reflects once again the need for Ghana to further expand its Joint Anti-Rape Disease Campaign strategy, which requires pet owners to vaccinate animals with rabies that is common to humans.
He stressed that Ghana must start campaigning and vaccination programs for five years to increase public awareness and eliminate the risk of rabies in humans.
He pointed out that through the Ghanaian Rabies Prevention and Action Plan (2018-2030), we have developed a comprehensive roadmap to phase out rabies, hoping to eradicate this tropical epidemic that has not been given enough attention by 2030.
Mr. Hail-Gabriel promised that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is ready to cooperate with other relevant entities to prevent and control rabies in Ghana.
Dr. Owen Kalua, WHO representative in Ghana, noted that rabies is an epidemic disease that must be controlled to save lives.
He explained that by adopting the Zero Death Risk Strategy for Rabies to 2030, countries are supported in developing and implementing national plans to eliminate rabies, including the concept of rabies health integration and cross-sectoral cooperation.
Dr. Kalua pointed out that 99% of the diseases that are common to humans and animals are transmitted to humans through dogs, and he added that the healthy integrated approach to control and ultimately eliminate human rabies is very appropriate.
Dr. Asieadu Baia, head of veterinary services, said with regret that rabies has become a global burden.
He said: "Although rabies cannot be cured, infection can be prevented by vaccination, so eliminating rabies is feasible and all animal owners must ensure that their animals are vaccinated".
Dr. Ba'a said that although the use of appropriate sustainable control strategies could prevent rabies completely, the mortality rate for rabies will continue to rise and the epidemic will increase due to lack of funds and insufficient collaboration.
He added that the urgent need for the animal sector is to have sufficient resources to prevent rabies from spreading to dogs, in order to prevent this disease.
A 12-year-old girl who silenced the world
At just 16, Greta Thumberi established herself as a global spokesperson on climate change, but 27 years ago, before social media became popular, another girl was already denouncing the leaders of the United Nations on the world stage.
Her environmental campaign has been unstoppable since Greta Thumbbery, a student strike in her native Sweden, launched a protest against climate change; her angry, passionate speech at the UN Climate Action Summit on Monday pushed her environmental campaign to the top; she fiercely attacked politicians who stole her dream and childhood memories with empty talk while mankind witnessed a huge extinction disaster.
The ruthless criticism of Tumbery has been fiercely criticized and highly praised. New York magazine called her the "Holy Lady of the Earth" for her protest against climate change, and the Guardian compared her remarks to the significance of the speech by US President Lincoln Gettysburg.
Back in 1992, the media gave the same assessment to Ms. Tumusetra. Before officials in the country froze to the point that we probably have no future for Ms. Tumusetra, netizens split into two completely opposing factions - Ms. Tumusetra's opposition and supporters; a similar slogan was given at the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, when the then 12-year-old Ms. Tumusetra made a similar claim, calling her the girl who silenced the world for five minutes.
The tone and tone of the Tomberi were so out of tune. We came here to tell you adults that you have to change your lifestyle, and she started her speech like Tomberi told the adults who attended the meeting that we will not let you easily escape these responsibilities.
As Tungbery told the UN climate summit that the catastrophe of extinction is imminent, and you know all day long only the fairy tale of money and economic growth, Tungbery told the leaders of the countries that losing my future is not as simple as losing an election or floating stock markets.
The focus of the two girls' communication was the null-destiny theory. I am now afraid to stand under the sun because the ozone layer has become hollow. I am afraid to breathe air because I don't know what chemicals are in it, said Tom Tomoshenko in his 1992 speech.
The environmental problems that Tom Tom Clancy cried out reflected the world of the early 1990s, when ecological issues focused on overharvesting, ozone depletion and species extinction. But after several years of intervention, humans have successfully addressed these problems. Thanks to the landmark chemical ban, ozone depletion has slowed significantly, while global forest cover has increased significantly, the increase is equivalent to the sum of the two states of Texas and Alaska.
Tom Tomusser was later the founder of an environmental think tank and worked for the Special Advisory Group of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in the early 21st century.
What will happen to the future of Tungbery? It depends on how you look at the example of Kim Kimsu-san. On the one hand, nothing that she was most worried about happened. On the other hand, governments are still struggling with environmental issues while also accepting the discipline of children.
Assuming that our world still exists 27 years later - unless humans cut carbon emissions to zero in the next decade or so, according to Tungbery, or the world will be extinct - the radical environmental activist is likely to look back on her long career at the United Nations and NGOs that began with this famous speech.
By then, another worried child may be raising a furious warning about the acid rain issue in the Martian colonies.
The Scottish National Party may support Jeremy Corbyn as interim prime minister to prevent a no-deal Brexit
The Scottish National Party has said it may support Jeremy Corbyn as interim prime minister in the UK's Prime Minister's Office to prevent a no-deal Brexit.
With the strained relationship between MPs and the Prime Minister's Office, Nicholas Sturkin suggested that the Labour leader could be supported as acting prime minister before the general election.
Mr. Corbyn called on Conservative rebels and opposition MPs to support him leading the provisional government in August, but the move was boycotted, particularly by Liberal Democrat leader Joe Swenson.
Under these proposals, the opposition sought to remove Boris Johnson by a vote of no confidence and then form a coalition government, seeking an extension to prevent Britain from leaving the EU on October 31.
The plan failed to gain cross-party support at the time, but senior members of the Scottish National Party feared that Mr Johnson would ignore the law if no agreement was reached by 19 October, forcing him to delay Britain's exit from the EU.
The leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturkin, suggested that the extension could be ensured by appointing Corbyn, as leaving Johnson in charge of the operation was a fool's errand.
Responding to a tweet suggesting the appointment of a Labour leader or another interim prime minister, she said: "I agree with this practice".
The vote of no confidence, the opposition united in one-person centering, the only goal was to ensure the postponement and then immediately hold the general election.
Everything is risky, but leaving Johnson in office, forcing no deal, or even making a bad deal, is a strategy in my opinion.
Senior MPs Harriet Harman and Ken Clark have both been nominated as potential candidates to lead the coalition government, but senior sources from the Scottish National Party insist that Labour must be the leader.
The source told Independent TV's Robert Peston that the situation was becoming clearer when we had to select a new Prime Minister through a vote of no confidence so that we could demand a postponement of Brexit and a general election.
Trying to find a candidate who is consensual and national unity is too complicated, especially now that we have a candidate. Whether people like it or not, Cobain must be the interim prime minister.
A spokesman for the Scottish National Party said the party was committed to preventing a no-deal Brexit and to removing the dangerous and undemocratic incumbent Prime Minister Liu Xiaobo as soon as possible.
"If there is political will, it is now possible for political parties to unite to ensure that the letter that has been delayed does not fall into the hands of Boris Johnson and his close friends, who have decided to find a solution to avoid the Bannon Bill, but issued by the interim acting prime minister, the interim acting prime minister will serve only for the necessary time to be sent, and immediately after the general election will be held", the spokesman said.
We remain open to all options to achieve the goal of stopping a no-deal Brexit and removing Boris Johnson.
Even with the support of the Scottish National Party, this would be a decisive vote for Mr. Corbyn. There are 288 Conservative MPs and 10 Democratic Unionists, so the opposition needs to draw some of the 34 independent MPs.
Labour believes the plan is the simplest and most democratic way to stop a no-deal Brexit.
However, the Liberal Democrats believe that the interim government under Mr. Corbyn needs the support of former Conservative MPs and party traitors, and therefore cannot get the necessary support in the House of Representatives.
Angus Conservative MP Kirsten Hale said: "This report confirms the longstanding suspicion that members of the Scottish National Party would be very happy to support Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
There is no doubt that Kobin's unstable stance on the second independence referendum (abbreviated as indyref2) was the determining factor for the nationalists.
If he becomes prime minister, he has already opened the door for the 2014 referendum to be held again.
Only the Conservative government will stand up and support those who cast their ballots against the ban on a 100th anniversary event.
Suspected of sexual harassment, over 50 students from the University of Surrey banned from participating in sports teams
"Well, people are just waiting for the guys to do what they should do on vacation. You can accept this is an exaggerated, noisy trip.
However, according to the students, some students' behavior this year was very outrageous, especially during a match when members of the football club were being provoked by their teammates to provoke women, while their friends tried to stop them from doing so.
Alan Sutherland, president of the Surrey Students' Union, said: "We have realized that this behavior is wrong and that any student accused of making serious mistakes will be transferred to the school investigation as the investigation goes on, according to the Student Discipline Regulations".
The school formally punished three students and personally investigated the behavior of the football team.
One student was expelled from the school for three sexual misconduct or harassment and one sexual assault.
At the same time, a final warning was issued to the other two students who were also accused of harassment and asked them to apologize.
One student was banned from entering the university campus at certain times, and another student was banned from participating in organized social activities. All three students were banned from attending the graduation ceremony.
The University of Surrey Men's Soccer Club said they sincerely apologized for the behavior of their members on their tour of Croatia.
Matt de Groord should not be punished for the stigma of schizophrenia
In 2016, Matthew De Groord, who killed five people at a family party in Calgary, was convicted of criminal responsibility for his actions.
Now, in 2019, a hearing will decide whether he should be allowed more freedom, such as an unattended exit. The decision will be made in the coming weeks, so during this period we will consider whether this is a good idea. There are different views on this matter: one believes that given his past violence, the call should be prevented from happening again, while the other believes in the power of change and recovery.
First, let's look at the more pessimistic side. De Groord did kill five people during a mental illness. This was an unpredictable violent attack. He had schizophrenia, which is why he was found not criminally responsible, but has been seeing psychiatrists and taking medication ever since. His psychiatrist Santok Ray had said before the review committee that if Matthew De Groord committed another crime, the consequences would be serious.
I think that the stigma that people have for psychiatrists, especially schizophrenics, has largely caused this fear. Some mental illnesses have become less scary, such as mood and anxiety disorders. But other diseases, including schizophrenia, are still highly stigmatized. This is largely because many people portray schizophrenics as dangerous people, and there is a voice in their heads telling them to kill.
This is true, but it is rare, and perhaps that is why we remember this so deeply. In fact, most schizophrenics are nonviolent, and they are more likely to be victims of crime or violence than perpetrators. Given this, it seems unreasonable to insist on depriving Degrad certain freedoms if the fear of repeating crimes is based more on biases against schizophrenics than on a practical possibility.
I don't think Degrod should be forever unregulated. Regulations should be made through a similar system of parole to ensure that he is still taking his medication and that medication is effective. He argued that it is still a form of isolation that accommodates him or other mentally ill patients unless absolutely necessary. This would make it impossible for mentally ill patients, especially those with schizophrenia, to ever integrate into society; thus they would continue to be stigmatized and the notion of them as dangerous criminals would be perpetuated. The court found him not criminally liable, why should he be treated as a prisoner rather than as a living, now recovering person?
Hungarian Prime Minister Orban defends the candidate for the European Commission in Hungary, and the solution is at hand.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that he had several solutions to address the issue after Hungary's nomination for European Commission membership was rejected.
According to Reuters, the Socialist Party politician Roana Prende, appointed by the EU Minister of Transport, and the Commissioner for Nominations for the EU's Eastern Expansion, former Hungarian Minister of Justice Raslo Trochenie, were told that their nomination hearing could not be held due to inconsistencies in the financial statements.
"I firmly believe that Trotsky Nietzsche is the most suitable candidate for the European Commission", said Mr. Olban. "If I say he is guilty, it means that he helped the government and me... to protect Hungary from immigration interference".
This move is embarrassing for the Trojan leader, who has been in conflict with Brussels on issues such as immigration policy.
Meeting a Baby on a Flight: Japan Airlines Launched a Service to Avoid Screaming Baby Seats
Japan Airlines has launched an online booking tool that can show seats for step-children, and from now on, long-haul flights that are haunted by crying babies may no longer exist.
When passengers with children aged eight days to two years are selected, a child ID automatically appears on the seat list to remind other passengers who have not yet been selected.
Japan Airlines quickly pointed out that the new features cannot guarantee that passengers can completely avoid the crying baby noise.
If passengers booked flights through third parties, or joined a travel group, or switched planes at the last minute, the icon may not appear, according to the website of Japan Airlines.
Japan Airlines and other airlines have not yet come up with a way to predict the seats of continuous gamblers and passengers who have their seats completely tilted when eating on the plane.
Despite this, the move has won praise from some users on social media.
Thanks to @JAL_Official_jp for reminding me where the kids plan to shout in the 13 hour journey, the businessman Rahat Ahmed wrote on Twitter.
However, some people urged travelers to remain tolerant.
"They are babies, and we were babies too. We need to learn tolerance, otherwise we will soon need a map of the common situations in life like screaming, running water, drinking, and drunkenness", wrote one user.
Pompeo accused Syria of using chemical weapons in the attack in May
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke during the United Nations Conference. The United Nations General Assembly said Thursday that the United States had confirmed that the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year.
Pompeo said U.S. officials have determined that the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad used hydrogen in an attack on the armed opposition in Idlib province on May 19.
In a press conference, Pompeo said that the Assad regime is responsible for countless atrocities, some of which have escalated to war crimes and crimes against humanity.
U.S. officials said in May that their reports were consistent with the chemical attacks in northwestern Syria, but did not give any definite conclusions at the time.
In April 2018, the United States, Britain and France launched airstrikes on Syria in retaliation for what they said were suspected chemical attacks that killed more than 40 people earlier that month.
"It's different in a way because it's a joke... but know that President Trump is actively protecting the world from chemical weapons attacks", Pompeo said.
He also said the United States will provide an additional $4.5 million to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to fund the investigation into other suspected chemical weapons incidents in Syria.
Pompeo also called on the Assad regime to release thousands of detainees who were unjustly detained, including the missing American journalist Austin Tissot, who was presumed detained by the government for seven years.
He is just one of the few American citizens held in Syria, and we call on the Syrian regime to release all of them.
Tesla released a report that Musk's goal is to deliver 100,000 vehicles this quarter.
Elon Musk, co-founder and CEO of Tesla Motor Co., is a member of the board of directors of Tesla Motor Corporation.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Tesla expects to deliver 100,000 vehicles this quarter, which will be a new record, according to Electrek, the news outlet reported.
Electrek's website said the news was leaked from an email Musk sent to Tesla employees. Musk wrote in the email: "Oh, we expect to deliver 100,000 cars for the first time this quarter, and this is an exciting milestone for our company!"
The CEO added in the report: "The difficulty of achieving this goal is ensuring that we have the right models in the right place and concentrate the company's resources as much as possible to help achieve the delivery goal at the end of this quarter".
The automaker is expected to report on its quarterly car deliveries in the coming days.
Last quarter, Tesla delivered about 950,000 electric vehicles.
Greece: Five people deny trafficking of poor women and newborn babies in illegal adoption
Five Greek and Georgian citizens are on trial for alleged involvement in a criminal organization that allegedly trafficked newborns as adoptions.
On Friday, the five denied the accusations before the prosecutor at the Thessaloniki base. Two of the Georgian nationals were charged with the main offence.
The group reportedly recruited several Bulgarian impoverished pregnant women who were willing to give up their newborn babies. Authorities said the group sold the babies to a Greek couple who had no children.
A total of 12 people were arrested this week for allegedly illegally adopting and trafficking human eggs. Another 54 people were charged with conspiracy.
Police said it was one of the largest and most rigorous organized gangs of its kind in Europe. The European Police Service provided assistance in the investigation of the case.
Mike Pompeo said the Syrian government used hydrogen-chemical weapons in the attack in May
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday that the US has concluded that the Syrian government used hydrogen chemical weapons during its war with rebels in Idlib in May this year.
Speaking at a press conference at the UN General Assembly in New York, Pompeo said that the Assad regime is responsible for countless atrocities, some of which have escalated to war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Pompeo added: "Today I announce that the United States has concluded that the Assad regime used chemical weapons on May 19.
The United States said that in May this year, the United States received a large number of reports that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces suspected some chemicals in the northwest area of armed combat with anti-government forces; however, the United States has not made clear conclusions about whether the Syrian Assad government used chemical weapons.
In April 2017 and April 2018, the Trump administration allegedly used chemical weapons to bomb Syria twice with Assad's Syrian government forces.
The parents still hope that the suspect who shot his son a year ago will eventually fall online.
The 20-year-old was shot dead in a case that took place a year ago, but the victim's family did not give up hope that the killer would fall.
Guy Alford, the father of the victim, said: "Oh, I wish I could be with you, son, I wish I could be with you".
Alford returned to the Jack fast food chain near the box at 52nd Street and Atlantic Avenue, where his son, Guy Alford III, was shot and killed. He said he wanted to draw attention to the murder of his unresolved son.
He said: "Well, someone knows about some things and they need to say it".
Never released security footage shows that Alford parked behind him in the car park after the car was parked in the restaurant. Three suspects then got out of the car. One of them went to the driver's seat of the car where Alford was, and shot Alford. Four people in the car jumped out and ran away. The suspect then returned to his car and drove away.
"Wherever this species is, it will be caught", said Olford.
The grieving father said he didn't know who would want to hurt his son, nor did he know who was in the car when his son was shot.
"Oh, they ran out of my son's car like in the video, where did they go?" said Olford. "Did you go back and try to help him or do something?" No one said a word.
Alford said his son was a star football player at Allemanni High School and then a standout safety for the Long Beach City College football team. Alford said that his son was working hard to play football at the time, trying to get into a first-class school, and his dream was to become a nurse.
A friend of his son, Michael Harvey, said: "He's got three jobs. I'm 21 years old, he's a year younger than me, and whoever keeps this busy state and work ideology will be admired by others".
Police are still investigating the fatal shooting, and Alford said he did not give up.
He said: "Well, this problem will be solved, I can assure you".
Alford personally offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect. We strongly recommend that anyone who can provide information about the crime call the Shengjiang Police Department.
The difficulty of Brexit is heavy
If Johnson tries to avoid committing to a delay, humiliation awaits him in Brussels at the EU court. This will ease the spirits of European officials, who will likely agree to do so, mainly because spending more time looking for solutions to reduce the threat of a no-deal Brexit would hurt both economies.
However, diplomats in Europe also saw that the political stalemate in Britain led to the delay in decision-making. Parliamentarians were able to put aside differences, limit Johnson's actions and seek extension, but the consensus that could be reached was limited to this. It was this Parliament that rejected the difficult Brexit deal with former Prime Minister Theresa May and the EU three times. Unless elections are held, this is another matter for which MPs have the right to decide, otherwise nothing will change.
Even with elections, the prospects remained worrying, as European countries wanted to resolve the chaos caused by Brexit through a friendly solution. The policies of the opposition Labour Party are so painfully distorted that it is almost impossible to understand; while the centre-left Liberal Democrats proposed cancelling the Brexit, which is considered too extreme. The longer Brexit delays, the more unfavorable the smooth functioning of the EU will be.
Brussels may be optimistic if a viable outline of the agreement is put on the table at the European Commission's headquarters in Belém, but in reality, there is no such outline.
Johnson frequently criticized the former prime minister's proposals to avoid Ireland returning to its hard border and protect the EU single market, but he also did not come up with any convincing alternatives. Officials said that many of the alternatives proposed by the UK were not specific enough, lacking practicality, and that the UK's exit from the EU on 31 October was difficult and timely.
Johnson's weakness will also make the leaders of the EU27 less willing to address the red line, despite the British minister responsible for the no-deal Brexit claiming they are adjusting the back-up.
Johnson was attacked for speaking out in the Brexit debate, and the ideal result was that a series of strikes against him would bring the race to a close. Europe has no choice but to negotiate with the current British government while working to maintain solidarity between the other 27 member states. Therefore, Europe should still strive to get Britain to make the maximum concessions, but the longer the time lags, the harder it is to achieve. If there is an opportunity to reach an agreement with the British Parliament again, the EU should seize the opportunity well.
But it was more like a football game, with 27 players on one side in the defensive line, while the other players were trying to pick up the ball and go home.
The EU is good at making rules, laying down the red line and sticking to enforcement, but imposing its will unilaterally is a shortcut. At least before the British general election or the second referendum break the deadlock, Britain has taken care of its own internal contradictions.
The difficulty of Brexit is heavy.
The first time a black hole was caught swallowing and tearing up a stellar event
For the first time, a large black hole is captured swallowing and tearing up a star.
According to the researchers published in the journal Astrophysics, the star is about the size of our sun, and 375 million light-years away, and can be seen twisting and spiraling upwards under the gravitational influence of a supermassive black hole.
The star was then swallowed, and astronomers called this rare cosmic event the tidal rift event.
NASA's planet search telescope, and the Ling Ling Ling Exoplanet Satellite detection - captured the detailed timeline from the beginning to the end of the event for the first time.
Astronomers used a global network telescope to detect this phenomenon before observing the Ling Ling Exoplanetary Satellite, and the continuous observation area of the Ling Ling Exoplanetary Satellite, designed to search for distant planets, captured the initial stage of this violent incident.
Thomas Hollyan, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institute of Science who led the study, said: "This is actually a combination of rationality and good luck, and sometimes it's what it takes to advance science".
When the star ventures too close to a supermassive black hole, it is absorbed into the black hole, which is at the center of most galaxies, such as the Earth's galaxy.
The strong gravity of the black hole tears the star apart, some of the matter from the star is thrown into space, while the rest is absorbed into the black hole, forming a glowing, hot glowing gas during its ingestion.
Mr. Holly added: "Specifically, we were able to measure the speed at which the star shone, and we observed a rare drop in planetary temperature and dimming of brightness".
The British Commerce Commission will investigate the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook
The National Aeronautics Service said it planned to operate 72 flights after Thomas Cook tourism group went bankrupt and take 16,000 more passengers back to the UK.
Aviation regulators said that more than 40% of passengers had been taken back in the context of the largest peacetime repatriation operation, the PAMMHON Plan, which began on Monday.
Meanwhile, the UK Parliamentary Commerce Committee has launched a bankruptcy investigation into Thomas Cook, seeking to question management about executive compensation and accounting policy.
Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel agency, closed early Monday morning, and is home to hotel owners, tourist attractions and resorts around the world.
The UK's oldest travel company, which unfortunately went bankrupt, should face public scrutiny and be held accountable for their actions before it went bankrupt, said Rachel Reeves, chair of the UK's Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee.
The hearing will begin in mid-to-late October.
The board of directors welcomed the opportunity to clarify the facts, to prove that their behavior was always in the best interests of Thomas Cook's customers, employees and stakeholders, a person familiar with the company told Reuters.
Why the Times published detailed identity information of the reporter
On Thursday, The Times released an exclusive detailed information about a reporter whose allegations led the Democrats to launch an impeachment investigation against President Trump this week. The article said the reporter was a CIA official who had previously served in the White House and was very expert on Ukrainian issues.
Many readers - including national security and intelligence workers - criticized the detailed information that the Times published, saying that the move could endanger the life of the reporter and could make those who want to report stand out.
We expressed the concerns of these readers to Dean Barquette, executive editor of The Times, who responded in a discussion with the Reader Center:
The president and some supporters have challenged the credibility of the whistleblower because the information provided by the whistleblower triggered a landmark impeachment process. The president himself has called the whistleblower's account a political hack.
We decided to release limited information about the whistleblower, including his work with a non-political agency, and his complaint was based on an in-depth understanding of the White House because we wanted to provide information to the reader so that the reader could make their own judgments about whether the whistleblower is credible.
China says it has not provoked any war and has not invaded foreign land
On Friday, China said it had no intention of provoking a war or conflict, nor had it invaded the land of one of the other countries, avoiding mentioning the 1962 Sino-Indian War.
China has always been committed to dealing with territorial issues and maritime boundary disputes through negotiation and consultation. China released an official white paper four days before the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party of China's reign on October 1.
China has not actively provoked any wars and conflicts for 70 years, and has not invaded an inch of another country's land, the China-World White Paper of the Neolithic era wrote.
While emphasizing the peaceful rise and rise of the Communist Party of China, the White Paper makes no mention of the bloody war with India in 1962 and the large swath of land occupied by China, especially the Aksu region.
The China-India border dispute over the 3,488 km line of actual control remains unsolved. China also claims that Arunachal Pradesh is part of southern Tibet, which India opposes.
So far, the two countries have held 21 rounds of special representative talks to resolve the border dispute.
In addition to the 1962 war, India and China also clashed militarily in 2017 in Dokram, when the Chinese People's Liberation Army tried to pave a road in a nearby corridor known as the "Purple India" and connected to the states of northeast India, which Sudan also claims to own.
Finally, the issue was resolved through diplomatic means, and both sides withdrew their troops.
In 1979, a major military conflict erupted between China and Vietnam. China claimed sovereignty over the entire South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan all expressed opposition.
China and 12 of its 14 neighbors have resolved the land border issue thoroughly, outlining the maritime boundary of the Gulf of China and northern Vietnam, the White Paper said, noting that China has initially cut back military personnel by 400 million yuan since the reforms opened in 1978.
China's military, with 2 million officers, remains the largest in the world.
The prolonged monsoon season has brought flooding and chaos to many parts of India
India's monsoon season has raged for almost a month, with unprecedented rainfall causing buildings to collapse and many crops to rot.
The northern Indian monsoon usually weakens in early September, but the average rainfall this month is 37% above normal. Experts from the Indian Meteorological Department say that if this continues for several days, it will be the latest monsoon season in decades to recede.
Many parts of India are still suffering from unprecedented flood disasters, with the latest one being in Pune, western India, where heavy rains on Wednesday and Thursday killed several people and caused extensive damage to buildings collapsing.
Houses are flooded, people walk down flooded streets, which are usually only seen during the peak season.
Heavy rainfall also fell in other cities such as Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad. Houses were severely damaged due to continuous rainfall in northern Akhand province.
The season is also late. Many areas lack water, and farmers are prepared to deal with possible drought disasters.
The prolonged monsoon season has left the farmers with no headaches. The rain is so bad at this time of year. This has led to the rot of my vegetable crops, including the cereal, beans, peas and tomatoes I have harvested, said Prakash Mehra, a small farmer in Bimtal, northern Akhand.
For consumers, the late-return season has led to higher prices for onions, which are an important ingredient in Indian food. In cities like Delhi and Mumbai, onions are sold at 80 rupees per kilogram (about 1 pound), whereas under normal circumstances they are 20 rupees per kilogram (about 23 pence).
The next big festival is the Ten Victory Festival on October 8, where Indians raise a huge cartoon-like robot portrait, the robot being the character in the Hindu epic Romoro's epic, with a dark mustache and a grin of evil.
Burning Robona's portraits symbolizes evil. But they are made of paper, and if the monsoon continues, Robona may laugh until the end.
Julian Assange: Private security company Liu Liu is the founder of WikiLeaks, which is being monitored by the Central Intelligence Agency at the Ecuadorian embassy
Julian Assange was reportedly living in London when he was the founder of WikiLeaks, which was monitored by the US intelligence agency, by a Spanish private security company hired to protect the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
A report in the Spanish National News Agency said that Spanish private security companies were alleged to have provided the CIA with audio and video of Assange's meeting with his lawyers.
The company is under investigation by the Spanish High Court, the report said.
Assange himself filed criminal charges, alleging that the company violated his privacy and the privilege of his client-lawyer.
The Spanish National Press reported that the private security company failed to respond to a request to comment on the matter.
In April, Assange was immediately expelled from the embassy by authorities after being handed over to the British authorities in Ecuador.
In 2012, while on bail, Assange entered the Ecuadorian embassy in the UK as a refugee, facing the risk of extradition to Sweden on sexual assault charges; Assange said he was concerned that if he gave up WikiLeaks, he would be extradited to the United States.
In June, the United States formally issued an extradition request for Assange, who was charged with 18 counts of computer abuse and unauthorized leakage of defense information.
He is accused of plotting a plot with former intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, a former US Army intelligence officer.
Assange, who was previously jailed for violating bail terms for Swedish extradition requests, is currently serving his sentence at Belmarsh Prison in London, and should have been released last week, but is still awaiting trial pending the US extradition hearing in London in February 2020.
In May, the Swedish prosecutor's office reopened the investigation into Assange's rape allegations - which Assange has denied.
After All-Power Airlines declared a state of emergency, the flight landed in Baltimore
The Federal Aviation Administration said that an All-Star International Airlines plane landed safely at Washington International Airport in Baltimore after declaring a state of emergency.
The Federal Aviation Administration said in an email that Flight 328 landed at Baltimore Washington International Airport at 6:19 p.m. on Thursday due to a hydraulic problem with the Boeing B777.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the flight had departed from Baltimore, but its destination is unknown. The number of passengers on the flight is currently unknown. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident.
All-Power International Airlines (headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma) received a phone message and immediately returned the message on Thursday evening.
Why do we still need Gandhi
As we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the birth of an extraordinary person, the leaders of the world's two largest democracies should more than ever obey the principles he has followed.
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, dedicated his life to moral, nonviolent, tolerant and social justice causes, left a valuable legacy for the world. He had a profound impact on the two most important civil rights movements in the United States.
Howard Thurman and Benjamin Mays, American activists who traveled across the ocean to India to meet Gandhi, thus Gandhi's influence on the civil rights movement began long before Martin Luther King embraced his ideas.
Kaisa Chavis traces her political awakening to a news video of her being 11 and 12 years old, telling of how a half-naked man without a gun conquered the powerful monarchy of the British Empire. Many of her later strategies were modeled after Gandhi when she led the farm workers movement.
Outside the United States, Gandhi has the same influence. Just to name a few, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai and climate change activists all see Gandhi as a beacon of light.
However, President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi seem to be indifferent to Gandhi's ideas, except for the verbal compliments he received at the recent large joint public rally in Houston. Both are practitioners of right-wing populism, which lacks sympathy or tolerance in the regime, and have successfully launched white and Hindu voting groups in their respective countries, while fomenting division and social opposition.
Modi became a member of the National Volunteer Organization of Indian Nationalists (NAN) at the age of eight, a former member of the organization, Natul Ram Godson, who assassinated Gandhi on January 30, 1948. In fact, the National Assembly member of Modi's ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, has been increasingly appreciative of the assassination of Gandhi in recent years.
The Modi government has demonstrated anti-Gandhiism in many ways, abolishing the autonomy and status of the Muslim-majority provinces of Jammu and Kashmir, and imposing blockades on the region; nor does it welcome the Rohingya refugees who fled extreme persecution in Myanmar.
And the Modi government has caused social unrest by setting up a national register of citizens, and setting up detention camps in border region Assam, apparently to capture non-native citizens from Muslim-majority neighboring Bangladesh, but this could lead to nearly 2 million people being deprived of their right to vote and imprisoned.
Trump's policies are also striking. The Trump administration's travel ban on Muslim-majority countries is a response to Islamophobia, and it is also a factor that Modi often considers in formulating policies. His cruelty to refugees is a breathing expression of the suffering suffered by the Rohingya by the Indian government, while the detention camps in the United States are very different from the detention camps established by the Modi regime. Trump's incitement to racial hatred is unmistakable from the headache words of some members of the Modi cabinet.
A moment worth learning emerged at the recent joint meeting of the two leaders. During the event, House Majority Leader Stern Hoyer cited Gandhi's definition of democracy as "democracy can give the weak the same opportunity as the strong".
It's time for the 150th anniversary of Gandhi's birth, and if Trump and Modi can remember Gandhi's advice, they should have done much better in their tenure.
White House statement: Trump nominates Peter Gainer as the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
On April 3, 2019, Peter Gaina, acting director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, smiled at the U.S. Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., testifying at a hearing on the agency's budget request for fiscal year 2020 held by the Senate Appropriations Committee's Homeland Security Subcommittee.
US President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaina as the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the White House said in a statement.
Guena, the current Deputy Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, served as acting Director of the agency, which oversees government response to hurricanes and wildfires.
Since Brock Lang resigned in March, the agency has not had a Senate-approved head. The senior branch of the Administration Department - the Department of Homeland Security - found that Long was violating the use of buses to travel to Washington and his residence in North Carolina, after which he resigned as director.
Earlier this month, another candidate for governor, Jeffrey Bayard, was withdrawn from the nomination after a background check found that he was suspected of being involved in a bar fight.
Gaina's nomination was unexpected. He also needed a Senate majority vote to approve the nomination and he could serve as deputy chairman.
Before becoming deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget in 2018, Gaina worked in the emergency management department in Rhode Island and served in the U.S. Navy, the White House said.
The man was attacked and burned at his doorstep
A man was set on fire at his doorstep, which police believe was a targeted attack.
The 48-year-old man was reportedly injected with a fuel oil liquid after being set on fire outside his home in Skellmerdale, West Lancashire.
The man was seriously burned and is currently in hospital in critical but stable condition.
At around 1am on Thursday, police received a police call and rushed to the man's home to investigate the attempted murder.
Detective Paulin Stoubles, who is in charge of the investigation, said: "The nature of the incident is bad, and the man is still in the hospital and the situation is very bad.
"We are conducting a series of investigations to try to find out who is responsible.
Well, we are trying to determine the motives behind the incident, we are sure that the incident was targeted, and I want to emphasize that I do not think that the incident is currently a threat to the wider community.
I hope that the person who killed the victim can report to us.
When your loved ones come home, do they behave suspiciously, smell smoke, smell gasoline, or have unexplained scars?
"We need someone to take responsibility for this terrible incident".
Fragile Democrats have raised concerns about Pelosi's impeachment
During the meeting, several members expressed their position: Democrats should continue to focus on investigating the issue of Ukraine, accusing Trump of asking the Ukrainian president to investigate potential 2020 political opponents rather than other possible violations detailed in the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller.
Pelosi said in a news conference Thursday morning that the vast majority of Democrats agreed with the strategy that the whistleblower allegation of fraud was the focus of the moment.
The leaders hoped to maintain party unity by continuing to focus on impeachment investigations, while focusing on moderate members who recently joined the proceedings. The MPs said that the issue in Ukraine was also clearer and easier to explain to the public. They also believed that the investigation led by the Intelligence Committee was smaller and progress would be faster, and could be implemented within the next two months.
Representative Angie Craig of Minnesota recently joined the Democratic Party, and she said earlier this week that she supported the impeachment investigation because Pelosi and Democratic leaders had largely heard the MPs' opinions at the previous meeting.
Craig said that she stands with me and I have always been unwilling to push the investigation from the perspective that I want to be restricted, I want to look at the proper procedure and hope to make sure that we have all the facts and the procedure will enable us to do this, she added that she supports a small scale investigation led by the House Intelligence Committee.
Democratic Representative Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania told the cable news network that he would not vote for the impeachment clause at this time.
"Oh, I don't vote now because we haven't seen the whole truth yet". Carter said. "Oh, we have to assume that people are innocent, right? If all this is true, we have to see if the press is reporting what news and if there are documents that reveal this information".
Democrats will soon hear from voters that they are pushing for impeachment, and members plan to return to their respective constituencies for a two-week hiatus in early October. This is the first time a large group of members from conservative regions have heard feedback from their own voters since they called for the impeachment proceedings to be launched after allegations in Ukraine occurred earlier this week.
But Michigan Democratic Representative Dan Kildare said it would be good to choose to retire at this time.
"I really can't think of anything better than to report to the boss before the impeachment proceedings are initiated". He told reporters. "It's actually a good time for us to go back to the moment, get the opinion of the local people, explain what we are doing, and then go back and move forward accordingly".
Although the MPs have returned, the process may be faster.
Justice Commissioner Jamie Raskin, who is a supporter of the impeachment investigation, said: "I think everyone is willing to complete this work in 2019.
The Maryland Democrat told reporters Thursday night: "We are always consistent with the violations and corruption that have emerged in the White House, and our job is to reduce these acts and issues through a series of meaningful impeachment clauses for the state. We need a series of clauses to ensure that legal cases are convincing and tell a coherent story to the public. If we do the right thing, then this will be a unified action for the entire country".
Anthony Brindisi, a Democrat newly joined from New York, who declined to appeal the impeachment investigation, told the cable news network that he was holding his objections to impeach Trump.
Brindisi said: "While I found many of the statements in the whistleblower's report disturbing, there is more information. We have to talk to some of these officials who have already listed the report here and checked the report's direction".
According to the cable news network, more than half of the members of the U.S. House of Representatives have expressed support for the impeachment investigation. However, this includes many Democrats who, although they have expressed support for the impeachment investigation, are still waiting for the results before deciding whether to vote in favor of impeaching Trump. Even if the House can vote to pass the impeachment clause, it will still be a bump in the road in the Republican-controlled Senate, which is one of the many reasons why this issue has caused political divisions within the Democratic Party.
Trump discussed former Vice President Joe Biden during a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25, and about three days later, the number of people supporting the impeachment investigation increased by more than 75 members of the House. There is no evidence that Biden was wrong.
Trump staff said lawyers have transferred Ukrainian phone records to the security system
A senior Trump administration official admitted Friday that White House lawyers directed President Trump to transfer the phone records of July with Ukrainian President Zelensky to a highly secure system.
Other than the allegations in the reporting phone, it is not clear what other actions were taken to transfer the records.
The Trump administration declassified whistleblower complaint and released it to the public Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee, which said White House officials said they were instructed by White House counsel Liu to delete the call logs from the computer system where the phones are usually stored.
The whistleblower claimed that the notes were usually kept in classified systems of different grades. The whistleblower also claimed that, according to White House officials, it was not the first time that the White House placed presidential notes in this system in order to protect politically sensitive information, rather than sensitive information about national security. The complaint claimed that the White House tried to restrict access to the whistleblower's call records.
Within days of receiving the call, I learned from several US officials that senior White House officials had intervened and locked all records of the calls, especially the formal word-of-mouth record of calls made by the White House Intelligence Room in the usual manner, the White House correspondent said.
The White House released a non-classified version of the call record Wednesday. The memo, which is not a literal record, but a record of the call and memories from the relevant people, shows that Trump sought assistance in investigating the Biden family.
He said: "The other thing is that Biden's son has a lot of rumors, Biden has terminated a lawsuit, and many people want to find out about it, and if you can do something with the Attorney General, it's best". Biden boasted everywhere that he stopped the prosecution, and if you can investigate, to me... that sounds terrible.
Joe Biden, during his tenure as vice president, urged Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the bribery scandal involving the Ukrainian natural gas company PBSM. Biden's youngest son Hunter was a director of the company. Biden's allies insisted that he intervened on corruption issues.
But the whistleblower's complaint says Trump sought foreign assistance in the 2020 campaign. However, the whistleblower admitted in the complaint that the complaints were based on secondhand information.
White House lawyers demanded that the instructions to modify the record be disguised as a cover-up by Democratic high-levels.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, announced this week that a formal impeachment inquiry would be held against the president over the development of Ukraine, calling it a cover-up and saying it would be part of the impeachment inquiry.
Meanwhile, Trump lawyer Jay Sekulo belittled the importance of preserving records.
Think about it, Secco said on Fox News with friends on Friday. Shouldn't the White House protect the phone call with the President of Ukraine? Is it secret and should not be hidden, it is a document.
Ukrainian scandal: Pelosi says Baal is unreliable; former US officials support the investigation
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused US Attorney General William Barr of defending the president ruthlessly in a controversial phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian leadership on Friday, which sparked an impeachment investigation.
Before the California Democrat made the above statement, an unnamed intelligence official submitted the indictment to the US intelligence agency's inspector general, Michael Atkinson, on Thursday. Atkinson handed it over to the Director of National Intelligence, Joseph McQuire.
In the July 25 phone call, Bar and Trump's lawyer Rudolf Julian was mentioned several times. The indictment said that White House officials were very concerned about this and tried to lock the logs of the phone calls.
Pelosi told Microsoft National Broadcasting Company on Friday: "Bumball has become very indifferent. I think they are trying to cover up the truth. I think it is sad that the Justice Department is so indifferent. Well, it has been a while. Now it will only make things worse.
Pelosi announced a formal impeachment investigation this week after Trump admitted to ceasing military aid to Ukraine. The aid was finally approved, but House Democrats wanted to know if the aid had anything to do with the fact that the Zelensky investigation was requested by Trump to have Hunter Biden work for the Ukrainian natural gas company for five years.
Also on Friday, nearly 300 former U.S. foreign policy and homeland security officials signed a letter supporting the impeachment investigation. The coalition said Trump's actions represented a serious concern for national security.
"We congratulate members of Congress, including Speaker Pelosi, for guiding us along this necessary path". The letter said that President Trump seems to have used the power and resources of the highest office in the country to invite more foreign powers to interfere with our democratic process. This would constitute an unreasonable abuse of power.
And it will also represent an effort to subordinate the national interests of the United States and the interests of our closest allies and partners to the personal political interests of the president.
Trump denied any wrongdoing in the call. On Friday, he denounced the complainant and again said that his call with Zelensky was a perfect conversation.
He tweeted: "Your voice is increasingly like a so-called whistleblower, but it's not really a whistleblower. Besides, all secondhand information has been proven to be inaccurate, and there may not be anyone else, a leak or a spy who provided him or her with this information at all.
The whistleblower's complaint indicates that Vice President Pence also interacted with the Ukrainian leader, who met Zelensky earlier this month in Poland. He said he did not discuss Joe Biden or Hunter Biden.
The funeral home of Chinese rights activists calls for a thorough investigation into the truth of torture
One Chinese rights activist was arrested and killed after demanding the resignation of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and several rights activists called for a thorough investigation into his true cause of death.
Wang Meiyu, 38, filed a petition outside the door of the Hunan Provincial Public Security Hall in July this year asking Xi Jinping and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang to step down and implement a general election system in China. The police subsequently accused him of allegedly seeking a case of HIV, a vague definition of the charge, and many dissenters were jailed for it.
Wang Meizu's mother and lawyer revealed that he died on Monday. Wang Meizu's wife Cao Jun received a police call claiming that her husband died in a unit hospital in Yangyang City, while Wang Meizu's custody guard was located in Yangyang. The police did not explain anything about her death in the call.
According to reports from Chinese human rights organization Liu Min-siang observing Liu, Cao Cao later saw Wang's remains and found that his mouth, ears, nose and face were covered with blood.
China Human Rights Defenders Network (CHRD) issued a statement saying that the Chinese government must conduct a thorough investigation into the torture and death of human rights activist Wang Mei-yu during his detention and criminal responsibility for those who carried out torture and extrajudicial executions.
According to Radio Free Asia, Cao Cao said that the police had asked her to accept Wang Mei-yeo's untimely death, but she refused. A police officer from the Yangyang City Police Department said that he could not comment on the case. Wang Mei-yeo's mother told the Guardian that authorities had issued compensation of more than 2 million yuan (about $220,000) to her family.
"The fact that the truth is not fully investigated and the criminal responsibility of the parties is not prosecuted, but only compensation is paid, so that the victim's guilt cannot be truly washed away and torture cannot be effectively prevented", said Francis Iyin, head of research at CHRD.
The families of the victims in particular have actually been taken hostage and may be forced to stop demanding the truth of the investigation because of the compensation they have been charged with.
Before Wang Meiyu, other Chinese rights activists had experienced similar incidents, such as Zhang Jiuzhan, a grassroots lawyer who died in custody last July, and Muhammad Salih Agy, a Uyghur scholar who died last year. In 2017, Nobel Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, who was serving a prison sentence (11 years) still had cancer and died after authorities refused treatment for him; in 2014, Cao Sanli tried to attend a UN conference on the human rights situation in China, was detained and died on the way.
According to CHRD, authorities have locked up Wang Meizu's family since the week before. Wang Meizu left two young children behind. Other people involved in the case were also pressured by the authorities. On Wednesday, human rights lawyer Xiang and rights activist Chen Zhenhui discussed Wang Meizu's case in a hotel room, while the police controlled six Dutch gunmen who were fired.
Wang Meiyu started his rights campaign early in the year after facing forced eviction; he had previously been detained by the police and claimed to have been tortured.
In 2018, after lifting a banner demanding Xi Jinping step down, he sent a message via the Internet that police had stormed into his home, ordering him to write a letter of remorse and a guarantee to stop such activities.
They don't want to think about how they tortured me these years, even three days and three nights without water, and tortured me for hours with electrical needles, and I won't give in.
Pet owners who do not feed dogs face a fine of A$2,700
If the owner cannot provide basic supplies such as housing, food and water, they face huge on-site fines. If the owner locks the dog for 24 hours, the pet must be allowed free activity for the next two hours or else they will face prosecution.
The region is the first jurisdiction in Australia to recognize animal perception.
Modern Animal Welfare is concerned with how animals respond to their environment mentally and physically, and Chris Steele, Minister of Urban Services of the Action Party, is also an advocate for the bill, he said at a press conference.
Hong Kong police say the number of students arrested during the protests has increased
On Friday, Hong Kong police said that 1,600 people have been detained since June in anti-democratic protests, while students accounted for 29%, and at the weekend the police urged young people to take the right approach when planning larger rallies.
Police Public Relations Department Chief Shie Chen said that although classes were resumed after the summer break, 207 high school and college students were detained this month alone compared to 257 people detained between June and August.
She said that the number of teenagers involved in violent crimes has increased, and some have already been indicted in court. These include a 16-year-old who was recently charged with arson, and who could be sentenced to life imprisonment once convicted; a 13-year-old girl who was charged with desecrating the Chinese flag, and others who attacked police officers and carried dangerous weapons.
In a press conference, Liu said that seeing these young people violate the law at such a young age, and that there may be criminal records, is worrying. We call on all young people to reflect on their behavior and hope that the education department and parents can help our young people regulate their behavior.
Since June, the youth have mainly protested the extradition bill, which the government has now agreed to withdraw. But since then, the protest has attracted more participants, and has evolved into a larger movement against the Chinese government, which Beijing claims is violating Hong Kong's autonomy; Hong Kong was once a British colony, and its sovereignty was returned to China in 1997, when the Chinese government promised to implement autonomy for Hong Kong.
The protesters expanded their demands, including directly electing Hong Kong's leaders and independent investigation into alleged police brutality against protesters.
Thousands of people held peaceful protests in the city centre square on Friday night, alleging police abuse of power, waving anti-police slogans and shouting slogans of democracy. The Hong Kong government said it would investigate complaints against police by a police watchdog, which critics said had no real authority and no real investigative authority.
Police approved a large rally organized by the Civil Rights Front on Saturday in downtown Hong Kong to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Hu Jinta Movement. During the Hu Jinta Movement, protesters occupied Hong Kong's main streets for 79 days demanding universal suffrage. The campaign ended without any concessions from the government.
On Sunday, protesters will also organize rallies against totalitarianism in Hong Kong and many cities around the world, protesting against the Chinese tyranny they condemn.
She called on protesters to stop manipulating peaceful protests, as they had done before, such as throwing gasoline bombs, starting street fires, destroying public facilities. Police used tear gas, high-pressure water guns and other measures to target the protesters, leading the protesters to complain about their excessive use of force.
The Civil Rights Front is also planning another large march on October 1, fearing that the bloody final may embarrass the ruling Chinese Communist Party, which is hosting a grand event in Beijing to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Hong Kong government has scaled down the national celebrations, cancelled the annual fireworks show, and changed the reception to a indoor event.
Nestlé reinforces coffee bean control after the herbicide panic
The world's largest coffee company said in a statement Friday that it found glyphosate residues close to the maximum in some green coffee bean products.
Glycemia is a key component of Monsanto's herbicide Nooda. In the United States, a jury has ruled that people who claim their cancer is caused by exposure to glycemia can receive a huge compensation. The owner of Monsanto, Bayer, said that the herbicide is safe to use as long as it is used properly, and the Environmental Protection Agency believes the same.
One of the world's largest traders, Newman Coffee Group, said glyphosate was one of the substances it monitored in its coffee purchases. Nestlé bought some coffee beans from Newman Coffee Group. It is too early to predict the impact of Nestlé's strict control policy on Newman Coffee Group, the spokesperson said.
Nestlé's decision to increase the frequency of inspections has little impact on the global coffee supply chain, the spokesperson said. "This is not a new process, we are only strengthening control", the spokesperson told the cable news network commercial channel. Coffee is being tested before it is shipped from the country of origin.
Nestlé will start implementing from suppliers in the world's largest coffee producing countries such as Indonesia and Brazil.
Our agricultural scientists will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve herbal management practices, including the appropriate use of herbicides and other herbicide methods, said the Swiss company.
Nestlé's powdered and liquid beverage business is dominated by brands such as Nestlé Coffee and Nestlé Sauce, which accounted for 2.16 billion Swiss francs (approximately $2.17 billion) in sales in 2018. Nestlé reached an agreement last year to sell Starbucks bagged coffee and tea beverages globally.
Is glycolin cancer-causing?
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, glyphosate is used in the cultivation of more than 100 food crops. Scientists from the Organic Food Industry Environmental Protection Organization said that the doses of chemicals contained in some popular breakfast cereals exceeded their prescribed safety doses for children.
Nevertheless, EPA said glyphosate is not carcinogenic and does not pose a threat to public health. Environmental Protection Agency said in a statement in April that ecological risks include the harm caused by pollinating insects and the problem of herbicide resistance.
But that didn't stop thousands of people from suing Monsanto, who claimed that contact with Nonda caused them or their loved ones to get cancer.
Earlier this year, a jury ruled that Baylor paid $2 billion in damages to a couple in California who claimed to have used NoNoD for more than 30 years on their property and had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma for four consecutive years. Baylor is appealing the ruling.
A 2015 study by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer found that glyphosate may cause cancer in humans based on limited evidence of human carcinogenesis and evidence from animal experiments that glyphosate is a carcinogen. However, a joint panel composed of WHO and UN Food Organization subsequently determined that glyphosate had a lower risk of carcinogenesis through diet.
A man was sentenced to death in Texas for killing his ex-wife and six family members.
A Utah man was convicted Thursday in Texas of murdering his ex-wife and six family members, and could face the death penalty.
A Harris County jury ruled that Ronald Hasker, 39, was found guilty of killing six members of the Sta family in July 2014: parents Stephen Sta and Katie Sta, 13-year-old Brian, 9-year-old Emily, 7-year-old Rebecca and 4-year-old Zach.
Harris County District Attorney Kim Og said in a statement: "We thank the jury for their attention to every piece of evidence in the case over the past few weeks. There is no doubt that Haskell carefully planned and implemented the actions to kill the entire Sta family".
Police said Haskell was traveling from California to Spring, a suburb of Houston, where he ambushed his ex-wife's sister, husband and five children at home.
The Sta and their four children were shot in the back of the head, and the fifth child, aged 15, survived the ordeal. The teenager Cassidy was hit in the head by a bullet and made a death escape.
Prosecutors demanded the death penalty for his murder, but the jury will decide whether Hasker should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.
According to KPRC, a Houston-based subsidiary of National Broadcasting Corporation, during the interrogation, the defense argued that Haskell was mentally unstable and heard voices that led him to kill the six people. He nodded after the verdict was read on Thursday.
According to the TV station, Doug Durham, one of Haskell's defense lawyers, said: "I think he could be heavily punished as expected. He realized that this was the most likely outcome".
The sentencing process began on Monday. Haskell's defense lawyer, Neil Davis III, said his team will work to save him once and for all. This is our job, according to KPRC.
According to the TV station, the sentencing process is expected to last about two and a half weeks.
Cassidy testified in court, and her family was present. According to KPRC, she appeared to be praying before her guilty verdict was announced on Thursday.
At a memorial service for her family in 2014, Cassidy thanked the support of all sections of society and said that her parents, two brothers and two sisters were in heaven and that one day she would see them again and that she was happy.
Haskell disguised himself as a Federal Express courier driver when he went to Stacy's house, apparently to find his ex-wife, Katie Stacy's sister.
Police said he forced his way in and tied Cassidy up. Minutes later, when her family returned, Hasker tied them up and demanded to report the fall of her ex-wife. They said they did not know that they were all shot in the back of the head.
Cassidy remained dead after being wounded until Haskell left and was able to identify him to the police. She told the police that he was planning to drive to her grandparents' house to kill them. But the police tracked down Haskell and after 20 minutes of police chase and three hours of confrontation, he was arrested.
Scotland banned smog products and e-cigarette advertising given the US mortality rate
Ministers are considering banning e-cigarettes and smog products.
The Chief Minister has confirmed that the initiative will be discussed in the coming months.
Nicola Stegkin said that her government would act without hesitation if there was evidence to support further action against the sale of such products.
Meanwhile, reports said that diseases related to smog products have claimed two more lives, bringing the death toll to 11.
Smog products - a mixture of nicotine, water, solvents and spices used for smoking - are considered to be a substitute for smoking and can help quit smoking, but their safety has not been fully established.
But in the United States, more than 500 people have a mysterious lung disease caused by e-cigarettes. Officials said that hundreds of new cases have been reported in the past week alone.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, Florida and Georgia announced the first cases of death. Currently, 38 states have reported cases of this disease, of which 8 have deaths.
While most patients reported using products containing four liters of cannabis - a psychoactive compound in cannabis - the deaths in Georgia on Wednesday were reported as a single heavy smoking of smogged cannabis.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more than 100 officials investigating the cause of the mysterious disease and warned citizens not to smoke e-cigarette products, especially those that have been renovated or bought by street vendors until they have more knowledge.
After the deaths caused by smog products, the Chief Minister confirmed that the Scottish Government was closely monitoring developments in the United States and elsewhere.
She pointed out that so far, they have not seen any reports of deaths from smog products in Europe.
"We are cautious, so in Scotland we have adopted the most stringent regulation method in Europe for smog products", she said.
The European Tobacco Products Directive restricts the advertising of e-cigarettes and ensures that e-liquids do not contain known harmful ingredients.
The directive also limits the concentration of nicotine in e-cigarettes.
In Scotland, we have also launched a retail registration and mandatory age verification scheme and funded trade standards departments in all parliamentary areas to ensure retailers comply with regulations.
In the coming months, we will consult on the advertising and promotion of a comprehensive ban on smog products.
She added: "It is important to emphasize that we all remember that these devices are relatively new products, so we should continue to study their effects. We do not fully understand what this effect is, so we should take a very cautious attitude.
Oh, that may be one reason why e-cigarettes are not yet popular in Scotland.
"We continue to take all necessary steps based on the best evidence to ensure that potential harm to people is avoided".
"While we have implemented the strictest management system for these products, if there is evidence that further action is needed... we will act without hesitation".
Cambodian court accuses political exiles of rebellion
A Cambodian court has accused seven senior opposition leaders of plotting an armed insurgency that aims to end self-exile and seek regime change through mass peaceful protests.
The Qingdao City Court also warned that anyone who supports the Cambodian opposition party overthrowing the government plan could face long prison terms.
If convicted, opposition leaders ending their exile could be sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison, and their supporters could be sentenced to 5 to 10 years in prison. Citing Justice Department spokesman Kim Ma-lin, even attending rallies or expressing support online could be considered a conspiracy to overthrow the government.
The political struggle has been escalating since opposition leader Sanlansi announced plans to end more than three years of exile and return to his homeland on November 9 in a bid to restore democracy to the country. The court on Thursday alleged that the latest round of the political struggle will be launched.
November 9 is Cambodia's Independence Day, and Cambodia broke away from French colonial rule in 1953.
Earlier this week, Sanlansi tweeted: "I will continue to call on the Cambodian people and armed forces to oppose the Hun Sen regime until the Hun Sen regime restores the opposition's right to participate in the political life of the country, including real elections".
Last year, the pre-election court dissolved the opposition party in Sanlansi to ensure that Hun Sen continued to rule more authoritatively for 40 years.
Opposition parties had been keen to launch a powerful election challenge in July 2018, which was widely seen as politically motivated, and the ruling Cambodian People's Party, led by Hun Sen, feared losing the election.
The Hun Sen government seems to be upset by the opposition leader's planned return to Thailand, although this seems impractical, and Sanlansi called for the return of large numbers of Cambodian workers in Thailand with him.
Officials vowed to arrest him as soon as he arrived in Cambodia, but there was speculation that Cambodia might simply prevent him from entering, and that if airlines were formally informed of the ban, Sanlan would be banned from boarding planes flying to Cambodia. Neighbouring countries are also unlikely to allow Sanlan to enter Cambodia from their territory.
However, the government has stepped up the arrests of supporters of Sanlansi, and there are reports that opposition organizers have recently been attacked personally.
In late 2015, Sanlansi was sentenced to two years in prison for criminal defamation and was exiled abroad to escape prison. After that, the local government filed other legal actions against Sanlansi.
In late 2017, in the midst of the crackdown on all those opposing the Hun Sen regime, opposition co-founder Gensoka was arrested and other senior members of the party were exiled abroad. Gensoka was charged with treason for establishing ties with a pro-democracy organization in the United States and is currently under strict lockdown.
This year's Turner Prize nominees will be exhibited at Maggate starting tomorrow, and the UK's Brexit agenda will be put forward.
Colombian artist Oscar Murillo's work, The Social White Barrier, depicts people gazing at the North Sea, but looking at the North Sea and across the European continent, is obscured by a black canvas, which only reveals a small part of the distance through a slope on the canvas.
The work is one of four nominations, and is an annual art prize established in 1984 for artists born in the UK or UK but living elsewhere.
Curator Fio Napari explained that Murillo's work focuses on the current political and socio-economic situation in Britain. The group of paper dolls represents the globalized workforce, while the black cloth represents the dark moments of the present British and global society.
She added: "I think it's a broader sense of obscuring the view, which actually means obscuring any distance view. There is also a posture of obscuring the light. But I think there is still a line of hope, a slope on the canvas, and you can see the sea on the horizon".
Meanwhile, Helen Cammock's video work, with a long note, explores the neglected role of women in the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland, which began in 1968 in Dreyfuss, London. The work also deals with the broader global class, racial and gender struggles of the late 1960s.
All works will be on display at the Turner Contemporary Gallery in Maggett from September 28 to January 12, 2020, and the 2019 Turner Prize winners will be announced at the awards ceremony on December 3.
The prize is named after the 19th century British landscape painter Joseph Malod William Turner, who dedicated his life to Grayson Perry, Damien Hirst and his twelve years as a slave to director Steve McQueen.
The man confessed to the details of the abduction and torture of the plastic surgeon and the abuse he carried out
A man in Florida admitted to kidnapping a plastic surgeon and abusing him with a flashlight in a blackmail.
According to the Sun Sentinel newspaper, Justin Boscio, 34, confessed Thursday to the details of the kidnapping and conspiracy of the surgeon who was attacked in January, whose identity has not yet been made public.
Boscio's lawyer, Kenneth Langer, said his client was involved in the kidnapping under the guise of fellow defendant Serge Corina, who will be extradited from the Spanish island of Tenerife.
According to court documents, the surgeon was abducted and pushed into a van by a man with weapons while leaving the Walmart store. After several hours of torture, he returned to his car in a coma. The video surveillance of the event was captured. Investigators said Corinna's wife was once a client of the surgeon.
The British Parliament for the second time refused to hold an early general election
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was again frustrated with pushing for early British elections.
The Speaker of the House of Commons said that it was not possible to vote before 31 October, the planned date for the UK to leave the EU.
This is the second meeting of the Parliament since the Supreme Court ruled that the general election was unlawful.
Meanwhile, the EU's chief negotiator, Michael Banir, said the EU was still waiting for new plans from the UK.
The United States sent troops to Saudi Arabia and deployed air defense systems to stop Iranian attacks
U.S. officials announced Thursday that the United States is sending a patriotic missile force, four ground radar systems and 200 support troops to Saudi Arabia to curb Iran's increasingly aggressive actions.
The Pentagon said that if necessary, a SDF missile defense system and two other Patriot missile forces were ready.
Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said: "Other countries in the region have called for attention to Iran's situation, and we hope they contribute to international cooperation to strengthen Saudi defence forces".
Last week, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that more troops would be deployed to the Middle East as a defensive measure to help defend against attacks from Iran.
Espar said the deployment was the first step towards addressing Iran's increasingly violent actions in the region, including the drone strikes on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities this month, and he called on other countries to step up the action and condemned the attacks.
Iran-backed Yemeni Houthi rebels claim responsibility for the September 14 attacks on the world's largest oil refinery and an important oil field, but the United States and Saudi Arabia directly condemn Iran. Iran denies any connection to the attack.
The weapons used were Iranian-made, not launched from Yemen, Mr. Espar said Friday, pointing out that all signs suggested that Iran was responsible for the attack.
The purpose of deploying troops and resources is to send out clear messages that the United States supports our partners and provide free flow of resources, Esparta said.
The Secretary of State said the United States called on other countries to stand up and condemn the attacks and contribute their strength.
Megan McCallum was never invited back to the Golden Gate Lawyer.
Alan Corbett, the founder of the Golden Lawyer Theatre, said that his mother never invited Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, to return to the play, and that Rachel Zann was a guest star in the grand finale.
After the grand finale of the Golden Lawyer Show aired in the United States, Cortez was asked in an interview with the Hollywood News Frontline of the United States whether it was possible for him to invite the former resident actor to the grand finale.
"Now that we have finished shooting the big ending, I can tell you", said Mr. Korser.
I thought about inviting her, and I thought about using audio material (and we had to think of a way to do that), but in the end I didn't say anything because I felt I wanted to respect her new life and not put her in the position where she had to be invited.
"Oh, we decided not to let her get into that situation, so I never opened my mouth".
In the grand finale of the Golden Lawyer's Tale, the Duchess of Sussex appears in the Montagne picture.
Megan played Rachel Zann in the New York-based legal drama from 2011 until her last episode aired last year.
In the final season of her role, Rachel's husband Mike Ross (played by Patrick Johns Adams) visited her from Seattle and asked about her recent condition.
"If I told you how good she was, you probably wouldn't believe me", he replied.
Bit Bull Dogs Killed by Serpent Bites to Protect a Florida Boy
A man in Florida said that his 8-month-old home bull dog Zeus was bitten to death by a snake to protect several of his sons.
Gary Richardson told WOFL TV that his home in Sumter County, Florida, was where a few of his sons were cleaning Zeus' water dishes outside their house on Monday when a venomous coral snake came up to them. Richardson said the children did not see the snake at the time, but the dogs saw it and attacked the snake.
According to Richardson, the snake bit Zeus four times. Although Zeus was rushed to the vet, he died the next day after the attack.
Germany reports a symptomatic case of the Nile virus
The authorities reported that the first human case of the Nile virus transmitted by mosquitoes occurred in Germany, and climate change has clearly accelerated the spread of the virus.
The German National Center for Disease Control and Tropical Medicine said Friday that the patient had contracted cerebral palsy but had recovered after being treated in hospital.
The Nile virus originated in Africa, but has spread northward through migratory birds and mosquitoes. In recent years, there have been several outbreaks in southern and central Europe. Cases have also been confirmed in most parts of the United States.
Jonas Schmidt Chanasett of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Bernhard-Nochter, Germany, said: "Climate change, the exceptional heat of summer over the past two years, has clearly accelerated the spread of the Sinir virus in the northern Alps".
Less than 1% of patients infected with the virus will develop dangerous meningitis or meningitis.
Radiation therapy skipping after prostate cancer surgery was effective
A major study found that men who underwent prostate cancer surgery were in good shape without radiation therapy.
The examination of patients receiving surgical treatment was the largest experiment to date, and the results could save thousands of patients from the painful treatment, which could also have painful side effects.
The Royal Masden Hospital conducted a study of 1,400 men receiving treatment for prostate cancer.
Half of the patients received immediate radiation therapy, which is the standard treatment method to prevent recurrence of disease so far. The rest of the patients were monitored and radiation therapy was given only when signs of recurrence of disease appeared.
Five years later, scientists found that the disease recurrence rates of the two groups of patients were almost no different, and those who did not receive radiotherapy were slightly better off.
The survival rate of the radiotherapy group without progress was 85% and the standard care group was 88%.
Given other factors, adjustments were made to the data, with the difference between the two groups being about 1%.
The study, funded by the UK Cancer Research Centre, found that patients receiving radiotherapy were twice as likely to experience worsening of urinary incontinence as patients who did not receive radiotherapy. Urinary incontinence is one of the main side effects of prostate cancer treatment.
A year after the operation, 5.3% of patients receiving radiation therapy had worsened, compared to only 2.7% of patients receiving standard care.
The radio claimed that the host of the WWL radio program in Louisiana, Seuss Dunlap, threatened to prosecute anti-gay tweets, but the tweets were actually sent by him himself, and were similar to the case of Josie Smollett.
A radio host in New Orleans said he received an anti-gay libel tweet from the station's Twitter account. WWL host Seuss Danlap, an openly gay man, said Wednesday that he intends to sue the station's parent company for working in a hostile environment that has been anti-gay for years. A strange twist occurred Thursday, and the New Orleans Police Department said that Danlap received the same intimidation tweet not from someone else, but from Danlap's phone.
The controversial tweet was released earlier this month, and Danlap hosted his own show as usual. According to the BBC's WWL-TV report, the tweet was released the next day and he announced a holiday.
In a statement, Danlap said that 14 people had access to the WWL Twitter account. He claimed that he was not the only one using the account.
His lawyer Megan Kiefer said he decided to participate in the lie detection, thus dispelling speculation that he was the promoter. According to WWL-TV reports, Dunlap has not filed a lawsuit, but he said in a statement that it will be started soon.
WWL Radio is a subsidiary of Columbia Broadcasting Corporation News Radio, but is owned by Penguin Media. WWL Radio said in a statement that it had opened an investigation into the tweet and decided to hand it over to law enforcement officials. WWL Radio said in a statement that WWL had completed an investigation into the highly rude and unauthorized tweet issued by its Twitter account on September 10, which directly targeted Seuss Danra in a smear campaign.
We believe that the next appropriate step is to hand over the handling to the law enforcement department. The investigation is currently being carried out by the law enforcement department, and we are not comfortable commenting on the specific situation of the results of the investigation, LiuWL said in a statement.
The New Orleans Police Department opened their investigation into the tweet, and a police report on Thursday revealed a twist: The threat and libel tweet was allegedly sent from Danrap's private cell phone.
Radio host Seuss Danlap has said he has worked in a hostile and intimidating environment for years. He threatened to sue after claiming to have received anti-homophobia tweets sent from the radio's Twitter account.
According to NOLA.com, the WWL accused Dunlap of threatening the radio for money alone. The WWL claimed that the 35-year-old radio host said he would investigate the tweet and then claim over $1.8 million in damages. According to the police report obtained by NOLA.com, the WWL noted that Dunlap was facing personal financial problems when threatening to sue.
The allegations were made by Kevin Cassidy, senior vice president of WWL, and the attorney for its parent company, Penguin Communications. The police department is still trying to confirm the allegations, but has listed the case as potentially blackmailing. Louisiana defines blackmail as "the sending of threatening information to others in order to obtain anything of value".
Viola Davis plays Michelle Obama in the role of First Lady
Viola Davis said that playing Michelle Obama in the latest TV series made her feel nervous.
The 54-year-old actress spoke about her role as Michelle Obama in the American television series The First Lady, which aired on the Jimmy Kimmel Show on Thursday!
Davis said she met Michelle Obama, but didn't know if the former first lady knew she was playing the role.
"I'm nervous". I'm very nervous, "said Dave, "I don't care what else I did with my shirt - I won an Emmy, an Oscar, two Tony Awards - but if I messed up this time, the impact on me would be huge".
She joked: "It's like a mother you raised a really great child, but you messed up Michelle Obama".
However, Davis said she was confident in the script by screenwriter Aaron Curry. Davis and Curry will also serve as executive producers of the television series.
"Oh, I promise you, this script is great", said Dave, "I don't want to drive my people crazy".
In the first lady's episode, we explore the political and personal lives of the first ladies in American history. The first season focuses on Eleanor Roosevelt, Betty Ford and Michelle Obama.
In addition to the First Lady, Davis will also reunite with Dancer Washington in the black-and-white dance sequences of the Renée Theatre adaptation, in which Dancer Washington co-stars in the counterculture thriller.
I had to wear a fat suit, and Dave told host Jimmy Cammore, "Oh, I like this suit". I told them I wanted a very, very big [curse] and I wanted to look more mature.
Davis played Anna Rise Keating in the ABC series "Forever Out", which premiered on Thursday for its sixth and final season.
McMiller's death: A third man charged with drug trafficking
A third man has been arrested and charged with drug trafficking, which is linked to rapper Mack Miller's death from a drug overdose.
Steven Walter, who was suspected of selling fake fentanyl-containing coke pills, died unexpectedly last year from an overdose of cocaine, alcohol and potent opioids, and he owned fentanyl before his death.
Walter is accused of being the source of drugs for another man, Cameron Petit, who sold the drugs to Miller.
Ryan Revis, 36, who was arrested this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, and charged with running a walker for Walter, was the one who handed the drugs to Petit.
Walter was released from custody in 2005 for a drug case and is currently in detention.
Miller, who is from Pittsburgh and whose real name is Malcolm James Miles McCormick, spoke frankly about his depression and drug addiction in the lyrics, which won him some of the biggest fans in the hip hop scene.
He ended his two-year affair with Elena Grande in early 2018. After Miller's death, Elena posted a video of her love for him on her photo wall and launched a song Thank You, Next Song, which was a song that was deeply in love with Miller.
In recent years, some musicians have died from opioid abuse and overdose, Miller being one of them.
Prince died in 2016 after taking a fake drug containing fentanyl, which looked like a replica of the painkiller Vicodin.
In 2016, the guitarist of the trio, Matthew Roberts, also died of a drug overdose, his body containing fentanyl and cocaine.
Women don't hang a piece of paper on Walmart
In a Walmart supermarket in Mexico City, a woman accused of stealing into a store took extreme measures to prove herself innocent, standing in the supermarket without hanging a finger, causing the supermarket security to shut up.
Earlier this week, the Tepe AcquaMarma branch in Mexico City captured a picture of a supermarket security guard approaching the suspected woman, who was approaching the supermarket exit. However, when she was stopped, her reaction left the security silent.
The woman first took off her collar and then started to go out, but she may have felt that she was still too embarrassed to take off her shirt. After taking off her shirt, she left the supermarket with her clothes in her hand and was furious.
The identity of the naked shopper remains unknown, but it appears that after improvising on the strip show, the shopkeeper allowed her to leave the store.
Walmart has seen this strange phenomenon. In July, a surveillance camera at Walmart supermarket in the town of Westmefflin caught a woman in Pennsylvania unpacking a box of potatoes. The woman in the video was clearly drunk, she was accused of public indecency, drunkenness in public, property damage and disruption of social security, and quickly went red.
This week, another British man, Steve Whitehurst, was forced to stand naked in a supermarket after the supermarket discovered that he had an unknown swelling of the neck, so he had to expose himself to security. It turned out that he hadn't stolen anything at all.
I was born this way and I can't", Whitehurst told the Sun newspaper.
The West Bengal government plans to set up a museum in Iswa Pandra Vidya Sabagho
Karl answered:
The West Bengal government plans to set up a museum in the former residence of 19th century social reformer Iswara Pandra Vidyasagar in North Kolkata, where he spent the last years of his life, State Minister Patta Chatti said.
He said on Thursday that the museum will be built inside Vidya Saga's residence in Badurbagan district and will display photos and models that document Vidya Saga's life, covering the various periods from his birth in the village of Bil Singhpur in Paschim Medinipur district to his relocation to the northern residence in Kolkata.
In celebration of the 200th anniversary of the education and social reformer, Chatji, the Minister of Education, said this during an event after attending the opening ceremony of the Vidya Sabha Academy in Badulbha Ganga.
The minister also released two books during the event: The Amid Vidya Sagat and the Choteod Vidya Sagat.
Some of the items used by Vidya Saga will be moved from the dust-filled storage room and placed in the museum for public viewing.
He said that this would help contemporaries understand the famous man who waged a war against the oppression of women and encouraged widows to remarry.
Mr. Chatji said that the Ministry of School Education and Higher Education will organize a workshop during the one-year event, focusing on Vidya Sagha's life and work in schools and colleges.
Listing other activities that the institute will be carrying out, Mr. Chatji said that a collection of Vediyasagha's works, which is not known until now, will be published.
Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee recently announced that Vidya Saga will be built in the birthplace of Bilsinhapur village as an educational tourism center.
Vidya Saga College erected a bronze statue of Vidya Saga on Thursday.
The people who oppose Vidya Saga's social reforms have destroyed his half-body image, which is housed in the institute that bears his name, the Minister said.
In May, during a road performance by the chairman of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Amit Shah, the semi-image of the social reformer was destroyed.

The Confucius Institute of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Cambodia unveiled the Chinese Chinese Language Symbols competition in my heart
The 26th Chinese Language Symbol Competition, which was dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the new China, was unveiled and awarded at the Confucius Institute of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Cambodia.
The award was presented to the guests by Chinese diplomats in Cambodia, including Zhang Zhang, representative of the General Council of the Governorate of Cambodia, and Chairman of the Jiangxi Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, Zhang Zhiang.
According to Chaik Qing, Chinese Director of the Confucius Institute of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Cambodia, during the two-month calendar, the contest was open to Cambodian elementary school students, secondary students (including postgraduates) and university students (including social workers).
Chinese Embassy Diplomat Zhang Feng presented the prize certificate to the first prize winner of the university group, Lin Wei, and the first prize winner of the secondary school group, Guorina.
Chaik Chin said that the entries were conducted separately by university group and primary school group, inviting senior Cambodian Chinese experts to form a review committee, and through the first, second and final evaluation, the final selection was made for the university group first prize 1, second prize 2, third prize 3, best prize 10, second prize 1 and second prize 5, third prize 10 and best prize 20.

The guests and the winners are shown.
Guorina, winner of the first prize in the junior class, said that as an overseas Chinese, it was a different thrill to have the opportunity to express the emotions of Chinese Chinese in their hearts and win the prize through the words of their homeland.
The organisers said that the contest not only created a positive atmosphere in the relationship between China and Cambodia, but also attracted more and more Cambodian students to learn Chinese and study in China.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a report on 26 November that Iran has started using advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of uranium enrichment, further violating the 2015 nuclear agreement with the world powers.
The IAEA report notes that advanced centrifugal pumps at Iran's Natanz Nuclear Facility are accumulating or are ready to accumulate uranium enrichment.
Since US President Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal last May and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran has been gradually violating the restrictions on the 2015 nuclear deal with the superpower.
The agreement stipulates that Iran can only refine the aluminum with the first generation IR-1 centrifuge.
Other signatories to the agreement, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have tried to save the agreement, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
According to the Japanese Joint Agency, on the afternoon of 25th, Japanese Foreign Minister Maumimi Fujimoto held a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in New York, where he confirmed that he would advance peace treaty negotiations including territorial issues including the four northern islands (Japan disputed islands, Japan called the Northern Four islands, China called the Northern Four islands, China called the Nanjing islands, China called the Northern Four islands) and develop relations between the two countries in broad fields such as politics and economics. Both sides agreed to coordinate Maumimi's visit to Russia as soon as possible.
This is the first time Maouji has been in charge of negotiations for a peace treaty with Russia since he took office as foreign minister.
Maumou told the Russian side that the agreement included the promotion of joint economic activities in the Northern Four Islands and hoped to effectively enter into consultations.
According to the Japanese government, the talks were held to discuss the territorial issues in detail.
At the summit of Japan and Russia in December 2018, the foreign ministers of the two countries confirmed the approach to accelerate negotiations as the head.
During the meeting, the foreign ministers of the two countries welcomed the progress made in consultations on joint economic activities in the field of tourism and waste disposal.
Maouji expressed his hope for the tourism tourism pilot business, which is scheduled to be implemented in October: "I hope that it will be successfully implemented and promote the next step".
In addition, the talks confirmed that Lavrov will be visiting the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting in November in Nanking.
Tōiōnoa was elected as the new Prime Minister of Tonga.
News from Nuku Alofa: The Parliament of Tonga, the South Pacific island nation, elected the current Minister of Finance and National Planning, Bocheva Tuio-Onota, as the new Prime Minister of Tonga on the 27th, replacing former Prime Minister Akilis Bocheva, who died of illness earlier this month.
According to the MATANGI website of the main media in Tonga, the Parliament of Tonga operates a single-party system, consisting of 26 members.
In the parliamentary vote on the day, Tuyoneto won 23 votes in favour, defeating his rival, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Infrastructure and Tourism, Semisi Sikka, and was elected successfully.
The country is a monarchical constitutional state, implementing a system of administrative, legislative and judicial separation.
Tōiōnoa also had to accept the king's appointment.
The next parliamentary election in Ghana will be held in 2021.
Women's volleyball is expected to defend the World Cup in advance!
On 27th, in the match against the Dutch women's team, the Chinese team was defeated by their opponent in a two-game win, and finally won the Netherlands 3-1, bringing the team to nine wins.
The World Cup is coming to an end, and while the defence is in sight, the Chinese women's team is still not going to take it easy against Serbia.
The Chinese women's team performed strongly in the first two rounds against the Netherlands, with the two cities leading 25:19, 25:16 respectively, until the third round, the team faced setbacks.
The Dutch women's team strengthened the offensive position of the ball in the back, the Chinese team was hit, and the girls attacked with passion, mistakes began to increase, and finally the opponent was taken back to the city at 21:25.
In an interview, the runner-up also pointed out: "The third leg, because of the mistake, we sent about 8 points.
Of course, the strength of the Dutch women's team was not enough, and the Chinese women's team prepared well before the tournament, although they lost one innings, but everything was still in the hands of Luo Ping.
In the fourth innings, the team members actively adjusted the situation, Zhang Zhenning was fully engaged in the offensive, and the single innings scored 8 points, giving the team a victory.
The 11 rounds of the match are now two rounds away, and although one hand has touched the trophy, the alarm was sounded against the Dutch team: the more critical the moment, the more effort should be made.
In another match on the 27th, the Russian and American women's teams played five innings, and the US team failed to score three points from their opponent, so the Chinese women's team could only score three points in the match against Serbia to achieve the defence one round ahead.
All sorts of things are developing in a way that is favorable to Chinese women.
However, although the Serbian team is missing a number of main players, this does not mean that they will easily pass three points to the Chinese team.
From the current scoreboard form, the Serbian team is basically medal-free, which means they can easily put on a stand against the Chinese women's team, putting down their pack and hitting the opponent with all their might, while the Chinese team bears the pressure to win the title, and the situation may turn upside down instead.
In addition, the substitute Serbian team was not the lamb that was slaughtered, and in the first game against the Dutch team, the Serbian team ended up 3:2 reversing the Dutch all-power lineup, which shows the depth of their lineup.
Before the third stage, Luoping also said that both teams were not good against: "The game in Osaka will be very difficult, but we must be prepared as before and seriously".
Today the crown's trumpet has sounded, and the race has really entered the phase of the white-hot.
The strength-based lineup, the Chinese women's team, is above the competition, but only the last straw, and it is also important to see if the girls can play at a normal level and release themselves as much as possible on the field.

In a speech at the US Military Academy at West Point, Stoltenberg said: "For 70 years, NATO's containment and defense measures have been based on maintaining technical advantages.
He said, but the times are changing.
Stoltberg said: "The competition we face is getting fiercer.
So we should double our efforts now to make sure that no one is better than us.
He said: "Some of the new technologies were developed not by NATO member states but by authoritarian states.
Chinese companies are researching 5G networks.
Russia is developing an independent Internet and investing heavily in developing the next generation of weapons, such as supersonic missiles.

On September 24, Liu took me with a boat ticket to see the Liu Love Heart Support event held in Yangtze, Guangzhou, where more than 100 disabled people from Yangtze were invited to board the Star Cruise of Yangtze, to appreciate the lush scenery of Jiang and to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
The more than 100 disabled people who participated in the event were mostly on the cruise for the first time.
56-year-old Zhang Zhang is a crippled man who rarely goes out because of the difficulty of moving his legs.
He said: "Today, for the first time, I took a cruise, and I was so excited and unforgettable to see the booming waves of Zhejiang, feel the developmental pulse of the Yangtze River.
Volunteers from the Fokkon Social Workers Service Center and Blue Sky Rescue Team in Changsha provided minute services to the disabled.
Volunteers will take them on the next cruise, especially for those who are seriously disabled.
The relevant head of the Foccon Social Work Services Center said that in the past 70 years, with the support of the party and the government, the work of people with disabilities in Changsha has progressed, and more and more people with disabilities have become truly participants, contributors and beneficiaries of socio-economic development, and concern for helping people with disabilities and concern for supporting disability work has also become a general social consensus.
The 70th anniversary of the Republic is coming, the street media flashes lights, so many images that we don't remember much about, flashing brightly. They are the ones who, for our bright days, silk brings heat energy, brings light source ...
However, if the hero walks around, he seems as ordinary as you are.
Zhonglongping, underwater water and water research, cultivating good varieties of farming in the land, so that tens of billions of people will no longer have hunger and thirst, and this is like an old farmer who likes to head in the fields; Nan Ren Dong, the chief scientist who tried hard to make China angry, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one thing only do in one life, in the deepest part of Guangzhou, frozen head in the mountains, and old man in the Zhiong; Zhongyu, the red scientist, a blind village boy, old still like Red child, learning to the West, on top of a messy white head, learning to understand the heart, like to laugh; and, the artist of the red-haired film, who has been working for nine nights and six nights in the high school
They, seeking to be kind, live plainly, simply and persistently, and it is easy to get well as they are, as long as they are immersed in the unintelligible foreigners and they are busy in their own business, without regard to the name of the rich and noble.
Like in the novel Kim Jong-il, the Tao Ling Temple is a Tibetan Buddhist monk who, despite his worldly martial arts skills, is not happy or sad.
Every monk in the village of Sasai, every red kid, has a home country behind him.
The home country is responsible not only for the hero's shoulders but also for the hearts of millions of people.
Once, a high school student was turned crazy by netizens. "When the hero passes by, there is always someone sitting by the street cheering... I don't want to be a hero, I want to be the one sitting by the street cheering".
In fact, when heroes and heroes applaud, it is not contradictory.
Those who cheer along the way also transmit heat and light, and they themselves are also light emitters.
Ordinary people like you and me, there are always opportunities in life, there are moments, there is a sunset, and it is shaping the hero.
Shanghai's excellent judge Liu Hua, who is in charge of judicial reform, but at the annual meeting, the media room teacher Liu Liu told his story, received countless newspaper letters a year, from no fault, Liu did the simple thing, it is not simple. Liu Liu led the judges to give applause to this old-fashioned message of the monastery of the sweeping land.
It's a battle between heroes, one hero applauding another hero.
The Sawachi monks have the Tibetan Buddhist temple, the water-salt experimental field in the Yanglong Plain, the Nanjing Tong has the Sun-Tang eyes, the Yang has the stage, the Zhouyuan has the platform... ...can be a hero, not only on his own efforts, but better environment and a mechanism of positive motivation.
For example, China's Chinese eyelids, for example, now seem to be a myth.
In the 1990s, the Chinese tech community was still in a difficult climb, and novelist Liu Xiaoping had not yet started writing the three-volume manga.
The largest telescope of its time, the one-sided radiation telescope in the valley of the island of Puerto Rico, is the largest telescope in the world. The 350-meter diameter telescope is considered the best in the world that cannot exceed the diameter of the telescope.
The Chinese radiation telescope at the time was less than one tenth of a person's diameter.
While Nan Ren-dong, who enjoys world-class scientific research conditions and salary in Japan, insisted on returning home with an almost crazy idea: build a new generation of radiation-rich telescopes in China to receive more messages from outer space!
China is a waste of money, investing in the stars?
The country trusted Nanking Dong, and the project of the Tearful Rainbow Project started in a moment of turmoil.
The site took 12 years to complete, and the project took 9 years to complete.
With a capacity of 500 meters, China has done an unprecedented scientific project, one of the world's most unique.
So, the sky was shining, the South Koreans were standing tall, with a large and promising republic.
With the trust of the country, the goodwill of the people, the Yan Yan Yan have the opportunity to become the heart and soul of the people of the country.
There are young geniuses and white-haired heroes who walk by, and there are people who cheer lightly along the way, and such a country is beautiful and harmonious.
Garbage classification education is the first in the Jilin kindergarten.
On 27th, a kindergarten in the city of Jilin, Jilin Province, held a class on garbage classification, teaching children to distinguish between recyclable garbage and other categories of garbage.
It is reported that this is the first time that the garbage classification has been included in the local kindergarten class.
The day before, nine departments of Jilin province jointly launched a work programme to promote the classification of municipal living waste in the province of Jilin.
Based on the pilot for compulsory sorting of living waste in Changchun City in 2019, the province decided to carry out the sorting of living waste in local cities.
The city of Jilin is one of them.
We hope that through this event, we will achieve the impact of families that are driven by children, and kindergarten that is driven by society, and we will advocate for the concept of environmental protection.
The executive director of the International Kindergarten of Phnom Penh, Li Li Liang, said that the event was organized.
On that day, the gardener read the Environmental Protection Initiative, hoping to classify garbage from children.
The children performed a low-carbon baby dance and then grouped up to play a garbage sorting game.
The instructor also issued recyclable garbage cans and other garbage cans labels, advising children to stick the labels to the trash can and record small videos when they get home.
Li Liang explained that the kindergarten has been advocating for the low-carbon, green environmental protection concept and regularly holds environmental lectures.
The garbage dumps within the park also have sorted trash cans, which are marked with a category of dumping.
Teachers teach children what is recycled trash.
According to preliminary statistics, the city of Jilin province generated about 546.52 million tons of municipal life waste in 2018, all of which went into the life waste treatment plant for treatment.
Among them, Sanitation has filled 329.29 million tons, burned 209.23 million tons, and adopted integrated processing of 801 million tons.
After years of efforts, the provincial municipalities and counties have the capacity to treat life waste harmlessly.
The project to promote urban living waste sorting in the provinces of Jharkhand, which has already been launched, specifically calls for the in-depth implementation of waste sorting activities in campus, in teaching materials, in classrooms, by creating songs, songs, cartoons, micro-video and other pieces of waste sorting, to strengthen interaction between students and parents, achieve the parenting of a child, influence a family, drive a community, and cultivate the effect of a new generation of newcomers.

Sales of the exclusive Chinese SUV CX-4 decreased by 14%.
The CX-4 was launched in 2016 for a longer period of time, and the new car's performance decreased.
The reduction in prices is also known to have a big impact on sales due to the strategy of increasing brand value in the long term.
Sales of Mazda in the United States increased by 7% compared to the same period, reaching 27,482 vehicles, 14 months later.
The salesman's business day in August was one more day than last year, and the promotion activities such as promotion promotion of the SUV and the CX-5 increased sales.

Hilak resigned and his political legacy survives
On 26 July, local time, former French president Hilaire Zengren passed away at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is in a state of change that has not been seen in a hundred years, the political legacy left by this French politician during his reign is still worthy of our praise.
He served as President of France for 12 years in a very personal manner.
He inherited the diplomatic spirit of the independent, de-Gaolist independence and was a strong supporter of European integration and a representative of the pursuit of the European dream.
At the same time, he was also a strong advocate of world polarization and multilateralism, and a politician with a strategic vision.
For this reason, the French media has praised him as the outstanding representative of France on the world stage.
One of the political decisions that made him happy was against the US-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France took Germany to the forefront of anti-war efforts to overcome American pressure.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the Iraq war would lead to increased terrorism and make the world more dangerous.
Later, it turned out that the warning of the Syrian government was correct.
In the midst of the unilateralism of the United States, which is increasingly prominent in the context of European integration, and in the wake of the past, Mr. Hiraq has undoubtedly had a strong influence on strategic thinking and choices in international politics and global affairs.
She was also a French politician who made Chinese feel familiar and friendly.
He was one of the advocates and creators of the Golden Decade of China-France relations, and after first being elected president of France in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of China-France relations with a strategic eye of politicians.
In 2004, China-France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and China-France bilateral relations entered a whole new phase.
During the reign of President Hilak, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly and the two countries made breakthrough progress in cooperation in various fields such as aviation, nuclear energy, rail transport.
The Chinese-French Cultural Year, the initiative of Hilac, created a completely new model of cultural exchange in French history.
His lifelong love of Chinese culture is particularly impressive.
According to his Chinese diplomats, he is known to be able to write some poems about Li Wei and Duo, and even accurately determine the historical date of Chinese bronzeware.
The pyramid is not really in Egypt, or China is not really in China.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Mr. Hilak said: "The West is concerned about China's political and social development, the ecological problems caused by China's economic growth and China's political position internationally.
But I am confident in China.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is enough to help it establish the ideals and values of achieving harmonious development and take on its responsibility on the world stage in the long term.
I also believe that China's revival will bring new creative energy to world culture and enrich world culture.
The Shia have gone, but the political legacy and revelation that Hilak left to the world will live on.

Hong Kong Special District Legislature members joined forces against the US-China Port Act
The members of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Legislature, who are part of the establishment, issued a statement on 27 April, expressing strong opposition to the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 by the House of Representatives Committee of the United States Congress.
The statement, made by the 40 members of the Constituent Assembly, said that Hong Kong's rights are currently granted by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Zone, including maintaining the status of a free trade port and separate customs zone in different fields such as economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, sports, and other areas, to promote China's Hong Kong reputation in the name of international trade, cooperation and development relations with different countries and regions around the world, and to sign and implement bilateral and multilateral agreements.
These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always strictly adhered to international agreements, international rules, legal and commercial ethics, and cooperated with various countries and regions in many relevant fields.
The statement said that the move by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs to pass the relevant bill was not necessary, but merely to respond to the call of its port of disaster agents, as a means of harshly intervening in Hong Kong's internal affairs and gaining political leverage for its agents in Hong Kong.
The constituency members deeply regret the move and strongly oppose the US's move.
The statement noted that Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the largest source of trade surplus.
Hong Kong's excellent rule of law, fair and free business environment, and clean society make it a good destination for American businessmen and entrepreneurs.
If the bill is passed, the United States will not only attack Hong Kong and its own interests, but also make China-US relations worse, without any benefit or harm.
The statement said Hong Kong will continue to exercise the two-state solution without hesitation, as it has always done, and continue to enjoy the rights granted by the Basic Law and effectively fulfill its obligations.
Hong Kong will continue to make its contribution to the international community and international trade, whether past, present or future.
According to the European Times, the French parliament will discuss immigration policy reforms next week.
French President Macron recently said that France cannot accept everyone's acceptance, but at the same time it must strive to accept it properly.
Macron is trying to find a middle ground on immigration issues, the report said, to slow down the impending debate shock.
Recently, Macron said in an interview in New York during the United Nations General Assembly debate that he hopes for a real two-tiered approach to immigration policy to strike a balance between humanitarian and efficiency.
Macron said: "If France wants to be able to properly accept immigrants, it cannot accept everyone".
Macron listed four priorities of immigration policy: granting asylum to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; more effectively promoting immigration integration; receiving and protecting all immigrants entering French territory; more effectively resettling those who entered France illegally and not staying.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the AME system is the topic of much discussion.
Macron said he hopes to be able to assess the system, but did not cancel it, but imposed certain restrictions on it.
Following Macron's remarks, Le Pen, leader of the far-right Nationalist Alliance, tweeted that Macron's expression was empty talk.
Right-wing Republican Senator Rachel also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a calm and calm but faced with reality and that Macron should be indirectly criticized.
The left-wing Socialist Party MP, Valau, believes that France should accept more and better immigration issues, and criticizes Macron's manipulation of immigration.
The report noted that the new version of the asylum and immigration law has been enacted for a year, which has led to internal disagreements within the ruling party, but at the same time has not appeased the right-wing opposition party.
In the next 2022 general election, the topic of immigration policy will once again be the focus of the far right, and Macron needs to do something about it, but he also risks anger from the left within the ruling party.
The French National Assembly House of Representatives is reported to debate immigration policy from September 30 and the Senate from October 2.
There are signs that Chinese A stocks are entering a boom in buy-back, and many listed companies have issued shares of the company.
According to financial data services provider Eastern Wealth, as of 27th, the total amount of the repurchase of publicly traded A-shares in 2019 has exceeded 100 billion yuan (Rwmen, below), far exceeding the same period data of the previous year, creating a new record high in the amount of the repurchase capital of A-shares.
In this regard, Xu Yang, Chairman of Shanghai MyKirong Information Consulting Limited, said that the overall valuation of the A stock market this year was low, and repurchasing shares at relatively low prices was conducive to improving the efficiency of using funds of listed companies, and reflected the willingness and abundant cash flow of the listed companies to actively manage market value, which was conducive to boosting investor confidence.
In addition, the constantly improving share buyback system has also encouraged the active share buyback of publicly traded companies.
For example, earlier this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued rules for the repurchase of shares of listed companies, providing detailed rules and guidance for the repurchase of shares of listed companies.
According to media statistics, the listed companies that have implemented the increase in buy-back plans since this year are mainly focused on the infrastructure industry, real estate industry, information technology industry and electronics manufacturing industry.
In addition, in terms of the amount of repurchase payments, six listed companies have repurchased over 1 billion yuan this year.
Among them, the first place was Eli's shares, which have been bought back for more than 5 billion yuan.
What effect will the buyback of shares of publicly traded companies have on the market?
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Xi Jinping, vice-dean of the Chinese People's University's School of Finance and Finance, said that the buyback shows that the listed companies have strong economic strength and a good financial situation, are able to maintain the stability of stock prices and give investors confidence; on the other hand, it also shows that the listed companies and their shareholders are responsible for the company, responsible for the market and responsible for the investors.
The former is based on good operating performance of the company, while the latter requires the higher quality of the listed companies and their shareholders.
For capital markets, these are the most fundamental elements.
The repurchase of shares of publicly traded companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence and supporting the price of shares of publicly traded companies.
According to the Oriental Securities Research Report, according to the expected number of share buybacks of the listed companies since the beginning of the year, and the average price of shares bought back, the increase in capital brought by shares bought back to the A stock market this year is expected to exceed 150 billion yuan.
Almost two months after the announcement, the National Center for Literature and Culture announced the completion of the monumental mural restoration work on the Tianjin Palace and the Tianjin Temple on the 26th, which will be reopened to the public during this year's National Day.
The Tōjō of the Sacred Treasure is a large traditional mural painting that fully reflects the life of our grandfather.
Approved by the relevant departments of the country, it was drawn by the curator of the Tianjin Citizen Folk Museum (Tangzhou Palace) Yang Quang from 1991 to 1994.
It is understood that the mural depicts more than 30 stories of the afterlife, the birth after the sun, the passage of the sea, the rise of the sky, and 358 characters who recreate the life of Grandfather.
In recent years, Tianjin's summer rains and dry winters have caused the wall paintings to crack, and the cracks account for 60% of the total wall painting volume.
In order to protect and rescue the wall paintings of the ancestors, the Committee on Ancient Cultural Streets and the Palace of Heaven in Tianjin City South Kuai District started restoration work on the Palace of Heaven and the wall paintings inside the palace.
The restoration project was undertaken by the Chief Minister, Quiao Liu, who invited four famous national painters to participate.
The restoration work was done in accordance with the principles of restoring the old as well as the old, while also making local adjustments to the original wall paintings, and supplementary restoration of the wall paintings where they were not so perfect.
In the repair, we also innovate and experiment with colors, materials, inks and so on.
After restoration, the style, spirituality, spirituality and artistic style of the original mural remained.
The Tianfu Palace, originally known as Tianfu Palace, built in 1326, and renovated several times, is the oldest building complex in Tianjin and one of the earliest surviving Chinese grand palaces.

Mawara suspends the November convention and plans to lower the party age to 16
Mawara suspended the Central Congress in early November, and proposed to amend the party's party chapter to lower the party age to 16.
As Congress passed the lowering of the voting age for general elections, Mawara announced the 66th Central Congress to be held this year, and proposed amendments to the party's chapter, including lowering Mawara's age to join the party from the current 18 to 16.
Chairman of the Mawara General Assembly, Naraduk Sri Chincheng said that the Mawara Central Committee was scheduled to convene the Central Congress on November 2 and 3, but due to the by-election of the Dhanbeei National Assembly seat, the date of the Congress may change.
He said that since the Election Commission will meet on October 1st to finalize the date of nomination and voting for the Dhanbhai State seat, they will meet the next day, October 2nd, to discuss whether to change the date of this year's Central Congress.
He also explained that the purpose of the meeting of the Central Committee yesterday (26th) was to finalize the date of the Congress and amend the party chapter, but the accidental illness of the Native Unity Party Dan Zhenbi Ai Congressman Naduch Mohamad Farai, which led to the addition of this agenda for the country's elections.
Shandong's Chairman of the Shandong Shuiyang County Commission, Wang Bershing, and Liuyang County, Fumen Kikuchi
Wang Bershing, Shandong Shu-sun, born February 1943, joined the work in 1967, and previously served as township party committee secretary, county committee secretary, and mayor.
In 1986, Wang Bershing served as secretary of the Suzhou County Commission in Shandong Province, which was then the poor county of Suzhou.
During the five years of his tenure, Wang Bershing-yeo has concentrated his efforts on three things: one to promote vegetable industrialization; two to develop the North Salt Lake plant; three to lay the foundation for the industry, so that the people of Shu Sheng-yeo can lift their pockets and stand up their waistbands.
The farmers of Sushong have a varied tradition and have learned lessons from varieties.
In the early 1980s, the crops harvested by the Shūshū farmers were not sold and were rotten in the ground.
Wang Berxia's research found that the key to grabbing vegetables is to get them out and circulate.
SUSU-SUN was the first to build a wholesale market for vegetables, and it opened the door to the development of a market economy.
The party cadres should lead, and the whole loss is in the county.
In 1989, 17 party members, including Yu Yuura Wang Liyi, started 17 winter-heated vegetable shelves with Wang Bershing's support, and the village raised 17 yuan for the family.
Subsequently, a promotion group was established in the county, and under Wang Bershing's motivation, Wang Li Yi toured and guided the towns; in the first year, more than 5,000 vegetable shelves were promoted, after which vegetable shelves such as the potato plant were promoted throughout the county and even throughout the country.
For thousands of years, the 1.6 million hectares of land in the north of Sushi, except for salt marshes, have been covered with ash marshes.
The lives of the local people are very difficult.
Sushi Nan has a vegetable shelf, Sushi Nan has a vegetable shelf.
Wang Berxi organized tens of thousands of people to fight the battlefield and camp in the desert for 45 days.
Wang Bershing and the leadership staff in the county ate all at work, driving the car like the civil servants, and the people saw them all reaching out their fingers and winking at them... At that time, Sushi North developed 150,000 ponds, 200,000 tonnes of salt fields, 600,000 tonnes of cotton fields, and developed a pool of salt to collect salt.
In July 1986, Wang Bershiang participated for the first time in the industrial conference of the city of Zhejiang as the secretary of the county commission.
During the meeting, a table of industrial economic figures for the 12 counties of the city of Zhejiang was released.
But if the raw salt is removed, the pure industrial output of SUS light is only 119 million yuan, ranking third in the negative.
Wang Berxiang, with a task force of more than 70 people, ran to the outside to change his mind.
Less than a year later, the entire county invested 150 million yuan and added 77 projects.
Every year after that, the group organized the collection of the rice, and the export to Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai.
SUSHU shortages enterprises, and more entrepreneurs.
Wang Bersiang hosted a conference with the theme of "The Chief Manager of the factory was publicly selected throughout the county, 40 talented people with a career mind stood out and were promoted to the front line of industry".
In 1991, Shu Shuo entered the list of the 100 best counties in the country, Wang Berxiang was appointed deputy mayor of Liuwei City.
He left over 200,000 vegetable shelves, 1.2 million tons of cotton fields, salt fields, salt ponds, 4,854 enterprises, more than 100,000 yuan households.
On September 26, local time, State Secretary and Foreign Minister Wang Yi hosted the Foreign Affairs Meeting of China and the African members of the Security Council in New York.
Foreign Ministers of Côte d'Ivoire, the current African Security Council member, Tanno, Foreign Minister of Equatorial Guinea, Foreign Minister of South Africa Pandor and Foreign Minister of Niger and Foreign Minister of Tunisia, Jenavi, the candidate member, attended the meeting.
Wang Xi proposed four recommendations to strengthen cooperation between the two sides in the Security Council.
First, by uniting forces.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, with the direct consequence that the basic norms of international relations are challenged, the role of the United Nations is impacted, and the interests of large developing and small countries, including African countries, are damaged.
To meet this challenge, it takes hand-in-hand, shoulder to shoulder, and unity to be strong.
At the Security Council, the three African countries spoke with one voice, focusing on the distribution of not just three votes, but the entire African continent.
China and Africa stand together, not only with four votes, but will move other countries to follow, influence and shape the agenda of the Security Council.
Since 2018, China and the African members of the Security Council have established a coordination mechanism of 3+1 to make full use of this coordination mechanism.
Second, dispute resolution through consultation.
China has always advocated political solutions to hotspots, Africa has a good tradition of consultation, and Africa has had success in spinning regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex problems in the conference process, especially the African hotspots, were largely the root cause of colonialism, and some were directly related to external factors.
We will work together to use Chapter VI of the UN Charter to play the role of the UN in mediation and mediation.
Third, self-empowerment is self-sufficient.
African countries and people know the problems of Africa best, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
When addressing the issue of Africa's hotspots, the Security Council should focus on listening to and respecting Africa's will, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support intrinsic solutions from Africa.
China is willing to strengthen coordination with non-African countries and firmly advance capacity building for autonomous peaceful action in Africa.
Fourth, development is the foundation of governance.
China and the wider African countries are developing countries, and we must insist on putting economic and social development first and support each other in their own paths of development.
China is willing to work together to build a Belt and Road Initiative with the African Union Agenda 2063, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the development strategies of African countries, helping African countries to strengthen their development capacity and eliminate the root causes of conflict.
Together, we will promote the United Nations' increased contribution to Africa's development.
The Ebola outbreak has erupted again in Congo, and China has and will continue to provide all its resources, human and material assistance, and is willing to coordinate with African countries, mobilize the United Nations, WHO and others to increase aid capacity to play the role of the UN mission to stabilize Congo.
The efforts of neonatologists to save small lives.
It's scary!
A second pregnancy came on prematurely, and on the rush to the hospital, a 32-week-old premature baby was born in the back seat of his father's car.
Fortunately, the obstetricians and neonatologists treated the baby in time and saved the life of this little girl.
Coincidentally, on 19, 20 and 21, the obstetrics and gynecology department of Hubei Province's Women's and Children's Health Center diagnosed three premature babies on the road for three consecutive days, and two others were born in 120 ambulances, all 29 weeks premature.
Ms. Chen, a second-term pregnant mother, felt a bit of a stomach ache at 7am on September 19, thinking she was 32 weeks pregnant and her first pregnancy was premature, and she packed up the products to wait for, preparing to wash the dishes and go straight to the hospital.
After 9:30 pm, Ms. Chen packed up properly and let her husband drive from Xu Dong's home to the hospital.
I had no idea that the car had just opened the door and the baby couldn't wait to be born in his father's car.
After 20 minutes, Ms. Chen and her baby finally arrived at the maternity ward of Hubei Provincial Women's and Children's Health Center.
Hospital security saw the panicked couple and baby, and immediately notified the maternity ward, and four doctors and midwives, including Deputy Director Dr Zhang Chei, rushed downstairs with the delivery bag and the ribbon plate.
The mother was half-lived in the car's co-driver, with sheep water and blood water underneath her, and a baby boy was next to her, still wearing a belt.
Zhang asked if the baby was born 32 weeks early, the parents had not been able to cover the package on the way, the early autumn morning was already cold, his skin was bleached, there was no crying, his limbs were soft.
Zhang rushed to the assistant driver to give the baby a treatment belt, and Zhang drilled in from the cockpit, quickly opened the product pack, packed the baby with a therapeutic towel and a wrap inside the product pack to keep him warm several layers, and cleaned the baby's breathing passage (see picture) and then carried the baby up to the newborn ward on the 12th floor.
The newborn pediatrician immediately rushed to the nursing station to rescue the premature baby.
The baby's face was purple, choking oxygen deficiency, and the doctor immediately gave him a tube, and in less than a minute, the baby regained heartbeat, and the skin color gradually regained redness, and the recovery was successful.
After being admitted to hospital, the 32-week-old baby was given a breathing apparatus, and after continuous rescue, breathing was stable, and the next day the respirator was successfully removed.
After a week of treatment, the baby's vital signs are stable, breathing is difficult, and she has started to breastfeed.
It happened that on the 19th, 20th and 21st, the hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department treated three children who were born prematurely on the road for three consecutive days, and two others were born in 120 ambulances, all 29 weeks premature, and are currently actively treated in the newborn ward.
Son Kang-yong, director of obstetrics at the Provincial Institute of Women and Youth Health, explained that in recent years, many babies born on the subway and in private cars have been diagnosed in the province, and this situation could be treated poorly and could threaten the life of the mother.
Son Director reminded that pregnant women should be immediately admitted to hospital if they experience abdominal pain, breakage of water, redness and other symptoms.
If you are at home or on the road, the mother should make sure that the bed is as flat as possible, she can put blankets under the mattress, etc. to prevent the baby from giving birth to the back of the head, the child should be immediately warmed up after giving birth and taken to the doctor as soon as possible.

Wuhan promotes the smart transformation of industrial enterprises, giving a maximum of 20 million yuan in grants
The reporter learned from the press office of the Wuhan Municipal Government at the Xiongjiang Zhuang New China Celebration Xiongjiang City Series conference held on 27th that since this year, the city has accelerated the advancement of industrial smart transformation and implemented transformation subsidies up to 20 million yuan.
So far, information on the needs of intelligent transformation has been collected from more than 800 industrial enterprises of scale.
Zhang Red, Deputy Director of Wuhan City Economic and Information Administration, explained that this year, Wuhan launched the Intelligent Enterprise Transformation Action Plan, offering free consulting diagnostic services and solutions to large industrial enterprises in demand, and promoting a new round of high-level enterprise technology transformation.
According to the plan, Wuhan City will openly screen out a group of specialized diagnostic services every year, and conduct smart transformation needs surveys for industrial enterprises of all sizes throughout the city, through open columns, questionnaires, and door-to-door filings.
So far, more than 800 industry standards have been collected to understand the needs of smart transformation, accounting for nearly one third of the industry enterprises of the entire market size.
Five city-wide diagnostic platforms have organized teams into enterprises, carrying out one-on-one on-site evaluation and program argumentation.
Zhang Red said that the city is currently organizing 373 projects for the transformation of smart technologies, with a total investment of 29760 million yuan, the first 5G smart production line in China, Motorola's leading smart phone production line in China, Wuhan's Siemens transformers digital factory without artificial man, Astronomical Engineering's first bulk satellite production line in the country, the leading new veterinary medicine in the world, the smart home IoT smart production line in Europe, and other smart workshops and smart factories in the industry.
In addition, Wuhan City has increased financial support for the project of smart transformation.
These include investments in industrial enterprises that have been made smart and transformed, which are actually completed; including investment in equipment hardware and R&D software, which gives 8% and a maximum of 20 million yuan for transformation subsidies.
At the same time, financial institutions such as joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, and Wuhan branches are actively providing personalized financial services specifically targeted at the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises, greatly alleviating the pressure of corporate financing.
Trudeau's plan to collapse is that he can be reelected.
This time, Trudeau dug a crater with a crater that was a little bit of a hole in the head.
Recently, Canadian media have uncovered several old photographs of the current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which Trudeau disguises himself as a black man.
This is considered a clear act of racial discrimination, which has sparked a wave of outrage in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, Canadians are not able to afford bills.
Trudeau is the one who lifted the stone and set his feet.
As political commentator Riley and others pointed out, since the rise of the anti-black face movement in the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been vocal in accusing opposition or dissenting parties within the party of losing their party in this regard, and repeatedly advocating that anyone who makes this mistake should be fired immediately.
Simply put, this time, the Trudeau dug out a crater with a crater that was a little bit of a hole in the head.
Trudeau was the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, a handsome young man who had just started out as a political idol.
Originally a political amateur, he fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the 2015 Canadian federal legislative election after taking over as leader of the federal Liberal Party.
At the time, Trudeau put forward many deafening policies and ideas, such as ethnic and gender equality, environmental protection, economic revitalization, and stressing the eradication of corruption and inequality.
However, in his five years in power, he has been a snake in almost all of the above aspects, and he has been a high-and-low-comer.
He was not particularly vocal on a series of issues related to indigenous people, aside from the issue of ethnic and gender equality, which led indigenous groups and leaders to move the protest tent to the front door of the Capitol Hill on the 150th anniversary of Canada's founding.
In the fight against corruption, Trudeau was involved in the heated Jinan-Wanin scandal at the end of last year and early this year.
It was revealed that the construction engineering company in his hometown, Lan Lan Ling, had a serious violation of the privacy fraud case, and pressured the departments and officials responsible for the search, demanding that the latter raise their hands.
And Trudeau, who became angry with the official who disclosed the wrongdoing after the situation escalated, Wang Zhudi, mentioned earlier, was the attorney general of Canada at the time who first disclosed the wrongdoing and directly handled the case.
Although there are doubts about the case itself, the suspicions are difficult to wash away.
Many observers point out that Trudeau's five-year rule collapsed largely due to his own crater, the largest of which was the tail of a tiger-headed snake.
Canada's most authoritative Angus-Red poll data shows that since 2015, respondents who support Trudeau have slipped from over 60% in one direction to over 30%, while those who oppose it have never risen to over 60%.
Although other opposition parties and their party leaders did not perform as well, even a significant portion of the voters who still voted for the Federal Liberal Party voted against the Federal Prime Minister and the ruling party leader.
On October 21, the new federal legislative election in Canada is about to begin, and can Trudeau repeat the spectacle of winning five years ago?
The answer might be in one word: difficult.
Both from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, and regional aviation integration and development integration in Jingxiang have far-reaching implications and positive implications.
On September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport officially opened for service.
The Xinjing newspaper reporter learned from the Beijing City Development and Reform Commission that the capital airport is in super-cluttered and operational condition and the opening of Daxing International Airport will improve the capacity of the capital's aviation services.
Beijing became the second city in China after Shanghai to have two airports, with Shanghai Neon Bridge International Airport serving mainly domestic aviation matters, while Pudong Airport is similar to International Shipping Airlines, and the future capital airport and Daxing Airport will also be differentiated to serve different domestic and international aviation operations, providing more detailed services.
The airport is well served and, from the point of view of business development, the capital airport is more beneficial.
Capital airport exceeded 100 million passenger passengers in 2018, ranking first in the country, but there is still a significant lack of capacity compared to the rapidly growing business demand, especially the gap in international routes demand.
In order to better serve domestic and foreign travel and travel needs, adapt to Beijing's increasing openness and urban development trends, and to keep pace with international development, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a major international hub airport, planning to meet the annual passenger capacity of 100 million people and cargo capacity of 4 million tons in the future.
So, the two airports are not overlapping, and each has enough market space for different customer groups.
From an economic point of view, the operation of Daxing International Airport will obviously have a win-win effect, alleviate the tensions in Beijing air transport, accelerate the growth of passenger and cargo throughput, and create the cake of the capital's twin-nuclear operations.
From a user perspective, with the transit of Daxing International Airport, the future will not have to focus on the capital airport, but it can also reduce a series of problems caused by the over-centred route, such as increased stop guard time, slower passenger boarding speed, indirect increase of aircraft and passenger staying time at the airport, increased airport operating burden, reduction of the air traffic burden through the capital airport, and actually improved passenger travel experience.
According to the media measurements of the time and cost of various transport routes to large international airports, such as starting from the South Five Circles to Beijing Highway directly to Daxing Airport Highway, driving 50 minutes can reach, oil money to return about 40 yuan, highway fee 15 yuan; and choosing the railway transport metro Daxing Airport line, the route is limited to 20 kilometers, 30 kilometers, ticket price is divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan three degrees; citizens can also take the Jixing City Interstate, from Beijing West Station to Daxing Airport Station only 20 minutes.
Overall, citizens have a variety of transportation options to reach Daxing Airport, and the cost and time are within a more reasonable range.
And from the trend development perspective: Daxing Airport is positioned as a transport hub in Beijing Zhenjiang, so it is a little far away from Beijing city district, but the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin is strengthened, facilitating more people to travel, and it is important for the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, passengers from Hebei and Tianjin will be able to enjoy more international airline services provided by Daxing International Airport, as can be seen in the traffic planning of Daxing International Airport.
The transportation facilities at Daxing Airport are very well maintained, and in addition to the new airport line to Daxing Airport in Beijing's city district, there are several highways connecting Daxing Airport and surrounding areas.
Just as passengers from cities such as Guangdong, Dongguan, Foshan, Qingdao and others can travel to Guangzhou's Weiyuan Airport via highways such as Guangzhou, Guangdong, Guangdong, and Guangdong, residents of the surrounding corridors, Xi'an and Zhuang Zhi will also benefit from Daxing Airport and get convenient and efficient air services.
This shows that the air transportation of Daxing International Airport, not only increased several runways and several aircraft, whether from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience level, or from the level of regional air transport integration, development integration of Jinxiang, has a profound impact and positive meaning, not only concerns the long-term layout and development of Beijing transport industry, providing diversification for the choice of travel for residents of Jinxiang, promoting further improvement of the quality of services in Beijing transport industry, more favorable to promote the development process of Jinxiang integration, attracting economic and commercial development in the surrounding region of Daxing Airport.
Therefore, for the air navigation of Daxing Airport, we are not only economically small to consider as an individual, but also as a big to consider as a whole development.

The 2019 Forum on Economic and Social Issues in Vietnam was held in Shanxi province
Vice-Director of the Economic Committee of the Vietnamese Parliament, Dr. Cheng said that early this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new ups and downs and continued to grow.
The forum focused on discussing the economic and social issues that were prominent in the months leading up to 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development in late 2019 and 2020.
At the forum, the participants exchanged views and views on four topics: the state of economic development in 2019 and the impact of some of the Free Trade Agreements, some of the key issues in Vietnam's economy in 2019, key issues in Vietnam's social culture in 2019, and forecasts and recommendations on Vietnam's economic and social development in 2020.
Representatives generally believe that in the first few months of 2019, global economic growth slowed down, and risks and challenges increased.
Trade friction between major economies has further tightened global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has determined that despite the uncertainty of the global economy, with 70% of the world's economies trapped in stagnating growth, Vietnam's economic development still achieved many welcome achievements, the macroeconomic economy functioned smoothly and inflation was effectively controlled. The index of consumer prices for residents grew by an average of 2.64% in the first half of 2019, reaching the lowest growth in nearly three years.
GDP growth in the first half of 2019 was 6.76%, although it was below 7.05%, compared to the same period last year, but growth remained higher compared to the same period in 2011-2017.
In making forecasts on Vietnam's economic development trends for 2019-2020, Vice Director of Vietnam's National Economic and Social Forecasting Center, Dr. Deng said that Vietnam's economy showed a higher growth momentum in 2019 in the context of global economic turmoil.
It is expected that the macroeconomic situation in Vietnam will remain fundamentally stable until 2020, and the implementation of various free trade agreements will further boost trade development, economic structural adjustment and business environment improvement work will be strengthened, and Vietnam's export activity to foreign countries will decline due to the impact of trade friction.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring and forecasting and warning mechanism, to actively seek trade relief measures for Vietnamese exports, to look for opportunities to expand new export markets and to facilitate the export of various goods, such as agricultural and water products.
At the same time, inflation is controlled at a reasonable level, thus promoting the development of auxiliary industries and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and ecological agriculture.
Liu Ji, director of the Consular Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia in Dongguan, held a reception in Dongguan on 26 March to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
Liu Ji said that in the 70 years since the founding of the New China, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributing more to China's wisdom and Chinese programs to improve global economic governance, promote global co-development, make important contributions to world peace and development, and bring tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and well-being.
Liu Jiang said that as the world's second largest economy, China contributes more than 30% to the world's economic growth, especially the China Belt and Road Initiative, and the deepening cooperation between Chinese provinces and municipalities in various regions and provinces in the region.
He said that this year marks the 61st anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-Cambodian border, and the two countries have brotherly friendships and mutually beneficial cooperation will be the driving force for local economic and social development.
The governor of the province of Minsk, Di Siha, highly praised the great achievements of the new China in the last 70 years and congratulated the results of the friendly cooperation between China and Cambodia.
DiSaiha hopes that the two sides will continue to work together to promote China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit, and continuously improve the living standards of the people.
Dichai said that the friendly interaction between the province of Minghella and the provincial municipalities of China is noteworthy, so far the company has established friendship relations with 28 provincial municipalities of China, large cultural entertainment projects such as the Dong smiley and the Dong Wang dynasty landfall, the Guangxi-Gangxi agricultural demonstration park, the Changming New International Airport project, special training groups for officials of the government of Minghella province, students of the Minghella province who go to China for studying scholarship, rural diagnosis, the renovation of the city center road, the white barrier restoration public benefits project, and the lightning tree.
The reception was attended by Kenvenson, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defense of Cambodia, Chairman of the Council of the Province of Guangdong, the Governor of the Province of Guangdong Region 5, the Guangdong Branch of the Council of the People's Republic of China, volunteer teachers, the Guangdong Branch of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, representatives of Chinese enterprises and representatives of foreign conglomerates in Guangdong.
In Yunnan Town, witnessed the rise of digital China in the decade.
If we take the 2009 Local Web Forum as the starting point, the 2019 Cloud Summit held in Hangzhou from 25 to 27 has been going on for a full decade.
From the concept of a cloud in the fog to the practice of cloud computing, big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies supporting China's economic development, social management and public services over the next decade.
In the Zhongtai New Energy Photovoltaic Battery Workshop in Zhejiang Heining, a recent security inspector was beside a new colleague with AI loaded with Ali Yun.
It is 24 hours a day, with a speed of identification that is more than twice that of a human, and a quality inspection accuracy that is stable at more than 95%.
According to the company's head, the silicon quality inspector with a camera has studied more than 40,000 silicon samples and, thanks to the cloud computing power behind it, it can quickly convert infrared images into binary language and place silicon-based battery chip classification.
The enterprise is just a shorthand for the transformation of the manufacturing industry that cloud computing is helping today.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued guidelines for promoting enterprise cloud implementation in 2018-2020, which proposed that by 2020, efforts to achieve significantly improved enterprise cloud awareness and motivation, significantly improve the proportion and depth of application of cloud.
Wang, founder of Ali Yun, said that today, cloud computing centered on data has built a bridge to the digital economy that is the key element of data.
At the same time, the scale of China's cloud computing industry has been expanding steadily for 10 years.
The Chinese Institute of Information and Communication published the Cloud Computing Development White Paper in July 2019 shows that the overall Chinese cloud computing market size in 2018 reached 962.8 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2% compared to 2017.
In addition to being a key technology supporting industrial transformation and digital economic development, the invisible cloud cloud has unknowingly changed urban management and social life.
At this year's Yunnan Congress, the three-year-old city brainstorming event continues to attract attention.
Ali Yun said that the urban brain has now become the center of urban management from a tool for traffic governance, and the related collaborative applications have been expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, AI algorithms, and powerful computational capabilities, the city brain can enable people to pay for parking before they arrive. The number of people in the clinic can be detected in real time. The new city management services such as the design of tourist lines can be implemented.
In the field of government services, using a cloud cloud to connect one thing to another, to advance collaboration in office, to advance collaboration in work, cloud computing has facilitated the supply of government services on both sides.
Currently, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform across the province through the government.
As of September 11, the platform has covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million corporate units in the province, and collected 1,90.8 billion items of governance category 3066.
The average monthly calls and data shared between Zhejiang provincial government departments has reached 12 million times, and the data flowing on the platform may mean less work for the masses.
Be careful with plastic tea bags and tea bubbles!
According to the Xinhua news agency, recently a recent study in Canada found that a plastic tea bag could release billions or even 10 billion plastic particles, significantly more than the estimated amount of microplastics consumed by a person for the entire year, but so far there is no evidence that plastic particles pose a threat to humanity.
Researchers at Margil University in Canada reportedly found that dipping a plastic tea bag into a glass of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius) would release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplast particles into the cup.
This is significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastics consumed by a person throughout the year.
According to a study published earlier in 2019, the average person consumes at least 50,000 plastic particles per year while absorbing the same amount of microplastics.
The study, published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montjuïc shops and cafes, opened the tea bag, washed the tea bags and immersed them in almost boiling water for five minutes, and then analyzed them using electron microscopes and spectrometers.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, which was several degrees higher than the plastic load of previous foods.
Most tea bags are made from natural fibers, but many brands that use natural fibers to make tea bags still use plastic to cover them, the report said.
Some brand tea bags are no longer made of paper, but instead of plastic, and these plastic tea bags are the subject of research.
Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic, defined by researchers as having a size between 100 nm and 5 cm, and are produced mainly by the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and deepest seawalls around the world, and they can also be found in fresh water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
Researchers first discovered plastic particles in human feces samples in October 2018 in several countries in different regions of the world.
To test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from tea bags, the Canadian research team placed the water soot in contaminated water and found that the microplastics affected the behavior of the soot and caused them to develop developmental malformations.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that consuming plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, WHO noted that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread to the environment and what impact they have on humans.
Researchers speculated that the reason these tea bags release large amounts of plastic particles may be that these plastic tea bags come into contact with boiling water, and even when the grade of the tea bag is heated to more than 40 degrees Celsius, they can break down or release toxic substances.
Guthrie said the climate emergency is the greatest threat to the survival of small island nations.
There, a natural disaster will erode the developmental results of a generation.
The disaster in Barbados, Dominica and the Bahamas, which has been hit by hurricanes this year, illustrates this.
About a quarter of the people in small island developing countries live at or below 5 meters above sea level.
The relocation could seriously affect their social and lifestyle, even raising questions of sovereignty and national identity.
At this Monday's Climate Action Summit, small island nations joined forces to achieve carbon and 100% renewable energy by 2030, thus leading the world once again in the right direction.
Guterres said: "The climate crisis is piling up new injustices on the old injustices.
Although small island developing countries contribute little to global warming, they pay the highest price.
Because these countries are in a middle-income position, many countries are also in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disaster and debt.
The world must act, and now is the time to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing countries.
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for seeking help in managing disaster risks in small island developing countries, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure and methods for transition to renewable energy; urging international institutions to help small island developing countries, especially debt-ridden middle-income countries, get funding.
Small island developing countries are at the forefront of protecting and maintaining the Earth's life line, the oceans.
The latest special report released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have already suffered the dire consequences of the current climate crisis.
By the middle of the century, there may be extreme sea level rise in many areas every year, something that would have happened only a century ago.
The report warned that without a large amount of investment in adaptation, some island countries could become uninhabitable.
Pollution, overfishing and oxidation have caused huge losses.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the past 40 years.
The demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a reduction in resources, including the maintenance of fishing grounds in many island communities.
Small island nations also face high costs for transportation, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, which makes them subject to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also working to address the security impact of illegal trafficking of people, weapons and drugs.
Guterres said: "The problem can be solved anywhere by solving a problem in the most challenging environment.
The efforts of small island developing countries to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons and examples from which we can learn from the world.
He stressed that small island developing countries are a typical example of sustainable development.
They need long-term attention and investment from the international community as a whole.
The Indian Ministry of Finance said that the liquidity of the financial system is sufficient.
Finance Minister Sitharaman said on 26th that the current liquidity of the financial system is sufficient and that Indian economic growth is expected to resume in the second half of the current financial year, driven by holiday consumption demand.
Sitharaman made the above statement after meeting with representatives of Indian private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks and others.
Sitrahman did not specify the targeting of these statements.
Some Indian media and overseas media have previously blamed the ongoing slowdown in India's current economy on the liquidity tensions of non-bank financial institutions.
Sitalman, using the fall in car sales as an example, denies that liquidity tensions are the main cause of the fall in sales.
Sitaraman pointed out that the decline in car sales was mainly influenced by cyclical factors.
Sitharaman expects that India's economic growth may resume in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday consumption.
The annual shopping season in India begins in September and will last until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping consumption will greatly boost India's economic growth.
The Jiangxi Provincial Ministry of Education recently issued a notice that the entire province's secondary schools are strictly prohibited from violating the supplementary curriculum during the National Day holiday and that organizers are randomly inspected.
In the forthcoming notice of the strictly prohibited National Day holiday violation sub-curriculars, Jiangxi Provincial Ministry of Education stressed that secondary schools in various parts must do this during National Day: never organize group sub-curriculars or take new classes, never hold classroom training, special classes, training classes, interest classes, promotion classes, etc.
At the same time, it is strictly prohibited to organize, recommend and induce students to participate in extracurricular irregularities, to prohibit teachers from participating in extracurricular irregularities or to provide information to extracurricular irregularities organized by other teachers, parents, parents committees, etc.
Notify clearly that the violation of the sub-curriculum in the secondary and primary schools in Chhattisgarh will be heavily punished by the local education administration in the quality development education examination of the county government for the year; teachers who participate in the violation of sub-curriculum will be treated strictly in accordance with the relevant provisions of the teacher's code.
Supporting pig production and securing market supply
Liu Loyalty called for measures to be implemented from six points of view
The provincial conference on the promotion of live pig production and market security for supply television conference was held today to fully implement the policy measures of the Central and Provincial Committees and provincial governments on supporting live pig production and market security for supply.
Liu loyally demanded that measures be implemented in six areas to seize the production of live pigs.
The mayor of the city of Chiang Mai is responsible for the implementation of the catch basket, and this year the 45 million pigs were cleared for the province.
Grab the policy measures and implement them, and effectively solve the last kilometer of policy implementation.
To get the production of fertile pigs implemented, seriously implement the subsidy policy for fertile pigs, encourage pig breeding enterprises to expand the scale of fertile pigs, and plan to select good fertile pigs from the commodity pigs group.
Grab the bidding and implement it, and place the domestic well-known large farming enterprises that have not yet entered our province as the focus of bidding.
Grab the market circulation system and accelerate the construction of pig cold chain logistics facilities, and fully promote the transition from pig-fed to chicken-fed chicken.
To get the modern system implemented, the first line of disease control should be built around the world with basic level epidemiology personnel that are adapted to the scale and work tasks of the farm.
The loyalty demands to ensure the market supply of meat products, ensure that there is no large-scale shortage and large-scale supply interruption, and ensure that the market supply of pork on major holidays is stable.
The conference also continued to work on the control of the African swine fever epidemic, the prevention of fishing and recovery in important waters of the Yangtze River basin in China province, and the late acquisition of the river in the province.

Big white gum lipstick, Big white gum ice cream... As an old-fashioned brand, Big white gum milk sugar has been actively changing in recent years, actively attacking, insisting on innovation and cross-border.
The great white was born in 1959 and coincidentally celebrates his 60th birthday this year.
The young consumer group is also being targeted by the Chinese government.
The secretary of the party branch of Shanghai Li Liang Liang Food Limited, Vice General Manager Liu Weije mentioned the scenes of Liu Chun's intention to eat fish, summer fever eating fish, autumn winds and winter winds, reflecting the constant innovation in how people eat chicken.
The company also explores brand culture further in terms of taste innovation, comic book packaging design, and more to adapt to the legacy of the younger generation of consumers.
The representative of the Old Letter told about the path of innovation in the classroom of the Party of Art of China.
Yu Jae, manager of Shanghai Fresh Fruit and Cakes Co., Ltd., also believes that all innovation is based on solid foundations, and that every innovation with the old letters is a process of thickness and thinness.
Everyone has hidden in their hearts the expectation of the old characters.
The era of small and beautiful products should be starting.

Abe Jin-soo recorded video congratulating the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China, and said the sentence in Chinese
Local time No. 26, Japanese Prime Minister Abe Jin-Sung congratulated the People's Republic of China on its 70th anniversary through video.
Japanese Prime Minister Abe Jin-Tsu: Good evening, I am Abe Jin-Tsu.
On this occasion, on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I would like to express my warm congratulations on behalf of the Japanese government and people.
At the G20 Osaka summit in June, Japan and China worked together to make the summit a success and declared the Group of 20's firm resolve to the world through the Osaka Summit Declaration of the G20 leaders.
In addition, at the summit and dinner before the summit, the two sides agreed that President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to Japan next spring, while agreeing on the determination to open a new era in China.
The two countries share a significant responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.
I firmly believe that working together to address the issues facing the region and the world, and contributing to the international community, will help to build a new model for the future relationship between the two countries.
Finally, I wish China's relations to flourish and wish our friends' career to flourish.
Overage farmers in some workplaces are estimated to account for more than half.
Where do we find young workers now?
I don't want to use so many old people in the workplace.
Recently, for the phenomenon of overage farmers working in the workplace (over the retirement age), long-time contractor in the construction industry, Yang Quo lamented.
Recently, the university where he lives has been conducting rain sewage distribution projects, and there are many farmers working on campus, and if you look closely, you will find that there are many overage farmers working here.
The overage farmers and out-of-work workers are not unable to live, but because they cannot work, and have to work so hard and tirelessly. Whether it is to earn money to solve their own pension and medical problems or help their children, these older people who should have been unable to work continue to work hard.
The elderly farmers are dependent on the elderly, and it is not as easy as we thought.
Raising children, caring for the elderly, reading for children, helping children build houses and buy cars, helping children to start their own businesses, and raising grandchildren, when these farmers have completed their life's work, the money bags have been emptied and even a lot of debt, most of which lack wealth accumulation.
In order not to drag children and to accumulate more wealth, many farmers work hard until they are dead.
Many late 80s, late 90s, and even early 00s, new generation farmers were unwilling to engage in difficult conditions, high labor intensity secondary industries or low end services, causing structural waste of raw materials, which lacked attractiveness and provided opportunities for overage farmers.
Due to the lack of skills, physical and labor capacity decreases, many overage farmers work hard, earn low, risky and low-security jobs.
One day at a time, one day at a time, one day at a time, one day at a time, and one day at a time, the survival of the overage farmers who cannot survive behind them cannot be ignored and ignored.
Solving the problems of unpaid and unpaid wages, strengthening labour protection, reducing security risks, increasing labour income, improving the survival of overage farmers, in addition to their self-rescue, and the institutional and humanitarian care of the public sector, are also indispensable.
Some scholars point out that overage farmers are less likely to rely on home farming to solve their own problems such as pensions and health care, and they must provide for their families through other means.
Reading about the strength and strength of the workforce of overage farmers helps us better understand the love and pain of overage farmers.
Seeing the backdrop of overage farmers, hearing their sigh and thinking about how to make them really live in the countryside, the public sector, the market and society share responsibility in a good interaction, and it takes multilateral efforts.
Chemezov said that Russia will not export such a system in the next five years, because the pump must first supply its army, and then export production will be carried out.
This practice is in full accordance with international custom.
The major producers of weapons and military equipment always ensure the needs of their defence department first, before processing export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Grethov, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Air Force, said that the development of the system was about to be completed.
The S-500 system was developed by the Kim Jong-un-Antai Space Defense Company.
This is a new generation of air defense systems that use the principles used to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The S-500's main role is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles below 3,500 kilometres in range.
In addition, according to some sources, the S-500 can destroy high-speed cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of drones, high-speed missiles faster than five times the speed of sound, and even targets located near space.
This weapon can also be integrated into other air defense systems, especially the S-400 system, which is very important from a defense perspective.
Sergei Chemezov expressed particular concern about the S-400.
He said that the system is in great demand in the world at the moment, but the Russian military also needs it, including in the Arctic region.
The S-400 anti-aircraft system is in service with the Arctic Air Defense Corps.
According to the news of September 15, the work of the Arctic Air Defense Corps on the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system has been completed.
This is not Russia's militarization in the Arctic.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, this is entirely part of the transition plan for more advanced defense tools in a strategic direction to the north.
The Russian Northern Fleet News Service reported: "The controlled airspace in the Arctic region has increased significantly with the transition to the new S-400 air defense system".
It is very important that, according to the military assessment, the system is used successfully in the Arctic and Arctic regions.
Air Defense Corps officers trained for the new system and prepared for combat duty.
The S-300 remote air defense system was previously equipped there, and a portion is now preserved.
Speaking of air defense systems, it must have weapons capable of destroying various air targets, whether they are targets for high-speed flight at outer altitudes or close to the leakage network of protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system developed by Diamond-Anthony Sky Defense Counter-Strike is designed for attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high-speed ultrasonic targets and other air attack weapons.
The weapon can attack aerial kinematics targets within a range of 400 km and hit ballistic targets within 60 km at a speed of 4.8 km per second.
Russia has never hidden that it will deploy air defense forces in the Arctic region to ensure air and air security on the Northern Sea Route.
Not long ago, the first 12 sets of Tor - M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Arctic region of Russia, which were enough to form an anti-aircraft camp to strengthen the anti-aircraft system in the Arctic region.
The Russian Ministry of Defense said at the time that the Arctic Torpedo Force would be expanded to a full brigade formation in the future.
In addition to the new S-400 remote systems deployed to Nyasaland and Kola Peninsula and the Pantsir-SA short range systems deployed in the Arctic region, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons are strongly defending Russia's polar skies.
It will be difficult for enemy aircraft, helicopters and drones to break through this defense.
According to the Russian government, flagship stores will be a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complex and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
Russian goods companies, which operate Russian goods stores, focus on selling Russian goods in China.
The largest trading platforms in China, such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, Hand Q, and Wechat, have online stores and have their own online platform Epinduo.com and Russian merchandise retail chain stores.
The Russian Export Center will work with Russian products to develop marketing strategies and participation standards for shops and select products on virtual shelves.
The store plans to open and sell products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers before the end of this year.
According to data from the Russian Export Center, the Chinese e-commerce platform has reached 1 billion monthly visits.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, and in 2018 they exceeded $1 billion.
Currently, Alibaba Group will also open a pilot store for the sale of goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of its global import strategy.
According to Alexei Kozhnevnikov, the new store will display merchandise from companies with sales of at least 500 million rubles.
To be honest, my expectation of higher sales of 500 million rubles is not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers are quite positive about Russian goods, and consider our goods to be high quality and green environmental protection products.
Kozhnevnikov said that competition from Chinese consumers who are competing for strong purchasing power is fierce and is intensifying.
He said: "Our goal is ambitious, to launch 500 businesses through this store in three years".
At the same time, the platform will also offer products for Russian Far Eastern companies.
Prof. Viacheslav Cheglov, professor of the Department of Trade Policy and Fundamental Studies at the Prelhanov University of Economics in Russia, said: "This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export hub is a state-owned and not a private institution".
I have not seen a lot of highly competitive Russian goods in the market.
He believes that the project is unlikely to be implemented in real terms, but it will help strengthen relations between the two countries.

News Time: We are determined not to move our own way
The answer to the "New Era China and the World" White Paper published on 27th is that in 70 years of China's development, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have found the right path to development of Chinese characteristic socialism and have steadily followed it.
China's path to development is the choice of history, the choice of the people.
Since recent times, in an environment of poverty and weakness and internal and external anxiety, a generation of good people has sought and sought to save the country and its people on the path to salvation.
However, the monarchical constitution, the restoration of the empire, the parliamentary system, the multiparty system, the presidential system have all been thought about, tried, and failed.
It was not until the Chinese Communist Party and the New China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a Chinese-characteristic socialist path in practice.
This road that China has taken is the path of happiness for the Chinese people, the path of the Chinese people's revival, and the path of China's development with the rest of the world.
It is because China is on the right path that it can do its own thing, become the world's second largest economy, and contribute the most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As the White Paper points out, China's development path, in line with China's national situation and adapting to the demands of the times, will increasingly show bright development prospects as the times progress.
In retrospect, the Chinese people know how difficult it is to find the right path; looking around the world, the Chinese people value this right path even more.
The Chinese understand the logic of the South China Sea, and understand that adapting to others does not necessarily suit them, only their own is best.
It was with this road confidence and strategic determination that China created the world's most spectacular miracle.
In the course of human evolution, the end of history was a noisy moment.
Today, the success of China's characteristic socialist path proclaims the end of the history of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries to achieve strong national wealth, expanded the path of development towards modernization, and provided experience and lessons for those countries and peoples in the world who want to accelerate development and maintain their independence and follow the path of their own country.
The world is rich and diverse.
China has always respected the right of countries to choose the path of development that suits their own national situation.
China will not stop importing foreign models, nor will it stop exporting Chinese models, but will resolutely not move out of its way to achieve its own continuous development, strengthen the exchange of governance and politics with the countries, and make the contribution that is due to achieve good governance together.
The Fair Work Commission found that the owner of a Foodworks supermarket fired a 66-year-old female worker by text because he preferred to hire employees from Asian backgrounds.
The committee said that Wang Wang, the owner of Lady Gail Ayton's Wagga Wagga store, where she worked for more than 20 years, was extremely unfair and likely to violate the anti-discrimination law.
Ms Ayton told the committee that Mr Wang took over the shop in 2016 and he was always trying to get rid of me because she was not Chinese.
In this case, the vice chairman of the committee, Peter Sams, did a search on the Internet and found that Mr. Wang had previously posted recruitment advertisements on various Chinese employment forums in Australia.
Among the job requirements listed for these positions, one was for the first Asian woman to be elected, and the other was for the first Asian employee to be elected.
The third post said that he preferred overseas people.
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton in April this year by text message, later claiming that this was due to her absence and the alleged cash shortage from $5.10 to $30.
But Mr. Sams said that Wang's reason for firing Ms. Ayton was weak and there was no evidence.
She only missed one shift in three years, and the total amount of missing work was AUDs.
He said that Ms. Ayton's dismissal had nothing to do with her behavior or performance.
He said: "Well, in my opinion, the real reason why the defendant should fire her, supported by the evidence of Mr Wang's recruitment advertisement, is that he is more willing to hire employees with Asian backgrounds.
Under Section 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's conduct is a violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or illegal for the applicant to be dismissed.
Mr Sams said that given Mr Wang's disgraceful treatment of Ms Ayton, he considered it inappropriate to restore her position.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton, a temporary worker, who earns A$26 per hour.
Given the possible violation of anti-discrimination and labor rights laws, Sam said he would submit his ruling and documents to the committee's director to consider whether to transfer Mr. Wang's actions to other bodies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
He said Mr Wang did not give Ms Ayton any opportunity to respond to what was allegedly the reason for her firing.
He said: "Well, I think the defendant has taken an unfair and biased procedure to fire the applicant, and Mr Wang Yang is waiting for this opportunity, and he thinks it will prove that it is legitimate for him to terminate the applicant's employment".
He was wrong... ...the defendant should have ignored any natural fair treatment when he fired the applicant, and it is shocking that he was rude and extremely unfair.
Mr Sams said that while Foodworks is a small business, it is necessary to be frank that no good employer will dismiss employees in the extremely unfair and distorted way that is acknowledged in this case.
He said: "Oh, that's shameful, and extremely unfair".

The shooting process was supported by China Southern Airlines.
The Foxhunter Team filmed the key drama of the results of the Foxhunter operation at the airport, the team of the Foxhunter Action Team chased the fugitive back to the country, hijacked the plane, signed arrest warrants and so on.
The team took a series of footage of the aircraft's stopovers, customs border checks and aircraft passenger and doorways, and re-enacted the first line of Chinese detection police and fox hunter heroes flying across the country, capturing the difficult journey and professional style of escaped criminals.
To complete the shoot successfully, the main creative team of the Foxcatcher did a lot of preliminary preparation work, repeatedly confirming every execution detail, ensuring that the most realistic and direct visual effects are presented.
It is reported that the drama will also be shot in many locations abroad.
Vietnam needs to seize the opportunity to develop artificial intelligence.
Four criteria are used to assess and rank cities for their level of preparedness for AI waves: prospects, capabilities, asset base and development direction.
Singapore is ranked first, followed by cities in the UK, USA, France, Sweden, Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an expert at the organization, said in an interview with reporters on behalf of Moisin Bevan: "I feel it makes a lot of sense when reviewing and evaluating cities like Henan and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.
Overall, I think Vietnam's future is bright in the context of high growth, strong economic development pathways and rapid development of talent base.
I think Vietnam is on the right track and doing well.
It is important that Vietnam should know how to seize the opportunities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution to promote economic development.
Artificial intelligence is completely changing people's work, communication and lifestyle.
It brings greater efficiency, but also creates a threat to exacerbate social, economic and technological inequality.
However, according to a global study by Oliver Wyman, no city in the world today is prepared for the breakthrough of the era of artificial intelligence.

About 800 million people took part in the National Day trip, which doubled China's tourism supply and demand
About 800 million people will travel during the upcoming 11 tonnes of gold week!
Big data from multiple tourism platforms shows that the tourism consumption market in China is booming in supply and demand.
The National Day of China Tourism Report predicts that, based on the National Day of China tourism statistics from last year, domestic tourists will be close to 800 million this year during the National Day holiday; more than 7.5 million will be outbound tourists.
Currently, tourists from more than 500 cities have booked products such as group tours, free walks, custom tours, local play, and more, involving 100 countries and regions.
According to estimates by the Institute of Tourism Research of China, the country received 726 million domestic visitors during the national holiday last year, an increase of 9.43%.
This year's National Holidays will not only be innovative in the number of visitors, but the consumption will also be the main melody of national holidays.
The report said that the average domestic tourist spending over 3000 yuan over the Holidays across the provinces, an increase from the same period last year, is due to the popular choice of products to experience better, such as high-rated brand hotels, non-shopping tour groups, elite groups, specialised cars, etc.
Donkey Kong Travel Network booking data shows a similar trend, with the use of comfortable models and private groups with less than 10 people on the domestic long-line being more popular than in previous years.
Spring and autumn tourism data shows that consumers prefer heavy experiences, heavy services, heavy variation in the pace of travel.
Fly Pig data shows that the number of tourist bookings in China's Fourth Line and below cities grew the fastest, reaching a 30% growth rate, which reflects the consumption upgrading of residents in more regions of the country.
Personalization is a big feature of this year's 11th Golden Week tour.
Carrying data shows that the order for holiday rental cars is expected to increase by almost 60% in comparison, while short-haul self-driving rides on the surrounding Volkswagen lines continue to be popular; the number of private groups registered increased by up to 155%.
Sharing joy has become the main purpose of tourist leisure.
Data from Carrier shows that 28% of the holiday tourists are parents, 25% are couples and 23% are friends of colleagues.
In terms of age, the '80s and '90s accounted for more than 50% of the total number of visitors.
It is worth noting that the domestic tourism market performance this year is more striking than the earlier Golden Week.
Fly Pig data shows that the number of people booking domestic travel routes for the Holidays this year increased by 42% compared to the same period, faster than the exits.
Industry analysis shows that while demand is high, tourism is promoting supply side reforms across the country, offering tourists a richer festival of the festival.
For example, the National Sports Directorate and Ministry of Culture and Tourism jointly released the 2019 Eleventh Golden Week Sports Tourism Special Links for the day before; the 2019 Shanghai Tourism Festival is launching seven of the 100 cultural and tourism events that are currently being held to attract Chinese and foreign tourists to participate; several provinces, such as Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Shandong, are launching discounts or free measures for tickets to the sightseeing area in the coming Golden Week.
The data from the bookings show that the most popular destinations in China with unique natural landscapes or cultural features are Zhongshan, Changchun, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin.
The first live-action movie of China's premier direct-to-video cinema, "The 70th Birthday of China" will be simultaneously shown in 70 cinemas in more than 10 provinces across the country on October 1.

China is expected to become Australia's largest beef export market.
An animal protein analyst at Rabobank, a Dutch cooperative bank, said China faced a severe pork shortage after the outbreak of African swine fever, and is expected to become Australia's largest beef export market.
After the outbreak, Chinese consumers were switching from eating pork to other animal proteins, and the epidemic led to the destruction of many livestock herds by the authorities. In the past year, the number of live pigs in China has been halved and the price of pork has almost doubled.
China produces and consumes two-thirds of the world's pork.
Chenjun Pan, senior animal protein analyst for the Dutch Cooperation Bank China District, said that there was an increase in demand for other meat, including beef, with China, the world's largest importer of animal protein, currently accounting for 27% of the world's pork imports and 24% of the world's beef imports.
Ms. Pan said that China's beef imports from Australia increased by 65% in the first half of this year, surpassing the United States and Japan to become Australia's largest beef export market.
Yesterday, the Chinese government said it would release more pork from emergency reserves before celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party of China's rule.

The world's oldest barber died at the age of 108, cutting his hair 96 years ago
Anthony Mancinelli, the world's oldest hairdresser, who holds the Guinness World Record for being the oldest person in New York, USA, never retired to do daily hairstyles for guests, but died on 19 March of complications from colon cancer, ending his 96-year haircut.
According to CNN, Mancini immigrated to the United States at the age of eight and helped clean the floor of a hair salon shortly after, and at the age of 12, began to serve clients with scissors, thus relieving the economic pressures of the family.
Manciniley was in elementary school at the time but did not graduate.
Mancini's son Robert revealed that his father loved work and people from all over the world liked him, although he was healthy and diagnosed with cancer in February this year, and was unable to work for six weeks before his death due to physical factors, but this was not retirement, because he planned to return to cut his hair until he recovered.
Robert, 82, said that after his father died, he now had to find a new barber because he had his father help cut his hair all his life.
The company's buyback of over 100 billion yuan in the year created a new historic high-China net
In order to stabilize the company's stock price and maintain the company's image, listed companies have begun to buy back shares frequently in the past two years, in order to transmit the information about the company's value being undervalued to the market through targeted buyback and collective bidding transactions, and thus stabilize the stock price and increase investor confidence.
According to the Eastern Fortune Choice data, the funds used by listed companies to buy back shares in 2017 amounted to 7.9 billion yuan, which rose sharply to 51 billion yuan in 2018. Since 2019, the total amount of A listed companies' repurchases has exceeded 100 billion yuan, setting a new high in the history of A shares to buy back funds, and far above the previous year.
From the point of view of the purpose of the buyback, the company's buyback shares appear to be the same as the increase of the major shareholders, but there are significant differences in the implementation of the subject, the source of funds, the use of the buyback, and the interests of the shares themselves.
In an interview with the Daily Xi Jinping of Shanghai Securities, Chairman Xu Yang, Chairman of Shanghai MyKyong Information Consulting Limited, said that the opinion issued in November 2018 about Xi Jinping supporting the share buyback of publicly traded companies, which corrected the existing system of narrow scope of share buyback, complex decision-making procedures and unsound inventory system, and increased sharply the issue of share buyback in the year because of the policy that began to encourage the share buyback of publicly traded companies.
In January, the publicly traded companies officially released rules for the repurchase of shares of publicly traded companies. These policies were introduced, broadened the sources of publicly traded companies' repurchase funds, simplified the implementation procedures appropriately, guided the improvement of governance arrangements, encouraged the implementation of various types of publicly traded companies' equity incentives or employee stock holding plans.
After the opinion was issued, the actions of the listed companies to buy back shares were more appropriate, the buyback process was simpler and the share buyback was more motivated.
The relatively low repurchase of shares also benefits the efficiency of using the funds of listed companies, thus increasing the level of earnings per share, increasing the net asset yield rate and reducing the pressure on the profit indicator of the company.
The importance of buying back shares of publicly traded companies is greater than the increase in shareholders, and it also reflects the willingness to manage market value and cash flow of publicly traded companies.
Xu Yang believes that the undervalued stock price is the main factor in the recapture of listed companies, and the company's stock price is no longer able to reflect the company's future development prospects, so these companies deserve the attention of investors, but cannot invest blindly, and need to pay attention to the profitability of such listed companies and the specific operating situation.
The large-scale takeover of public companies at least shows the confidence and financial strength of the company in its development.
The willingness to buy back shares of publicly traded companies has gradually warmed up, and the buying behavior has become normal. Data shows that almost 1,000 publicly traded companies have already implemented share buybacks this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the dominant force in the buyback market.
China's recent disclosure of the re-purchase progress said that the company has cumulatively recovered 5,759,000 shares of A shares through a centralised bidding process, representing 0.315% of the company's total capital, and the total amount of funds paid is 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction fees). The re-purchase of shares will be used entirely for employee stock holding plans, including but not limited to the long-term service plans that have been considered by the company's shareholders' conference.
Eli shares have paid 5792 billion yuan for share buyback and adjustments to the use of share buyback in the near term, and the change from the original plan to share buyback will be used entirely as a stock source for the later implementation of the share incentive to cumulative buyback of 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares will be used for the implementation of the share incentive stock source, and the remaining 30.49 million shares will be used for liquidation to reduce registered capital.
Eli shares said that the cancellation of some of the shares that had been bought back would further increase the level of earnings per share and actually increase the return on investment of the company's shareholders.
TCL Group issued a progress announcement on the acquisition on September 25, showing that TCL Group has acquired a cumulative 3.59% stake in the company, for a total cost of 1.65 billion yuan.
The TCL Group Board Office told the Daily Sun newspaper, "The buyback of shares will be used for employee stock holding plans, equity incentives or for convertible corporate bonds issued by publicly traded companies.
TCL Group adheres to its established operating strategy, continuously improving competitiveness and sustainable healthy development.
Based on confidence in the company's future development and maintaining investor interests, combined with the performance of the company's stock in the secondary market over the past year, and taking into account factors such as the company's operating and financial situation, the company plans to buy back shares of the company using own funds, self-funding and other financing methods.
The chief economist of the Open Source Fund of the Pradhan Mantri said that the operation of the publicly traded company to buy back shares can reduce the number of shares circulating in the market, increase the earnings per share of the publicly traded company, and is an important benefit for the secondary market share; in addition, the willingness of the publicly traded company to actively extract real silver and buy back shares from the stock market, which greatly boosted the confidence of the market.
The buy-back of domestic listed companies has gradually increased in recent years, especially performance stocks, and the buy-back of shares is a very good way to boost investor confidence, which is also a positive and encouraging practice.
The Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Commission, the Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Commission, Huang Hua and the Four Great Commandments of the Chinese Army in Engineering Machinery Manufacturing, Liu Xia, Jin Jin, Chen, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang, Liang
The world's leading engineering machinery industry group in Yangsha is the strongest in terms of building concrete floor in terms of current trends.
As a provincial city in the Inland Empire, Wangsha shouts this grandiose slogan, "What's the bottom line?"
The power of the hydrogen gas leak is the strength of the side leak.
The four engineering machinery companies that participated in the dialogue, each with their own hands, covered all areas of the sky, ground, sea and land: light aircraft of the Yangtze River intelligence, concrete transportation tank of the Central Liaison Heavy Division, three heavy-duty all-terrain lifts, iron-built tunnel shield constructors, whose hard force can be called single-step underground, and the arrogant group of men.
For a long time, China had virtually no say in engineering and mechanical manufacturing.
When moving to China, Chinese enterprises are introduced, and Chinese enterprises are driven by two wheels, and take the initiative of the East Wind, acquisition, merger, plant establishment, and so on, and become the leader of the global engineering machinery industry.
Among them, the three leading engineering machinery enterprises, heavy construction, heavy construction, iron construction, and smart mountain, whose output values, market share and sales are key economic indicators, have significantly led similar enterprises.
The camera is the driving force behind the momentum.
The engineering machinery group, Dong Dong-gu, is the founder of the Yangsha engineering machinery industry group and the leading enterprise in the global engineering machinery industry.
In the global industrial lake, who lives and lives well is the hard part of talking.
In the early years, the global engineering machinery industry experienced a cold winter, and many internationally renowned engineering machinery manufacturing companies have fallen, but the engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises in Changsha have taken the cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat
The power of the political enterprises that are star-studded.
Developing an industry with advantages requires both the active involvement of enterprises and the active role of the government.
Changsha has the reputation of being the capital of silicon engineering machinery, which is to bring together the entire industrial chain from upstream to downstream, to create many related industrial clusters, and to reduce the costs of R&D, manufacturing and sales of enterprises through optimizing the business environment, improving support services, simplifying approval processes.
A good business environment has allowed engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises to flourish.
History has pushed Yangsha to the forefront of building the leading level of engineering machinery worldwide, so I won't wait, and I won't let it.
Both government and enterprise, and related sectors such as product research and development, should seize the opportunity, get ahead, set goals, and continue to work hard to contribute to the strength of Hunan to build a strong manufacturing power.
Wang Xi presided over the meeting of China and the African members of the Security Council.
Wang said China and African countries are good brothers and good partners.
China stands firmly with its African brothers, past, present and future.
We advocate holding this meeting as a concrete step towards implementing the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and African leaders at the Beijing Summit of the Forum for Central African Cooperation last September, in order to strengthen China's cooperation with African countries in the Security Council and to promote better international support for Africa's achievement of peace and development.
Wang said Africa is China's most important and trusted partner.
As a permanent member, China's vote in the Security Council has always belonged to large developing countries, including African countries.
In the face of the new situation, China is willing to join the Security Council with African countries to strengthen solidarity and cooperation and uphold common interests.
Both sides should rely on strengths to unite, dispute resolution through consultation, self-determination and development.
The foreign ministers of the participating African member states thanked China for the initiative to hold the conference and congratulated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the New China.
Foreign Ministers said that Africa and China have always been the most trusted and reliable partners of each other, based on equality and mutual respect.
The non-Party appreciates China's important and positive role as a permanent member of the Security Council in African affairs, strongly promoting the just and inclusive resolution of African issues, and its enormous efforts and contributions to safeguarding African interests and promoting peace and security in Africa.
Africa is currently facing the threat of terrorism and extremism, and only solving security issues can truly achieve long-term peaceful development.
Looking forward to further coordinating positions with China in the Security Council and strengthening cooperation in solidarity.
Wang said that today's meeting reached an important consensus.
We support the maintenance of multilateralism, strengthening the authority and role of the United Nations, upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, opposing unilateralism and bullying practices; we agree to strengthen mutually supportive cooperation in the affairs of the United Nations and the Security Council; we support the common interests of Central and Central Africa and the developing world; we support African countries to solve African problems in an African way; we ask the United Nations to provide financial support for African autonomous peace operations; we support the idea of cooperation to promote development, development and peace and prosperity, and help African countries achieve autonomous development; we are firmly committed to upholding the legitimate interests of developing countries and against any country creating barriers to developing countries and depriving them of their rights to achieve development.
Genghis Khan: Let's get out of poverty through the lake.
The fall of September covered the Yellow Earth Plateau.
In the community of Puma town, a 58-year-old village man named Shavely filled the last straw in the manger and watched the white lake sheep's mouth.
The food is good until the autumn and winter are full of mushrooms, and the mushrooms can be sold for good price.
Shavely said he gave sheep a special nutritional meal every day, regularly cleaned hygiene, disinfected, and served carefully.
Shavely has been raising sheep for more than 20 years, until the cooperative came to know how coarse shepherding was in the past.
Shavely is a village in the town of Sha Shao Pyak in the Qingyang City district of Qingyang Province, Gansu.
His left-neighborhood and right-neighborhood are herders, but he adheres to traditional herding methods, poor quality of sheep and low production.
In June, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative under the guidance of the government, and everything started to change.
Shavely spent the whole day digging and farming because he always had a problem in his mind.
The people who are in the stock are poor people, they all give sheep to cooperatives, they can not divide and sell at the end of the year, but they expect him.
With the guidance of technical staff, he slowly learned how to prevent the epidemic, mastered scientific breeding, and became a popular breeding dog in the village.
The pro-civil farming professional cooperative is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1,400 sheep.
The head of the cooperative, Liu, said that there are doors to standardized sheep sheds both inside and outside.
The wool is thick and easily breeds bacteria, the sheep must not be kept in hot and humid places, the sheep shed must be built in three-way gaps, and the ventilator must be fitted to ventilate the heat.
Liu said that in order to prevent the epidemic, she also needs to be regularly disinfected with a spray of sheep's shed and to give the sheep three to four vaccination shots in a quarter.
The small, fat sheep are well-settled, and can be eaten with grass made from a mixture of frog corn, wheatgrass, and soybeans, and have a wide enough playground to relax the muscles.
The cooperative adopted a method of fostering substitution, guiding local farmers to bring good sheep to the area, unifying the breeding, management and sales, achieving good breeding, scientificalisation, standardization and clustering of farming.
Today, 140 poor families with sheep shares, divided by more than 6000 yuan per household per year, have four registered poverty alleviation persons working in cooperatives.
From the pasture of the mountains of Guangzhou to the prefecture of Guangzhou, from the mating of the local chicken to the artificial insemination of chicken, from the look of the body, the touch of the belly to the B-over chicken... In Guangzhou, the transformation of beef and sheep farming is not only the way of feeding, but also the model of the farmer's chicken has changed the landscape of the former sheep farming and sheep selling in the market in the slopes of Guangzhou, overcoming the weakness of traditional farming, the poor days of farmers as modernised sheep farming has become.
Liu said that if the market price weakens, local leading company Gankong Sheng Farmers Development Limited will buy the tooth at a market protection price of 27 yuan per kilogram, helping farmers to spread market risk.
Xu Jifeng, general counsel of Guangzhou Farmers Development Limited, said that companies are driving more and more poor people to consider sheep farming by providing loan guarantees, sheep supply, order breeding, bidding, procurement and unified processing sales.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have achieved steady growth through the cultivation of straw, good breeding, large-scale cultivation, slaughter division and market sales of the crops grown in the Yangtze region.
The northern agricultural pastoral mixed zone in Qingyang City is rich in straw resources.
There are currently 913 large-scale sheep farms and cooperatives in the city, with more than 5 million sheep and goats being raised, and two processing lines built for the slaughter of 1.3 million sheep and goats.
The French finance minister said he would cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros next year and urged Germany to follow suit.
Reuters Paris, September 26 - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France will reduce taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, while Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revive the sluggish economy.
LeMel, while introducing France's 2020 budget, said the latest monetary easing initiative by the European Central Bank created an opportunity for governments of member states with the capacity to borrow to increase investment.
The European Central Bank lowered interest rates to record lows on September 12 and plans to re-inject debt to reduce borrowing costs, hoping to stimulate economic recovery and boost inflation.
Lower interest rates will not bring Europe back to prosperity, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough, LeMel told reporters.
"Germany needs to invest, and it needs to do so now, the sooner the better. Don't wait until the situation gets worse and move again", he added.
He has repeatedly made this call to Germany.
France has implemented tax cuts of more than 10 billion euros this year, which has brought a great boost to France's economic growth.
The global economy is losing momentum, and Germany's economy, which depends on exports, is the first to be hit.
Lemel pointed out that next year the tax burden on French families will be reduced by 9.3 billion euros, including 5 billion euros of income tax relief.
In addition, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost 1 billion euros as the corporate tax rate is gradually implemented from 33.3% to 25% over five years.

Study: The National Health Diet Index in the United States has seen small growth but challenges remain.
According to the American Daily News, recently, a recent study in the United States showed that the US government's healthy eating index has grown moderately in 16 years, from 56 to 58.
But this is not worth celebrating when the score is 100.
Americans still face significant challenges in dieting.
Dr Zhang Fanfang, a nutritionist at Tufts University in Massachusetts, one of the authors of the study, said Americans still eat too much food that could cause heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and other diseases, which are among the most common diseases in the United States.
The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on June 24.
The study is based on the US government's health survey of 44,000 adults from 1999 to 2016.
The authors write that despite the dramatic improvement, significant dietary challenges remain.
These challenges include reducing the consumption of snacks, hot dogs, fat cows, butter, and other saturated foods.
The study found that people's intake of these unhealthy fats in their daily diet increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended 10% intake limit.
The biggest improvement in the American national diet was the reduction in sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but the intake was still too high.
Officials believe that the intake of added sugar should be less than 10% in the daily diet.
The reason for the reduced sugar intake is thought to be related to the reduction in the consumption of sweet water, but Zhang Faang stressed that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and tomato sauce.
American adults have seen a slight increase in their intake of fruits, nuts, oats and other whole grain categories.
However, data from 2016 shows that these foods still account for less than 5% of the daily diet.
Although people's intake of salt is slightly reduced and the reduction in fruit juice leads to the intake of low-quality carbohydrates, Zhang said they still account for up to 42% of daily calories, many of which come from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study was based on a biannual personal health survey that enables adults to recall what they ate in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have asked this question twice every few days since 2003.
The government's guidelines on dietary requirements for American residents recommend that people adopt a healthy dietary model of dietary fat to reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases.
The guidelines point out that people should consume more nutrient-dense foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, lean meat, poultry, egg and seed foods that can provide protein.
The number of people with diabetes among the US population almost doubled during the study, to over 7%, and the obesity rate increased over the years.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among Americans.
The EU promotes strategic partnership with Asia
The committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Vietnam, the secretary of the Central Secretariat, and the Central Economic Ministry's Yuanping Group attended the forum.
Based on the close cooperation between the EU and partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the forum focused on the theme of building bridges for a sustainable future.
The forum was held a year after the implementation of the integration strategy in the two continents of the European Union.
The President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said that strengthening the link was part of the above proposals because it would benefit the people and economies of the countries concerned.
The above relations have helped bring stability and prosperity to all parties involved.
He also believed that the EU wanted to convey the message about increasing participation and strengthening the mutually beneficial and reciprocal link between Europe and Asia.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is the guest of honour at the forum and will give an important speech at the plenary session.
The first stock finance subsidiary in the country was established to empower the capital management business with technology
On 26th, Guangdong Bank's wholly owned subsidiary Guangdong Finance Limited Limited was officially established in Qingdao, the first joint stock bank finance subsidiary established in China.
The experts said that asset management is an important area for developing financial technology, and the bank established a financial subsidiary in favor of using technology to improve its capital management business.
In April, Guangzhou Bank and Commercial Bank respectively issued a statement saying that they have received approval from the Chinese Banking Authority to set up a financial subsidiary.
On September 24, Guangdong Bank announced that Guangdong Finance has been officially approved for opening.
Just two days later, Guangzhou Bank led many equity banks and was the first to establish Guangdong Finance in Qingdao.
Li Xiaojun, Chairman of the Guangdong Group, said that Guangdong Group will accelerate the pace of innovation, apply modern technology thinking and means, rely on big data, IoT, cloud computing, improve the coverage, utilization and penetration rate of financial capital, improve the sense of access, happiness and security of customers.
By 2021, establish the four pillars of strengthening the development of our country's financial technology, further strengthen the application of technology and technology capabilities in the financial industry, achieve deep integration and coordination of finance and technology development, and significantly increase the satisfaction of the people with digitization, networking and intelligent financial products and services.
Zhang Yang, Chairman of Foton Finance, explained that Foton Finance's investment management platform will use technologies such as smart consulting, smart investment research, big data, to help Foton Finance better judge macroeconomic situations.
The future will also apply new technologies such as blockchain to grasp the direction and trends from traditional assets to alternative assets to digital alternative assets.
Dr. Dong Shihyang, a special researcher at the National Laboratory for Finance and Development, said that in the face of a new competitive situation in the investment management industry, financial technology companies and investment management agencies will work together to explore new growth paths with investment technology.
The need for transformative development of the finance technology industry, which is the need for transformative development of finance technology itself, will be more than just injecting new vitality and vitality into the development of the finance business.
At the beginning of this year, Digital Technology in Jindong introduced a new technology system to increase the capacity of the product research and development and wind control with the help of technology and digitalization.
The new system will start with the four capabilities of product design, sales transactions, asset management and risk assessment, and will improve the overall level of intelligent operation of the capital management industry.
Experts believe that while the technology of capital management improves customer service capabilities and innovates rich products, it can also enhance risk prevention capabilities and improve capital management efficiency.
Zhang Yang said that in the past, risk preferences of customers were easily biased to be targeted through questionnaires, but now using AI to image users helps to better target customers and to launch products according to their investment preferences, which helps to solve risks.
Alternative big data such as e-commerce, space and time data can help us better map the activity and geography of a region, an industry.
Zhang Yang said that while decomposing the risks, big data technology will also help improve wind control capabilities.
China's deepest tunnel, the deepest tunnel in China, was refreshed
China New Social Security (Zhuo Yusengbo) completed the dig on September 27 after more than 1,200 days of day and night construction, and the well reached 762.59 meters below ground on September 27 at the construction of the Great Ri Ri Ri Railway's Goryeongchang Tunnel No. 1.
The 34.5 km long Dairy Railway's Gorgon Mountain Tunnel is located in Yunnan, and runs along the western shore of the Yangtze River through the Gorgon Mountains, the longest single-line tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel crosses 19 fault lines and is buried at a maximum depth of 1,155 meters, covering almost all the unfavorable geology and major risks that can be encountered in tunnel construction.
The well is the most important auxiliary pit in the Goryeong Mountain Tunnel, and it is responsible for increasing the operational area to achieve the important task of the long-term and short-term operation of the railway.
Well No. 1 was successfully dug to the bottom of the well, marking the official entry of the Highlength Mountain Tunnel into the construction of horizontal tunnels, and after the well underground car park was dug and replaced, the well could add four working surfaces to the well, accelerating the opening of the tunnel.
The well is located in the granite bedrock, and because the granite bedrock is rifted, the water does not stop flowing from above to below, basically the depth of the well is the pressure of the water.
Director General of the Department of Railways Project, Directorate of Narayama Railway Agency, Shi Jing-jun told reporters that during the construction of the well, there were several situations of mud and water and collapse, and the builders invited experts to take the plunge on the spot, and more than 20 times discussed the process.
The maximum flow of water in the well is more than 300 cubic meters per hour, well depth of more than 700 meters, water pressure equivalent to 700 meters depth.
If we don't draw the drain in time, we will drown 10 meters in an hour, and we spend almost 85% of our time treating water, 15% of our time digging.
To overcome geological problems such as the development of well-drained rocks along the 1st well, mudflow, rich granite, and others, tunnel construction uses systemic water management measures combined with drilling, drilling and drilling to reduce construction risks.
After several improvements, the construction of well No. 1 formed mechanized flow lines such as excavation system, excavation system, suspension system, brake lift system, and achieved the mechanized operation of the whole process, such as eyelashing, explosion, excavation, template installation, concrete construction, accelerated construction progress.
Finally, after more than 1,200 days and nights of construction, the well was successfully completed at a depth of 762.59 meters.
The 330 km long Dairy Railway is an important part of the China-Burma International Corridor and is an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the construction of the Belt and Road Bridge.
After the completion of the tram, the journey time from Dali to Raili will be reduced from the current road of 6 hours to 2 hours, which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in the Zhongshan region and contribute to promoting economic and trade cooperation and friendly personnel between China and Southeast Asian countries.

The afternoon started with loneliness, not wanting to go out, and not adjusting to the fact that the children are not around.
He nodded and said to the dog, "I'll take you out".
The details of the things to do outside the house are detailed, and the characteristics of Type A blood are becoming stronger and I feel very different.
They took out clothes, bought nutritional grains, paid, bought live fish, and snacked Nana.
That's the reason for leaving.
In the phone, Nana had just finished preaching to her sister, and she had no excuse to buy snacks.
The other side laughed a few times and said the children would call and hung up.
Nana jumped into the assistant chair, she knew she was driving, panicked and worried, and was reluctant to go with me.
Her husband Boo is hardly home early.
Even praising the salad made with salmon and beef oil, he went to the bedroom and lay in bed watching TV.
Look at the brick on the wall, it's just 7:00, the sunrise and sunset are early, the sun has already gone dark.
The circle of friends is inventing the moon, and it was supposed to be mid-autumn.
Washing a bunch of grapes from friends, leaving half for Boo, the rest in a favorite flower bowl, and going out to see the moon.
And I sat down on the ground, and ate the grapes, and she ate the skin; and I spat the grapes with my strength far away.
The moon is hidden in the clouds, it seems that the clouds are moving, and the moon suddenly disappears, and the light is dark and it is a bit sharp.
The poems about the coming month flooded my mind, and I liked the phrase very clearly: every time three or five people gathered/full of the light of the day/a round of the day was spent/a person looked up at the name of the person.
Perhaps we have given too much emotion to the color of the moon, but for my present conclusion, it is best to say that God to God, Caesar to Caesar.
The color of the moon is the color of the moon, the emotion is yours.
After eating the grapes, the group is cold and cold.
With a tiny whisper at her feet, the Nan group stood up and laid her little blanket on the side of her little house, where Nana was happy to lie down.
Open the door and shout: "Is the bath water hot?"
The window of the bathroom is not visible from the moon, only the moon color can be felt, the bathroom lights are turned off and the glass is pulled open.
No mooncake or drink.

Is Mawar running for the Dhanbadhai Assembly seat in Juwar?
Chairman of the Mawara General Assembly, Naradushri Khyber Singh: The discussion of the Supreme Council of the National Front is underway!
The Dhanbeei state seat upcoming election is a matter of concern whether the Mawar of the Nationalist party will contest this traditional state seat.
However, after convening a meeting, the Central Committee of the Mawara Party announced that the supreme council of the National Front would be handed over to decide whether to continue handing over the traditional Mawara parliamentary seat to the Mawara Party or to the other party members.
After presiding over the meeting of the Mawara Central Committee on Thursday afternoon, Liu Xiaobo told the media that any by-election will be held according to the standard operating procedure (SOP) and will be decided after the meeting of the Supreme Council of the Mawara National Party.
He said that since the Election Commission will meet on Monday to finalize the matter of the Dhanbhai state by-election, the meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front is expected to be held in early October.
Yesterday morning (26th) I also met with the National Party Chairman Nadu Sri Alamzah and we agreed that we must reclaim this seat from the hands of the coalition hopes.
We decided to hold a special meeting of the National Front leaders in early October, where the National Front's three party party leaders will determine which member party will be in the line.
Asked whether Mawara would hold the traditional parliamentary seat to the National Front Supreme Council, Liu Xiaobo reiterated that as Chairman General of Mawara, he must act according to standard operating procedures, so any decision must be made by consensus of the National Front.
In any by-election, people are willing to campaign, there are parties, somehow think they should come out, this is common practice.
What is the most important thing about which organization and political alliance we are from?
"This is a great test for us to form a political alliance over the years, and we believe that the National Front has come a long way and maintains some valuable values".
"It's weird that someone might say something in the process.
But once the Supreme Council of the National Front has made a decision, everyone must be fully prepared for war, which is the most precious thing.
In any case, Liu Xiaobo said that Mawara will prepare fully for the upcoming Danbian A-level by-election in three levels, namely District Council, State Joint Committee and Central Committee.
The Zhong District meeting will be led by the Chairman of the Zhong District Association (Dangbei Ai) Nadukshiri Huangye; the State Joint Commission will be led by the Chairman of the Joint Commission of the Zhong District, Nadukshing Ling; and the Central Committee will be personally deployed by the Chairman of the Joint Commission, Nadukshing Mahanchun.

A village in Hubei Bokong County hunting wildlife is ordered to make a pilgrimage to the mountains.
A village in Parkong County, Hubei, was sentenced for hunting wildlife and ordered to pay RMB 154,20 for environmental damage to ecological resources.
Due to the family poverty of the accused, the prosecutor's office enabled the cost of alternative labour compensation ecological repair, achieving the organic unification of legal effect and social effect.
Wang Zhongliang, deputy prosecutor of the Parkong County Prosecutor's Office, explained on the 27th that through three months of forced labor and alternative labor, such as mountain biking, the defendant has established a deep bond with wild boar and feels deeply guilty about his previous hunting behavior.
On June 21, a criminal civil civil civil interest lawsuit in the field of ecological resources filed by the Parkong County Prosecutor's Office was opened to the public in the county court and sentenced in court.
The accused was sentenced to three years in prison, four years probation and fined 3,000 yuan, while ordering him to compensate for environmental damage to ecological resources and repair costs of 154,20 yuan.
The investigation began in late January 2014 with the installation of power grids at the cliffs, and hunting more than 20 wild animals, including zebras, small lizards, and crown deer.
The zebra is a national endangered wildlife reserve of the second category, and the small lizard and the crown deer are listed in the National Register of Land Wildlife Conservation.
During the trial, Zhou Shuo refused to admit his wrongdoing and actions and was willing to assume the accompanying civil responsibility.
But given the poor economic situation in the village of Zhou, the local village committee, the forest station and the Zhou trio, coordinated by the Parkong County Prosecutor's Office, reached an agreement on alternative labor compensation and ecological repair costs: the cost of ecological repair costs for public service workers were compensated by providing a year of mandatory maintenance work, maintenance of crops and forest protection in the village of Zhou.
On the recommendation of the prosecutor, the court acknowledged that it agreed to the obligation to actively implement the ecological repair costs of alternative labour compensation while enforcing the suspension on Sunday.
So far, Sumo has been in the reserve for three months, and the tour is active and performs well.
In recent years, the Park County Prosecutor's Office has in practice incorporated the organic integration of prosecutorial functions and social governance practices, scientifically applied methods of supervision such as prosecutorial advice, surveillance of detection, and litigation supervision, to minimize the damage to the ecological environment caused by criminal acts through judicial means.
The United Nations awarded the Earthwatchers Award for the Forest of Limestone
In a warm applause and a revived musical voice, Xu Deete, head of the Yangtze Forest Project, and Shen Liang, the user representative, took the podium and received the 2019 United Nations Earthwatchers Prize from the host.
The 2019 Earthwatchers Award ceremony was held in New York, USA, where the Earthwatchers Award ceremony was held to reward the Earthwatchers incentive and action award for the Earthwatchers Project, which has engaged hundreds of millions of people in environmental protection actions using mobile phones.
A week ago, the UN Environment Programme announced the list of winners at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but the people who attended the awards ceremony that day were still excited.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, UN Environment Programme Executive Director Ingue Anon said that the Yangtze Forest Forest is an exciting innovation that moves hundreds of millions of people to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humanity can do for the environment.
It will have a huge impact by connecting people and the environment with technology, so that every individual can participate in the action to protect the planet.
The Zhongsong Forest was launched in August 2016 on the payment platform by China Zhongsong Financial Services Group (Zhongsong Goldware) where users accumulate green energy by recording their green journeys in their daily lives in Zhongsong Forest, paying for water electricity online, and other low-carbon activities.
For every virtual tree grown by users, the forestry and public utility partners plant the next real tree in desertified areas.
As of August this year, 500 million tonnes of forest logging users have cumulatively cut carbon emissions by 7.92 million tonnes, and planted 122 million trees in desertified areas.
In the award ceremony for the National Environmental Efforts of Costa Rica, the award was presented to the Earth Guard, and the award winner, Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado, praised the contribution of the forest forest frog, which has inspired so many people to participate in the green action and impressed.
The Chairman and CEO of Zhengqing, Yi Yiwu, said that the Zhengqing Earth Guard Award is a confirmation of the Zhengqing Project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for people to participate in low-carbon lives, an honor that belongs to all participants.
He said that the last three years of deforestation has affected 500 million people, and the goal of deforestation in the next three years is to get 1 billion people worldwide involved in low-carbon actions.
While fighting desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how to make farmers' income more from the green water of the mountains.
In addition to providing employment opportunities through tree planting, the hope is to help farmers achieve increased revenue through agricultural product development projects and e-commerce platforms.
The public-benefit environmental protection model created by the Forestry Institute based on digital technology has also been successfully launched and has been adopted by other countries.
In June, the Philippines' largest silicon e-wallet, GCash, launched the Philippine version of the silicon forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon living.
GCash, working with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and environmental protection public benefit organizations, plans to plant 365,000 trees within the Philippines within a year of the project's launch.
The Earth Guard Award is the highest award in the field of environmental protection of the United Nations and is awarded once a year.
The award was won by the Chinese project for green innovation, which won the award for the third consecutive year after the builder of the Sehan Forest in China, the demonstration of the Chinese village of Xiang, and the renovation of the village of Wang, in Zhejiang province.
Economic and trade friction affected the US economic performance.
The second quarter economic performance chart of the United States shows that the private sector's investment and exports have been significantly affected by the decline, and the growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States has slowed significantly compared to the previous quarter.
Analysts noted that the economic and trade friction and the uncertainty it brought about were the main factors that led to the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
Final correction data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on 26th showed that the U.S. GDP grew 2% year-on-year in the second quarter, the correction data released before was the same, but significantly lower than the 3.1% in the first quarter.
Data shows that consumption growth is the main factor supporting the U.S. economic growth in the second quarter.
Personal consumption spending, which accounts for about 70% of the total U.S. economy, grew by 4.6% in the quarter, driving economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government spending and investment have driven economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment in the second quarter fell 6.3% from the previous quarter, dragging economic growth of 1.16 percentage points in the quarter; exports fell 5.7% from the previous quarter, net exports dragged economic growth of 0.68 percentage points in the quarter.
Barry Knapp, managing partner of the US-based Ainside Macrosocial Consulting Company, said private sector investment not only failed to maintain the growth momentum last year but also fell sharply, as economic and trade friction and rising uncertainty hit business confidence.
Knap believes that US corporate capital spending is expected to remain down next year, due to the impact of policy uncertainty.
Analysts believe that while consumption growth provided strong support for the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are increasing signs that economic and trade friction and the uncertainty it brings has affected consumer confidence and adversely affected the prospects for U.S. consumption.
Richard Curtin, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, who led the survey, said yesterday that in a recent survey, 38% of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, a new high in six months.
For the future US economic trend, analysts generally believe that the US economy will continue to slow down.
But experts also said that if the economic and trade friction is eased, the performance of the US industrial sector and financial markets will improve.
Global economist Karen Birch of the British Economist's Think tank predicts that the US economy will continue the gradual downward trend since this year, and the growth rate will fall to a level lower than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, predicts that the U.S. economy will grow at 2.3 percent this year and further slow to 1.6 percent next year, assuming that economic and trade friction no longer continues to escalate.
Ellen Harkin, investment manager at Patnan Investment Company, noted that the biggest concern of the current enterprise is the uncertainty surrounding the trade dispute and its consequences. If the trade dispute is resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced and the performance of the industrial sector will be much better than it is now.
Matt Mealy, a stock strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said that economic friction remains the number one issue, and that it is the main reason for the sharp fluctuations in the U.S. capital market this year.
Ningxia's first couple and joint parenting leave parents of children aged 0 to 3 can take 10 days off per year
Safeguarding women's legitimate rights and interests is an expression of respect and protection of human rights and an important sign of progress in social civilization.
On September 27, at the 15th meeting of the 12th Plenary Session of the People's Standing Committee of the Ningxia Baih Autonomous Region, the Women's Rights and Rights Guarantee Regulations of the Ningxia Baih Autonomous Region were approved by a large vote.
This is the comprehensive system of local regulations promulgated by the provincial level of the Ministry of Ninja to protect the legitimate rights and interests of women, which will be officially implemented from November 1, 2019.
It is understood that the current regulations were revised in accordance with the provisions of the Law on the Protection of Women's Rights in the People's Republic of China, implemented in 2007 in Pyongyang, and are divided into articles 9 and 65, including the general rights, political rights, cultural educational rights, labour and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, marriage rights, family rights, legal responsibilities and annexes.
In the context of the regulations, Ningxia encouraged exploration of the practice of couples' joint parenting leave, which is still the first in the country.
In April, the State Council Office issued guidance on promoting the development of childcare services for children under 3 years of age, which described the couple's co-parenting as relevant.
In the process of revising the regulations, Ningxia proposed the innovation to encourage the employee unit to give joint parental leave to couples who have children in accordance with the laws and regulations, every 10 days each year between the ages of 0 and 3 years of age of the children.
At the same time, the statute highlights anti-sexual harassment and protection of women minors.
Article 43 of the Zhou Ordinance incorporates the latest legislative results of the current Chinese Civil Code on the rights of persons, and provides detailed provisions on the constituent elements of sexual harassment, the subject and mechanism of anti-sexual harassment.
Article 44 of the Education Ordinance explicitly prohibits the frequent sexual abuse of girls and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, prevention and prevention work, which becomes the new benchmark for protecting girls in local legislation.
Regarding the right of women to know and to deal with common property of married families, Article 35 of the Constitution clearly stipulates the right of women to know and the obligation of the property registration body and relevant entities to provide strong institutional support for women's rights.
In addition, Article 26 of the Employment Regulations not only prohibits direct discrimination, but also orders the prohibition of indirect discrimination, and absorbs the latest joint practice experience, strengthens the discipline against gender discrimination violations, and more vigorously upholds the legitimate rights of women.
In recent years, the Unified Public Prosecution Law Department of the Ninja Women's Association, civil affairs and other departments have been very effective in promoting and introducing social professional forces to engage in mediation of family disputes and family violence in marriage.
The Constitution summarizes and enhances this, encourages mobilization of social forces, gathering social resources to jointly defend women's rights and interests, and requires the people's government at the county level to provide stable and institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services.
In Mongolia, the workstation of the alumnus of the Xiangjian University of Technology has broken the silicon valley of salt and salt water and metals
The reporter learned from the Zhongshanjiang Administrative Office of the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia on the 27th that the Zhongshanjiang University of Science and Technology's workstation for salt water resistant pumpkin field testing and acceptance review report was uploaded on the 27th day of the meeting.
A team of experts on the production of samples from the Zhongshan salt series of salt water pumps was collected on site by six experts from the Agricultural Academy of Sciences, Yangzhou University and the Agricultural Village of Hunan Province.
After expert assessment, at pH 8.8 to 9.6, the salt content in the soil of 5‰ to 6‰, the average yield of sodium silicon in salt water resistant to hydrochloric acid reaches 508.8 kg.
Wangsheng, Executive Chairman of the Working Station of Zhang Lingping, said: "We intend to innovate and reform on the basis of this year's trial, to cultivate and optimize the salt-resistant water-resistant strains again, so that the quality is better and the production is higher".
The head of the team of experts for testing, the vice-dean of the Agricultural Science Institute of the province of Hlaingjiang, and the researchers came to say: "I think that under the premise that the production elements will remain the same, I think that the continuous strengthening of the scientific offensive and the salt-resistant water pump will continue to work miracles in the salt-resistant soil.
Xinjiang is part of the Dakhming An-nam District of the Central Ganges Special Zone.
In October 2018, the work of Professor Liu Lingping was unveiled by the Xianglian Union.
Professor Pyongyang led a team of experts to accelerate the introduction and promotion of the latest cultivated salt-resistant hybrid strains and advanced technologies, and built 960 salt-resistant salt-resistant salt-resistant base in the center of the Korean right, using marginal test demonstrations and marginal technical routes to promote the increase in production and wealth of the local poor population.
This salt-resistant saltwater pumpkin field test not only gave hope for the upliftment of low-production fields in the saltwater region of Xinjiang, but also provided scientific basis for saltwater pumpkin cultivation in China under similar conditions.
According to Australian Net, after a marathon-like debate and weeks of protests, the Australian state passed the abortion legalisation bill on September 26 local time.
The bill has sparked political debate in the last eight weeks and has been a source of serious disagreement within the Liberal Party of Australia since the independence MP Greenwich announced the introduction of the bill.
After nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Australian New Zealand Senate passed the abortion legalization bill late on 25 April by 26 votes to 14, making it the third longest-running bill in New Zealand's Senate to be considered.
On the morning of the 26th, after the last vote in the New State House of Representatives, New State legalized abortion.
The bill allows women to terminate their pregnancy at 22 weeks of pregnancy, and allows women to have abortions later in pregnancy if both doctors agree.
The Senate passed an amendment late on the 25th, allowing doctors to seek advice from the multidisciplinary panel of the Hospital Advisory Committee before performing abortion surgery on women 22 weeks after pregnancy.
In addition, the amendments passed by the Senate also included that doctors must provide appropriate care for babies who survive termination of pregnancy.
New Jersey Governor Berry Griglin has previously faced open criticism from conservatives over the bill, and Berry Griglin has intervened several times to gain more time for debate over the bill, but she did not attend the final vote.
Berikiklin defended his absence from voting: "Oh, I need to spend time managing the entire new state".
Australian Liberal Party MP Davis, who was the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, was reportedly threatening to withdraw from the new state government because of the bill, and said the bill triggered a crisis in the government.
But afterwards, Davis made concessions.
Davis said: "The amendments to the Abortion Legalisation Bill submitted to the House of Representatives on the morning of the 26th actually provide more safeguards for women and doctors.
Meanwhile, Barillaro, leader of the Australian New States National Party, said he was proud to be part of the government that legalized abortion.
"What we achieved last night was historic for New York State, it legalized abortion, it is no longer a criminal act, and it will not treat abortion women as criminals".

Minister of Finance, Liu Quan: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have allocated $860.1 billion in state funds to the Social Security Fund.
Finance Minister Qin Quang said on 27th that as of now, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the allocation of some state capital to the Social Security Fund, with a total allocation of about 861.1 billion yuan.
The above statement was made by Qinqu at the meeting of the State Capital Refinance Fund Task Force, which was convened jointly by the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the State Finance Commission on the same day.
The redistribution of some state-owned capital-rich social security funds is an important initiative to reform and improve the basic pension insurance system, is a full expression of the results of the development of state-owned enterprises and the generational equity of the basic pension insurance system, and is a current and long-term policy measure.
In 2017, the State Council issued a plan to implement the Social Security Fund with the capital of the state, which required the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to conduct pilot projects.
According to Qin, the work to reverse the forecast has been successful.
At the central level, the three batches of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been completed, allocating a total of about 860.1 billion yuan of state capital.
Among them, the work of the Ministry of Finance to redistribute the central financial institutions that perform the duties of investors has been substantially completed.
The central enterprise splitting has a certain scale.
At the local level, the business has been doing a succession of work on the forward-looking work.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work in the two provinces of Zhejiang and Yunnan was basically completed, allocating state capital of 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also carried out successive pre-classification preparations, laying the foundation for the next step in implementation of the classification.
According to the joint press release issued by the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, National Finance Commission, Tax Directorate and Securities Commission, the central and local allocation of some state-owned capital to the Social Security Fund was fully launched in 2019 and substantially completed by the end of 2020.
The conference held on the same day made a concrete deployment for the full launch of the work of the division.
The conference stressed the need to do the work of redistributing effectively and effectively.
According to the progress arrangements, the work to be done by the end of 2020 should be completed.
The work schedule is tight and the task is heavy.
He said that the regions and sectors should be organized carefully and closely, to ensure that the work is done as requested; to advance the work and to understand the content of the policy; to strengthen communication coordination and to solve the problems in a timely manner.
The state funds are allocated to the Social Security Fund. The starting point of the Social Security Fund money bags started with the aim of providing strong support for pension insurance.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple transfer of ownership of the physical place, but the opening of mathematical addition of the physical place.
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Human Resources, National Finance Commission, Tax Directorate, Securities and Exchange Commission jointly issued a notice on the comprehensive launch of the redistribution of some state capital to social security fund work.
The documents were released and implemented quickly by departments such as the Ministry of Finance.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance will transfer 10% of its holdings in Commercial Bank and Agricultural Bank to the Social Security Fund, with the total value of the two shares being over 115 billion yuan.
According to the regulations, the entities that are responsible for the social security fund, such as the Social Security Foundation, as financial investors, enjoy the right to acquire, dispose of and know about the state owned shares.
The Ministry of Labour and Agriculture said in the announcement that the changes in rights will not lead to changes in shareholders and actual controllers of the holding company.
In this regard, he argues that similar divisions of state-owned enterprises are not a simple change in ownership, but can stimulate a series of effects.
The first step in the allocation of some state funds to social security is the result of the law.
After years of reform and development, state enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important sectors and sectors of our economy, and overall profitability is strong and more stable.
Among them, the leading enterprises are continuously achieving excellence and strength.
On July 10, the State Council's Standing Meeting decided to fully launch the work of the Social Security Fund this year to allocate some state capital.
The Ministry of Finance said that it will work with relevant departments, in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Meeting of the State Council, to fully implement the work of splitting some state capital into social security funds, fully reflecting the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system and the development of state-owned enterprises.
The second step of the split was to strengthen the sustainability of our Social Security Fund and further strengthen the foundation of the Social Security system.
As the population ages, the social security funds in China are under pressure, and this time as a devolved entity, the state funds have a sustained profitability and dividend capacity, which can not only effectively supplement the social security funds but also provide the source of living water for the social security funds.
Some estimates show that for every 3.8 percentage points of allocation of state capital, the percentage of deposits in the basic pension insurance of enterprises can be reduced by 1 percentage point to support.
The third step of the spin-off, and the result of the law, is to increase the stabilizer for capital markets.
The way the entity receives the dividend is divided into dividends and the transaction is carried out as a sub-section.
The Social Security Fund, as a financial investor in state capital, does indeed focus on earning dividend dividends.
However, the Social Security Fund, as a value investor in the capital market, has a stronger capital operating capacity.
For publicly traded assets in state capital, participation in social security funds will further optimize the corporate governance structure of publicly traded enterprises, which will help to raise the level of business of enterprises and have a positive positive impact on publicly traded companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the Social Security Fund, as a benchmark for investment, has increased shareholding weight, which contributes to further enhancing its influence in the market and plays a role as a stabilizer in the market.
In addition, it is also conducive to fully exploiting the value of institutional investors' discovery of the function of the leverage, guiding investors to rational investment and value investing.

The US Senate approved Scalia as Minister of Labor - Xinhua
Washington, Sept. 26, News Agency (CNN) Reporter Sunning Shenlai: The Senate of the United States Congress voted on the nomination of President Trump for the position of Minister of Labor for Eugene Scalia on September 26.
The vote was 53 in favour and 44 against, and no Democrat voted for Scalia.
Republicans believe that Scalia's background makes him well suited to serve as Minister of Labor.
But in the eyes of the Democrats, Scalia has long been opposed to workers and unions throughout his career as a lawyer.
Scalia will replace Alexander Acosta.
Acosta, then Minister of Labor, announced his resignation in July under intense pressure from public opinion after allegedly being treated harshly by American billionaire Jeffrey Epstein for alleged sexual assault and trafficking of girls.
Scalia, 56, is a partner in a well-known law firm in the United States whose father is the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
The Department of Labor is a cabinet-level department of the federal government of the United States, responsible for labor-related matters.
The White House also issued a statement on the same day saying that Trump has nominated Peter Gainer, acting secretary of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to formally lead the agency.
According to the procedure, Gaina's nomination must also be approved by the Senate of Congress.
The Federal Emergency Measures Agency, affiliated with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, coordinates federal government resources to deal with emergencies and follow-up events such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks and others that occur in the United States.

Iran has confirmed the development and development of advanced centrifuges, further suspending implementation of the nuclear deal with Iraq
According to the Xinhua news agency Xinhua, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of the United Nations said on 26 September that Iran has violated the Iran nuclear agreement once again by using advanced centrifugal machinery to make silicon.
Iran is reportedly gradually violating the restrictions of the Iran nuclear deal in response to US President Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018, restoring and strengthening sanctions against Iran.
Iran has suspended two further commitments in July to keep the stock of titanium enriched below 300 kg and the purity of titanium enriched below 3.67%, and now there are further steps.
Under the nuclear agreement, Iran will only be able to set up about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to accumulate uranium enrichment, and will only allow Iran to use a small number of more advanced models for research, but not produce uranium enrichment.
If Iran succeeds in developing a more advanced centrifuge, it will be able to produce titanium enrichment at several times the speed, possibly for use in the manufacture of nuclear bombs.
The International Atomic Energy Agency report noted: "On September 25, the agency confirmed that Iran's advanced centrifugal pumps, the Type 2 and Type 3 research and development aircraft, are accumulating or are ready to accumulate uranium".
The International Atomic Energy Agency submitted the report to the member states on 26 May, and a diplomatic official responded by saying: "They are busy at the Natanz enrichment facility".

The Italian Minister of Education proposed a sugar tax to protect the health of the people.
The Minister of Education of the new Italian government, Lorenzo Fioramonti, a member of the Five Star Movement, presented a motion to Parliament yesterday, suggesting that the Italian government implement a new tax policy on sugary drinks, snacks and air tickets.
According to reports, the Italian government will impose a snack tax on health-damaging food items such as sugary drinks and snacks, as well as an environmental tax on air tickets, a €1 fee for domestic flights and €1.5 fee for international flights, according to a bill proposed by Education Minister Fioramounty.
Fioramounti said that the government expects to get 3 billion euros in tax revenue through this series of seemingly small tax measures.
The tax revenue will be used for education, health and environmental protection.
In response, Italian Prime Minister Conte said he thought it was a viable plan; Italian MP, MEP and Union leader Salvini tweeted ironically, "Please hide the desserts, cookies, bread and candy as soon as the new government starts to levy a snack tax".
The report noted that the snack tax refers to a special tax on sugary drinks and high-calorie foods.
The taxation of this tax is beneficial for public health.

The first autonomous taxi fleet of Baidu is starting its pilot operation
Yesterday, Baidu announced in Yangsha that the autonomous taxi company Robotaxi has officially started its pilot operation.
The first batch of 45 Apollo vehicles developed jointly with a Red Flag car company, the Red Flag EV and Robotaxi, have been opened for test run in the Yangsha section.
From the same day, ordinary citizens of Changsha can log in to the Apollo website to apply to become a seed user and have the opportunity to try out the experience.
One experienced passenger said he sat in the back row of the vehicle and clicked on the screen in front of the passenger seat, which opened the vehicle's automatic driving path with a single click.
In the vehicle, for the safety of passengers and the requirements of current policy regulations, the test vehicle is equipped with a security guard at the driving position to maximize passenger safety.
During the journey, the vehicle can make intelligent changes based on the road conditions, and can judge the driving conditions of the surrounding vehicle, and make automatic avoidance of situations such as nearby supercar.
Throughout the experience, the passenger zone screen shows the status of pedestrians, cars, and even some traditional blind areas on the road in real time.
Even if the vehicle is shaded, you can see information in advance about the red and green lights and the waiting time, and all the traffic conditions are visible.
I've heard about driverless driving on TV before, thinking it's far away from us, but today it feels magical to find it in our lives.
We look forward to it really coming into people's lives in the future.
In June 2019, Apollo received 45 manned test licenses issued by the Yangtze City Government.
Currently, the Autonomous Driving Test Road in Changsha is open, passing through the city of artificial intelligence technology, Lake Meiji, Lake Yang, Dawang Mountain, and the Yangtze district, reaching a total length of 135 kilometers, the demonstration area reaches 70 square kilometers, is currently the longest road distance, largest area, covering the most complex scenarios, and the most advanced intelligent driving demonstration area in the road collaboration infrastructure of China.
The Apollo Robotaxi team is expected to cover about 50 kilometres of test roads in Yangtze by the end of 2019, and plans to cover the 135 kilometres of roads currently open in Yangtze in the first half of 2020.

On the afternoon of 27 Beijing time, the Chinese women's team hosted the ninth match of the 2019 Women's World Cup, against the strong Dutch women, and finally the Chinese women's team beat the Dutch women's team 3-1 to win the Women's World Cup nine times.
However, after the match, the head coach of women's volleyball, Luo Ping, expressed his dissatisfaction with the team's performance in the third leg.
In the third innings, the opponent strengthened the offensive, and we were able to score a goal without a strong offense, and our mistakes were especially high.
It's hard to play against strong teams, and it's so much mistakes.
He said in an interview after the game.
"We told our teammates to focus, once the attack is not in place, we will make the adjustment and we will defend with each other".
Luoping also criticized Zhang Xuanping's performance, saying that she faced some difficulties in the offense, was more urgent, and wanted to kill the ball, and the action would be distorted.
I hope she is patient, and we all protect her.
China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
(New China 70s) White Paper: China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The White Paper notes that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The White Paper said that with China's comprehensive national and international influence rapidly increasing, some people internationally fear that China will take the path of a strong nation, and some have raised the so-called "China threat".
This is a cognitive misreading, deep-rooted prejudice, a psychological imbalance that has been eradicated, and a deliberate distortion of the defence of our vested interests.
Achieving national prosperity, national revitalization, and people's happiness is both the dream of the Chinese people and the common dream of the peoples of the countries.
China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The White Paper notes that China is the main stabilizer and driver of global economic growth, China is the largest contributor to global economic growth, Chinese technological innovation injectes new energy into global economic growth, and the role of stabilizers and drivers of the future Chinese economy is more emphasized.
The current global economic growth is underpowered and a robust Chinese economy is increasingly important to the world.
China's economy is moving from rapid growth to high-quality development, new types of industrialization, informatization, urbanization, accelerated advancement of agricultural modernization, deep adjustment of economic structure, continuous upgrading of industrial optimization, and new economic growth points are emerging.
According to the research report of the University of Hong Kong's Global Research Institute, the integration of China and the rest of the world's economies is expected to create economic value of $22 trillion to $37 trillion by 2040, equivalent to 15% to 26% of the global economy.
The White Paper stresses that the Chinese economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and are deeply intertwined.
China's economic performance is more stable, the quality of growth is higher, the growth prospects are sustainable, and it is good for the world economic development in the long term.
To see China's economic development as a threat, a challenge, and a challenge, and to try to push China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain, value chain, to break China's link with the world economy, is both impossible and harmful.
The White Paper notes that the full open to foreigners creates more opportunities for countries to share Chinese dividends.
China is determined to stick to its mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of openness, achieve greater strength and higher levels of openness to the outside world. China has the most potential consumer market in the world, China is the most attractive investment destination, and it is going out on a larger scale to benefit more countries.
Opening up should be bilateral and mutually beneficial, not one-sided, benefiting one another.
Mutual benefits and bilateral ties can last for a long time.
The White Paper said China is committed to continuously expanding imports, easing market access, improving business environment, strengthening intellectual property protection, and other countries should also expand openness and take appropriate steps to improve their business environment.
Only the parties can move forward to create an environment of development that is open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win, and to make the cake cake jointly developed larger and create a community of mutually beneficial and win-win interests.
The White Paper notes that China provides more public products to the international community.
Including promoting high-quality co-construction, building a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively carrying out foreign assistance.
China's development benefits the international community and will never forget to return to the international community to provide more and better public products to the international community.

Foreign Ministry responds to Taiwan's so-called diplomatic breakthrough:
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Sheng said that this small move was unfortunate and laughed at the large part of the Chinese delegation, who had visited the UN headquarters on religious issues the day before.
A reporter asked that Taiwanese media reported that staff from Taipei's New York office had entered the United Nations headquarters yesterday to attend a meeting on religious issues held in the United States, and called it a diplomatic breakthrough.
This meeting you mentioned was a side meeting held by the United States on the United Nations site, not a meeting of the United Nations at all.

The demonstration was held in Egypt, where the president fell, and authorities showed strong repression.
The hashtags and social media are strongly encouraging the Egyptian masses to take to the streets today to appeal peacefully for President Sisi's resignation.
But authorities have indicated that they intend to use force to suppress the situation.
Since the military coup in 2013 that took power, the then military chief, Sisi, has almost disappeared from the face of Egypt, and any form of protest could be in extreme danger.
The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a Cairo NGO, reported that more than 1,900 people have been arrested since the rare outbreak of protests demanding Sisi's ouster last weekend.
Corruption allegations of vain pursuit of the public around Cece and his family led thousands of people to march on the streets on the 20th.
The Egyptian Interior Ministry said yesterday that any attempt to undermine the stability of the country would be decisive and unyielding.
The city center of Cairo has been on guard since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, and the streets around Tahrir Square are lined with town mobs, security vehicles and uniformed police.
Peninsula TV reported that security forces detained several important academics and social figures on the 25th, including Nafa, a professor of political science at Cairo University and a well-known columnist.
He tweeted on the 24th: "I have no doubt that continuing to allow Cece's absolute rule will cause disaster.
He immediately resigned in accordance with Egypt's interests.
Hosni, a spokesman for Amman, the former Egyptian chief of staff, was held in custody before Nafa was arrested.
Anhui was arrested last year after trying to run for the presidency with Cece.
The president of the Constitutional Party, Davud, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that the way dissenters are swept away reflects the instability and fragility of the government at a time when the economic hardships of the poor and middle class are escalating.
Ayman Nour, leader of the opposition party and former presidential contender, said: "The arrest of the rebels highlights the regime's indifference to the Egyptian people and how much it fears itself".
Because the economy has been thrown into a state of confusion by him, coupled with the widespread political repression, Cece tried to convey a clear message to important generals and political figures who could replace him.
Norr pointed out that the government's use of high-pressure methods will only increase the anger of the people under the premise that the socio-economic situation continues to deteriorate.
Since the fear barrier has been broken, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Ali, a businessman and actor currently living in exile in Spain, who was a contractor for Egyptian military construction, started uploading a series of videos earlier this month, accepting the benefits of government corruption, and sparked a small demonstration in different cities over the weekend.
Ali said his company Amrak General contracted without having to go through a legal tender process to get lucrative contracts, stressing the corruption of the military and the Sisi family, including First Lady Tissar Amer al-Sisi.

The party committee of five universities, including Hunan University, was responsible for the gays, and the provincial unit directly responsible for gays made the speech.
The two high-pressure engineering projects have been carried out in one go.
On the 26th, the project of high-voltage direct current transmission power project from the east to the southwest ± 1100 kV, the project of the Sutum 1000 kV transmission special high-voltage GIL integrated pipeline project was launched.
Both projects have achieved high points in the respective fields of current world transmission technology, and after the launch will allow China's energy broad range optimization to be significantly improved.
Guo Qi, chief economist of the National Energy Agency, said that the project from East to South Korea is the largest electricity transmission capacity in the world and the most remote transmission of electricity.
Its investment is important for promoting the development of Xinjiang energy base and ensuring the electricity supply in the Guangdong region.
GIL, which is gas insulation metal, closed the transmission lines.
The Suzhou Pipeline Engineering, which created the record for the highest global voltage level and the strongest transmission capacity of GIL Engineering, achieved the highest voltage level of the Chinese Dongdong skeletal power grid.
According to the National Electricity Network Company, the distance of the East-South power transmission is 3324 kilometers.
If conventional technology is used, more than 15% of electricity will be lost along the way, and the project has been advanced and developed, which has significantly increased the economic transmission distance to more than 3,000 kilometers.
After the project is launched from East to South China, 100 million degrees of electricity can be transmitted every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which can help break down the problem of discharge of existing new energy in Xinjiang.
According to full load estimates, the electricity transmission of this line alone will reach 600 to 85 billion kilowatt hours per year, which will meet more than half of Shanghai's entire year.
The Sutum GIL Integrated Pipeline Project is a control project of the special high-pressure transmission network across the Yangtze River.
If the conventional airline lines cross the river, two giant iron towers over 450 meters will be built on the banks of the Yangtze River, and an artificial island the size of a football field over four will be built for each iron tower.
To this end, the bold innovation of the national grid, the development of the compact special high-pressure exchange GIL transmission technology, which crosses the river from the water through the tunnel, avoids the impact on the gold channel.
The two projects have taken a new leap forward in our capacity to manufacture electrical equipment.
Currently, the national power grid has been built in 10-11 straight-line high-pressure projects, and 4-3 straight-line projects are under construction.
Foreign Office: Foreign debt structure continuously optimised and stability enhanced
Overall, China's external debt structure continues to improve and the stability of foreign debt is enhanced.
Wang Chun-ing, the chief economist and spokesman for the National Office of Foreign Exchange Administration, said on the 27th that the main indicators of our foreign debt are within the internationally recognized security line, and the overall foreign debt risk is controllable.
Wang Chun-ing made the above statement when he answered a reporter's question, releasing the foreign debt data at the end of June 2019 by the Foreign Exchange Service on the same day.
Data shows that China's total external debt balance (including foreign currency) was $198.0 billion at the end of June 2019, up from $26.3 billion at the end of March 2019, an increase of 1.3%, mainly due to the growth of debt securities balance.
In the second quarter of 2019, over 70% of China's total external debt growth was driven by non-residents buying domestic yuan bonds, and non-residents were mainly medium-term investors such as central banks.
At the end of June 2019, the medium-term foreign debt accounted for a 3 percentage points increase compared to the end of March 2019, and the foreign debt accounted for a 1 percentage point increase compared to the end of March 2019.
Wang Chun-ing said that with yuan bonds in China being included in the Bloomberg Global Comprehensive Index in April 2019, international investors have continued to increase their recognition of the Chinese bond market and continue to hold yuan bonds in China.
China's international payments are kept in overall balance and foreign debt risks are controllable.
The journalist learned from Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences on the 27th that the current situation of grassland grazing in Yunnan has been effectively controlled without causing major floods and the work on control has achieved phased results.
In January this year, Yunnan's Pyongyang city, Jiangxi province, first discovered grassland grazing night owls that migrated from abroad, and subsequently confirmed in 129 counties of Yunnan, grassland grazing night owls also spread gradually from Yunnan to mainland China, posing a direct threat to Chinese food production.
The grasshopper is a multi-focused, long-distance migratory important agricultural pest native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, and is a major migratory pest in the UN FAO global warning, characterized by its international, migratory, outbreak and destructive pest.
The pest harms more than 80 crops such as corn, sugarcane, and cane, and can cause up to 70% loss of production.
The problem is difficult to control, and there is no registered pesticide for the pest in China.
Since the grassland greedy night owl migrated into Yunnan, Yunnan Province Agricultural Science Academy has selected Liu Xiaobo researchers to lead the provincial innovation team of Yunnan Agricultural Science Academy Agricultural Cross-border Harmful Biology Cooperative and Green Control Province to go to the front line, field investigations, sampling, and technical guidance and demonstration.
The team of Liu Yi-dong has initially mastered the population characteristics of the grassland of Yunnan, the insect resources, the characteristics of the source of foreign insects, the migration trajectory of the population, the toxicity of drugs and the effect of field control.
They actively conducted research and application of green control technology, implementing new green control technologies such as population monitoring, insect bait, scientific use drugs and agricultural measures, and have achieved more than 90% of the control effect in the demonstration area, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting hostile resources and ecological environment, and providing technical guarantees for the effective control of the wildfires and sustainable governance in Yunnan.
Currently, the Yunan grassland greed nightmare has been effectively controlled without causing major area outbreaks and the control work has achieved phased results.
The next step, Yunnan Agricultural Sciences Institute will focus on developing ecological mechanisms for population migration and invasive outbreaks, breaking through the system of biological control and green control technologies.
At the same time, actively promote international cooperation across borders, seeking to establish joint focus laboratories and joint monitoring network and demonstration zones abroad to enhance monitoring and prevention capabilities in all aspects of the Yunan grassland nightmare.

Taiwanese scholar advises: "I'm not sure when Taiwanese businessmen need to keep up with mainstream industry development on the mainland".
The Taipei 2019 Taipei Business Innovation Operating Model Forum was held in Taipei on 26 and 27 June for two consecutive days.
The event invited representatives of Taiwanese businessmen and academics to share their experiences on business transformation, innovation, shiftwork and market access.

The two-day conference was divided into several seminars, including transformation and upgrading models and operating strategies, and more than 100 people attended.
Chen Ming-yeon, director of Taipei Institute of Business Administration, said that the ongoing trade friction between China and the US continues and Taiwanese businesses face a period of uncertainty.
He believes that Taiwanese business needs to keep up with the times and keep up with mainstream industries in the development of the mainland, especially focusing on innovative products related to technology, culture, tourism and health.
Taiwanese business has always attached importance to quality, effectiveness and delivery.
Chen Ming-hwan believes that the above conditions alone are not enough for Taiwanese business at the moment.
He said that Taiwanese companies need to combine speed and service, accelerate the speed of the supply chain, and focus on extending services and life products services.
In addition, the value added value of the service is also a new area for Taiwan to grow strongly.
Speaking on behalf of Taiwanese, Chairman of Taiwanese Aymor Electronics Limited from Guangdong, Xu Wendong said that Aymor Electronics had caused operational difficulties due to the sudden decrease in orders, and the group was moving to improve its operating conditions from restructuring to activating assets.

According to Taiwan's Xiongqi Economic Daily Xiongqi, the general manager of Golden Earth Company, an operations center based in Shanghai, won the Xiongqi Award for Outstanding Taiwanese business and contribution on both sides.
New rules for opinion: Social capital is required to have the right to operate rural land
Social capital is required to have the right to operate rural land
The Rural Land Management Movement for Land Management Measures (RMMM) publicly requested opinions on the proposal to regulate the movement of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises to obtain land management rights
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs website published a notice of public consultation on the management of the transfer of rights of management of the land in rural areas. The revised draft requested a notice of public consultation.
The opinion paper is open to the public.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that in order to implement the newly amended Law on Land Contract in the Rural Areas of Yangon, further consolidate and improve the basic operating system in the rural areas, deepen the reform of the rural land system, implement the system of three-tier dividend schemes, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the methodology for transferring the management of the transfer of the rights to contract land in the Rural Areas of Yangon and formed a memorandum of understanding.
The Beijing Youth Journalist learned how many important changes were made to the first published opinion paper.
The newly amended Law on Land Contract for the Rural Lands of China clarifies the scope of land transfer, implements the concept of the three-tiered right of separation of land, and sets out the rights of land contracting and land management respectively.
In this draft opinion, in order to implement the concept of the three-tiered right to land, effectively respond to the principles of the Law on Land Contract Law and take into account the large differences in the transfer of land rights and land contract management rights, exchange of rights, transfer of rights, etc., the draft amendment defines the scope of the transfer, focusing on the transfer of land rights, transfer methods including leasing and entering into shares, and modifying the name of the regulatory method of transfer of land contract management rights and transfer of rights to management of land contract management methods.
Alternative management measures will be introduced for the transfer and exchange of the rights to contract land.
The commentary notes that in the context of the three-tiered division of rights, farmers' shares are only a limited amount of land management rights.
In theory, even if the bankruptcy clearance occurs, there is only a risk that farmers will lose their right to operate within one deadline, so the provision that the contractor is not legally required to return to the original contractor under a contract is no longer necessary and there is a conflict with the bankruptcy law.
In practice, methods have been developed to prevent the risk of land loss for farmers, such as priority shares, pre-lease and repurchase shares.
Given the more mature theoretical exploration of preferred stock in corporate law, it is recommended to use it as an advocacy provision to prevent risk of loss of equity.

Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) once again called for the mandatory installation of closed-circuit television cameras in all slaughterhouses in Australia.
David O'Shannessy, the inspector general of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), New South Wales, told ABC that it should be common practice in Australia to regulate and inspect slaughterhouses.
To those who look after animals, the monitoring system will certainly be a strong indication that animal welfare is the most important thing.
The International Seismic Map of the US Geological Survey shows that Iceland has not experienced an earthquake in the past week.
The Icelandic Meteorological Office also reported that no earthquake activity occurred in the area of Hekla in the last 48 hours.
The massive earthquake that caused the phase change occurred on March 10 on the northeast side of the volcano's summit.
The clouds at the base of the mountain are reported to have appeared unrelated to volcanic activity.
These clouds could lead people to doubt whether the volcano actually erupted.
The Luno had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel on board. After a failure, the wind and waves pushed it to the tidal deck.

The amendment was passed in both houses in 2011.
A modification was made at this legislative session, first the House removed the second sentence from it, and then the Senate approved it on Monday as a cannonade.
The second statement banning same-sex civil unions failed to pass, which could open the door to future same-sex marriage.
Following this process, the next elected legislature will review HJR-3 again in 2015 or 2016 to ensure its continued implementation.
In addition to directing films, Wotier's achievements included a hunger strike in 1973 against the political repression he saw in his eyes.

Over the past three decades, China has developed a market economy despite being still a communist country at the official level.
The first economic reform was carried out under the leadership of Liu Xiaobo.
Since then, China's economy has grown 90 times.
Last year, China's automobile exports exceeded Germany for the first time and surpassed the United States to become the largest market for automobile exports.
China's GDP is likely to outpace the United States in 20 years.
Tropical Storm Dunneyer formed in the eastern Atlantic, the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season.
The storm was about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, and had maximum sustained winds of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predicted that Daniel would strengthen into a major hurricane by Wednesday.
Given the storm's long shelf life, it is still difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, Bobek became famous when he played for Belgrade Guerrilla Football Club.
He joined the team in 1945 and played until 1958.

Luckily, nothing happened to me, but I saw a terrible scene where people tried to break the window and escape.
People are knocking on glass with chairs, but the windows are unbreakable.
Survivor Franzische Kowal said: "The young people finally broke a piece of glass and started running out the window".
Stars emit light and heat, which is because hydrogen atoms combine together to form heavier elements.
Scientists are currently working on building a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
However, this is a difficult problem to solve. It will take many years before we see a practical fusion reactor built.
Due to the surface tension, steel needles can float on the water surface.
The surface tension is caused by the strong attraction between water molecules on the surface of the water, which is greater than the attraction between water molecules and air molecules above.
Water molecules form an invisible outer layer on the surface of water, which allows needles to float on the surface.
The blade of modern skates is double-edged, with a hole between the blade and the blade. The blade has better grip on ice (even when tilted).
Because the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, the edges of the blade that come into contact with ice are curved when the blade is bent to one side.
In this way, the ice skater can turn. The ice knife tilts to the right, the ice skater turns to the right. The ice knife tilts to the left, the ice skater turns to the left.
They must eliminate the excess energy from light to restore to their previous energy levels.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent flu
Scientists call this process the "radiation of the electron" because the atom is excited by strong light and causes the emission of photons, while light is also a form of radiation.
The next image shows the situation of the atomic photon. Of course, the photon is actually much smaller than it looks in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the matter that makes up atoms!
After several hundred hours of use, the filament was finally burned and the bulb was not lit.
Then you need to replace the bulb. When replacing the bulb, you have to be careful.
First, it is necessary to turn off the switch or cut the cable connection of the lighting fixtures.
This is because when a part of the bulb is connected to the plug, when you touch the plug inside or the metal base of the bulb, electricity flows into the plug (the connection point of the bulb's metal base) and you are severely electrocuted.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which is responsible for the blood supply.
Blood flows from the heart through a tube called the artery, and then back into the heart through a tube called the vein. The smallest tube is called the hairy vein.
The teeth of the Triangle Dragon can not only bite the broken leaves, but also the very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that the Triangle dragon feeds on suet, a plant common in the Neolithic period.
These plants look like a small palm tree, and the crown is made up of nail-like, curly leaves.
Before eating the stems, the triangular dragon uses its powerful mouth to peel off the leaves.
Other scientists believe that these plants are poisonous, so dinosaurs are unlikely to eat them, even if now tree frogs and other animals such as the dinosaur's offspring can eat the toxic leaves or fruit.
If you stand on the surface of the tree, your weight will be lighter than on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth weighs about 36 pounds (16 kg) on the Wooden One. So gravity naturally produces less gravity for you.
The sun is not as flat as the earth. The whole sun is made up of gas, fire and plasma.
The thinner the gas the farther you are from the center of the sun.
The outer layer of the sun we see is called the light globular layer, which means the globular layer of the fluorescent light.
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe the celestial body and discovered that Venus had a phase consistent with the moon.
The change occurred because Venus (or the Moon) was only illuminated on one side facing the Sun. The change in Venus supported Copernicus' theory that the planet orbits the Sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a Venus sun.
After the reconquest of the Danish legal region (Danelaw), England experienced a long period of peace.
However, in 991, Esselred faced the largest Viking fleet after the Gusslum fleet a century earlier.
The fleet was led by Olaf Trigvason, a Norwegian who wanted to take Norway back from Denmark.
After an initial military defeat, Eselred finally reached an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to regain the throne, but without success.
The Han alphabet is the only special invented alphabet for everyday use, invented during the reign of Emperor Zhengzhou (1418-1450) in 1444.
King Seung-sook, the fourth monarch of the Korean dynasty, is one of the most revered monarchs.
He originally named the Korean alphabet pronunciation chart as the Song Song Min's phoneme, meaning the correct pronunciation used to teach people the correct pronunciation.
There are many claims about the origin of the Yoruba language. One of them is that the Aryans migrated from the West to India and brought their language here.
The Chinese language is an ancient language that is similar to Latin in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Chinese. After the completion of the writing of the Song Oei Book, Chinese language gradually disappeared due to the system of ranking.
The language is a highly sophisticated language and is the origin of many modern Indian languages, as is Latin, which is the origin of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the end of the war against France, Germany began preparations for the invasion of the British Isles.
Germany designated the attack as Operation Sea Lion. The British army lost most of its heavy weapons and supplies when it withdrew from Dunkirk.
But the Royal Navy was much stronger than the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) and could destroy any invading fleet across the English Channel.
However, few Royal Navy ships are stationed near potential invasion routes, as Navy commanders fear they will be sunk by German airstrikes.
Let us first explain the plans of Italy. Italy is basically the brotherhood of Germany and Japan.
The country's army and navy are both relatively weak, although they built four new ships shortly before the war began.
Italy's main objective is to conquer African countries. To capture them, they need an army base so that the army can cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
To do this, they had to withdraw British bases and ships in Egypt. Other than taking these actions, Italian warships should not have taken any action.
Now let's look at Japan. Like Britain, Japan is an island country.
Submarines are ships designed to navigate underwater, and submarines stay longer underwater.
Submarines were used during both World War I and World War II. At that time they were slow and their range of fire was very limited.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly sailed over the sea, but with the development and improvement of radar accuracy, the submarines were forced to dive underwater to avoid detection.
German submarines are known as U-type submarines. Germans are very good at navigating and operating submarines.
Because the Germans were successful in submarine operations, they were not able to handle large numbers of submarines after the war.
King Tutankhamun, sometimes known as King Tutankhamun or King Tutankhamun, was one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt in modern times.
Interestingly, he was not considered a heavyweight in antiquity and was not recorded in most ancient kings' lists.
However, his grave was discovered in 1922 and made him famous. Although many of the graves in the past were stolen, the tomb was almost untouched.
Much of Tutankhamun's burial goods are well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare gems.
The invention of the radial wheel made the Assyrian war wagons lighter, faster, and easier to ride than soldiers and other war vehicles.
They fired arrows from deadly crossbows that could penetrate enemy armor. The first cavalry was used by the Assyrians around 1000 BC.
The cavalry refers to the army that fought on horseback. The horse was not yet invented, so the Assyrian cavalry could only fight on the back of a bright horse.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the most famous figure in Greek culture is the legendary blind poet Homer, who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature: the Iliad of the Throne and the Oedipus of the Throne.
Sophocles and Aristophanes remain popular playwrights, whose plays are considered among the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek was the mathematician Pythagoras, best known for his famous theorem about the angular relations of right triangles.
There are different versions of the word Hindi. It is estimated that Hindi is the second to fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers depends on whether the closely related dialects are included.
It is estimated that the number of people who speak this language ranges between 340 million and 500 million, while the number of people who understand this language reaches 800 million.
Hindi and Urdu have similar vocabulary, but different writing styles; in everyday conversation, the two languages can often communicate with each other.
After the 15th century, the north of Estonia was heavily influenced by German culture.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to their people, so they invented the Estonian script.
It adds a letter / to the German alphabet.
Over time, many foreign words in German merged with the original vocabulary. This was the beginning of the Enlightenment movement.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne would be directly enlisted after completing his education.
However, Charles attended Trinity College, Cambridge University, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, obtaining a 2:2 degree.
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to receive a degree.
Turkey is located in parts of Europe (east of the Balkan Peninsula, in the region of Reus or Rumily) and accounts for 3% of its land area.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) long and 800 kilometers (500 miles) wide, and is roughly rectangular.
Turkey's land area (including lakes) is 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 sq mi) are in Southwest Asia, 23,764 square kilometres (9174 sq mi) are in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world, about the sum of the French mainland and the UK.
Turkey has three ring seas: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but it became independent only in 1839.
Some parts of present-day Belgium were formerly part of Luxembourg, but were ceded to Belgium after the Belgian Revolution of the 1930s.
Luxembourg has tried to become a neutral country, but it was occupied by Germany in both World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of what is now known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined fortress and Buddhist temple located in the upper part of Paro district in the village of Vander.
It is said that Zhabdrung nawang Namgyel built the fort in 1649 to commemorate his victory over the Tibetan army.
In 1951, a fire left only a few remains of Dukay Castle, such as the statue of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fort was maintained and protected, becoming one of Bhutan's most popular attractions.
18th century Cambodia was torn between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thai invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and destroyed the Golden Gate in 1772.
In the last years of the 18th century, Vietnamese invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of the workers are non-formal economic practitioners.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans are in the service sector, nearly a quarter are in industry and one-fifth are in agriculture.
Venezuela is a net oil exporter, and although only one percent of the people work in the oil industry, the oil industry remains an important industry in the country.
In the early days of the country's independence, the Singapore Botanical Garden put its expertise to good use, helping the island become a tropical pine garden city.
In 1981, the Choi Jing-Wang was chosen as the national flower of the country. It is a hybrid variety of the oranges.
Every year, after the beginning of October, about 1.5 million herbivores leave the northern mountain range, crossing the Mara River, to the rain-filled southern plains.
Then, after the rainy season in April, they returned from the west to the north and crossed the Mara River again.
Serengeti includes Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Nature Reserve in Tanzania, Maswa Wildlife Reserve and Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning how to create interactive media requires traditional skills and the tools to master in interactive courses: storyboarding, audio and video editing, storyboard design, etc.
Interactive design requires you to reassess assumptions about media production and learn nonlinear thinking.
Interactive design requires that the components of the project are interconnected, but can also exist as an independent entity.
The disadvantage of focusing lenses is that the complexity of focusing and the number of lens elements required to achieve a certain focal range is much greater than the focusing lens.
This is no longer a problem as lens manufacturers reach higher standards in lens production.
This allows the focused lens to take pictures that match the quality of the fixed focal lens.
Another disadvantage of focusing lenses is that the lens's maximum focal length (speed) is usually smaller.
This makes cheap focus-shifting lenses difficult to use in low light conditions without flashing lights.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert movies to DVD format is over-scanning.
Most TV shows are produced for entertainment.
For this reason, the edges of the images you see on TV, including the top, bottom and sides, have been cut.
This is done to ensure that images can cover the entire screen. This is called over-scanning.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, its border is likely to be cut off, and if the subtitle in the video is too close to the bottom, the subtitle will also be incomplete.
This traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination of people, bringing back images of the spear of the horse, the banquet and the spirit of King Arthur's knighthood.
Even in the ruins of a thousand years, people can easily recall the sounds and smells of wars that have passed, almost hear the collision of horses on rocks and smell the breath of fear that comes from the underground crater.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
As a typical building of the period, instead of being a real castle, it is a fortified house.
Its large glass windows and thin walls could not withstand a firm attack for long.
The country was relatively peaceful when Lord Hastings began building the castle in the 1880s, with only a small group of roaming looters to defend themselves.
The balance of power is a system in which European countries seek to maintain the sovereignty of all European countries.
The idea is that all European countries must try to prevent a country/region from becoming strong on its own, so governments often exchange allies to maintain balance.
The War of Spanish Succession marked the first war in which the balance of power was central to the issue.
This marks an important change, as the great powers of Europe will no longer be able to use religious warfare as an excuse. Therefore, the Thirty Years' War will be the last war to be labeled as a religious war.
On July 21, 356 BC, the act of Herostratus's burning caused the destruction of the goddess Almeida in Ephesus.
According to the plot, the man is willing to stand up at any cost. The angry Ephesians declared the name of the Black Rostatus ("Herostratus") to be a hard book.
The Greek historian Strabo later mentioned the name, which is the name we know today. The temple was destroyed on the night Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander the Great had proposed rebuilding the temple, but his proposal was rejected. After Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while still being able to tap all the notes correctly and try not to do too many unrelated moves.
This will save you as much energy as possible. Remember, you don't have to hit the piano key as hard to raise the volume as you do on a piano.
To improve the volume of the organ, the windbox can be pulled with more force or at a faster speed.
Mysterious pursuit of communication, identification or realization of the ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth or God.
Believers seek a direct experience, intuition or insight into the reality/deity of the divine or the gods.
Followers pursue a certain lifestyle or practice designed to nurture these experiences.
Mystery can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship because it emphasizes the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially those of peaceful, insightful, happy, or even joyful consciousness.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent that originated in Punjab in the 15th century, with internal sectarian divisions derived from Hindu traditions.
Sikhs believe that they believe in a religion different from Hinduism, although they acknowledge that Sikhism is derived from Hinduism and includes Hindu traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, meaning Guru Road Road in Punjabi. Guru is a fundamental part of all Indian religions, but is particularly high in Sikhism and has become the core of Sikh belief.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539), followed by nine other gurus.
However, Khrushchev's commitment was put to the test in June 1956, when riots against food shortages and wage cuts by Polish workers turned into protests against the communist system itself.
Although the tank was eventually restored, Khrushchev made concessions to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Vladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indian River Valley civilization is a Bronze Age civilization located in the northwestern Indian subcontinent, covering much of modern Pakistan, as well as parts of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
The civilization of the Indian River Basin flourished, and the civilization got its name from this.
Although some scholars speculate that the civilization is also present in the now-arid Saraswati basin, it is appropriate to call it the cradle of the Indian-Saraswati civilization, although some call it the Jharkhand-Palapa civilization after the first site excavated in the region in the 1920s.
The military nationalism of the Roman Empire promoted the progress and development of medicine.
Emperor Augustus began recruiting doctors and even formed the first Roman medical team for postwar medical use.
Surgeons are familiar with various sedatives, including morphine extracted from the seeds of the plant and tetanus extracted from the seeds of the plant.
In addition to using blood-stoppers and arterial veins to block blood flow, they have been able to save patients with bad breath through amputation.
In the course of centuries, the Roman Empire achieved great results in the field of medicine, which constituted much of the knowledge we know today.
The rules of the pure earth folding, which limit folding to one time only, do not allow more complex movements like reverse folding, and all folding positions must be simple.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help paper craftsmen with little experience or poor hand skills.
Children are aware of racial and racial stereotypes when they are young, and these stereotypes affect their behavior.
For example, if people modeled that a minority child is not performing well in school, they often do not perform well in school once they understand the modeling concept of their ethnicity.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States, with 54 million registered accounts.
These sites have received a lot of attention, especially in the field of education.
These sites also have benefits, such as the ability to easily create a class page with content such as blogs, videos, photos and more.
Providing an internet address makes it easy to access the page. This makes it easier to remember and easier to enter for students who do not have difficulty with keyboards or spelling.
It can be personalized to read, and can use more or less color depending on the needs.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a neurological syndrome in which three typical limiting symptoms include impulse, attention deficit, multiple movements or excess energy.
This is not a lack of learning ability, but a learning disability that affects 3 to 5 percent of all children in the United States, and may reach 2 million.
Children with ADHD have difficulty concentrating on things like homework, but they can focus on doing things they like to do, like playing games, watching favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children often get into a lot of trouble because normal methods do not stimulate their brains, and in order to stimulate their brains, they engage in dangerous behavior, fight, challenge authority.
Attention deficit disorder (ADD) affects the relationship between children with ADHD and their peers because other children cannot understand why the patient behaves, spells, or understands why their maturity is different.
When the ability to acquire knowledge and to learn changes as mentioned above, the basic rate of acquiring knowledge also changes accordingly.
The way to get information is different. Stress no longer exists in personal memories, but the ability to remember text is becoming more important.
The Renaissance fundamentally changed the way learning and knowledge spread.
What distinguished primitive humans from other primates was that they no longer moved their bodies with their hands, carried their weight, and roamed the woods.
The chimpanzees' hands and feet are similar in size and length, reflecting the fact that their hands carry weight when walking with their fingers.
Human hands are shorter than feet, meaning that the bone is straight.
Fossils of the hand between 2 and 3 million years ago have been transformed from the mode of movement to the mode of operation.
Some people believe that frequent artificial induction and lucid dreams can make people exhausted.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that the clear dream prolongs the time interval between fast-moving states.
The shorter the REM period each night, the less often the body is able to sleep well and recover its mood in this state.
It's as exhausting as waking up to watch TV every 22-30 minutes.
The effect depends on how often your brain has nightly nightmares.
The situation for Italians in North Africa was almost not ideal from the start. On June 10, 1940, less than a week after Italy declared war, the British 11th Light Cavalry captured Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In a raid in the east of Bastia, the British captured General Latousi, the commander of the Italian 10th Army of Engineers.
On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, the successor to Libyan Governor Mussolini, was shot dead by friendly forces while landing in Tobruk.
Modern fencing is divided into several levels: there is a level of initial learning for university students, and there is a level of professional and Olympic athletics.
The sport is mainly played in a duel format, which means that one fighter is facing another fighter.
Golf is a sport in which players hit a ball into a hole with a ball stick.
The regular round of matches is played with 18 holes, usually starting from the first hole of the pitch and ending with the 18th hole.
The player who finishes the game with the least number of hits or batting average wins.
The competition was held on a grass field, where the grass around the hole was cut shorter and called the fruit tree.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism, and what most people think of when they think of tourism: leisure tourism.
It refers to people going to a place that is completely different from their daily lives to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and campgrounds are often the most frequented places for leisure tourists.
If a person visits a particular place for the purpose of learning about its history and culture, this type of tourism activity is called cultural tourism.
Tourists may visit different landmarks in a particular country or may focus on one area only.
Seeing this activity, the colonists also demanded reinforcements.
The supporting forces at the front line positions included the 200-man New Hampshire 1st and 3rd Regiments, commanded by Colonel John Stack and Colonel James Reed (who later became generals).
Stark's soldiers were stationed at the defensive fence along the northern end of the colonial post.
As the tide receded, a mysterious river that flows along the northeast of the peninsula opened a gap, and they quickly built a short stone wall, extending the wall to the small beach at the northern end of the shore.
Gridley or Stark placed a log 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the tank and ordered no fire before the regular army passed.
The US plans to launch a coordinated attack from three different directions.
General John Cadwadh will launch an offensive against the British garrison in the town of Bodden, diverting the attention of the enemy to block any reinforcements.
General James Ewing led 700 militiamen to the Trenton Pass and captured the bridge over Assenpike Bay, blocking the enemy's escape route.
The 2,400-strong main force will cross the river 9 miles north of Trenton, then split into two groups, one led by Greene and one led by Sullivan, to launch an offensive before dawn.
The change from a quarter mile to a half mile race, speed became less important, and endurance became an absolute factor.
Of course, to be a top half mile runner (and finish in two minutes) you have to be fast enough and have endurance at all costs.
In winter, practice cross country running, combined with fitness exercises for the upper half, can be fully prepared for the running season.
Proper nutritional practices alone are not enough to create great performance, but this can significantly affect the overall health of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, maintaining the habit of effectively supplementing with water, and understanding all aspects of the proper use of nutritional supplements can help athletes improve performance and increase sports fun.
Mid-range running is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, participants have a lot of misunderstandings about the few pieces of equipment needed.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most products have little real impact on performance.
Athletes may think they prefer a product, although it has no benefits.
Atoms can be considered as one of the basic building blocks of all matter.
According to the simplified polar model, it is a very complex entity, containing a central atomic nucleus surrounded by electrons, which are somewhat like planets orbiting the sun. See Figure 1.1.
The atomic nucleus is made up of neutrons and protons, both of which are particles.
Protons carry positive electricity, neutrons carry no electricity. Electrons carry negative electricity.
To inspect the victims, you must first inspect the site to ensure your safety.
When approaching the victim, attention should be paid to their posture and any unconscious danger signals.
If you want to hurt others, you will only make things worse.
Research has found that depression, fear and the mood of catastrophic illness play a mediating role in the pain and disability of low back pain patients.
Only those who are concerned about the effects of mental thinking, rather than the effects of depression and fear, can conditionally perform structured sports exercises regularly every week.
People who participate in regular training need more support in their passive perception of pain to help them distinguish between chronic pain and discomfort and normal physical activity.
The ability to see or see depends on the sensory organ of the visual system, the eye.
There are many types of eye structures, and the complexity depends on the needs of the organism.
Different constructions have different functions, sensitivity to different wavelengths, and sensitivity. They also require different processing methods to understand inputs and require different amounts of inputs to achieve optimal results.
Population refers to the collection of specific species of organisms within a specific geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are at the same time on a particular pattern, it is called monotypic.
When individuals exhibit several variants of a particular trait, they are polymorphic.
The march and nesting of the troop of marines are also divided into different stages.
During the migration phase, the troops marched at night and stopped camping during the day.
When the food available is reduced, the herd will enter a migration period. At this stage, the herd will build temporary nests that are replaced every day.
This nomadic, horizontal impact action lasts about 17 days each time.
What is a cell? The word cellophane comes from the Latin word cellula, meaning cellophane, and was originally created by microscopists who observed softwood structures.
Cells are the basic constituent units of all organisms, and all organisms are made up of one or more cells.
In fact, cells have such a fundamental and critical position in biological research that they are often called the basic units of life.
The nervous system maintains a smooth flow of blood by sending nerve impulses throughout the body, thus maintaining balance within the body.
These nerve impulses can be transmitted very quickly to the whole body, keeping the body from any potential threat of harm.
Compared to other violent storms, the area of tornado attack is small, but can destroy everything along the way.
Tornadoes can uproot trees, tear up the wooden planks on buildings, and throw cars into the sky. Two percent of tornadoes are the strongest, and can last for more than three hours.
These monstrous storms, with wind speeds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph)
For thousands of years, humans have been making and using magnifying glasses.
However, the first true telescope was made in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes use a combination of two lenses to make distant objects look both close and large.
Greed and selfishness are always with us, and the essence of cooperation is that short-term selfishness always brings more benefits when it benefits the majority.
Hopefully, most people will realize that in the long run, working with others is the best option.
Many dream that one day humans can migrate to other planets and explore other worlds. Some wonder what the universe has; others believe that there may be aliens or other life on other planets.
But if this really happens, it probably won't happen again for a long time. These stars are very scattered, with their neighbours trillions of miles apart.
Perhaps one day your grandchildren's descendants will live in an alien world, guessing what their ancient ancestors lived like then.
Animals are made up of many cells. Animals digest food in their bodies after eating it. Most animals are able to move.
Only animals have brains, but not all animals have brains, like seals.
Every corner of the earth has the image of animals. Some of them dig holes underground, some float in the ocean, some float in the sky.
Cells are the smallest structural and functional unit of any organism.
Cell (cell) is derived from the Latin word cella (meaning small room).
Looking at the organisms under the microscope, you will find that they are made up of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from the UK, saw some small squares in the softwood case with a microscope.
They look like rooms. He was the first person to observe dead cells.
Elements and compounds can change the material in the event of chemical changes.
Gaseous silicon still has the same properties as liquid silicon. Liquid silicon has a higher density, but the molecules are the same.
Another example is water. Compound water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Whether it is gas, liquid or solid, its molecular structure is the same.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains unchanged.
Time is around us and influences everything we do, but it is difficult to understand.
For thousands of years, time has been the subject of study by religious, philosophical and scientific scholars.
The time we have been through is a series of events from the future to the present and the past.
Time is also the way we compare the duration of events.
You can record the passage of time by observing repeated cyclical events. Cyclical events are what happen regularly over and over again.
Today, we use computers to process images and videos.
Complex animations can be built on computers, and this type of animation is increasingly being applied to television and movies.
When recording music, complex computers are often used to process and mix the sounds together.
For a long time in the 19th and 20th centuries, the first inhabitants of New Zealand were thought to be Maori, who hunted a large bird called the feared bird.
The theory then established the view that the Maori migrated from Polynesia by large boats and took New Zealand from the Māori people, establishing an agricultural society.
But new evidence suggests that the Maori belong to the mainland Māori people who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and developed their own unique culture of noble peace.
There is another tribe in the Chatham Islands, the Maori who migrated from New Zealand.
They call themselves Moriorians. There have been some minor conflicts, and eventually the Moriorians were wiped out.
People who have participated for decades help us to recognize our strengths and enthusiasm while honestly evaluating difficulties and even failures.
When we listen to others share their personal, family and organizational stories, we gain valuable knowledge about the past and about some of the people who have had a positive or negative impact on organizational culture.
While understanding history does not mean understanding culture, it can at least help people understand their place in organizational history.
When summarizing success and failure, individuals and all participants will have a deeper understanding of the values, mission and motivation of the organization.
In this context, reviewing previous entrepreneurial practices and successes can help people remain open to new changes and new directions in the local church.
Such success stories alleviate people's fear of change while creating a positive trend for future change.
A cohesive thinking model is a technique for solving problems by combining different ideas or fields to find solutions.
This thinking model values speed, logic and accuracy, as well as separate facts, reapplications to existing technologies and information collection.
The most important factor in this thinking pattern is that there is only one correct answer. You only need to consider two answers, yes or no.
This thinking model is not associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking have logical thinking, can remember patterns, solve problems, and can perform scientific tests.
So far, humans have been the best species to understand the minds of others.
This means that we can successfully predict the perceptions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge or desires of others.
Understanding the intentions of others is essential in these capacities. With this ability, we can understand the ambiguity of the questions that physical behavior may express.
For example, if you see someone breaking the window of a car, you are likely to think that this person stole the car of a stranger.
If he lost his car keys and tried to open the door to his car, he might have to change his mind.
The magnetic resonance imaging base is a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) discovered by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Percell (from Harvard University) in the 1930s.
In this resonance, magnetic fields and radio waves cause the atom to emit weak radio signals.
In 1970, MD and research scientist Raymond Damadian discovered the basic principles of using MRI as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was approved, the world's first patent in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the manufacture of the first full-body, full-body, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging scanner, which he called the "Unsubject" scanner.
Asynchronous communication gives people time to think about the reactions of others and react.
This allows students to learn at their own pace and control the pace of teaching information.
In addition, due to the flexibility of working hours, there are also fewer time restrictions.
Learners can access information at any time using the Internet and the World Wide Web.
Students can also submit questions to the teacher at any time of the day and can expect a quick response within a reasonable time without having to wait for the next interview.
Postmodernist learning methods give people absolute freedom. There is no one way to learn that is a good way to learn.
In fact, nothing requires special learning. Learning behaviour occurs when the learner experiences and presents knowledge.
This is evident in all our experiences with DIY, presenting information and learning as the main content of TV shows.
Many of us find that the TV shows we watch tell us about a process or experience, but we never participate or apply that knowledge.
We will never make major repairs to cars, build fountains in the backyard, visit ancient sites in Peru, or transform neighboring houses.
Thanks to the submarine optical cable and broadband satellites connected to Europe, the Greenland network connects 93% of the population to the Internet.
Your hotel or landlord (if you live in a hostel or private home) may have a computer with wifi or internet connectivity. All accommodation points have a internet bar or a place with public wifi.
As mentioned above, while the term "Esquimo" is still acceptable in the United States, many non-Americans in the Arctic region, especially for Canadians, consider the word to have a pseudo-religious meaning.
Although you may have heard the term used by the locals in Greenland, foreigners should avoid using it.
In Canada, the indigenous inhabitants of Greenland call themselves Inuit, and in Greenland they call themselves Kalaalleq (plural Kalaallit), meaning "the Greenlander".
In Greenland, crimes and malicious acts against foreigners are almost unknown in general. Even in towns, there are no high crime zones.
The severe cold may be the only real danger faced by those who are not prepared.
If you visit Greenland during the cold season, remember that the colder it gets to the north, you must bring enough warm clothes.
Long summer days can lead to sleep deprivation and related health problems.
During the summer, you should also pay attention to the northern European mosquitoes. Although they do not spread any disease, they can make people feel uncomfortable.

For many American families, going to Disneyland to play is a great activity.
This typical fun-filled process includes flying to Orlando International Airport, taking a bus to the Disney Park Hotel, and spending about a week at Disney before returning home.
There are countless Disney games, but for most people, going to Disneyland is what it means.
Many tickets sold on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day passes.
Although this is a common practice, Disney forbids doing this: tickets are non-transferable.
A camping permit is required to camp below the edge of the Grand Canyon.
To protect the Grand Canyon, limited licensing is issued. The license starts on the first day of the month, four months in advance, according to the launch month.
Therefore, if the launch date is May, the camping permit will be issued on January 1.
The most popular areas, such as Bright Angel campgrounds near the Phantom Ranch, usually receive full booking applications on the first day of opening.
For unreserved visits, the number of reservations is limited and permits are issued on a first-come, first-served basis.
South Africa is ideal for driving, where visitors can enjoy all the beauty of the region and get to places other than the usual tourist route.
While ordinary cars can do this if they plan carefully, it is strongly recommended to use four-wheel drive, and in many places only large-axis four-wheel drive vehicles can pass.
During planning, please remember that while South Africa is stable, not all neighbouring countries are.
Visa requirements and fees vary by country/region and will be affected by your nationality.
Each country/region has specific laws that provide for emergency items that must be placed inside the vehicle.
Victoria Falls is a small town in western Zimbabwe, bordering Livestock, Zambia, near Botswana.
The town is close to the waterfall, which is the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers plenty of opportunities for explorers and tourists to stay for a long time.
During the rainy season (November to March), the water level is higher and the waterfall is more pronounced.
If you cross the bridge or walk along the dirt path near the waterfall, you will definitely get wet.
On the other hand, the view is blocked by water because the water is so large that you cannot see the entire waterfall!
Tutankhamun Cemetery (KV62). KV62 is perhaps the most famous burial ground in the valley. Howard Carter discovered the near-complete royal tomb of the young king in 1922.
But compared to most other royal tombs, Tutankhamun tomb is hardly worth a visit because of its much smaller size and minimal decoration.
If anyone thought about seeing the mummy being damaged when it was removed from the coffin, they were very disappointed, because everyone could only see the mummy's head and shoulders.
The vast wealth in the ancient tombs is no longer in the tombs, but transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Tourists with limited time prefer to choose other destinations.
The Grom temple is located 12 kilometers southwest of the city of Lim Limong. The temple was built during the reign of King Yeong-tung of the late 9th century.
The atmosphere of the temple and the view of Tonle Sap Lake make it worth climbing to the top.
The lake can also be accessed by boat when visiting the attractions.
Tickets for entering the temple are required to buy in order to enter the temple, so do not forget to bring your passport when you go to Tonle Sap Lake.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, although most other countries/regions and the United Nations do not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
Located on the Judean Hills, this fascinating ancient city has a history of thousands of years.

The religious significance of Jerusalem (especially many places in the Old City) makes it one of Israel's major tourist destinations.
Jerusalem is not only full of historical, archaeological and cultural sites, but also of vibrant and busy shopping centers, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador stipulates that Cuban citizens must enter Ecuador after receiving the invitation letter through an international airport or border port.
The letter must be approved by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and meet certain requirements.
These requirements are designed to achieve a smooth migration between the two countries.
Cuban citizens with a US green card should visit the Ecuadorian consulate for exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be at least 6 months from the date of departure and a return/conference ticket is required to prove your stay.
Travel is relatively cheap for larger groups. If you are alone or only with a friend, you can try to get to know others and form a group of 4 to 6 people so you can get a more favorable per capita price.
However, there is also something to worry about, because tourists are often transported and transported to fill the cars.
This is actually more like a way to trick people into thinking they have to pay more money.
This steep hill, at the northern end of Machu Picchu, is often the background for many site photos.
From below, it's a bit scary and a difficult climb, but most people in good physical condition should be able to complete it in 45 minutes.
Most of the pathway is paved with stone steps; steel cables are used as supporting arms in the steeper parts.
It is said that breathing is a breathing stimulus, and caution should be exercised in places where there is heat, especially when the weather is humid, and the situation can quickly become dangerous.
We had to go through a very low, very narrow hole near the top.
The best transportation to visit the attractions and wildlife of the Galapagos Islands is by boat. Charles Darwin visited the place by boat in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships regularly return to and from Galapagos Islands waters, and the size of these cruise ships ranges from 8 to 100 people.
Most people book places early because the boat is usually crowded during the peak season.
Make sure that the agent you booked is a Galapagos Islands expert with a wealth of knowledge about various ships.
This ensures that your particular interests and/or constraints match the vessels that are best suited to them.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was ruled by the Incas, while the indigenous Araucanians (the Maputches) lived in central and southern Chile.
The Maputche were one of the last independent Native American tribes, and only after Chile's independence were they completely brought under the rule of the Spanish systemic rulers.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (and Spain had no functioning central government for years during the Napoleonic Wars), it was not until 1818 that it achieved a decisive victory over Spain.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country located in the eastern half of the island of Espaniola, which is divided between Dominica and Haiti.
In addition to its white sands and mountainous landscapes, the country is home to the oldest European-style city in the Americas and is now part of the San Domingo region.
The first settlers on the island were the Taínos and Caribes, an Arawak-speaking people who arrived in the Caribbean around 10,000 BC.

Because they are in the same time zone as Hawaii, these islands are sometimes considered to be the Hawaiian Islands of the South.
Although smaller in size, it reminds some older visitors of pre-state Hawaii, where there were not so many large tourist hotels and other development projects.
The Cook Islands have no cities, but are made up of 15 different islands. The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In today's developed countries, providing luxury accommodation has risen to become an art form.
In the high-end market, it is clear that the B&B companies are competing mainly in two aspects: bed and breakfast.

Breakfast may include local snacks or special dishes provided by the host.
The scene may be an ancient building with historical significance, with antique furniture, a neatly decorated floor and swimming pool.
Sitting in your own car and embarking on a long road trip has a simple and pure appeal in itself.
Unlike a large car, you may already be familiar with driving your own car and know its limitations.

In short, driving is a great way to drive, but it is not very suitable for camping.
If you have a larger small bread truck, sports car, van or travel car, and the seats can be flattened, you can camp in the car.
Some hotels date back to the golden age of steam trains and ocean liners: before World War II, in the 19th or early 20th century.
These hotels were the backbone of the rich and famous at the time, and often had high-end restaurants and nightlife.
The elegant flavor of traditional equipment, lack of the latest facilities and the sense of timing of the equipment is also characteristic.
Although they are usually privately owned, they sometimes provide accommodation for visiting heads of state and other politicians.
A traveler who is a well-rounded person might consider flying around the world and staying in many hotels like this during the journey.
The Food and Dining Exchange Network is an organization that connects travelers and local residents of their destination cities.

The World Expo (commonly known as the World Expo or simply World Expo) is an international event that showcases art and science.
Participating countries hold art and educational exhibitions in the National Gallery to showcase world issues or their culture and history.
The World Horticultural Exhibition is about flowering, botanical gardens and everything related to plants.
Although theoretically, the World Expo can be held once a year (as long as it is held in different countries), in reality, this is not the case.
The duration of these projects typically ranges from three to six months and are held in locations of no less than 50 hectares.
Over the years, many different film formats have been used. The standard 35mm film (36x24mm film) is the most common.
If the film is finished, it can usually be easily filled, and the resolution presented is about the same as the current digital single reverse camera.
Some medium-sized film cameras use 6x6cm frames, more accurately, 56x56mm backs.
In this way, the resolution almost reaches 35 mm of the bottom sheet (3136 mm2 vs 864).
For photographers, wildlife is one of the hardest objects to photograph. Good luck, patience, experience, excellent equipment are indispensable.
Many people are used to wildlife photography, but like ordinary photography, one photo is more than a thousand words.
Wildlife photography is usually done with long-focus lens, but objects such as birds or microorganisms require other lenses.
Many rare animals are difficult to find, and the park sometimes has regulations for commercial photography.
Wild animals are fearful of humans and aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or harsh.
There are more than 5,000 different languages in the world, with more than 50 million users of more than 20 languages.

The camel (also known as the deer) is not aggressive by nature, but if threatened they will defend themselves.
Some people do not consider camels as a potential danger, and may get too close to put themselves in danger.
Drink moderately alcoholic beverages. Alcohol affects everyone differently, and it is very important to know your drinking limits.
Excessive drinking can lead to long-term health problems, such as liver damage, and even blindness and death. The potential danger is greater when drinking illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal spirits may contain various dangerous pollutants, including methanol, and even small doses can lead to blindness or death.
Glasses may be cheaper abroad, especially in low-income countries where labor costs are lower.

Travel agencies have been around since the 19th century and are a good choice if travelers are not familiar with the nature, culture and language of the destination during a trip or plan to travel to low-income countries.
While most travel agencies are willing to accept most regular bookings, there are also many travel agencies that specialize in travel activities for specific types, specific budget ranges or specific destinations.
It is best to find a regular booking agent similar to your trip.
See what travel products travel agencies promote, you can see on the website or in the shop window.

Some cross-border trains are checked on the vehicle; valid identity cards should be carried on board.
On nightly sleep trains, the train master may collect the passport in advance in order not to affect the sleep of the passengers.
Registration is an additional requirement of the visa process. In some countries, you must register your presence and address with the local government.
This may require going to the local police station to fill out a form or to an immigration office.
In many countries with such laws, local hotels can handle registration registration procedures.
In other cases, only those who live outside the tourist accommodation facilities need to register. However, the law is very vague, so you should know in advance.
Architecture is a discipline that studies architectural design and construction. The architecture of a place is often a tourist attraction in itself.
Many buildings have a beautiful appearance, and whether you look up from the high-rise or look out from a clever window, you can see a beautiful and unfathomable view.
There is considerable overlap between architecture and urban planning, civil engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.

First, there are serious drinking problems in northern New Mexico, and the percentage of drivers driving drunk near a small town bar is high.
Self-painted wall paintings or miswritten graffiti are known as graffiti.
Although this is by no means a modern phenomenon, most people will likely associate it with the use of paint to destroy public and private property by young people.
However, there are now mature graffiti artists, graffiti activities and legal graffiti walls. Graffiti paintings created in this context are often more like artwork than hard-to-recognize labels.
Throwing the spinning wheel is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn how to fly a flying rebound kite and let it fly out and fly back in hand, make sure you use the appropriate rebound kite that can fly back.
In fact, most of the rotors on the Australian market do not fly back. Beginners are best not to try to throw the rotor back in a storm.
Hangi refers to baking a delicious meal.
The pit is heated by burnt stones, and in some places, geothermal heat is used to heat the ground naturally.
Stone turkeys are often used in traditional roast meats.
There are several places in Rotorua where geothermal roasting (hangi) is offered, while other ways of doing so can be tasted in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail has a platform on commuter trains in and around Cape Town, and MetroRail has two levels: MetroPlus (also called first platform) and Metro (also called third platform).

At home, you are very vulnerable to immunity to local pathogens because you are exposed to them often.
But in other parts of the world where there has never been a bacterial group, you are much more likely to encounter problems.
And in warm climates, bacteria can both reproduce quickly and survive longer outside the body.
And so came the catastrophe of the Pandora's Box, the curse of the Pharaoh and the vengeance of the Montecosta.
Just like cold climates are easy to cause respiratory problems, hot climates are very easy to cause intestinal problems. In the vast majority of cases, intestinal problems can be significantly uncomfortable, but not very dangerous.
If you are traveling to developing countries for the first time or visiting a place you are not familiar with, do not underestimate the cultural impact that may arise.
Many emotionally stable and capable travelers have been intimidated by the new challenges of traveling in developing countries, where many subtle cultural differences need to be quickly adapted to.
Especially in the early days, you can consider spending more money on Western and high-quality hotels, food and services to help you adapt to the environment.
In areas where the local animal population is unfamiliar, do not sleep on the floor on a mattress or a cot.
If you want to go to the campsite, bring a camp bed or a hanging bed to avoid the dangers of snakes and lizards.
In the morning, enjoy champagne coffee at home, and in the evening, bubble a relaxing sugary tea.
Home is home for vacation, more time on your hands, you can spend a little more time making a special drink, and you can enjoy yourself.
If you want to update a bit, you can take this opportunity to sip some fruit juice or make a mixture of milkshakes:
Perhaps you will find a simple drink that can be made for breakfast when returning to normal everyday life.
If you live in a city with a culture of drinking, go to bars or pubs in the neighborhood you don't often go to.
For those unfamiliar with the medical term, the two terms contagious cyanide and contagious cyanide have very different meanings.
Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and other parasites.
Infectious diseases are a type of disease that is very easily spread near the infected person.
Multi-national governments require tourists entering or residents leaving the country to get a series of vaccine against the disease.
These requirements usually depend on the country the traveler has visited or intends to visit.
One of the advantages of Charlotte, North Carolina, is that it offers a lot of high-quality options for families.
Residents from other areas often praise family friendship as the main reason they move there, and visitors will find it very exciting to visit the city with children.
Over the past 20 years, facilities for children in the Uptown Charlotte area have achieved exponential growth.
Families living in Charlotte generally do not use taxis except in special circumstances.
Passengers over 2 need to pay extra, so this option may be more expensive and not necessary.
Antarctica surrounds the South Pole, the coldest place on Earth.
Travel costs are high, physical qualities are high, and travel is only possible during the summer months of November to February, with tourist destinations mainly limited to the peninsula, archipelago and the Ross Sea.
In summer, more than forty bases here will accommodate thousands of staff, most of whom are stationed in the area; a small number stay during the winter.
Antarctica's interior is a barren plateau covered by 2-3 km thick ice.
Occasionally, special air travel teams will travel inland, participate in mountaineering activities, or travel to large bases in the Antarctic.
The South Pole Traverse (or Highway) starts at McMurdo Station in the Ross Sea and goes straight to the South Pole, for a total length of 1600 km.
Snow is pressed, gaps are filled, and flags are marked. Only special tractors and snowmen with fuel and supplies can pass through.
The car is not very flexible, so it must go around the Antarctic Mountains and turn a long mast to reach the plateau.
The most common cause of accidents in winter is the wetness of roads and pavements, especially stairs.
At least you need the right shoes underneath. It is usually smooth to walk in the snow in summer shoes, and even some winter shoes are not enough.
The shoe should be deep enough, at 5 mm (1.5 inches) or more; the material should be soft enough under low temperatures.
Some boots have shoe nails; there are also extensions designed for wet slippery road surfaces with shoe nails, which are suitable for most shoes and boots, and can be mounted on the shoe foot or at the same time on the shoe foot and the sole.
The foot should be low and wide. On the road, sandstone or salt grains are often sprinkled with lime to increase friction.
Snowfall is not uncommon; the amount of snow that can be contained on the slope is limited, and the excess snow falls in the form of snowfall.
The problem is that snow has a strong viscosity. So some triggers are needed to make snow fall, and a little snowfall may trigger other snowfalls.
Sometimes the initial trigger is the sun warming the snow, sometimes it is more snow, sometimes it is other natural events, but the more common causes are often human factors.
Tornadoes are a rotating air flow column with extremely low air pressure that can inhale the surrounding air inward and upward.
Tornadoes produce strong winds (often 100-200 miles per hour) that can throw heavy objects into the air and wrap them around moving forward.
At the beginning, the buoyancy clouds stretched downward from the thunder clouds and turned into tornadoes when they touched the ground.
Personal VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) are an excellent tool for avoiding political censorship and commercial IP geographic filtering.
The reason they are better than web agents is that they redirect all Internet traffic, not just content of the hypertext transfer protocol (http).
They usually provide higher bandwidth and better quality services. They are encrypted and harder to monitor.
Media companies lie to cover up their purpose, claiming that this is to prevent piracy.
In fact, the region code has no effect on illegal copying; a step-by-step copy of the disc can be played smoothly on any device that can play the original disc.
The real goal is to get these companies to better control their markets; everything is to make money.
Because the calls are routed through the Internet, you do not have to use the phone company located in your place of residence or travel.
There is no requirement to get a local number in the community where you live; you can get a satellite internet connection in the wilds of Alaska Chickens and then choose a number that shows you are in sunny Arizona.
Many times, you have to buy a number that can be used globally separately to listen to calls from the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The source of this number has a big impact on the main caller.
Real-time text translation application: An application that can automatically convert entire text from one language to another.
Some such applications even allow users to translate foreign text by using their smartphone to mark or other objects in the real world.
Translation engines have improved significantly, and now often provide more or less correct translations (and more often there is little nonsense), but it is worth noting that they may still be completely wrong.
One of the most prominent such applications is Google Translate. After downloading the language data required, it can be translated offline.
Using the GPS navigation app on smartphones when traveling abroad may be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate.
This is a much safer way to save money than buying a GPS-enabled map or an independent GPS device or renting one from a car rental company.
If your phone has no data connection or is not within the service range, the phone's performance may be limited or it may not be able to use the phone.
Every small shop on the street is packed with a row of eye-catching prepaid phone cards, which can be used for both public pay phone machines and ordinary telephone machines.
Although most phone cards are suitable for calling anywhere, some cards have special advantages when calling in certain countries.
Usually, one phone number is the only way to access these services, and most phones can dial the serial number for free.
The rules for regular photography apply to video, and may even apply more.
If even photography is not allowed, then there is no need to shoot videos.
If you are using drones, please confirm in advance what can be shot, and what licenses or additional licenses are required.
Operating drones near airports or crowded places is a foolish idea, even if it is not illegal in your area.
Now very few people do not search and compare prices first and book tickets directly through airlines.
Sometimes, the same flight may have a big price difference on different information gathering sites, and it is advantageous to compare search results before booking while also looking at the airline's own website.
Although travel or business travel does not require a visa for short visits to certain countries, travel time is usually longer than for leisure travelers for international students.
Usually, a visa is required in advance for longer stays abroad.
Student visas usually have different requirements and application procedures compared to ordinary tourist or business visas.
In most countries, you need an admission notice from the school you want to attend and proof that you have at least the funds needed for the first year of classes.
Consult schools and the Immigration Office of the country where you wish to study to learn the details.
Unless you are a diplomat, you are generally required to pay income tax to your country/region for work abroad.
The structure of income tax varies from country to country, and the tax rate and tax rate levels vary greatly.
Some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, impose federal and local income taxes, so the tax rates and grades may vary by region.
When returning home, there is usually no need to carry out an entry check or just walk away, but crossing customs can be a hassle.
Ensure that you know what you can carry and what you can't carry and declare any objects that go beyond what is allowed by law.
The easiest way to start travel writing is to hone your skills on a senior travel blog site.
After getting acquainted with online editing and editing, you can create your own website.
Volunteering on a trip is a different and better way to do it, but it's not just about giving.
Living abroad and volunteering is a great way to learn about different cultures, meet new friends, learn about yourself, exercise the ability to judge rightly, and even gain new skills.
This is also a good way to save money and stay longer somewhere because many volunteers work to provide lodging and some work with less pay.
The Vikings used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Riviera. Some of these routes are still open today. It can be difficult to apply for special permits if you confirm whether they are needed.
The White Strait connects the North Sea and Baltic Sea via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, most of which are rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga River, so it is possible to reach it from the Caspian Sea via Russia.
Rest assured that everything will be normal once you arrive at the dock. You will meet other people who are going to board the boat and they will share information with you.
Basically, you can post a notice, tell others you can help, come and go around the pier, contact people cleaning the yacht or the sailors in the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will know you and they will tell you which boat is looking for someone.
You must be careful in choosing the regular airline from the alliance.
While you may think that it is natural for members of which airline to join the most frequent flights, you should know that the benefits offered by airlines are often different and that other airlines under the same league may get more regular passenger points.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have greatly expanded their services to Africa, providing routes to many major cities in Africa, and are more competitive in price than other European airlines.
Starting in 2014, Turkish Airlines has reached 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have plenty of time to travel, check out the comparison of the total fare to Africa and the global fare.
For all areas outside Africa, don't forget to add additional visa fees, exit taxes, ground transportation and more.
If you only want to fly around the world in the Southern Hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited because there are few trans-ocean routes.
The Southern Hemisphere has no airline that can cross all three oceans - and the Skyline has no trans-ocean route.
However, the Star Alliance covers routes worldwide except for the southeast Pacific route from Santiago, Chile to Tahiti, which is the route of South American Airlines (LATAM), an airline owned by Liu.
If you don't want to cross the South Pacific and the west coast of South America, there is another option besides this flight.
In 1994, the Armenian community of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan started a war against the Azerbaijanis.
A new republic was born with the support of Armenia. However, it has not been officially recognized by any country (including Armenia).
Diplomatic disputes in the region continue to worsen relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Canal Zone (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is a famous 17th century old town district around Binnenstad in Amsterdam.
Due to its unique cultural and historical value, the entire region is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and the property value in the region is among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, originally intended as five parcels of land, consists of five small coastal villages in the Liguria region of Italy: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso.
They are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
For centuries, people have built terraces on rough terrain, which stretch down to the cliff wall overlooking the sea.
Part of its charm lies in the lack of obvious business development. The villages are connected by roads, trains and boats, and the driveway cannot reach them from outside.
The French language used in Belgium and Switzerland is very similar to French, but it is a little different.
Specifically, the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland have some subtle peculiarities in the digital system, and unlike the French spoken, some words are spoken slightly differently.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss learn standard French in school, so they can understand even if you use the standard French measurement system.
In many parts of the world, waving is a friendly expression that means hello hello.
However, in Malaysia, at least among Malay people in rural areas, this gesture is similar to the way some Western countries use their thumbs to move their body, indicating that they are moving and that this gesture is only used to express this meaning.
Similarly, British tourists in Spain may mistakenly think that this is a welcome gesture if the waving is directed to the waving person himself rather than to the person who is waving.
Assisted language is an artificial language or constructed language designed to facilitate communication between people who do not speak the language.
They differ from the common language. Common language is a natural or gradual language that for various reasons becomes the main means of communication between users of other languages.
During the hottest part of the day, travelers can experience the illusion of the Shanghai Market Tower formed by water (or something else).
Travelers chasing the seafront tower is dangerous because it will waste precious energy and remaining water.
Even the hottest deserts can get extremely cold at night. Without warm clothes, low body temperature is a real risk.
If you decide to walk through the rainforest, especially in summer, you need to be careful with mosquitoes.
If you are driving through subtropical rainforests, the few seconds you enter the car and the door opens are enough to get mosquitoes to get in with you.
Bird flu, or more formally known as the common avian influenza, can infect both birds and mammals.
There are reportedly less than 1,000 cases of human avian influenza infection, but some cases are fatal.
Most cases come from people who interact with poultry, but there is a risk for birdwatchers.
The typical landscape of Norway is that the steep canyon and valley suddenly become a high, more or less unstable plateau.
These plateaus are often called "Videos de Vida", meaning a wide, open, treeless space, a region without trees.
In Rokan and Agda, they are known as "hei-sheng", meaning forest without trees, usually full of rocks.
The glacier is not stable and flows from the mountains, causing cracks and ice crevices, which may be covered by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of the ice hole could collapse, and the cracks could close.
On the edge of the glacier, huge ice sheets will loosen and fall, and perhaps jump or roll further away from the edge.
The tourist season of summer destinations in the mountains is usually in the summer months of India.
However, winter has a different beauty and charm, and snowfall in many mountain summer resorts is a good thing. These places offer activities such as skiing and skateboarding.
Only a handful of airlines offered tickets for the dead, which was slightly cheaper than a temporary trip to attend the funeral.
Airlines offering such tickets include Canadian Airlines, DAMA, German Hansa Airlines (flights departing from the United States or Canada) and Seagate Airlines.
In any case, you must call the airline directly to book your tickets.
He added: "Well, we have rats that have not had diabetes for four months now, but they have had the disease".
Dr. Ehud Url, professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and professor in the clinical and scientific departments of the Canadian Diabetes Association, reminded that the study is still in its early stages.
Like other experts, he was skeptical about the cure for diabetes. He noted that these findings were not related to people who already have type 1 diabetes.
On Monday, the Permanent Secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature of the Swedish Academy, Sara Daniels, announced to the public in a program on Swedish Radio that the committee had abandoned the attempt to contact Bob Dylan because it could not contact him directly and informed him that he had won the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature.
"We are still in the military", Daniels said. "I called and emailed the best partners in his relationship, and they responded very friendly. For now, that is enough".
Earlier, Ring CEO Jamie Siminoff said that when the company was founded, he could not hear the doorbell ringing in his garage studio.
He said he created a WiFi threshold.
Seminoff said that the company's sales increased after he appeared on the "Winner of the Creative Mind" show in 2013, when the program team refused to invest in the startup.
At the end of 2017, Seminoff appeared on QVC TV sales channel.
Ring also reached an out-of-court settlement in court with competitor ADT Security.
While an experimental vaccine appears to reduce Ebola mortality, no clear evidence has been provided so far that any drug is suitable for treating existing infections.
A cocktail strain called ZMapp (Multi-Antibody Combined) was initially expected to play a role in this area, but official studies suggest that its effect on preventing death is somewhat uncommon.
In PALM experiments, ZMapp is used as a reference, which means that scientists use it as a baseline and compare it to the other three treatments.
The American Gymnastics Association supported the letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee and accepted the strict demand of the Olympic family to create a safe training environment for all athletes.
We agree with the statement of the U.S. Olympic Committee that, instead of revoking the license, it is better to continue to promote meaningful changes within our organization that may be more conducive to safeguarding the interests of athletes and clubs and their movements.
According to an independent investigation supported by the American Gymnastics Association, we may be able to find out why Larry Nasral's massive sexual assault, which survivors bravely exposed, was not discovered for so long. In addition, the association said it would make necessary and appropriate adjustments.
The American Gymnastics Association and the American Olympic Committee share a common goal: to ensure the safety of gymnastics and other sports as much as possible, and to allow athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and supportive environment.
In the 1960s, Brejzinsky first worked for John Ford Kennedy as his advisor, and later for the Lyndon Baines Johnson administration.
During the 1976 presidential election, he advised Carter on foreign policy, and then took over as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981 to replace Henry Kissinger.
As national security adviser, he assisted Carter in handling many international matters, such as the signing of the Camp David Accords in 1978, normalizing U.S.-China relations in the late 1970s, the Iranian Revolution in 1979 that led to the Iranian hostage crisis, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

This not only confirms that the theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathered fins is widely circulated but also provides details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the feathers of this animal are chestnut brown at the top and light or carrot-colored at the bottom.
This discovery also helps us to understand more about the evolution of bird feathers.
Dinosaurs' feathers do not have a well-developed main stem, which is called the feathered axillary, but they do have other feathered features, such as feathered branches and feathered branches, and researchers hypothesize that the evolution of the feathered axis may be later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they are not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or showing off. The researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature feathers, not the feathers of younger dinosaurs.
The researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers, not the tail of a rhinoceros.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb explosion occurred at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two policemen and injuring more than 20.
The governor's office said 19 of the wounded were police.
Police said they suspected that an ISIS suspect was behind the attack.
They found that the principles of operation of the Sun and other stars were the same: the activity of all stars in the galaxy was entirely determined by their luminosity and spin.
The Rosebud number of a star is determined by its luminosity and rotation, and is related to the flow of the plasma.
The smaller Rosebery, the less active the stars are in the reverse of the magnetic field.
On the journey, Iwasaki encountered problems on many occasions.
He was robbed by pirates, attacked by mad dogs in Tibet, escaped from Nepal and was arrested in India.
The 802.11n standard is available on both 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies.
It is backwards compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided the base station has dual radio.
802.11n speeds much faster than its predecessor technology, with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600Mbit/s.

Hu Jinping encouraged developing countries not to go back to the old road of pollution governance.
He added, "However, they should not be asked to assume obligations beyond their developmental stage, responsibilities and capabilities".
The Iraqi research team submitted its report today at 12 pm GMT.
The report warned that no one can guarantee that any action currently taken in Iraq will stop sectarian war, the growing violence or the chaos.
The report opens with a call for the United States to openly debate and build consensus on Middle East policy.
The report harshly criticizes the administration for almost every aspect of its current policy in Iraq and urges immediate change of direction.
Among the 78 recommendations in the report, the first suggests that new diplomatic operations be launched before the end of the year to protect Iraq's border from hostile forces and rebuild diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries.

The work was largely theoretical, but the purpose of the writing process was to simulate observations of the constellation Humanohorse.
The effect the team is looking for may be caused by tidal forces between galactic dark matter and galactic dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts its gravitational pull on Earth to cause tides, the galaxy exerts its influence on the constellation Horus.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
The theory holds that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in some kind of light circle around a galaxy, made up of many small particles.

Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caves on Earth, which usually maintain fairly constant temperatures, but they are similar to deep underground caves, said the team of space geologists from the USGS and Northern Arizona University in the flagship town of Phoenix, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a technical experience: voters enter a small room and put a pre-printed paper clip showing the candidate they have chosen in an envelope.
After the official verifies the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the polling boxes and signs it on the ballot.
French electoral law has made fairly strict regulations for electoral procedures.
Since 1988, the ballot box has had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelope was in the box when voting began, and that no one else put the envelope in the box except those voters who were statistically able to vote in time.
Candidates can send representatives to the site to inspect every aspect of the election process. In the evening, volunteers will vote under strict supervision according to specific procedures.

UN peacekeepers arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, and they were blamed for the spread of the epidemic. The outbreak began to spread from near the troop camp.
The legal materials show that the UN camp failed to properly disinfect the waste, causing the bacteria to flow into the Attiboneet River, one of the largest rivers in Haiti.
Prior to the arrival of the military, Haiti had never faced problems related to the disease since the early 19th century.

This is known as the pH of chemicals. You can use indicators to make red and blue sugar juice.
The color of the curd juice will change depending on the acidity of the chemical.
The pH value represents the number of H ions in the hydrogen in the test chemical.
The lithium ion is a proton that has lost electrons because the lithium atom is composed of a proton and an electron.

Below them are more medium-sized cat animals, which eat medium-sized prey, from ducks, goats to deer.
Finally, there are many small cat species - including the cat cat - that feed on a much larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the Liquic, where each cat is responsible for a special task to prevent them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most obvious cats in the family, living in large groups called lion groups.
The lion family consists of males of only one to three relatives, and up to 30 females and young.
As sisters and daughters in large families, females are usually closely related to each other.
Lions behave very similarly to wolves or dogs. These animals behave remarkably similarly to lions, but different from other large cat species, and these behaviours are also very deadly to their prey.
Tiger is an all-around athlete, and it can climb (although its climbing ability is not very strong), swim, jump, and pull five times as much as a human powerlifter.
Tigers and lions, monkeys and jaguars belong to the same species of cats. These four large cats are the only cats in the family that are known to bark.
The tiger's mouth is not as deep as the lion's mouth, but rather like a word that is angry.
Catchings like to eat small animals. If conditions permit, they will catch rabbits, snakes, rodents and birds. Catchings are almost all much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that the American cat is tracking and searching for prey by sniffing and sniffing for traces of prey on the ground.
They have strong night vision, can see clearly in the dark, and are very secretive. The cat's prey method is to first blend into the surrounding environment and then to attack prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from their main population (e.g. they cross mountains and rivers, or they arrive on a new island so that it is not easy to return), they often find that their environment is different from before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new populations will need different characteristics or adaptability to become a strong competitor, rather than the ones they previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, and they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
Over time, new populations began to adapt to the new environment and they began to become increasingly unlike other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will eventually appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process the formation of a species of lizard, or the formation of a new species.
Plants can produce oxygen that humans inhale and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants can also provide cooling by using photosynthesis to obtain nutrients from sunlight.
We make houses with plants and clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat is plant. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The dragon was the top predator of the era, and it was afraid of nothing but its kind.
Its long bottom is filled with more than 70 razor-like teeth, and there is a row of them on the top. This means that anything that encounters it has no escape.
Its tongue may be forked, but we are not sure about this. Its food includes sea turtles, large fish, other lizards, and even humans.
It attacks anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like the Dragon Dragon are not its opponents.
Although most of the food of the Romans was common to us, they did have some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boars, sparrows, cows and a rodent called the sleeping mouse.
Another difference is that the poor and women sit down in chairs and eat, while the rich like to gather together for banquets and eat on their sides.
Food that was introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later was not likely to be present in the diet of the ancient Romans.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes and cocoa, nor did any ancient Romans eat turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for themselves for each temple and considered it the dwelling place of the God.
People offer sacrifices to God, and priests meet God's needs through ceremonies and festivals.
In every temple there was a courtyard open to the outside, and an inner temple into which only the priests entered.
Some special pyramid-shaped towers, known as pyramid-shaped temple towers, were built as part of the temple.
The tower is a special sanctuary of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not so important.
The majority of the life of the Hebrew family was spent outside.

If you've seen the National Treasure of China in the movies, you might think that the Declaration of Independence has a Tibetan picture on the back.
However, this is not the case. Although the document has something written on the back, it is not a treasure trove.
The original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776 (original text of Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776) is written in the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text is written at the bottom of the document, which is overturned.
Although no one can determine who the author is, this large sheepskin document (sized 293⁄4 inch by 24 1⁄2 inches) was supposedly wrapped up when it was written.
So it is likely that this symbol was added as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the French, who in 1940 reached a peace agreement with the Germans, not to resist the invaders, but to cooperate with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, known as Operation Longhorn.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated the south of France and turned to Germany.

Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not considered to be a civilization.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the auspices of the Federal Regulations. Congress was the only component.
Congress has no power to impose taxes, and because there is no national executive or judicial branch, Congress can rely solely on the state government to implement all bills, and the state government often does not cooperate.
It also has no power to overturn the tax laws and tariffs between states.
These provisions must be approved unanimously by all states to be amended, and states are so slow to treat the central government that their state representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are the second most successful team in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.

Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, where Italians compete in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Benzhou Island), making it the seventh largest island nation in the world!
Japan is often referred to geologically as the "Crimea" because of the large number of islands in Japan.
Western knowledge of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century. European sailors who passed through the island named it Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern Taiwan region, began to change the way indigenous people produce food and hired Chinese workers to work on their watermelon and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), forces controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan. In 1885, the Qing Empire declared the establishment of a province in Taiwan.
In 1895, after the defeat in the War of the Pacific (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Pyongyang, ceding Taiwan sovereignty to Japan, and Japan ruled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Three Window House.
To give visitors a better understanding of the original appearance of the complex, most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common static image photography format is the 35mm format, which is the dominant film size in the late era of the silent film era.
It is still in production today, but more importantly, its long-width has been applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual size of the 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm high, so the format is a bit confusing.
Therefore, the width-to-height ratio of this format (the simplest integer ratio to be divided by 12) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format series) are the same or fairly close to this longitude ratio.
The often abused and derided three-dimensional law is a simple guiding method for creating dynamics and keeping images orderly.
It notes that the most effective position for the subject is the cross-section of the line dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see examples).
During this period in European history, the already rich and powerful Catholic Church was closely monitored.
Although the languages and customs of Europe differ, Christianity has linked them together for over a thousand years.
From the king to the civilian, it has ten-sided forces affecting everyone.
One of the main Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the Church's money fund was created specifically for this purpose.
The centralized church system in Rome has existed for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they adhere to this belief.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to impose a sea blockade on Germany.
They cut off the supply of military and civilian goods that are life-threatening. This strategy proved effective, despite the fact that such blockades violated the generally accepted international law established under several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain is in international waters, preventing any vessel from entering the whole sea area, and even poses a threat to neutral vessels.
Because the response to this strategy is limited, Germany expects its unrestricted submarine war to have a similar response.
In the 1920s, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was pacifist and separatist.
After witnessing the atrocities of the First World War, countries are eager to avoid repeating it.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job with Edison in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he carried a four-cent note, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former manager, to Thomas Edison.
Different periods of ancient China have their own characteristics; each period or every ruling family in China is a distinct dynasty.
Similarly, the Chang'an period was a period of instability in which small states were divided. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period of 60 years, which was between the Chang'an and the Chang'an of the Han dynasty.
During these turbulent times, the princes of various roads fought fierce battles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands died fighting for supreme power in the Xi'an Palace.
There are also many social and political influences, such as the use of units of measurement, the transition from authoritarianism to republicanism, nationalism, believing that the state does not belong to the sole ruler but belongs to the people.
In addition, after the revolution, the open application of the offices to all men was opened, which gave the most ambitious and successful people the opportunity to fly the Yellow Dragon.
The military is also the same, because the high and low of the military rank is no longer based on rank, but on talent.
The French Revolution also encouraged the oppressed working class of many other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was interested in things beyond the earthly life. He used to meditate in a cave called the Shin-hil-e-Haram on the Sunnah (Light Mountain).
The cave itself has not only stood the test of time but also gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
The cave is located on a hilltop north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even knowing its existence is not easy to find. Once you enter the cave, you are completely isolated from the world.
Nothing is visible except the clear sky and the surrounding mountains. In the cave, the sights and sounds of the outside world are hardly seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands.
The Great Pyramid is a masterpiece of the Egyptians of the third century BC, and it is one of many great pyramids to pay homage to the late pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau in Egypt's Death Valley (or the Giza Pyramid Group) includes several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples and large lion-like figures.
The Great Pyramid was built in memory of the Hoof king and several smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in memory of Hoof's wife and family members.
The bow-and-mouth symbols on the top are like the letter V, and the bow-and-mouth symbols on the bottom are like the book of knots or the missing square at the bottom.
Upwards means starting to push the bow from the top, downwards means starting to pull the bow from the root of the bow (i.e. where the hand shoots the bow).
The upper bow usually makes a softer sound, while the lower bow makes a stronger, more firm sound.
Please write your own markings with pencil, but remember that the notes printed are musical in nature and should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antoinette and their two children (Marie Theresa, 11, and Louis Charles, 4,), and the King's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were driven back from Versailles by a group of urban women.
They rode back to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people, shouting threats to the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage completely.
In the face of the frightened Queen, a mob once waved the title of a Royal Guard guard who was killed at Versailles.
The war costs incurred by American imperialism during its conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial government of the United States, to pay most of their expenses, and interest on bonds issued through the Wall Street Bank in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the large profits gained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people became the basic benefit of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights of the Temple, one must understand the background that led to the formation of the Knights of the Temple.
The period of events is commonly referred to as the Middle Ages of European history, i.e. the period of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The late Middle Ages were preceded by the early Middle Ages and followed by the late Middle Ages, and the late Middle Ages are generally believed to have ended around 1500 or so before.
Technical determinism is a term that encompasses many ideas in practice, including the theory of technological advancement, the theory of technological necessity, and a strict definition of human destiny driven by the logic behind scientific laws and their performance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism include these two general ideas: first, that the development of technology itself has largely exceeded cultural or political influences, and second, that technology in turn will produce an intrinsic influence on society that is not constrained by social conditions.
For example, some might say that cars will inevitably promote the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically feasible for only a handful of cars, so a new production method should be introduced to reduce the cost of ownership of cars.
The higher holdings of Volkswagen vehicles will also lead to higher road traffic accidents, which will drive the invention of a whole new medical technology to repair injuries.
Romanticism has a strong cultural deterministic color, which has its origins in writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlagel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shapes individuals and over time, customs and cultures associated with geography emerge, which are far better than arbitrary laws because they are in harmony with the place where they live in society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of the European feudal era.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the gifts of the Crusaders' return, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow pace of cultural exchange, Western fashion may be 25 to 30 years behind.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, Western Europeans gradually developed their own style. One of the greatest advances was the use of buttons to dress after the Crusades.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agricultural activity that is carried out to produce food that can only meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple and usually organic system that uses local seeds stored within the ecological zone, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize production.
Historically, the majority of farmers are engaged in self-sufficient agricultural production. Today, this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel they are ignored by social standards and subculture cultivates a sense of identity among them.
Subcultures may differ depending on the age, race, class, position and/or gender of the members.
The subculture can be distinguished by a combination of different features, such as language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography or more.
Members of subcultural groups often use their unique style of behavior symbolically to express their membership, including fashionable clothing, behavior and black language.
To illustrate the importance of socialization, one of the most common methods is to use the case of a small number of unhappy children who have not socialized with the help of adults during their growth due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse.
Such children are called wild children, meaning wild children. Some wild children are held captive by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because parents refuse to accept their children with serious intellectual or physical defects.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or left home.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some live alone in the wild.
If raised entirely by non-human animals, the wolf's behavior (to the extent permitted by physical conditions) would be very similar to that of the animal, such as showing fear or indifference to humans.
While project learning should make learning easier and more fun, the supporting learning method goes further.
Supported teaching is not a learning method, but a means of helping people who are just learning to use new computer programs or start new projects.
Supported teaching can be done online or offline, in other words, teachers are a form of supporting teaching, like the backbone assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is embedded in software to question, tip and explain programs that may be difficult for students to handle alone.
Children are adopted for various reasons, such as being neglected, abused, or even blackmailed.
No child should grow up in an environment without education, without care, without education, but it goes against their will.
We believe that the foster system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
The foster system should provide all the necessities that are lacking in its native family.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet add an additional dimension to its use and fulfillment.
For example, learning and interacting are considered important motivators for using the Internet (James et al, 1995).
In studying the audience's response to websites, Amy and McDermott (1998) also cited the involvement of individuals in relationships and the continuing relationship of relationships as a new motivating factor.
The use of video to explain micro-expressions (a few milliseconds of facial movement) has led to a major discovery.
Specifically, it is said that one can judge whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting the micro-expression.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper, in the speech of President Bush, noted that those who cannot understand language because of brain damage can still accurately judge whether the speaker is sincere.
He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior may be a common ground for animals such as domestic dogs.
Studies in the 20th century have shown that there are two libraries of gene variation: manifest and implicit.
Mutations add new gene variations, while selection removes variations from the expressed gene variation pool.
Due to separation and reorganization, variations have changed back and forth between the two libraries of each generation.
In tropical meadows, primates have a digestive system similar to humans, and existing plant resources are difficult to meet primates' needs for amino acids.
Furthermore, failing to do this will lead to serious consequences: growth suppression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources should be proteins in leaves and soybean plants, but primates like us have difficulty digesting this protein unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (corn, egg, and egg) are not only easily digested, but also provide a large amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In summary, we should not be surprised if our ancestors' methods of solving the protein problem of zinc were different from the methods used by chimpanzees in the tropical prairies today.
Sleep disruption refers to the process of consciously waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This is easy to do, using relatively quiet clocks, to wake you up without being fully awake.
If you find yourself re-positioning the bell while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room and force yourself to go to bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids before bed, especially water or tea, which are known to have beneficial urine effects, and forcing yourself to pee.
The degree of inner peace in a person is the opposite of the degree of physical and mental tension.
The less stress, the more positive the vitality. Everyone can find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach the level of enlightenment, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own feelings of tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded through the universal love of Buddhism and many of the techniques of Hinduism.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes methods of Kundalini, meditation and universal love.
In Kundalini, Kundalini energy (enlightening energy) is awakened through the posture of the breath, breathing exercises, reading and visual images.
The central activity of Tibetan meditation is the sky. By symbolizing different gods, purifying energy channels, activating the loophole, the Buddha reaches the realm of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy of the countries in World War II, which promoted cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. As the war ended, the conflict over institutions, procedures and culture further divided the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began immediately.
The war lasted for 40 years and proxy forces fought on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defense line had been broken, and the only hope left was to retreat and retreat along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were abandoned almost overnight, and after breaking the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet Union's Polish non-violence treaty and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, invading Poland's eastern region, more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered and established positions in Belarus and Ukraine.
To date, shipping has been the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
In the traditional sense, the Navy's mission is to ensure that the state maintains the ability to transport people and goods while disrupting the ability of the enemy to transport their people and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy, powered by U-class submarines, tried to intercept the transport.
If the Allies had failed then, Germany would have been as likely to conquer Britain as it was to conquer other European countries.
Goats appear to have been first bred in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to feed them, eat and use their milk, meat, fur and skin.
The domestic goats are usually herded in the mountains or other pasture areas, and are usually tended by herdsmen (mostly children or adolescents), similar to the more widely known herdsmen. These herding methods are still used today.
Britain built a goods corridor in the 16th century.
Although the Mara track was made of parallel wooden planks, at the time, the cars made the horses that pulled the car faster and pulled more for the slightly bumpy road.
Early track pillows were introduced to be used to fix railways. However, people gradually realized that if iron pieces were placed on railways, railways would be more stable and effective.
This is common practice, but iron chips can make wooden carriage wheels wear worse.
Finally, the wooden wheel was replaced by the railway. In 1767, the first full railway was born.
The first known mode of transportation is walking. Two million years ago, with the advent of Homo Erectus, meaning "right man", humans began walking upright.
Their ancestors, the Southern Ancestors, were not used to walking upright.
Two-legged specimens have been found in Southern ape fossils dating back 4.2 million to 3.9 million years, although the Sahelanthropus, a legendary Sahel Shahr, may have walked with both legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, join environmental movements, and even become environmental activists, to some extent reducing future disasters.
In many cases, this is similar to symptom therapy. But if we want more than just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and root it out completely.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly due to scientific and technological progress by humans, while overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of humans make the problem more serious.
The draft handwritten by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary-General Charles Thompson was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4 and was then sent to John Pulp printing plant in several blocks outside.
150 to 200 copies were printed overnight, which is the now widely known version of Dunlap broadsides.
On July 8, John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One letter was sent to George Washington on July 6, Washington read it to his army in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 remaining Dunlap broadsides are the earliest extant versions of the document. The manuscript manuscript has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and have survived to this day, the so-called "bird-of-war" monkeys.
Many people think they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have many similarities to dinosaurs.
They have claws and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and they walk with their back legs like the Dragon.
Today, almost all computers in use are based on information that is processed in binary code.
A binary number can only represent one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and such a number is called a binary number, i.e. a space in computer terminology.
In the body, intoxication may not appear immediately, and symptoms such as vomiting are common and therefore cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The most powerful indicator of the ingestion of the poison may be the container that was opened on the spot, containing medicines or household toxic chemicals.
Check the label on the poison and get specific emergency directions.
Insectologists use the word bug to formally refer to this class of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity with the bug, which is a highly adapted insect that lives in humans.
Falcons and bugs are nesting insects that adapt to live in the host's nest or housing.
In various regions of the United States, there are more than 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which has become a major neurological disease among young people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve).
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis (MS).
A couple may decide not to have children because of their own interests or because of the interests of their children.
These couples may develop adoption plans for their children.
In the process of adoption, the biological parents terminate their rights as parents so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through scientific methods. In fact, this method can provide guidance for most scientific research.
Experiments are experiments used to eliminate one or more probability assumptions, but experiments are not the only way. Asking questions and observing can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers are interested in classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Holy Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues - including psychology - were unanimously accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West has detached itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many physiological and behavioral laws observed by researchers often depend largely on the innate life cycle produced by the biological clock and its existence.
Cyclical rhythm is not just a simple response to external cyclical signals. This rhythm is recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillating device that can continue to function freely for a period of time even without external input.
The experiments of Hershey and Chase show that DNA is one of the main evidence for genetic material.
Helchi and Jones used a fungus or virus to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one on DNA labelled with radioactive sulfur and one on proteins labelled with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells are inherited to children, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural landscape tourism attracts visitors interested in natural areas to see natural landscapes, including wildlife and plants.
Field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and researching ecosystems.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about red gorillas in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small towns to work, and the workplace of those who walk with them on the road is where they leave.
In this dynamic traffic loop, everyone is connected and supported in some way with the transport system based on private cars.
Today, science shows that such a large carbon economy will no longer be able to keep the biosphere that has supported human evolutionary development stable for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transport system. Almost everyone has complaints about the transport system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the water quality or the extent of bridge collapse.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints? Why do they fail every day? Is it because transport engineers are not qualified? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic traffic studies the movement of the driver and vehicle between the two points and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of vehicles because it is not possible to make a 100% accurate prediction of the driver's behavior.
Fortunately, the driver's behavior is often within a reasonable consistency range; therefore, traffic traffic often has a certain reasonable consistency that can be expressed roughly mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship was established between the following three main characteristics: 1) traffic, 2) density and 3) speed.
These relationships are helpful for planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly made them easier to avoid enemies and more efficient at finding food and a mate.
Most insects have an advantage in that they can fold their wings back and forth along their body.
This gives them more small space to hide from predators.
Today, the only insect that can't fold its wings back is the caterpillar.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many people have the opposite view; they think the solar system revolves around the Earth, the sun is also -- and even other stars are.
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel itself moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. Its water volume is more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some stretches reaching up to 6 miles wide.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of the flow of all rivers into the sea worldwide.
The Amazon River drains 6387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The river is fed by thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the magnificent scale and superior construction techniques of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were amazed at the monument of their ancestors that is more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legal regulations and official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements of gold, silver and copper have been known since ancient times, because they can be found in natural form in the natural environment and are easier to extract using raw tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that anything is made up of one or more of the four elements of earth, water, air and fire.
It's more like the four states of matter -- the order of things: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma -- but he also proposed the theory that they would transform into new matter and make up what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget one thing, there are many elements on the element cycle table.
Elements like zinc, zinc and zinc belong to metals, and elements like silver and gold are of course metals.
There are also alloys containing a small amount of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atom is so tiny that the last sentence can contain trillions of atoms.
Therefore, the pen was made popular by many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing styles, the status of pencils is becoming less and less popular.
People now write messages on computer screens, never having to touch a pencil knife.
One can only guess what the keyboard will end up like when the updated product comes out.
The principle of fission bombs is as follows: To put a nucleus and many protons and neutrons together, energy is required.
It's like pushing a heavy truck up a mountain and splitting the atomic nucleus again, releasing some energy.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means they are likely to split with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the earth's crust.
The earth's surface is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
The ground below the dark side is thinner, and the ground above the ground is thicker.
Because the terrain is thinner, there may be more dark areas on the near side, and the lava is easier to climb to the surface.
The core of motivational content theory is to find factors that identify or interest.
These theories suggest that certain needs and/or desires are internalized when people mature to a certain extent into adulthood.
These theoretical studies study why people want to do what they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do something.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's demand-level theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, there are two behaviors when managers start to lead past colleagues. One is that they try to maintain a close relationship with team members.
It is difficult for managers of this type to make unreasonable decisions, and there are difficulties in implementing disciplinary measures, performance evaluation, allocation of responsibilities and accountability.
In another extreme case, the person becomes a completely different individual, feeling that he/she must change everything the team has done and take the results for granted.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leadership and other members of the team.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are also subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for the corresponding sub-teams.
They tend to have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams may schedule meetings for different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The existence of a truly virtual team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is a management team that each member reports to. It sets standards for all members.
Why does an organization take so long to build a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
Creativity and creativity occur when all available resources are effectively utilized between functional sectors of an organization.
Therefore, in the process of working together to overcome barriers, an organization often brings new innovation processes to meet the needs of its customers.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create an innovation culture, share knowledge and conduct organized learning.
Angelina Jolie (2006) explained the continuum program as a way to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes research more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can support scientists' research.
We knew early on that different types of brain injury, trauma, illness and tumor can affect people's behavior and cause some changes in mental function.
The rise of new technologies has allowed us to see and study the structure and work processes of the brain, which have never been seen before.
This provides a wealth of information and material for us to build a simulation model that helps us understand how the brain works.
AI has a strong science fiction flavor, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research on artificial intelligence (AI) involves automating tasks that require intelligent behavior by making machines.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and customer problems, and handwriting recognition, voice and facial function.
All of these have become independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, and some home computer and video game software applications already have built-in AI systems.
Field trips are an important part of any teaching activity. Usually teachers are happy to take students to places that cannot be reached by buses.
Virtual field trips are high-tech solutions. Students can see artifacts in museums in classrooms, visit aquariums, or admire fine art.
Sharing field trips in a virtual way is also a good way to review the journey and share experiences with later classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their state visit each year. The website is redesigned each year, but the old version is kept online and used as a clipboard.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although grammar and spelling are often very poor when students start blogging, the appearance of readers usually changes this situation.
Students are often the most provocative readers, so bloggers start working to improve their writing level to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging also forces students to gain more insight into the world around them. To meet the audience's interest, students are encouraged to become smart and interesting.
Blogging is a tool that can inspire collaboration and encourage students to extend learning beyond traditional school curriculum.
"The proper use of blogs" can help students become better analysts and thinkers; by responding actively to web materials, students can find their position in the context of the above-mentioned articles and be able to present their views on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's capital city, charming and bilingual, and the highlight is a series of art galleries and museums from Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is Muskoka River and the undeveloped natural landscape opposite the river.
All of these things make Ontario the typical model for Canada that foreigners think of.
The vast areas to the north are sparsely populated, and some areas are desert with no smoke.
A surprising set of demographic data compares: more African Americans live in the United States than Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island so far and is an independent continent for wildlife.
The smaller islands, which are mostly independent states or belong to France, are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, a doctrine prevalent in the Comoros and the Mayotte countries.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route from Europe to Cape Town in India.
It borders the Sahel region to the north; the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female tourists should say that they are married, regardless of the actual marital situation.
Wearing rings will also help, but don't wear rings that look too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment; and it is not uncommon for people to follow and grab them.
When rejecting men, be firm, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (no matter what the culture is, you will be decisive!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merenids, who called the port Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it, renaming it Casa Branca, until it was abandoned after the earthquake of 1755.
Morocco's Sudan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish merchants established a trading base here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting shopping destinations in Morocco.
Near the old town of Medina, there are shops selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tajik, ceramics, leather, water smoke and various small toys, but these shops are all aimed at tourists.
