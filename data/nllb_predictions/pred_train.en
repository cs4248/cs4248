28-year-old chef found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead this week in a local store's staircase.
But the victim's brother said he didn't think anyone would want to hurt him and said that everything was finally fine.
The San Francisco Coroner's Office said the body found Wednesday morning in the Westfield shopping center was identified as Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old San Francisco resident.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was the result of a murder conviction and an investigation is underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told KGO radio in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a plumbing cook in Boston, had found the ideal job as a plumbing cook at Sons & Daughters in San Francisco six months earlier.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were shocked by Frank's death.
The spokesperson said that we are a small team of people who are close together like a family and we will miss him very much.
In this sad moment, we express our deepest condolences and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia says that Frank initially lived in the inn, but recently everything has been fine.
Louis Galicia told KGO: "Frank found an apartment while dating a girl".
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to hurt his brother.
Frank has a kind heart and a broad heart.
Louis Galicia: "Mother Frank often cooked dinner for her family".
He never wants to argue with his family.
He was a man who followed everyone's opinions.
Louis Galicia says: "Everything in the world can go wrong, but Frank describes himself as a man who shines out every day".
If you have a lead, please call the San Francisco Police Department at 415-575-4444.
Strike of primary doctors: call for new labour action
The Primary Doctors' Representative called on the Union to approve its new labor action against new contract disputes.
The British Medical Association's Primary Doctors' Committee will ask all its members to start supporting more labour movements from the beginning of September.
The Primary Doctors' Committee said that the ministers had not addressed concerns about the contract.
Primary doctors and medical students voted in July to boycott the contract deal with the British Medical Association.
The agreement was approved by the European Parliament on 28 October.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, the chair of the Primary Physicians Council, Ellen McCourt, said the government has remained silent on the issue of the objection to contracts.
She said: "In light of this, the Executive Committee of the Primary Doctors' Committee has voted unanimously to reject the proposed new contract and called for a formal re-negotiation of all concerns".
In response to the government's silence, the Executive Committee of the Primary Doctors' Committee has formally requested the British Medical Association Council to convene a special meeting to approve a long-term plan to upgrade labour action starting in early September.
The dispute has led to six strikes by primary care doctors this year, including the first full-scale strike in the history of the UK's national healthcare system.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the leader of the British Medical Association's primary physicians, resigned after a vote to boycott the terms of the contract recommended by the British Medical Association.
In a meeting before the 54,000 primary doctors and medical students voted, he told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should be accepted.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be mandatory for healthcare workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: Does the Turks not join the alliance?
One gesture to end a crisis.
Russia met with Turkish leaders on Tuesday, where they shook hands and officially announced the end of the eight-month-long war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin met the Turkish president in the Golden Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I had a strong feeling that this reconciliation was what Ankara wanted most.
Yes, both sides did shake hands.
However, even by the standards of Mr. Putin's one-sided guilt, Putin was only smiling and barely showing his warmth.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan is reported to have mentioned his good friend, Pushkin, five times.
I don't remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to pre-crisis levels, even higher.
The next day, a newspaper wrote that Mr. Erdogan was acting as if nothing had happened.
But I think his enthusiasm suggests something quite opposite.
However, Mr. Putin's continued coldness shows that he has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in the opening credits was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
The Russian government has been trying to get the Russian government to stop the attack.
Mr. Putin lashed out at the incident, accusing Ankara of plotting Moscow.
The attack from the so-called friends makes it more difficult to accept.
It is difficult, if not impossible, to rebuild real trust between the two sides.
Since November, the Russian public opinion has also been reversed.
In recent months, government-controlled media have launched a shocking full-scale attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
The most serious of these was allegations by senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's family profited from illegal oil transactions in the so-called Islamic State-controlled Syrian region.
He has denied this claim.
However, the news from St. Petersburg suggests that it is time to look ahead.
After all, the premise of this meeting was that Putin received an apology from Turkish President Erdogan.
Russia can declare victory.
The benefits of the ceasefire are obvious to Ankara.
First, Erdogan was in danger of being ousted after the failed coup last month, and he needed the support of all his friends.
The continued terrorist attacks have obviously caused him a great blow.
The government has also been given economic incentives.
Russian sanctions have been a major blow to Turkey, especially banning the charter service that can transport millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has dropped sharply by almost 90%.
As flights resume, Russian travel agencies and charter companies will be relieved.
They will be the first to welcome the Mediterranean tourism boom at the end of the season.
National TV even predicted this week that prices of fruits and vegetables would fall once Turkish agricultural imports were reopened.
According to a report in the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti, "The tomatoes are back, the tourists are gone".
The visit also has additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the Western world's weak reaction to the intention to take over.
In addition, Ankara is dissatisfied with the slow progress in joining the EU negotiations and with Putin's long-term interference, who is keen to exploit political coldness and weaken Turkey's relations with the Western world.
The Russian leaders will surely get Ankara's share of the vote because they support the elected authorities after the failed coup.
Note that this is a gift to Moscow, which has always had a deep-seated fear of the regime.
Thus, the meeting in this golden seaside palace made Russia and Turkey allies of two countries rejected and abused by the Western world, which one analyst described as a non-aligned country.
However, despite the public reconciliation, there were still significant differences between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors. Moscow has recently played a role in Syria, while Russia and Turkey support the opposing factions.
After almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents predictably said at the conference that they had not yet discussed the topic.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided the issue of differences between the two sides, while Putin emphasized the issue.
The two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to reach a consensus on the Syrian issue.
It is certainly a good thing for the leaders of the two countries to resume dialogue once again, given the possibility of months of public hostility brought about by the downing of Russian warplanes by Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the possibility of a major disaster.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside of Scotland
According to the CEO of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank will be simplified into a logistics department.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC's Scotland branch that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand was committed to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago, he was facing bankruptcy and had to accept rescue, and since then he has given up pursuing it.
At the time, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer financial brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds to sponsor international sporting events in ways such as the Rugby Six Nations and Wimbledon Tennis Championships, Andy Murray.
But now, the right thing to do is to get more national brands to come forward.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will use the same services for Scottish customers, but not as a recycling facility.
In England and Wales, all the titles outside the headquarters and the securities exchange will be changed to National Westminster Bank.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used by customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private bank brands that stand out, such as Casualty Bank, Adam & Co., Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a visit by clients and staff in Invernessshire.
He told the BBC's Scotland branch: "The Royal Bank of Scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand and one of the employee-employed brands because in a larger sense we are now a bank with many brands".
As the bank itself became an international brand, RBS became a global brand.
For now, what I want to say is that we are no longer focusing on the global, we have turned our eyes to the domestic.
Each brand represents a different industry, and our employees serve customers through different brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations tournaments; at the same time, efforts have been made to raise the profile of different brands in sporting events.
The CEO said: "It's time to become a multi-brand bank because privately we've been exploring how to become a bank that better serves customers".
If we were to become a big bank with many brands three years ago, we would be ridiculed.
We are currently focusing on customer needs, and I am sure you have noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands, and now is the right time.
DeTuri has won 3,000 career titles with Predilection at Newmarket.
Newmarket's two wins helped Daytree win a career-high 3,000, after which he splashed champagne to celebrate.
On Friday, professional rider Frankie Dettori took his 3,000th win at Newmarket.
He was a keen rider in the Predilection, a race from John Gosden, and won two races that night, bringing his career to 3,000 wins.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional rider to achieve this milestone in the field of flat-land racing.
The top five finishers were Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion at Ghayyar, Dairy, said: "It's special.
I was excited because my family was there too.
I am happy with my achievements at Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
This is not a large-scale race, nor is it the Royal Ascot, but it is just a regular Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I am happy and humble.
DeTuri came to Predilection after winning the race, which caused a stir.
In the field of obstacle racing, two riders achieved this feat, the champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, with over 4,300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Berger is a nine-time German champion, with a career total of 4,493 wins.
DeTourney is one of the greatest riders of his time, so it is no wonder that he achieved this milestone, as few have done before him.
He is fashionable and fit, but what really makes him stand out in the weight room is his tactical logic.
He is an amazing ambassador for horse racing and his passion and charm for the sport has attracted a large following over the years.
A few weeks ago, I told DairyTuri at Epsom that if he hadn't had a weekend with the racing driver, he would have won 6,000 races!
It is very important to be honest that Dairy is the best British horse winner in 30 years.
He is a lively character, which is good for British riders, but besides that he is an incredible rider.
DeTourie celebrates this milestone with his iconic jump and horseback.
From the jump line to the jump horse, for twenty years, DeTourney has been a typical representative of the British flat racing scene.
He has a career as a mountain biker.
He won several races, including the famous 1997 Grand Prix victory at the Royal Scottish Rally Championship in 1996, but he also suffered a crash and was banned from racing for taking a banned substance.
Three years ago, when he returned to the field after a six-month ban, he was once very hard-working. However, he showed amazing personality strength and finally returned to the top, leading the way for those who were skeptical.
He may not have been able to do that for too long, as Dundee Turley had said before, and he hopes to compete at least until he's 50.
Russian President Putin resigns as Director of the Office of Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly removed Sergey Ivanov from his post as Director of the Presidential Office.
For years, Mr. Ivanov has been part of the core group that Mr. Putin trusts.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr. Putin had announced the removal of Ivanov from the office of the Russian President, but gave no reason.
Anton Vaino, who began as Mr. Ivanov's deputy in 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. Waino is 44 years old and a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he managed the presidential draft and government employees, the Kremlin website (in Russian) says.
After his appointment, he said to Mr. Putin: "Thank you for your trust".
I think the most important task of this government is to support the heads of state in drafting laws and implementing control orders.
Mr. Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself had asked to resign and recommended Mr. Waino to take over.
Is that a convincing smile?
Moscow is not comfortable with this move.
Sergey Ivanov was one of Putin's closest aides for a long time, and like Putin, he worked in the KGB.
As the director of the office, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin broadcast on national television, both claimed that the director of the office had asked for his resignation.
Despite the smile on his face, almost no one convinced him, especially in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
So, is this a result of a defeat in a power struggle?
I'm not sure.
However, the official statement that the electorate of a former presidential candidate suddenly chose to rule Russia's environmental policy has raised much doubt.
The Kremlin website quotes Mr. Ivanov as saying in a conversation with Mr. Putin: "Yes, I asked you in one of the conversations in early 2012 to give me this difficult, if not troublesome, four-year term".
"The result is that I have been the director of the presidential office for four years and eight months".
Mr. Ivanov took up this position in December 2011.
He was the first Indian to hold the post of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the National Security Agency, like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin became the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly the National Security Agency), Mr. Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
After Putin took office, he named Ivanov as one of his five most trusted people.
The outside world once thought that Mr. Ivanov might be elected President of Russia after the end of Mr. Putin's second term, as three reelections were unconstitutional.
But the position eventually fell to another close aide of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin served as the Prime Minister of Russia for a time before being re-elected as President three and a half years later.
The mysterious fish surprised Banff, a garden
A resident of Banff discovered fish in his garden and then called for help.
Kevin Bain believes the 75 fish may have been sand washed by sea tornadoes.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the ocean, posted a video of this strange scene on the Periscope in hopes that someone would explain to him why these two-inch-long fish appear.
The Queensferry Bridge now leads to Fave
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have connected the north side of the Queensferry Crossing with the high rise bridge, which now leads to Fave.
The four bridges near the three main towers of each bridge are now close to being completed, and the project is the first bridge to be built.
The bridge, which starts from Faf, is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 hectares.
It uses 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 slats.
The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first people to climb the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge".
We have all witnessed the engineering work on such a grand project, and this section of the bridge alone used more than 30,000 hectares of concrete and steel.
Despite the size and weight of the bridge, the bridge's intersection between the high-rise and the bridge surface required precise work and precise assembly.
In total, almost 79% of the total bridge surface is now installed, and the last concrete bridge is now on the Rosyth, meaning that all the bridges are ready to be built.
Michael Martin, project manager at Queensferry Bridge Construction Company, said: "Whatever the bridge project, the first bridge is a major milestone".
The project is a remarkable project, and the project demonstrates the cutting edge of civil engineering technology.
After the last section of the road panel is installed and connected to the extended North Bridge Bridge Road panel, the remaining gaps on the north side or near the land side are to be completed.
The project will require 700 mm of southward movement of the northern tower bridge.
It was a massive task, but also a very precise one.
The large size of the bridge is said to be 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 hectares, and it takes about 3% of the slope to pull it out.
It is accurate because the engineering team needs to make sure the deviation is very small, only a few millimeters on each side.
It is a joy that everything is going well.
Simon Byrnes wins the women's gymnastics all-around title
Forget the pressure.
Forget the joke.
Simone Biles was not affected by all this.
The horse jumps with a lot of energy.
The balance of the wood is over the edges.
The free exercise is amazing.
The overall performance was great.
Now, it's finally the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the all-around title on Thursday, fully demonstrating her talent at the Olympic Games to lead the world in gymnastics.
She won the silver medal with a total of 62.198 points, and was joined by finalist Ali Raisman and Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles from the United States performed a balance-wood performance at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byers helped the U.S. team to a four-way tie for the women's individual all-around title at the Olympics, and she won five medals at the Olympics, further proving that she is the generation and perhaps the best gymnast ever.
By the time she saw her total score, Bales could not bear to run down the water. She had finally finished her long journey.
Byers, like Michael Phelps, have been at the forefront of the sport for decades, taking their sporting program to new heights:
For the past three years, Bayles has been called the "Golden Field" and has won 15 World Championship medals, including 10 golds. She strives to train every day to achieve greater accuracy. Mary Lou Retton, Olympic champion in 1984, said: "Buyles is the greatest gymnast I've ever seen".
There is still one final match in Brazil, but it is not a competition between Bales and other gymnasts, but rather a battle between herself and the enormous pressure of expectations.
If Bayles didn't return to her home in Spring, Texas, with a full gold medal, everyone would be very disappointed.
Simon Bairns (left) from the United States hugged Lesman, who won gold and silver medals respectively in the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The Bayers won their first gold medal on Tuesday, and will give a surprise tribute to retired national team coach Martha Karolyi.
Although Bairns insists that he has no plans for the future as he takes the throne, this is not entirely true.
One of Bales's free gymnastics performances included her iconic swinging sequence, accompanied by Latin music, which she often heard in the one-street neighborhood of the Rio Olympic Stadium.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a baby and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother while on a field trip to the gym, has grown into a middle-aged woman.
Since the summer of 2013, Bayles has not lost an all-around game, and if she wants to win, she will win.
The two spins of Mustafina's slightly ahead were just an illusion.
The world champion in both the wood and freestyle events, Bayles, is set to be laid to rest.
She has a balance of 15.433, and a free gymnastics score of 15.933.
While waiting for the final score, Lesman hugged Biles gently. When Biles learned that he had achieved his dream, he shed tears.
Lesman's performance was somewhat of a revenge for her fourth-place finish four years ago, when she lost to Mustafina in the final.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, who is being played by Americans as "Grandma's Grandma", is far ahead.
She kissed the crowd after her free gym and announced her return, but before that, there seemed to be some doubt.
Byers is only 19 years old. The news has been viral on Twitter since earlier this week. For Byers, her life has been given a whole new meaning.
Mahaj Brown, 6 years old, who was charged with murder, survived the shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old to be shot in the city this week.
The children's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child was Mahaj Brown.
Brown's abdomen, legs, thighs and abdomen were heavily gunned down, but the child was clear on the way to the hospital, they said.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the TV station that he was charged with multiple offences and that his body was hit by a bullet.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition and has undergone several surgeries.
His family told the TV station that the child is expected to recover.
He was going to start his first grade at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Two of the three other people who were shot were aged 29 and one was 32.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the victims, a 29-year-old, is in critical condition; the other two victims are stable.
According to the TV station, the child was found in the front seat of the car with the 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the vehicle and police are investigating whether there were any gunmen among the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like multiple gunmen had been shooting.
The charges against the attackers were found on the spot, which suggests that they used different weapons.
The first is that the war is going on.
The city is also known for its beautiful beaches and the beautiful beaches.
The police chief, Anthony Ginaldi, told the TV station that the scene was a state of emergency.
The area is also home to a number of houses and vehicles that were damaged.
The police are reportedly watching surveillance videos.
On Tuesday, a six-year-old girl was shot dead while playing at her door in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is currently recovering and police are still hunting the suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabriel and Laurie?
This is how I assess this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, but the United States has never been so dominant.
The second group, the three great gymnasts Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, have been inspiring many girls of color.
The team is a source of pride for all, as it includes Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian.
The team finally looks like the American team.
It also cemented the top position of black and Latino women in the movement.
In the last four years, the number one female gymnast has been non-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabriel were first and second.
That's too bad.
In the last Olympics, Gabriel Douglas unexpectedly emerged as the Olympic champion, which made the United States cheerful.
Today, the world is witnessing the extraordinary performances of three world champions, Simon Byrnes, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who have been able to manifest their divine nature through their regular gymnastics skills.
On Thursday, Simone helped Team USA win four consecutive titles in the women's individual all-around program.
She was the first woman to win the silver medal in the women's team event.
We are at the peak of the sport, but not in all American gymnastics classes.
Simon, Gabriel and Laurie made the Olympic team the same way Ali and Madison did.
They are the Final Five, as the next Olympic gymnastics team will be made up of four gymnasts, the last year coaching Marta Karolyi.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly sport, with gymnasts training mainly in private gym clubs, and their parents paying for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions, and hotel fees (including coaching and related expenses for gymnasts and their families), and the list is growing.
Most gym clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can provide support for the industry.
All gymnasts' training is completed at these clubs, which is a costly and expensive expense for the gymnasts' families in the long run.
The Bears coach Aimee Boorman and the Elnards coach Maggie Haney have coached the two gymnasts since they began their training.
We must bring more affordable, more accessible gymnastics training to countless young girls who have been deeply influenced by Simon, Gabrielle and Laurie.
I started my own gym foundation 20 years ago.
In my organization, we provide free, inexpensive gymnastics to over 15,000 urban youths in black neighborhoods -- mostly black and Hispanic Americans -- and cultivate national and world championships.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my home city, to provide high-quality gymnastics to the young people who deserve this opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic Games.
Physical activity helps to develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, and helps to develop a spirit of hard work, self-discipline and determination.
These can be life-long benefits for a person's health, academic and professional success.
It's really great that thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics from this team.
Participation in sports is important, especially for girls.
It was an exciting time.
I thank Simon, Allie, Laurie, Gabriel and Madison for their amazing performance in winning Olympic gold medals as a group, and for inspiring young girls from all backgrounds to take the path to health, strength and success.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, primary doctors plan to strike further
The ministers initially hoped to end the dispute over the change by accepting a contract with the British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 primary doctors who voted against the contract.
In July, Mr Hunter revealed plans to force the contract, saying that the NHS is currently in a state of a state of complete vacuum, and that a slight delay would harm the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract first mentioned changes to the practice of working overnight and on weekends for primary care doctors to improve the care situation for abnormal working hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Primary Doctors Committee, said in a statement last night that the primary doctors of Yang were still deeply concerned about the proposed contract, especially the fact that it would exacerbate the current labor crisis and not treat all doctors fairly.
We have only eight weeks left before the first doctors sign the new contract, and we need to make progress, not much time.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute through negotiations, but people are not willing to participate, and sometimes the government responds in silence.
Despite this, we still got the promise of Jeremy Hunter last month, who said his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt needs to act now to abolish enforcement and address the concerns of primary care physicians.
If he does not, the primary doctors make it clear that they are ready to take further labor action.
The last strike took place in late April, resulting in nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 delays in appointments as nurses and clinicians sheltered doctors on the interim line.
The ministers initially hoped to end the dispute over the change by accepting the BMA's amended contract.
BMA hopes to get a better weekend's pay for the 54,000 primary care doctors covered by the contract.
The NHS Employers CEO Daniel Mortimer has called on primary doctors to stop any more strikes.
Mr Mortimer said that the work of the workers was not very effective, but that it would put pressure on the teams and services that had already been working hard, causing anxiety, anxiety and confusion for patients, caregivers and their families.
Over the past two months, we have been in continuous negotiations with the Primary Doctors Commission and have been actively responding with the Department of Health and other departments to their concerns about the role of caregivers and the reporting they have revealed.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics such as deployment, flexibility in training, other training for people who have become addicted after a career break, training costs, shared cognition of the curriculum, and gender pay gaps in the field of medicine, which show the importance of the agreements between employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health and the BMA in November, February and May.
2 pounds of medication a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Officials suggested that more patients be given a £2 a day drug and that the duration of the drug be extended so that thousands of heart patients would benefit from the drug.
Anticoagulants such as teagrelor can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease.
The drug is taken for 12 months after a heart attack and can reduce the risk of a stroke or heart attack recurrence.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE), the regulatory body under the NHS in the UK, recommends that patients continue taking the drug for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
However, now, NICE, the NHS regulator, recommends that patients continue to take the drug for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year, and a quarter of them will continue to have a recurrence of heart disease or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fatty substances in the arterial walls to form plaques.
If the plaque is broken, it causes a blood clot, which prevents blood from flowing to the heart, leading to a heart attack.
If the blood clot moves, it enters the bloodstream, blocking blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
Patients who have had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another heart attack.
The Cagre is manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and marketed as Brilica, which reduces the risk of disease by reducing the formation of blood clots.
The draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that patients take 90 mg of Cagre for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of Cagre and two aspirin doses daily for the next three years.
Prof Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the effective level 2 prevention, up to a quarter of patients with a history of heart attacks will have a second stroke, usually with serious consequences".
The fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that taking Cagre with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke recurrence in patients who have had a heart attack.
We are very pleased that the temporary recommendation for Cagrey will provide more treatment options for thousands of people who have benefited.
Due to limited information on the efficacy and safety of Cagre after three years, and in particular the risk of bleeding, the draft guidelines do not recommend continued use of Cagre after this time.
Computer culture has made voter fraud prevalent in Muslim areas
Lutfur Rahman, former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was dismissed last year due to corruption, prompting a government report.
The political correctness of the culture of corruption that has made widespread election fraud in the Muslim community invisible, a deadly government report today reveals.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles has accused the police, election regulators and the city hall of ignoring evidence of electoral abuse for being overly sensitive to racial and religious issues.
The former Minister of Community Affairs, who is now an anti-corruption activist, said that the practice of intimidating voters with religious positions was badly affected and that the police should be allowed to set up a line of vigil outside the polling stations to protect the fearful voters.
He suggested that voters carry their identity cards to confirm their identity.
Currently, voters are only required to state their name and address.
The report even recommends that the voters' fingers be painted with unflappable ink to prevent a second vote.
Sir Eric said that the protection of whistleblowers should be increased.
He called for more media awareness of the meeting documents and the way in which decisions are made by non-official committees or working groups.
The aim of the campaign is not only to prevent electoral fraud but also to protect local governments from the toxic effects of a widespread culture of corruption and financial fraud closely linked to it, Xi said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street following the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that a series of corruption and illegal acts in the office of Mayor Rahman should be removed from office.
The court found that Rahman Khan had ridiculed the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and had not spoken out against the accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman Khan is said to have declared his vote as a religious obligation for loyal Muslims during his campaign.
Up to 300 votes are suspected of being fake votes.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of electoral fraud throughout the country.
He specifically warned of mail fraud, which is alleged to have been carried out by senior members of the Muslim community who pressured voters to vote for their designated candidates.
Sir Eric (pictured) has made several suggestions on clearing voting mechanisms, including bringing ID cards to prove his identity.
He said in the report: "There is evidence that senior members, especially senior members in Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds, have put pressure on some vulnerable groups in minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote as they please".
The group is concerned that the state will ignore such acts because of their over-sensitivity to racial discrimination and religious biases and political correctness.
Sir Eric proposed 50 electoral clearance mechanisms, including a ban on political activists handling mail ballot papers to prevent polling stations from harvesting votes.
The report also called for a strict check of registration information to prevent electoral rolls from being used for immigration and welfare fraud.
These recommendations include requiring voters to present their identity documents before voting.
After the vote, the voters' fingers are painted with unflappable ink to prevent a second vote.
The voters are systematically verified for their ethnicity to ensure their voting rights.
The validity of automatic mail voting requests will be limited to three years.
Prohibiting political activists and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal voting envelopes.
Authorizing the police to set up a vigil around the polling stations.
Amend the provisions of the law to make it easier to prosecute persons for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
The law on the subject of photography at polling stations is illegal.
The rules state that English is the only language used in polling stations except in Wales.
Strengthen training and ensure that staff strictly follow the rules for voters to go to the polling station separately.
Sir Eric has been critical of the Metropolitan Police, saying that they have not filed any criminal charges since the Tower Hamlets incident, and that the truth is surprisingly not true.
The election commissioner, who was also the chief electoral officer, was also the first to be elected to the office of the president.
According to the standard of criminal evidence, he is unquestionably guilty in many respects.
He also criticized the fact that the municipal election registration department checks the fake ballot box.
Sir Eric: The Court of Appeal's judgment against Tower Hamlets last year sounded the alarm.
While the country has a proud tradition of parliamentary democracy, the reputation of the country is threatened by the fact that some institutions have been secretly manipulating and fraudulently defrauding the elections.
The Rio Olympics are looking like the bikers of Queen Kate and the faces of other celebrities who are in demand.
This week, French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevot, who looks like Princess Kate, was in great demand at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is not the only one to face the famous at the Summer Olympics, at least social media doesn't think so.
In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the faces of celebrities who appeared on screen at the time, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic stars who have hit the face of Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: American men's archer Brady Ellison (left) From childhood he was compared to Leonardo DiCaprio
In addition to the cyclist who bumped into Kate's face on the bike track, many netizens soon discovered that one of the archery players was Leonardo DiCaprio's half-brother.
Since his photo of the Wolf of Wall Street star was revealed on Twitter, American men's archery team member Brady Ellison has caused a huge stir on social media.
In fact, the archer noticed the social media hype and admitted that when he was a kid, people said he looked like a little lee.
I don't think he looks much like anything but a hoodie, said Bladdy to Huffington Post.
He's a pretty angry-looking flower boy, so I think that's a compliment to me.
One of the most popular rivalries at the 2012 London Olympics will undoubtedly be found this year with more similarities: British long jumper Greg Rutherford looks like the famous actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, who has two large eyes, is said to resemble Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
In the pool, for years, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Choir's drummer Matthew Morrison.
The user thinks that Nathan Adrian is the game version of the Inception actor's The Phantom Menace.
Another pair of older people were compared to tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who had eyebrows and lips that looked very similar.

Not the only one: One Twitter user was happy to find that others saw the similarities.
The theory of propagation: According to this user, the couple seems to have a reason.
A recent Twitter user has happily claimed online that other netizens think Hop Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look the same.
Indeed, the American football star and the bloodthirsty forensic doctor who starred in the movie have a very similar face and eyes.
Other popular contrasts include Kerri Walsh Jennings, whose smile is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney; and Gold Medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose beautiful and brilliant smile is a blend of the smile of the brilliantly charming Gabrielle Union star, who is also a star of the British comedy troupe Bring It On.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for Chinese swimmer who was as slow as a pig
On Wednesday, comments by Byron MacDonald about 14-year-old General Ayrawi who won fourth place in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay angered viewers watching live broadcasts of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Olympics.
A commentator for CBC said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer swam faster than the smell of air when she started competing, and the latter swam slowly like a pig, after which CBC was forced to apologize.
Interviewer Byron McDonald expressed some of his views at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay, when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
Byron, a colorful eyewear commentator who was heard by the audience on the CBC commentary team, said that the 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake.
He was so excited that he started to swim faster than the smell of the air, but later he went as slow as a pig.
And it's because of her.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, who swam second, fell behind Taylor Ruck by 1.61 seconds with a time of 1:57.79, and then narrowed the gap between Canada and China.
The whole of Canada was amazed by the tone and wording of the narrator, and they quickly reacted online.
Emmett Macfarlane: The CBC commentator says that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer is slow as a pig?
This idiot didn't realize it was live.
A Chinese junior general who competed in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final was described as saying: "A 14 year old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake".
Criticism of Byron McDonald on Twitter quickly broke through the Twitter feed, with many demanding his withdrawal.
Twitter users didn't stop when they heard that Byron McDonald was slow to respond to the news.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Oh, my God, #Byron McDonner.
You represent CBC and Canada, and your words make us all sound like racists.
Shortly afterwards, CBC broadcaster Scott Russel apologized for Byron's remarks on the live broadcast, saying: "Oh, we apologize for the comments made on the live swimmer.
We are sorry for the timeless wording.
CBC apologized more than 90 times to Twitter users who responded to the remarks.
Another commentator, Scott Russel, also apologized for Byron.
CBC then posted a copy of their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users protesting Byron's comments.
The channel also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We are sorry for saying this and for broadcasting it live.
Last night, we took swift action and apologized to our viewers who watched our live broadcast and who were following us on social media.
It is worth noting that Byron's comment was directed at the performance of the swimmer, but not at her personally.
The wording is not appropriate, and Byron is deeply sorry about that.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized in a live broadcast saying that his words were not meant to be half-human attacks and that he was trying to defend himself.
I wanted to take some time to apologize for my comments last night after the women's relay, and I said the same thing on the CBC Olympic broadcast.
I'm just commenting on the performance of the swimmer, not on the individual.
I'm sorry, I'm not disrespectful.
Primark customers expressed anger at a woman who shamelessly tried to wear a hat in the center of the store
A woman stripped herself of her clothes in the middle of a Primark store, and customers inside the store didn't know where to look.
Even worse, she was also considering what she would look like after wearing it, then taking off her cabinet and putting it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves and eventually tried four cabinets in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The woman tried to put her cabinets on the shelves of the Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone before returning to the shelves.
Jenny Davidson (a mother of two) said that after trying to get her underwear off, the mysterious woman's mother dressed again and then left the store without buying anything.
She said: "Everyone can't believe what they see.
She stood in the middle of the store, took a cabinet off the shelf, took off her tight pants and cabinets, and then dressed like this.
She didn't try to find a hidden place to try to dress up, she just stood there, it was rude.
When she took off the cabinet again, everyone was shocked and stunned. Apparently, she was still unhappy because she put the cabinet back on the shelf.
After that, she tried three more of these, and found that none of them were her own, and then she put on her clothes again and went out of the store.
She didn't seem to care if anyone was watching her or who would eventually buy her a cabinet she tried to pass.
Ms Davidson, 33, of Kent, said: "I was sick of the idea that someone would buy a toilet that someone else had passed through and hadn't been cleaned.
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: "The shopkeeper obviously had to take care of the guilt after she left, and thankfully so".
I hate buying a new cabinet back home, but I found another woman trying to get through and it wasn't cleaned.
A Primark spokesperson said: "Mommy, Primark already knows what happened in our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9th".
All the problem goods have been removed.
How to use horse magic to protect yourself in gun attacks
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com may give you a sense of security.
We ask the Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, Rhon Mizrachi, to learn how to approach gun-toting killers from close proximity.
Whether he comes to you from the front or behind, this video will teach you how to win and lose.
Mizrachi says that if the gunman comes to you from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and clear the firewall.
Then, with your forearm and shoulder, hold the gun, and then hit the attacker's face with your elbow.
He then used his knee to pierce his abdomen, turned the gun in his hand, and hit him in the face with a gun barrel and a backup gun, keeping the gun pointed at him while the assailant was crawling down his neck in pain.
If the gunman approaches from the front, similar techniques are used to keep your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and turn the gun hook so that the gunman cannot fire.
Meanwhile, the gun was pressed against the gun and hit the attacker's chest, and the gun was turned from his hand, then pointed at him.
Sounds complicated?
The video shows Mizrachi's actions.
But remember, if you're not a master of horse-racing, the safest way to escape a robbery is to turn up gold.
A family of teens are destroying a cheap rental home in Sultash, Cornwall, before being evicted
A family of stray people who were evicted for intimidating their neighbors, destroyed their cheap rental houses before leaving, causing £50,000 in damage.
After a series of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their cheap rented house in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being forced to leave the residence, Housing Association officials were surprised to find that the building had been severely damaged.
The wall was covered with holes, the floors were broken, and the garbage was thrown away, and the wall was covered with rubbish.
The family has been moving since their expulsion and is said to be living in private homes.
Donna McEvoy, home manager at Cornwall Housing Association, said she was concerned the house could not be saved.
She said: "It's a nightmare for the people who live here, I don't think people can live like this.
There are many things to consider now, as this house is likely to be a bad element in Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and their names are notorious.
The couple have three sons, who live here from time to time. Police said the family's acts of terror included using baseball bats in the streets, intimidating nearby residents, drugging, drug trafficking, shouting, quarreling and cursing.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant, Skeldon, received an antisocial resolution.
Many of the rooms in the house that may have been demolished are filled with long-term trash.
The floor was covered in a room that was once a drug dealership.
Neighbors say they were often seen fighting in the streets and were often alerted to police.
After giving them an 11-week extension to move voluntarily, the Cornwall Housing Association forced her and her husband to leave the house this week.
The neighbors, who finally relaxed, were applauding the move, saying their previous lives were a hell of a human being.
One neighbor said: "Oh, they don't care about anyone".
We've lived next door to them for 20 years and it's been so bad.
We've seen police come through the door countless times.
I'm not sure how much I'm going to be able to sleep this morning.
We get up early because it's so quiet here that we're not used to it.
They're finally gone, and it's great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the executive manager of the Cornwall Housing Association, said the family had not been able to work well with local government.
The family lived in the house for 20 years and police visited them often.
Garbage and old toys were thrown into the side of the cheap rented weed grasshopper
He added: "It is regrettable that the landlord did not take any responsibility for her behavior with her family and the eviction was the last thing the Cornwall Housing Association considered.
This is a very difficult case to deal with because their behavior is extremely extreme and their actions must have caused fear among their neighbors.
I thank my team for the work they have done, and I also thank the Devon and Cornwall Police and the community members who have bravely provided us with information.
I hope this will bring some comfort to our neighbors and send a message that we will never tolerate anti-social behaviour.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that their three sons lived in the house at different times, but they were also in their 20s.
After they were expelled, they threw a dirty mattress on the floor of one of the bedrooms.
Housing union workers quickly cleaned up the garbage pile around the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 acres of cannabis, as well as a toilet, drug paraphernalia and 1,700 pounds in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of Class B drugs and intent to distribute them.
She claimed the money was used to buy the tombstone for Lee Skeldon, her son who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is reported that after being homeless, Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of the multi-room apartment are painted with graffiti.
Police said they would expel tenants who violate the tenant rules.
Angela Crow, of the Devon and Cornwall Sheriff's Office, said the eviction issued a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate tenant rules.
The warning was directed at those who believe that their actions will not be blamed and those who are devastated by them, she said.
Devonshire and Cornwall Police are not tolerant of crime and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work together as partners to protect our communities.
Read: Hillary will nominate Gallagher to the Supreme Court if elected president
Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid said he was confident that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton were elected president, she would nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have been blocking confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would select him to succeed the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
In a phone call on Thursday, Reed said he predicted Hillary would choose a few credible Galland models.
A spokeswoman for Reed later said that Reed had not nominated Gallagher to speak directly to Hillary, saying he was only speculating.
He added his appreciation for Galdand and said that Hillary's team did not want to be frustrated by the new recruit.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reed said the Republican who stopped Galland's nomination was the cheerleader and cheerleader of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit to be president.
The first is the story of a young girl who is pregnant with twins.
The magazine will be working with photographer David Bellemere to create a collection of images inspired by Pirelli's 2017 calendar from the 1970s.
This time, they plan to look for a new generation of top models, not famous nudists, for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Teen Treats president Steve Shaw said earlier this year that they were using a nude-based magazine differently from the old-fashioned Teen Titans, which was aimed at men.
We are looking to women.
He also said that the calendar was a "simple" way to look at the future.
We need to show off the eternal, classic nudity that makes women and men feel comfortable, and this is exactly what inspired us, Ms Shaw said at a calendar presentation conference.
Women will be happy to take part in this shoot because it is a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit photo applications online or in person to public recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.

French court rejects petition to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court rejected the government's petition to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle Park refugee camp, which currently houses thousands of refugees.
At the court's hearing this week, the government of Galway argued that the French government should have the right to demolish a total of 72 temporary stores in the camp. People in the camps sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, hair services, tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or basic meals for several euros in temporary restaurants.
The Governor's Office in Gale believes that the sites should be demolished because they are a tax-free parallel economy and there are fire and sanitation hazards.
Humanitarian groups have said the shops and restaurants are of great importance to the court because free food provided by state-supported associations and other groups is not enough to meet the growing needs of the refugee camp.
They said that these temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
A Riel court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of the 72 operators of the temporary stores, but said Governor Gale's concerns were fully understandable.
Judge Jean François Molla said that the role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants is much more than simply providing food to refugees who are living in extremely dangerous conditions.
He said that these places are a peaceful meeting point between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition is the jungle book kids cafe in the refugee camp, which provides 200 meals a day, lessons in english and french, and offers shelter to hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, the closure of the cafe's kitchen would be a major disaster for these children (many of whom are only eight years old).
Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, two charities, estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in jungle refugee camps had surpassed 9,000, the highest since the summer surge in the number of refugees.
The $5,000 grant has helped me to clear my eyebrows.
The Gujarati county governor, Li Kaohsiung Mi-Mim village poorly educated Rika-Kaku girl, Zhofen, received a letter of admission from the University of South China.
On August 9, when she was grieving about the cost of her education, the Regency County Commission gave her a timely grant of 5,000 yuan.
On the same day, the county's relevant departments also implemented 283.8 million yuan in scholarships for more than 690 poor college students.
At the same time, the family's economic situation is particularly difficult and it helps them to complete their education through the organization of social donations, such as scholarships.
Gujarati has been able to integrate more than 18.5 million yuan in scholarship funds and more than 2.5 million yuan in financial self-financing, which the finance department has put into the real name bank cards of poor students in accordance with the stipulated deadline.
She said: "I thought my father was dead, my brother and I were not going to college, and I didn't think the county would solve the problems for us in time.
As of August 8, the Gujarat school has implemented more than 21 million yuan in various rescue funds for 13,140 poor students in the first half of this year.
All the poor students in the county have been given the necessary assistance.

The journalist learned from the National Tax Administration today that as of the end of June this year, tax authorities at all levels have published 2470 cases of tax breaches and blacklisting.
In July 2014, the National Tax Administration, in conjunction with the Tax Credit Management Mechanism (TMA), released a measure to disclose information on major tax breaches in the Central Government functional sector.
Not only will the facts of the violations, the legal basis, the handling of the penalties in these cases be published, but the basic information about the parties to the violations and the persons responsible for the relevant intermediary bodies will also be included in the blacklist and exposed.
Government agencies such as the Ministry of Quality, Finance and Customs have also taken appropriate corrective measures against blacklisted parties.

The environmental problems of uranium are reflected in air, water and soil pollution, but the roots are still in the production lifestyle.
For example, in 2015, Jiangsu province had a land development rate of 21%, the highest in the country.
The problem of high pollution, large energy, and land use has not yet been radically addressed by the transformation of the production lifestyle.
On the one hand, the country is ranked first in terms of absolute advantage in terms of the achievement of the creation of ecological environments at all levels in Jiangsu province; but on the other hand, the resource environment is under great pressure.
Strong promotion of ecological environmental protection and governance requires fundamental promotion of transformation of production lifestyles to promote transformation of the people and the environment in order to build ecological civilization.

Qingdao is the 12th pilot city in the country and the first in Shandong province to pay for the use and trade of pollution rights.
On 11th, several companies came to the Pyongyang City Cleaning Rights Trading Centre to submit a cleaning rights application, and after receiving the application, they will pay a paid usage fee.
The upcoming transaction also marks the official start of the pilot of the Pyongyang Ponzi scheme, which will be the first Ponzi scheme in the entire province and the first Ponzi scheme at the national city level.
On the morning of the 11th, the general manager of Qingdao Dupe Precision Chemicals (QPP) Ltd. Shen Shiping came to the Qingdao City Cleaning Rights Trading Center to submit a cleaning rights application.
The company is located in the old town area of Qingdao, China, and has been completely shut down since the end of last year, moving to a new plant area with a level of environmental protection.
After the submission of the application form, the environmental impact report of the construction project, and other materials, the Center for Reservation and Trading of Pollution Rights of the City of Qingdao began the preliminary examination of the application materials.
According to the charging criteria established by the departments of prices, finance and other sectors of the city of Qingdao, the estimated initial use of the pollution rights is currently around 6412 thousand yuan, and the staff will complete the approval in seven working days.
The upcoming transaction also marks the official start of the pilot of the Pyongyang Ponzi scheme, which will be the first Ponzi scheme in the entire province and the first Ponzi scheme at the national city level.
He said that the amount of investments in environmental protection in enterprises is huge, but it has a big impact on the concept of business management and social benefits, and also opens up space for business innovation management.
On the same day, Ningxi Zhizhou Bus Accessories Limited, located in Qingdao, China, also applied for the clearance of pollution rights for 4200 high-speed rail and rolling stock interior accessories projects produced annually.
The project is owned by a machinery processing enterprise and the initial clearance claim is for the chemical oxygen requirements (COD) of 0.514 tonnes per year, ammonia (NOX) of 0.052 tonnes per year.
The right to use and trade air pollutants is a key industrial enterprise for the supply of electricity and heat generation throughout the city.
The existing sewage treatment units that have received an environmental review before 1 January 2016 are not subject to a fee for use.
The right to pollution for a fee is not the same as the right to pollution illegally, and pollution cannot be released at will.
Vice Director of the Environmental Protection Agency of the City of Qingdao, Han Redong, explained that if illegal pollution, excessive pollution, and the penalties still have to be punished in accordance with the relevant regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises to avoid the punishment by buying the pollution rights.
In other words, through legal means, to crack down on environmental violations and to punish excessive pollution by companies, thereby protecting the environment and protecting public health.
Now, for their own sake, companies have increased their pollution control drive, valued their limited emissions rights and reduced emissions.
Driven by economic interests, reducing emissions of pollutants will transform from government enforcement to business-conscious market behaviour, thereby achieving the true purpose of protecting the environment, protecting nature and protecting public health.
The right to discharge, also known as the right to discharge nitrogen, is the right to discharge pollutants into the environment, within the limits allocated by the government, by the law.
This right is essentially the right of polluters to own, use and profit from environmental capacity resources.
The next step is to exchange the amount of pollutants between the sources of internal pollution by exchanging currency, provided that the total amount of pollutant emissions does not exceed the permitted amount.
The Clean Air Act has been applied to the management of air and river pollution since the 1970s, when it was proposed by economist Dale in 1968.
The pilot program has been in place since 2007 and is currently being implemented in 14 provinces, districts, cities and towns in Zhejiang, Jiangsu and other regions.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, several Russian warplanes have been flying support from the Syrian air base of Khamimim to assist the six strategic bombers in carrying out airstrikes against the Islamic State's target in Syria.
On February 22, the United States and Russia reached a ceasefire agreement on all sides of the Syrian conflict, which has been in effect since February 27.
Under the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes against terrorist organizations identified by the UN Security Council, such as the Islamic State-backed front lines.
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure at the base and the living conditions of Russian soldiers will be guaranteed accordingly.
He also said that if extremist forces are not attacked, they will spread to Russia.
While Russia has not reached an agreement with the West to jointly fight against extremist forces in Syria, Russia will strengthen cooperation with Syria, Iran, Iraq and others in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia responded to the Syrian government's invitation to launch a military strike against extremist forces in Syria.
On March 15, the main Russian military forces in Syria began to withdraw, but Russia promised to continue to maintain the air base at Khmeimim and the naval base at Taltus.
In the case of newborns and successful country-builders, Hobbes has been a good example: he inherited a hundred-year-old house and told the story of the inheritance of a piece of land.
Today, an average of 100,000 people gather annually to visit the mountain, either to bring a variety of ideas or to seek inner peace.
In fact, the relationship between the countryside and the city should be as warm as a mother and child, without strength and without need to rule.
There is no fixed model for rural development, but it is difficult to change it on the basis of rural development, and the most important thing should be to get the right people to the countryside.
The Shanghai Yangtze district police recently used electronic police to fix drivers driving mobile phones, seizing more than 30 vehicles a week.
With the popularity of smartphones, mobile phones are becoming more fun, browsing, tweeting, and even playing games, it seems that many people have to keep their phones open and even when driving, they can't stop.
The Road Traffic Safety Act of 2010 prohibits driving with a mobile phone and defines it as a threat to driving behaviour that is unnecessary.
Unfortunately, due to the number of offenders, the difficulty in obtaining evidence, and other reasons, this phenomenon has not been punished, and the legal provisions have almost become available.
If the authorities can decide to declare war on mobile phone gambling and normalize this measure, this illegal act can be curbed.
The strict management of the records of the household, the creation of electronic and paper records of the material for the registration of the accounts of the persons without a household, ensuring the complete validity of the records.
The public security authorities shall inform the relevant authorities in a timely manner of the situation in which the account of persons without accounts is being registered.
A comprehensive clean-up of policy measures inconsistent with the spirit of this implementation opinion, a serious revision of the amendment, and a definitive repeal of the repeal thereof, will be carried out.
In the collective shed in the village of East Ling in Taizhou, King Shefen, 48, was taking his workers to spray pear trees with pesticides.
The village has 150 apple orchards, 10 trees and only 12 workers plus one technical engineer.
Last year, $50,000, at my age, would have been impossible to get if I had worked in a factory.
Last year, the income of the villages in East Lining reached 22 million yuan, accounting for nearly half of the total agricultural income.
Village Secretary Suzifan: The per capita land area is growing every year, from 50 tons at the beginning, to over 100 tons now; the per capita yield of rice is increasing every year, and the income of professional farmers is growing every year.
The biggest highlight of the Sunan Rural Collective Economic Reform, which is to quantify the share of each village, is the clear ownership of the collective rural operational assets and the exploration of the separation of powers.
In July 2015, 14 Rural Economic Cooperation Organizations (RECOs) in Sichuan Township, Sichuan City, China, were involved in the distribution of accounts with the local village committee, the village committee performs the rural public affairs administration, and the cooperative is mainly engaged in operations.
The two institutions, which are not bound by each other, prevented the corruption of village staff from participating in collective asset management.
Jiangsu Provincial Agriculture Commission Deputy Director Sheng Bo Ping said Jiangsu will continue to push for reforms in the community share cooperation system, encourage joint development of farmers and establish a mechanism for democratic exercise of power at the village level.
Congratulations to the President of the Republic of China, Mr. Buiping: To further advance reforms, to engage in community-sharing cooperation, to quantify assets to employees, to fix them to farmers, to form clear ownership rights.
The implementation of his right to know, his right to participate in decision-making and his right to oversee democratic governance, and the three rights that he exercised on farmers through the Internet+, have indeed made it a standard operating mechanism for share-sharing.
Currently, the new collective economy in rural Sunan is mainly based on the four types of development: asset leasing, corporate equity, agricultural development, and co-development.
It is understood that the overseas exhibition is an important platform for promoting the construction of the Zhejiang Belt and Road Bridge.
The success of these overseas exhibitions to continue to pioneer emerging markets along the Belt and Road, creating an integrated platform for overseas exhibitions has accumulated valuable experience and a good foundation.

On August 11, the first festival of humidity tourism in the state of Jinan opened in the eastern city of Huai'an, in the state of Jinan.
Since 2014, tourism industry revenue has accounted for 10% of the Gross Domestic Product of Jiangsu City; it reached 11.3% in 2015.
East Huai City Wetland Hot Springs Tourism District, located in Linheia City, Jiangsu with the economic zone Linheia Road Linheia Zone No. 1, 70 km from Linheia City, 50 km from Linheia City, and 70 km from Chongqing City.
The area of the area is 3,000 square meters of indoor and 4,600 square meters of outdoor hot springs.
The young lady Zhang Xia: The handsome, handsome actress started shooting roads career after several years of reversing her career.
Zhang Dong Red, from Dong Park Village in Xiamen, Xiamen, just changed his old 29-inch TV from a 65-inch TV in his home a few days ago.
The daughter of a common farmer, she won silver in the women's 50m rifle triple jump final for China at the Rio Olympics on the evening of 11th.
On the night of the 11th, just before the new TV, Zhang Dong-red and dozens of close relatives and friends witnessed their daughter's struggle to get back on track, from being eliminated from the almost pre-race to a magical process that almost turned her back on her.
In the same day, Zhang Yi was once down in the rankings, seemingly far from the final.
But his parents and friends didn't give up, continually browsing live, seeing as the other players finished the game, Zhang Chang'e rose in the ranks, finally locking up a final seat, and his home burst into a moment of cheers.
In the final, Zhang Yi was once again ranked behind, with the last few shots more stable, and won silver with only 0.2 laps behind the champion.
Zhang, who is 27 years old this year, has almost won the silver medal with this piece on several occasions in his 16-year shooting career.
Her mother Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that while they were hesitating, Zhang found several of the same village's famous novelists.
The guest of honour in the novel were the same village children who were recommended to attend the training at the same time, including Zhang's cousin.
Soon after joining the gang, Zhang Xiaoxun returned to school in Xi'an for reasons such as family difficulties.
But after his coach Zhang Aje repeatedly worked, Zhang returned to the team.
After joining the provincial team, Zhang Yan was unable to make the national team because of his late arrival, and once again returned home because of his lack of hope.
This time, not only Zhang Aje, the head coach of the Shenzhen Shooting Archery Center and the Fujian Provincial Team came home, eventually persuading Zhang to return to the Provincial Team.
As in yesterday's match, the goalkeeper's persistence in the shoot was a turning point.
I was surprised to see how beautiful the hands of the coach were.
Zhang Dong Red recalled that her daughter's performance in the training test was not the best, but the rings were stable, which is also an important reason for her attraction to the coach.
During her training, Zhang Aje was most impressed by the contribution of the farmer girl.
He recalled that Zhang Yi entered the Vanshan firing squad more than a year later, and the team had been conducting long-term shooting training, requiring the team members to be unable to move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter was a quiet and intelligent child, and from an early age she loved to draw and make handmade toys.
I used to make clothes at home, make stuff, and make dolls in the corners.
She said that her daughter often made her own handmade toys, and that she was good at painting, from her five senses to her clothes, and that she was always able to make a living.
As an athlete, Zhang and his family gathered less and less, and only returned home on holidays, usually by phone.
The parents said that, whether it was meeting or calling, Zhang said little about his hardship, but rather about having fun with his parents.
The parents, who often do not see their daughters, carefully store their childhood paintings and the honours of their years at home.
Zhang Xiaolong showed her daughter's cartoons to reporters, and she should have continued to paint the manga without being a shooting athlete.
In the second floor of the living room, there was a box full of medals, medals and certificates she had received.
Zhang Dong Red has put the medals and medals in order, and the certificates are kept in the folder, and these are the honors that have been exchanged for decades, and we all cherish them.
Recently, the Hebei Province's Chikichi Foundation sent 16,000 yuan of condolences to the families of six families who lost loved ones in villages such as Chikichi, Taipei, and Guizuzang in the province of Hebei.
This is another consolation-caring action that the fund has sent to the community in search of the children and lonely elderly who lost their homes in the 7.19 tsunami.
7.19 Heavy rainfall has caused damage in many parts of Hebei Province, causing flooding disasters in parts of the province, and resulting in deaths and disappearances of personnel.
The impressive work of the well-known iron man who helped the village to drain the water, leaving behind a 2-year-old child and a wife of six, touched the entire province.
On August 4, the staff of the Hebei Shijiazhu Foundation and volunteers of the Hebei Brand Association came to the home of the well-to-do people of Hebei and handed over 3,200 yuan to the family of the people of Hebei.
When the Vice President of the brand Yelli learned about the situation of the family of the Yoichi, she immediately decided to launch a campaign to sell Yoichi in the company members of the brand, to help the family of the Yoichi to share their hardship.
The Hebei Provincial Charitable Fund, fully known as the Hebei Provincial Volunteer Service Foundation, was launched by the Hebei Branding Association Planning Commission and established in August 2015.
According to Hong Kong's Yang Oriental Daily, Yang on August 12, there are three main problems with the sale of continental diamonds: the net worth of the diamond is pushed up, the weight of the diamond is pushed up, and the after-sales is not guaranteed.
The city of Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers, and its craftsmen are known for their diamond cutting techniques.
With a small cloth bag, a handshake, a small slice of lightweight, worth nearly a million yuan, a Chinese woman involved in the purchase of diamonds, she described her experiences in Antwerp in June this year to mainland media.
She said she had hidden the diamond in her underwear, went to the bathroom for days, took a bath, and went to sleep in a very tight way.
She said the diamonds she bought in Antwerp cost about $55,000 per kilo, and the same quality diamonds are at a retail price of about $11,000 at the door.
She bought the diamond for a price of two percent and sold it all, once over 200,000 yuan.
According to the customs regulations of the mainland, diamonds are not goods or necessities of travel for travellers, therefore belonging to the category of goods, and must be declared at the time of entry, otherwise it is classified as smuggling, the situation can be seriously imprisoned.
According to foreign media, on 10th of July, the British Prime Minister's Office announced in Downing Street that British Prime Minister Theresa May will be in Switzerland for her summer vacation, but did not disclose a specific location.
According to media reports, the new British prime minister chose to go on a political holiday to Switzerland, a neutral country on the European continent, after the Brexit referendum.
The British newspaper Guardian commented that the symbolism of the neutral country of Switzerland played a role in the choice of the UK Prime Minister's first holiday.
The Daily Telegraph commented that Theresa May chose to go on holiday in Switzerland, the first time a British prime minister has visited since Mrs. Thatcher.
The choice of two female prime ministers and the choice of two male prime ministers, Blair and Cameron, to go on holiday in hotter places, is the opposite.
The new British Prime Minister, Theresa May, is reportedly returning to London on 24 August, after a series of important works and activities await her.
The UK Parliament will meet again on 5 September, with a debate on the second Brexit referendum, which is required online.
The UK referendum on 23 June decided to leave the EU, but the new British Prime Minister refused to launch Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on membership before the end of the year.
The city of Huangshan has 1,325 existing non-material cultural heritage projects, ranking first in the province in both type and number.
As the non-hereditary heritage of the culture of China depends mainly on oral transmission, many non-heritage are in danger of being lost, and the use of digital technologies is essential for preservation and protection.
According to the main work plans of the Provincial People's Standing Committee for this year, the Standing Committee plans to hear the special work reports and conduct inquiries on the implementation of the Banking Supervision and Administration Act and the development of local economic development.

China's Mars program has arrived
The mission will be a one-time round-trip, landing, and patrolling mission that has never been done before.
The mission of our country's Mars exploration mission is to go around, land, and explore, and this is a very difficult task.
Because Mars spacecraft takes 26 months to meet a time window, experts are working hard on a project to launch our first Mars spacecraft in 2020.
According to Shutter Taz, despite the fact that our aircraft have entered deep space, the completion of the Mars mission is still essential, and the discovery of Mars means that China has entered the era of deep space exploration in a real sense.
The first time a spacecraft is launched at this point in time, it is the most energy-saving spacecraft for a launch rocket.
The launch mission will be completed by the Chinese Commander-in-Chief Mission No. 5 carrying rockets, taking into account the quality of the Mars probe.
The mission of our country to orbit, land, and explore Mars was a first, and this was never done before, and the landing failed.
The technology involved in Mars detection is very diverse, especially because although Mars is a spacecraft, it has distinctive features compared to ordinary space probes.
In other words, the Mars detector must have the ability to determine the path of the orbiter and detect the dangers of obstacles.
According to Pyongyang, a researcher at the Chinese Space Science Group's Five Institute, the reason humans are so fond of exploring Mars is because exploring Mars has important scientific, technological and even future implications.
Mars is the most studied planet outside of Earth, and the history of human exploration using space probes spans almost the entire history of human space exploration.
The human race hopes to one day establish a permanent base on Mars and eventually migrate to Mars to make it a second home for humans.
There is also a lot of evidence that Mars was likely to be like Earth before it evolved into a thin, low-temperature, water-scarce atmosphere after billions of years.
Therefore, exploration or manned landings on Mars could provide a blueprint for a second Mars that would prevent the Earth from becoming unlivable to humans.
As of June 2016, 114 lunar and 43 Martian missions have been conducted worldwide.
However, from the 1990s to the present, humans have made 18 Mars explorations, compared to only 14 on the Moon.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rover vehicles in operation, but only one Moon orbiter and one Moon lander are in operation.
The world's space powers have developed a Mars system-targeted exploration program, which shows that Mars is hotter than the moon.
On November 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars probe, Mangalorean, becoming the first country in Asia to successfully explore Mars.
The Mangariyan fluid is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars, and to investigate whether there is methane and signs of life on Mars.
The most difficult part of the mission was that the spacecraft had only one chance to enter the Martian atmosphere after the airflow and the descent of the hydrogen.
According to Sun Zhejiang, the chief designer of the Mars probe at the Chinese Space Technology Group's five-star headquarters, the mission faces many technical challenges.
The atmospheric pressure on Mars is low, with only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on the Earth's surface, and high uncertainty.
Scientists are not yet fully aware of the factors that affect its changes and storm characteristics.
Mars often forms dust storms in summer, which cause a sharp decrease in the solar energy it receives, and must design a hibernation mode for the Mars rover to wait patiently for the dust to pass.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere also reduces the sunlight, which poses a challenge to the energy supply of Mars' exploration.
This would require a larger solar wing area for the probe, and a constant adjustment to the direction of the sun.
The gravity of Mars' surface is only 38% of Earth's, but it is much more than the Moon's surface, so the probe needs more power.
The most central and difficult part of this mission is the process of the spacecraft entering the Martian atmosphere, which is a one-time chance to make sure it succeeds.
Sun Jae-ju said that the entire process cannot be controlled by ground-time because the Earth is far away from Mars, so it must be done on its own.
Because there are not enough propellants to offset such high speeds, the deceleration of the Mars landing depends on the action of the Martian atmosphere, which is difficult to simulate on the ground.
The Ponzi scheme, which is generally similar to the way the moon is explored, is also used to orbit, land, orbit, and return to Mars, ultimately achieving the goal of manned landings.
Since Mars is farther from Earth than the Moon, exploring Mars requires a series of more complex technical challenges.
According to Taiwanese media, Taipei's chief executive, Zhang Lin, announced yesterday morning that the Taipei political party and its affiliated organizations have been unlawfully granted property treatment orders, which are effective from today.
The vice-president of the National Party, Jan Javadhan, said that the failure of a more than 100 years old National Party with a commitment and responsibility to society would not be such a failure.
Lin stressed that if a party, affiliated organization or trustee violates the provisions of regulations prohibiting execution, the Committee will investigate the powers of the office and punish the execution in accordance with the law.
Lin also announced the election of the Vice-Deputy of the Party Production Committee, to be held by the Deputy Director of the Taiwan Integrity Agency, Pyongyang.
He said that the committee was elected by the Chairman of the Party's Unfair Products Committee by Qui Li-xiong, and that the committee will be based on the experience of Hong Baekje's past investigations of major cases related to the Party's unfair products.
Jan Wahyun believes that as long as there is still Party product, no one will give you social contributions, if the whole Party product is taken away, the National Party can only ask for social support and sponsorship, and today there really is no opportunity to ask for it.
Jan Jahaj also stressed that even after the unfair party product regulations were put into place, the NPC products were not fully publicised and confiscated, and the rest would still be donated according to the promise, so that the party product license would be zero, and the party would start from zero.
Original title: Dr. Yang Lan Wenfeng against the Central Television host Wang Xiang
The legal news agency Late News reported that after the comments of the TV host Wang Xiang on Sina Weibo about the incident of Dr. Liu in the Yangtze Corridor, Wang Xiang and Beijing Dream Research Network Technology Limited were brought to court.
The Hainan court ruled yesterday afternoon that Wang Zhiang and Microman were not infringing and rejected all claims by Lanvietfeng.
In early 2014, a Central Television reporter Wang Xian investigation found that despite the fact that Ranhwen-Peng, who sat in the hospital corridor for more than 600 days, was portrayed by the media as a sad hero who was oppressed by the regime, there was a lot of false information in these reports.
On March 29, 2014, the TV news investigation produced the Doctor Who series The Corridor of the Corridor aired.
The reports of the media about the alleged over-medication of Ranveer Peen are not supported by any evidence.
Wang Xiang also described the reason for reaching this stage in a self-certified blog post as character and obviously biased personality.
Ranviet Peong has asked Wang Xiang to remove Weibo, apologise to him and compensate him for the spiritual damage of 100,000 yuan.
During the trial, both sides argued strongly about whether Wang Xiang had violated the reputation of Ranviet Phan.
China's athletics team is busy with women's soccer, four-bike race and hopes to break through
The bike is expected to achieve a zero-breaking Olympic gold medal, while the girls will challenge the two-time world champion Germany, looking forward to a cold-blooded run into the top four.
Wang Town has been in the spotlight for nearly two seasons, winning silver at the Beijing World Championships last year, and being promoted to individual event champion again at the World Championships in May this year.
According to foreign media, 27-year-old South Korean archer Zhang Huijian won the gold medal in the women's individual archery event, and won the Olympic gold medal after the group stage, becoming the double crowned champion.
Zhang Huijian, considered a latecomer, who regretted not winning the entry ticket to the London Olympics last year, is now proudly standing on the podium at the Rio Olympics.
Zhang Hui-Jin won the gold medal in the women's individual javelin throw final at Rio Zamba Arena in Brazil, defeating Lisa Unru of Germany by a score of 6-2.
She first shot in the fourth grade of elementary school and won her first individual gold medal at the World Cup in 2014 at the age of 27.
Zhang Huijian recalled that there was no level of competition in the country before high school.
Zhang Wenjian, who finished fourth in the individual all-around at the London Olympics four years ago, missed out on the Olympic ticket and was able to win two gold medals while sitting down with his colleagues and friends.
Zhang Weijian spoke about his message of winning the gold medal after the women's individual archery event, and he was happy to have thrown the arrow as early as possible.
The 28-year-old South Korean archer, who won the bronze medal in the individual archery event at the London Olympics, won the bronze medal.
Chihiro Abe lost to Zhang Xiejin in the semi-final and won the bronze medal with Mexican athlete Alejandra Valencia.
The first time that the team had ever won a bronze medal was in the final, where they were able to win the gold medal.
The first is the coaching staff's rich experience in continuous research, followed by the scientific training methods, which all require long-term accumulation.
Archery teams use military training, crossing cemeteries at night, and other methods to help the team focus and stay normal.
Although not confirmed, many sources have said that Apple's fall 2016 launch will be in September, and the iPhone 7 is coming.
While Apple has not responded, there have been reports of new iPhone features and configurations, and even images of iPhone 7 models are available online.
The new generation of iPhones is so hot, so tight, so cheap... If you want to buy a good one for the first time, you have to choose a good channel, like Sunny.
This has made people more disappointed with the new phone, and it has grown, but it can't project a holographic image at all!
The iPhone 7 is like any other iPhone, with a myriad of secrets before it was born.
In addition, several sources claim that the new generation of iPhones will eliminate the 3.5mm headphone interface and use Bluetooth connectivity and charging interfaces, which will allow for the addition of a second speaker to Apple.
Another evidence of this is that Apple allowed headphone manufacturers to produce headphone products connected by a charging interface as early as 2014.
Whether the news is true or false, the answers will not be revealed until Apple's fall 2016 launch.
However, this does not prevent the industry from seeing the prospects for the iPhone 7, and many believe that the iPhone 7 will likely be the last major upgrade to Apple's iPhone series.
The iPhone market share has declined, although data released by the recent market research agency IDC showed that iPhone's market share has declined.
In the case of the iPhone 7, Goldman Sachs maintains a nickel-to- nickel rating for Apple's stock, while analysts at BMO believe the iPhone 7 will have a historic sales record.
At the same time, Boutron CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple's future revenue growth is likely to exceed 20%, which is entirely due to the launch of the iPhone 7.
7% of respondents said they plan to buy an iPhone 7, compared to just 4% two years ago.
It is reported that 20% of users who currently own an iPhone 6 or 6Plus plan to buy an iPhone 7, a relatively high proportion.
Second, according to expert analysis, most apple trees prefer to replace their iPhones with their own.
According to statistics, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones in two years, or nearly 120 million users have used their phones in two years.
According to media reports, Taiwan experienced several earthquakes during the iPhone 7 production, the extent of the damage to the Pyongyang power plant was beyond belief, and could have an impact on the early iPhone 7 supply.
The supply and demand contradictions affect the average user, it's time to choose a good channel, the first time to get the good iPhone 7 at a low price.
According to sources, in recent years, senior Sunni officials have met with Apple frequently in order to prepare sufficient supplies.
The operators have already reached a deal with Suning, and it is anticipated that the deeper cooperation between the two parties will inevitably bring lower prices and more attentive services to users.
The lowest price consumers can earn is only 7 yuan a day to buy an iPhone 7.
The abundance of supplies and a variety of offers will make buying an iPhone 7 no longer a strain on the mountains, but the logistics of Sunning will make this a more intuitive experience.
Maybe you'll get a phone call at midnight, hello, Sunny is easy to buy, your iPhone 7 is here.
The organizers hope to bring the local people to a better understanding of the historical Chinese culture through the cultural exhibition, thus enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two countries.
The exhibition in Barcelona is part of the European Tour, which will run until early October.
The Bank of China, Poof Bank, released its semi-annual report yesterday, showing that securities have increased their shares again in the second quarter of 2016.
Among them, China securities increased its stake in Bank of China to 299.31 million shares, and at the end of June, the number of shares held by China securities in Bank of China increased to 387 million shares, which also increased its share from 33.5% to 362%.[3]

Recently, the Hobos Park in Zhongfu Village Lion Beach, Yangon, Zhejiang Province, was officially opened to villagers and tourists.
The park consists of more than 100 small circular ponds, which grow about 300 varieties of sightseeing hazelnuts, sleeping lotus, etc.
The rural flour industry, which is both spectacular, relaxing and economically beneficial, is a highlight of the development of the new rural areas.
According to foreign media, the event of the Rio Olympics in Rio de Janeiro has recently received a lot of attention from the outside world as the water of the swimming pool has turned from blue to green.
However, on the morning of the 10th, the water of the water polo pool next to the swimming pool also turned green.
The Australian water polo player said he had a stinging eye after the game and wanted to shed tears.
Earlier, Rio Olympic officials confirmed that the pool water had turned green and said that the change in color was due to a weakness in the elasticity of the pool and would not affect the health of the athletes.
However, the Australian athlete said he had a stinging eye after winning the match against Japan in the water polo pool.
The competition organizers first worked on the problem of overworking the pool on the evening of 9 after the pool water turned green, but on the morning of 10 they found that the color of the pool also changed rapidly.
The Australian team's environmental conditions at the pool gradually deteriorated during the match against Japan, but the officials stressed that they will restore the water quality of the two pools to their original colors on 11th.
Rio Olympic spokesman Mario Andrada said: "Yesterday afternoon, the water level in the swimming pool first weakened.
We know a number of possible causes of water colour changes in ponds and the concentration of water in them.
The Centre for Water Sports conducted a series of water quality tests, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used pools to determine the standard water quality conditions.
Well, we've been doing normal things these days, but we may have ignored the impact that athletes can have on water quality.
The change in water colour is certainly not an effect on physical health, especially for athletes.
The independent team confirmed our assessment and confirmed the steps we have taken to restore the pool to its normal colour and chemical state.
We were hoping that the pool would return to its normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by the rain.
According to Taiwan's Xinhua news agency, a bombing at a prison in the outskirts of Manila last night injured the jail's director, killing 10 prisoners, including two Chinese.
ABS-CBN TV reported that the incident occurred at around 9pm yesterday in the Paranaque City Jail, but the police did not make an initial statement until 2am today.
The police said that the 10 prisoners had asked the warden to transfer their prison sentences, but neither side speculated, and the prisoners threw grenades, which led to the explosion.
The prison has not released the names of the dead inmates, but GMA TV reported that two Chinese prisoners were among them.
As of 8 a.m., the prison had not provided details, including how the prisoners obtained the grenades.
Yesterday, Central Philippine Police entered the Leyte Provincial Prison, killing one prisoner who tried to attack the police station.
Urumqi regulates the order of operation of the tourist retail market, travel agencies must sign contracts with tourists
Now that Xinjiang has entered the tourism boom season, the tourism enforcement branch of the Uroumzi City Tourism Law Enforcement Branch, the United City Transport Administration, has been investigating issues such as non-regulation of tourist vehicles in the retail market, low contract rates signed by travel agencies with tourists.
At 8am yesterday, around the Kempinski Hotel, about 10 buses full of tourists were parked, mostly by a group of strangers heading for a day trip to the lake.
Hello, I'm from the Urumqi City Tourism Board, and you have a contract with this travel agency?
The staff of the Law Enforcement Branch of the Urumqi Municipal Transportation Administration (UTC) explained: "The tourist cars and buses operating tourist transport projects in Urumqi market are not qualified for the job.
The fine for over-the-counter operations ranges from three to 100,000 yuan and the fine for drivers without a license is 2,000 yuan.
It is understood that the tourism enforcement department of the city of Urumqi has previously inspected places where tourists are concentrated, such as West Park, Red Mountain and others.
In the two inspections, the deputy captain of the tourism enforcement branch in Urumqi said: "The first is safety, the second is regulation, the tourist vehicles are small, and when there is a problem, the crowd dies".
The company and the transportation authorities have been working together to conduct ongoing market inspections and regulate the use of vehicles by travel agencies to ensure the safety of tourists.
On the morning of August 12, the State Department Press Office held a press conference on the state of the national economy in July 2016.
The head of the National Economy Comprehensive Statistics Department, Sheng Liang, said that in July, the growth rate of some indicators of the national economy slowed, but still operated within a reasonable range.
The figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics show that the growth rate of fixed asset investments in July and the total imports have declined.
In general, I would like to borrow a phrase from the Prime Minister about the national economy in July, which is fluctuating and still going strong, which gives a better overview of the characteristics of the economic operation in July.
He explained that the volatility of the slope meant that some of the economic indicators in July did decline.
The export pressure is still high because the domestic and foreign economy is still in a deep adjustment in July, the international situation is complex and changing, and the global economy is not recovering as expected.
From the domestic perspective, the entire economy is still in the critical phase of adjustment, adjustment pain is being released, and the economy is facing a lot of downward pressure, so some indicators are fluctuating.
Shengliang pointed out that there was also a special situation in July, where the flood disaster was more severe and the hot and humid weather had some impact on production operations in some areas.
According to a recent report by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people were affected and the direct economic loss was over 200 billion yuan.
The impact of the new measures on the region varies from industry, investment and transportation indicators.
The weekly freight traffic growth in July was down 3.6 percentage points from the previous month, and flood disasters have had some impact on traffic in these areas.
In view of these factors, some of the indicators in July were fluctuating, which is normal and expected.
He said that the momentum is still good, but despite the slowdown in economic growth, the overall economic operation is stable, stable and stable.
The CPI rose 1.8% in July, 0.2% in the RIP; 2.1% in July and 1.7%, so the overall price situation is stable.
According to the Chongqing City Meteorological Office portal for high temperature weather statistics for different districts, other than Yangon, the rest of our city can receive varying degrees of high temperature allowance.
At least 28 provinces have already defined the standard for allowances, but the standard for allocation is different from provincial to municipal, and Chongqing is a way of getting a high-temperature allowance on a high-temperature working day.
The standard is not less than 10 yuan per person per day for 35°C above 37°C and not less than 15 yuan per person per day for 37°C above 37°C.
A maximum of 20 yuan per day per month is available to workers at high temperatures above 40°C (except for workers who have already been granted a statutory allowance for high-temperature work).
According to this standard, the highest temperature of the previous month in the state was 330 yuan, the lowest in the city was 80 yuan, and there was no heat allowance due to the fact that the highest temperature in the state was not above the high temperature standard.
In the past, many units have used cooling drinks to pay for high-temperature subsidies, and the Metropolitan Safety Authority said this behavior was not in line with the current method.
The workers' wages shall not be deducted or reduced by the employee unit due to the cessation of work and the reduction of working hours due to high temperature.
The city's civil society agency said that employees who work in high temperatures and do not receive high-temperature allowances can seek legal rights through the labor dispute mediation agency in the company, or call 12333 complaints.
If a person is denied a high-temperature allowance, workers can complain to the competent authority for social security for human resources above the county level where they work.
At the same time, since the high-temperature allowance is part of wages, not benefits, it should be included in the total wages, tax deductions.
Therefore, the high-temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage range and must be issued in cash and cannot be replaced with physical items such as drinks.
The newly built station is located in the high-speed rail section of the city of Urumqi, with a total building area of about 100,000 square meters.
The ground floor has 1 or 2 floors for entrance, waiting room and office and commercial buildings, and the ground floor has 1 exit level.
Currently, the Urumqi station is the largest integrated transport hub in Xinjiang, which integrates high-speed rail, rail transport, buses, taxis, etc. and provides seamless connectivity in various modes of transportation.
There are three ticketing halls on the north and south sides of the platform, with 39 individual ticketing windows and 34 automatic ticket machines.
In terms of check-in, there are 30 passages on either side of the waiting area, and passengers can check-in quickly based on the check-in number on the ticket.
If you need help, you can choose from 41 call buttons set up nearby by pressing the power station and get a timely service.
From July 1, the passenger train from Old Bus Station, or Urumqi Junction Station, will be moving to Urumqi Station in stages.
This means that all the cars and 30 trains can be parked at the station in Urumqi.
Now both stations can buy tickets for buses, and trains run between them in about 10 minutes, and passengers need to pay attention to the specific stations of ticket start and end.
The official commissioning of the new passenger station in Urumqi will be an important platform for the construction of a national integrated transportation city in Xinjiang, and for the promotion of the economic belt and construction of new districts along the Silk Road.
The female, Gracia, is a large-mouthed bird that spreads the air of the tropical rainforest.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the giant-mouthed bird Gracia and its stories have long been known.
At a press conference on August 10, Gracia, who had been treated for surgery, finally made her debut, showing people her new 3D printed plastic bird nest.
The giant-mouthed bird that was cut down and killed a year and a half ago has finally been reincarnated.
The day not only announces that it has been 100% healthy, but also the day it moved to a luxurious birdhouse, where it met with human friends who cared about it.
The first of these, Gracia, was a little bit of a wimp, but she was often a little bit of a wimp, rolling around in the water and eating new grapes with new spices.
To remind people of the damage it has suffered, the technicians did not give it a new color, but kept the original white of the 3D printing material.
Outside the bird's nest is a thin layer of cornea, empty inside, with only a few fine skeletal supporting rods intersecting.
Although there is such an internal reinforcement component, the larvae of the giant's mouth are still fragile and break when injured.
The Animal Rescue Center, an ornithologist and a US 3D printing company worked together to create several test kites for Gracia, which ultimately made the perfect kit for her kites.
Today, Gracia is able to use fresh water, eat, and even grow grains of wheat.
The final design of the finished product took about two months to print and took only four or five hours.
3D printing is not the future of technology, it is actually coming into my life. Thomas Lang, chairman of SG3D Printing USA, said in an interview with Xinhua International.
In January 2015, a blood-sucking giant-mouthed bird, Gracia, was found dead in a farm in the Alajuela province of central Costa Rica.
The drug addiction was severely broken by a group of young people who were completely unable to eat and were dying.
The tragedy in Gracia has sparked protests against animal cruelty outside Costa Rica after media reports.
The demands for stricter animal protection laws and increased punishments for abusers have been made.
People volunteered to do their best to help Gracia recover from her injuries.
Even the inventor of 3D printing technology, Chuck Heller, was involved in the design of the Gracie's addiction.
The situation in Mangrasiya is very special, with the remaining part of the roof less than 1 cm, so the installation of the new roof is very difficult.
We first scanned Gracia, then designed and produced an extension of the prototype that was slightly longer than the rest of the body, and then stuck it on top with a sticky stick.
The newly created system will reduce further invasive damage to Gracia, Zhang told Xinhua International.
Before installing the mask, the staff must clean the faucet for Gracia every day to prevent infection.
Far from the mill, the story of the giant mouthed bird Gracia was inspired by the famous documentary director Paula Eredia and the exploration news channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded the tiny drops of the installation of the new fox by Gracia, and recorded a documentary, The Fox's Country, which aired on Animal Planet this month.
The documentary, The Country of the Mockingbird, shows how a small, small, big-mouthed bird can change a country, and how it can get people involved in the fight against animal cruelty.
Core tip: Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of small independent refineries in China known as T-teaspoon.
Japan's largest oil company JX Energy believes China's expansion of exports is one of the reasons for the slump in the market.
Japanese oil companies have been particularly wary of the rise of small independent refineries in China, known as the "Thai Tea Tea Plant".
The quality of China's oil products is gradually approaching that of Japan due to the Chinese government's stricter environmental regulations.
Prior to the approval of the import of crude oil, the pumps of the tea mills were generally refined with heavy sulfur-containing oil imported from Russia and other countries.
The high sulfur content of oil products produced, poor oil products, are one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining the import permit for crude oil, the Tsai refinery was able to import low sulfur content of Amman crude oil and Russian crude oil, and the quality of its oil products was improved.
The company said that the capacity of refining equipment has also improved as the quality standards of oil products in China have improved.
As a result, the quality of China's oil products exported to the outside world has gradually reached the same level as Japan's (the world's highest quality).
JX Energy said that after the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil pipes to Australia, competing with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Despite the fact that the Japanese oil industry is facing a crisis, the response strategy adopted by the Japanese oil companies is to focus on the market sector while exporting to profitable regions.
The importance of tea refineries is also increasing due to the enormous impact of Chinese oil exports on the Asian market.
The 2016 Young People's Day Aid campaign, launched on May 26, has reached more than 800 poor schoolchildren applying for grants after two months of registration.
In the course of the grant, more than 1.2 million yuan of social contributions have been received (five publications have been made) that can help at least 240 students of Khangmen Son-Dun-Dream University.
The donations are ongoing and the newspaper calls on the community to continue to reach out to help more children in difficulty in families to receive funding and social care.
To ensure that the actions of the school are fair, open and transparent, the paper has published the basic information of the school today, and today the first 100 students are being supervised by readers.
Li Group Sunshine Assistant Action, a Chinese charity brand, has been running in Jiangsu since 2003 and has funded over 4,000 poor children.
The program is funded by the University of California, San Diego, and the University of California, San Diego.
Statistics Australia says that New Zealand's population growth has exceeded 2% during the peak of the baby boom population in 1974 and the 1950s and early 1960s alone.
As of June, New Zealand's net immigration inflow in the 12 months to date was 691 million, which has been a major driver of population growth in recent years.
In addition, the natural growth of New Zealand's population in the same period was 282 000 people.
The data shows that in the last 10 years, New Zealand has had an average net influx of 218,000 immigrants per year, with a natural population growth rate of 323,000 per year.
From a demographic perspective, the large influx of immigrants means that the proportion of the working age population aged 15 to 39 is increasing gradually.
In the 12 months to June 2016, the working-age population in New Zealand grew by 3.6% to 1,58 million.
At the same time, the population of older people over 65 years of age has increased by 3.6% to 700,000.
At 10 a.m. yesterday, the X9003 international freight train left the Xi'an Nevsuk station for Almaty, Kazakhstan.
The train's run marks the first time the Xi'an Railway has successfully surpassed 10,000 since its launch in 2013 in the Central Asian International Freight Line.
The cargo categories of the cargo class are comprised of six categories of industrial raw materials, mechanical equipment, industrial parts, building materials, food and light industrial products, totalling 206 varieties.
As of August 11, this year, the new station operated 221 rows of 10009 vehicles, which collectively transported 338,000 tons of export goods, of which 84 rows were operated in 2016, an increase of 47% compared to 2016.
It is known that the first cargo of the Central Asian shipment was made by the Chinese shipbuilder, and today it has attracted a large number of foreign supplies to the list.
By the end of July, the volume of containers in the Central Asian group exceeded 64,000, an increase of 8% from the same period in 2015.
With the launch of encryption in Central Asia, the Shiang Railway Agency has increased freight traffic to new stations year after year.
In 2015, the total annual freight throughput of the new station was 2477,000 tonnes, and as of 10 August 2016, the freight shipment reached 153.1 million tonnes, an increase of 6.7% over the same period last year.
To meet the needs of future development, the Xi'an Railway Agency has launched the construction plan for the Xi'an Railway Integrated Logistics Center, which will be built in the center of the newly built station, and is working to build a modern, newly built railway integrated logistics park.
An Indian uncle who just died last week at Dubai International Airport, won a $1 million prize at the same airport.
Mohammed Bashir Abdul Khaddar, an Indian resident in Dubai, UAE, has a habit of buying tickets every time he returns to his country.
His 21-year-old son, who died of an accidental fall on his 13th birthday, has been working hard to pay back his medical bills.

Although it is already autumn, the strength of the Tiger's nest does not seem to be any worse than that of the summer.
In addition to making the skin of the students darker, ultraviolet light also causes more sun damage, how can the skin pass through the training without getting sun damage?
The SPF is the sunscreen index for UVB ultraviolet rays, and the most common SPF is 15, 30, 50, etc.
Products labeled with PA are targeted at UVA, so sunscreen products play a more effective role, usually using PA intensity to indicate +, and more than one + to indicate an extended effective protection time.
Oily skin should be used for waterproof sunscreen products with a strong penetration, and sunscreen spray is also a good option.
Dry skin should choose a sunscreen with a shiny texture; neutral skin is generally not strictly regulated, and any maintenance product on sensitive skin rubbing is a burden, and it is recommended to choose a purely physical sunscreen.
Remove the sunscreen half an hour in advance, as it takes time for sunscreen to fully penetrate the skin.
The military training day is longer, and sunscreen is rubbed every two hours to have lasting effects, so don't sneak around.
The military advised that the skin should not be immediately exposed to sunlight and should not use white products.
After the military training, it is possible to use towels wrapped in ice to cool the burned skin to reduce local drying heat.
Farmers who buy farm machinery during the exhibition will continue to implement the policy of additional subsidies, with farmers buying farm machinery receiving up to 40% subsidies.
The exhibition is aimed at global tenders, in particular to increase the invitation to countries along the Belt and Road and to countries in the target market.
The exhibition aims to complete 60 tendering projects, bring in 22 billion yuan in funding, sign more than 160 trade contracts worth 3.2 billion yuan.
It is reported that the reason for the seven-year successive settlement of the gambling site is the strong industrial base of the city of Pudong, Hunan province, and the long history of industrial development.
As the host of the JBC, JBC has established trade and business relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
The Expo is an important platform for the development of the local feature industry, and the promotion of the feature industry outside the country.
At night, the ionization layer is filled with free electrons, which means that the radio signal can go further.
According to the August 11 issue of the American public science magazine, the U.S. Air Force is interested in the effect of replicating the effect.
While the ionization layer with a stable amount of free electrons can help people listen to the radio on the broadcast edge of a university radio station, this may not be in the interest of the US Air Force.
The electron-filled ionization layer means that the radio used by the military has a greater range of transmission and may provide some protection for global positioning systems (GPS) signals to protect them from solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of cubic satellites that can strengthen the ion layer when needed.
But first, the teams that have signed contracts with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles are working.
Industry data shows that in 2015, the total coal capacity was close to 6 billion tonnes, with the country's coal capacity exceeding 1.8 billion tonnes.
In the last decade, the State Council has issued five notifications to eliminate excess and backward capacity.
Although the first four were not targeted at the coal industry, the target industry is directly related to the coal industry.
In November, the price of coal on the island of Liaoning, which is 5,500 KM, fell to 370 yuan per barrel in the long term, and 90% of coal companies lost.
Since February, coal prices have been steadily rising, with recent increases in coal prices for the last four weeks, reaching a 16-month high of 436 yuan per tonne, up nearly 70 yuan from the beginning of the year.
As prices soared, there was concern about the consequences: Will a small coal mine be able to reproduce?
In this regard, the Chairman of the Economic Institute of China's Hainan Institute of Reform and Development, Zhang Ming, has analyzed and interpreted the results.
M. M. M.: The decommissioning of coal has attracted a lot of attention from all sides, and the decommissioning of coal industry results published today are also a cause for concern.
These three factors reflect the relatively backward nature of our past transformations in growth, which has not yet been fundamentally transformed by government-led growth.
Second, this is directly related to the capacity of local governments to drive, and in the process of decommissioning, funds and support measures must be put in place, and in this respect, the differences between regions are quite large.
Third, if some of the provinces that are currently progressing relatively slowly are to catch up in the second half of the year, they may face a greater risk.
In this case, the process of relying on central grants to advance capacity may have some negative impact.
First, decommissioning is not a simple matter of total control.
Our aim is to rebuild the entire coal industry by eliminating backward capacity, promoting structural optimization and re-engineering the industry.
In the process of deploying decommissioning, local governments must combine the transformation upgrades of decommissioning and the coal industry to develop the related services sector.
Second, if we want to complete this year's decapacity task, we must also make full use of the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision.
Finally, we need to strengthen the role of social security in the world.
As the market is directly involved in employment issues, we need to strengthen the training of employees and employees in employment skills.
The decline in the ranking was due to the deterioration in foreign investment expectations for Brazil's GDP growth over the medium term.
In 2015, Brazil's participation in global direct investment was 3.7%, down from 5.7% in 2014.
The International Investment Attraction Index of the Swiss Bank is divided into four indexes: infrastructure, economic prospects, business environment and direct investment.
In 2015, Brazil's international direct investment was $64.6 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year, investment in Brazil's green-light green-light (in the model of investing in offshore plants) was $17.9 billion, down 2.1 percent.
In Brazil, there are 288 green-field investment projects in tin, with an average annual amount of 314 tin from 2003 to 2014.
However, in the first half of 2016, international direct investment in Brazil reached $33.8 billion, an increase of almost 10% compared to the same period last year.
Canadian police beat ISIS supporters: suicide bombing preparations for the market close to completion
The taxi company said the taxi was taken to the driver's house before the police arrived.
In a press release Wednesday, Canadian police said the information they received included "martyred videos" provided by the FBI about the young man who would carry out the attack.
According to German Voice, a man wearing a black bar-Arafah hat was reading the Koran, mentioning crimes against Muslims and vowing to launch an attack on a Canadian city soon.
He said in the video that the attack would take place within 72 hours, and at peak hours.
The incident was the first time since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office that police had killed a suspect in a terrorist attack.
The upgraded Jinghang Grand Canal branch line, the Yangtze River and the North Grand Slip Canal, will charge a fare from September 1.
The two shipping lanes have been converted to social finance and have been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.
The Yangtze River waterway runs through the town of Kim, Fish Taeng, and enters the main waterway of the Jianghan Grand Canal via the Yangtze Lake, with a total length of 32.5 km.
According to the needs of the air transport, the Yangtze River shipping channel has been modified in a manner that is maintained, the depth of the water is deepened, the cutting of the water is done in a hurry, and the conditions of the air transport are improved.
The channel runs through the Qingdao County, Ningbo District, and enters the main channel of the Jianghan Grand Canal via Nanyang Lake, at a length of 19 km.
The construction of the two shipping lanes began in February 2011 and the transfer of receipts, investment and operations to the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center in Jinan City was completed in January 2015.
In accordance with the principle of construction of the loan, the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center in Jining City is charging the passage of the ferry according to the fee standards approved by the Shandong Provincial Office of Pricing.
The basic transit fee is 1.75 yuan/kg and the mileage fee is 0.05 yuan/kg.
The fee is charged from 15 June 2016 to 14 June 2019.
The reporter learned from the Jining City Port Authority that there are currently four charging routes in Jining, namely the Yangtze River, the White River, the Great Northern Slip and the Huawan Fu River.
The four shipping lanes are being upgraded to serve the Jinghang Grand Canal, which is being upgraded using social finance.
The Renminbi Line Upgrading Project is the first model to use the Renminbi + Market Flow model for the Renminbi Port Shipping Infrastructure Construction project in Shandong Province, with the government making a major investment and social funds filling the funding gap.
The White Horse, the Huangfu River, and the Great Northern Slip River are all purely marketed.
The state financial allocation of funds cannot meet the needs of engineering construction and constrains progress in the upgrading of the shipping lanes.
Social funds for the construction of public infrastructure in accordance with the requirements of national policies are also a way to break the bottleneck.
Ningze's performance in the semi-final of the 100m freestyle swimming has left many Chinese viewers speechless.
In the 50m freestyle, Ningze-san once again refreshed the bottom line.
In fact, 50m freestyle swimming is not the main sport of Nietzsche, but his performance and best results at the Kassam World Championships also determine that he is unlikely to break through in this project.
Of course, Hong Kong's official media outlet Zhao Zhao revealed that the biggest reason for Ningze's failure was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many factors outside the field may have had a major impact on his future thinking, and he may now be more interested in entering the entertainment world.
After the Kazan World Championships, Nietzsche became a red light with his super high values and good results.
The name "Mommy" is also used to describe the name of the man who is the father of the country, the man who is the mother of the country, the man who is the mother of the country, the man who is the mother of the country.
The business has been a source of great wealth and a source of great wealth, and it has become a glittering avenue.
In this case, even if Nietzsche chose to retire at this time to join the entertainment world, it was not only his freedom but also a seemingly viable path.
After all, he was only 23 years old and had some education, and he could be a part of a TV series or two with his popularity.
But what Nietzsche needs to see is whether he is qualified enough compared to his predecessors.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the 21-year-old has reached the end of her career as an athlete.
Her beautiful appearance quickly made her remembered and laid the foundation for her future entertainment career.
After retiring from the military, Liu starred in several television series and in 2013 set up his own studio.
She competed in the men's 10 metre platform at two Olympic Games, winning 2 golds and 2 silvers.
However, after losing to team-mate Hu Jia in the men's 10m event at the 2004 Olympics, Tan Liang's athletic status declined and he was fired by the team.
He and his daughter attend a variety show, where his parents go, and even keep his eyes peeled.
The golden age of gymnastics, Lee Hyun-woo and Chen Yi-Ice, all played a high-profile role in various variety shows.
It is worth mentioning that Liu Li Xiaobo led China to the 2008 Olympic men's team title, and Liu was twice awarded the individual all-around gold medal, known as the all-around king.
Chen Yi-hyeong also became the ring king while leading China to the 2012 Olympic group championship.
After losing the gold medal at the London Olympics, Chen's ice-skating moves also left him with a lot of dust.
However, the main energy of these athletes is still on the field, and for the complex program, they are just like a touch of water.
But whether you are a retired or active athlete, to be favored by the entertainment industry requires a certain amount of achievement.
After all, athletes are entering a new field, whether it's ability or people, and it's a vacuum.
Even the old-timers of the entertainment world like Tendai and Yang, who have been around for years, are still remembered by the general public, and more often than not, they are remembered for their performance at the Olympics.
The newcomers, such as Bowie, Lee Xiaojun, and others, who were introduced to the series, were all Olympic champions.
In comparison to the above, Nietzsche's title of swimming world champion was still slightly slim.
Moreover, compared to the success of others like Tendai, Liu, and Liu Wei, Ningze-won would have been able to retreat at the age of 23 if his career was a bit of a setback, and the negative impact on his image would have been unimaginable.
After all, the athletes, the demands of the people are not to win 100 but to fight hard, and Nietzsche is far from it.
The first step is to get back to the old age of the Ninja, and to get back to the old age of the Ninja, which is based on the color of the brain.
It's hard to be a little bit more active, just looking out and trying to get into the entertainment world, and it's hard to train to find the right attitude.
The path of life is chosen according to the individual's will, but how to choose it should be numbered in the mind of the person.
On the surface, social media platforms have expanded social circles and reduced loneliness.
The power of networking is expanding, not only replacing traditional telephone connections, but even entering the real world online, and changing the social life of the people today.
The benefits of online social networking are obvious, such as convenience and speed, and are particularly prone to younger people.
A survey of college students' social habits showed that 57% of college students use their phones for more than 5 hours a day, and the basic routine of their daily lives is to use them.
The social networking platforms are low-cost, fast-transmission, and multi-person interactions that meet the needs of today's college students.
The main reasons for our growing love for online chat are to expand adult relationships, engage in more equal dialogue and avoid social anxiety.
Newcomers love to communicate with colleagues online, and because they are not very familiar with the unit, the relationship is closer than ever to the likes of them through social media.
The love affair is also often communicated online, and the couple has not been in contact with friends for a while because of some mistakes, and then converse in a large group of words.
The IT engineer is said to be a deeply networked social enthusiast, with most of his social life happening online, with more network contacts than online friends.
The legend itself is more confident than the fish in the net.
The answer is that the person can answer to his friends at any time, because there is a lot of time to consider the words and express them more clearly.
I've been hiding under the ID and I've been avoiding face-to-face interactions, not only giving me a little bit more time and space to think and talk to each other.
People with different identities have the same rights and effectiveness to speak, and social concerns in real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace.
However, the gossiping friend, Little Bunny, feels that gossip in life is a barbaric and uninteresting homely bunny.
The little mouse and the proverb met in a large crowd, because they were both active speakers, and they quickly became acquainted.
The young man felt that if the gossip and the internet judge two people, the words are boring, and not actively comment, repeating a few phrases, well, yes, yes, or no, I'm going to go online to check out the phrases.
The police have already intervened in the investigation and the Ministry of Transportation will also step up efforts to correct illegal vehicles.

The merged payment institution shall complete the payment business contract within six months from the date of the announcement.
The People's Bank of China will handle cancellation and exchange of business license fees after the completion of the business contract.
Due to the existence of serious business violations, stagnation of business or the type of business termination actively requested by some payment institutions, the extension of the scope of their business is reduced.
The relevant institutions shall cease to carry out the relevant payment operations in an orderly manner upon request within six months from the date of the announcement.
The People's Bank of China will continue to carry out the work of the legal and prudent extension of the license to operate in the country.

Mayor Wilfredo Lopez of Rivaz, speaking at the teacher training site, said that the Nicaraguan government agencies are working together to develop environmental management plans and plant trees with the HKND Group.
As the developer of the canal project, HKND Group has always followed international best practices to build canals to international standards and to maximize the environmental protection of Nicaragua.
The university students, through a combination of theory and practice, lead middle school students to plant trees together and teach the next generation of Nicaraguans how to green the environment.
A full team of professors from the Department of Natural Resources and Environment at the National Agricultural University of Nicaragua, Francisco Reyes, participated in a project to educate people about tree planting and forestry.
We have reason to believe that the same trans-ocean canal project led by HKND Group will bring more benefits to the people of the greater Nicaragua and create more jobs for the local people.
To ensure the long-term effects of tree planting, HKND Group has also produced a training book on tree planting, distributed to all 150,000 middle school students in Rivaas province, aimed at providing long-term technical guidance to teachers and parents.

Tajikistan's Avesta News Agency cited a Central Bank report on 11 November that inflation in the seven months of the year in Tajikistan was 3.7%.
The report noted that the inflation rate in the seven months of the year in the Tower was 3.7%, of which the inflation rate in July was 0.6%, compared to 6% in almost a year.
The government's goal is to control annual inflation at 7.5% in 2016, while the country's inflation rate is 5.1% in 2015, the report said.
In addition, the report also noted that the government and some major international financial institutions have some predictions about economic development and inflation in the country in 2016.
According to the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development, the growth of the economy of the country will reach 7% in 2016, while the country's inflation is basically above this level.
The Asian Development Bank, World Bank and International Monetary Fund have all made different predictions about the economic development and inflation of the country in 2016.
For these two indicators, the Asian Development Bank forecasts are 4.2 and 7%, the World Bank forecasts are 4.8% and 7.5%, and the International Monetary Fund forecasts are 3.4 and 8.2% respectively.
Despite the negative external factors, such as the international economic downturn, the devaluation of the Russian ruble and the fall in the currency, the economy of the Tajik Republic grew by 6% in 2015.
On August 11, in a telephone interview with Huang Ilin, who had returned to Sichuan's Spongjong House, she said: "Oh, it was so urgent, and I had only one thought in my heart: to save people!"
Huang Ilin is a 2015 graduate of the South Central Linguist University School of Landscape Gardening.
Huang Ilin, who studied urban and rural planning, wanted to go to Sichuan Province to study local architecture design, so a family went on a tour.
On August 8, around 10 a.m., Huang Ilin's father was resting at the hotel, and his mother and daughter were preparing for the ancient city of Zhao.
As he was walking on the road, he saw a crowd of people who were shouting and going up in curiosity.
The little girl was in the water, her little head was exposed on the river, and she sometimes sank, and Yellow Irene, who learned to swim as a child, jumped to her rescue.
After the water, Yellow Irene, who is 165 cm tall, found that she could not step on it!
The water was calm before, but the bottom was a violent stream!
She was a little girl, but she was still going to the girls, regardless.
Huang Erin said that the river was running fast, less than five meters away, and she was almost exhausted.
She pushed the little girl to the riverbank, the slope was particularly slippery, and I was afraid I was too weak to sink.
So, when Hu Ilin cried out for help, and heard her daughter's cry, the poor water-loving lady prepared to come to the rescue, and was stopped by the visitors next door.
On August 10, after the story of Hu Ilin's jump to the river rescue spread, Ms. Liu received many comforting and praising from her relatives, and was also held accountable by many friends.
And when I think back, I am afraid; and when the children cry out to me, and they cannot stand on the banks of the river, my heart breaks.
Ms. Liu said with confidence that even if it was dangerous, she would still support her daughter's choice if she were to be in that situation again, and she was proud of her daughter!
Because of the pressure, Huang Ilin rarely took action after learning to swim again, and I had no idea that this skill was still in use.
According to Huang Iling's principal Chen Yi-Ying, Huang Iling is a recognized alumni of Banri and a happy assistant.

From September 1, seniors aged 60 to 64 can take buses in the city for half the price.
On the morning of the 11th, in the IC card sales center of the Jining City Bus Company, several elderly people were lined up in front of the card window, and 62-year-old Grandma received a half-price card.
Earlier, the Jining City Commission for the Aged, the Municipal Finance Office, the Municipal Transportation Office issued a notice of the half-price of urban buses for 60 to 64 year olds, which was officially implemented on September 1 this year.

According to the official website of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC said today that close cooperation is currently underway between the two securities regulators and the Deep Trade and Port Trade.
At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission has established a special working group on Shenzhen Port Seizures, which is actively promoting the preparations for Shenzhen Port Seizures, and will open the selection machines this year after the relevant regulatory rules and technical equipment are ready.
The number of fraudulent text messages is high, and even if they are not fraudulent, they can be found guilty of fraud.
The People's Court of the Guangdong District of Nanchang Province, Henan Province, has determined that from September 30 to October 4, 2015, the accused Li will Wang sent fraudulent information in the district of Tangber, Nanchang Province using fake base station equipment.
On October 5, the same year, at 10 am, the accused was again caught by the public security police while using a fake base station group to send a scam text message in a hotel room in the Guangdong district of Yangtze.
The assessment showed that the fake base station device sent 62228 text messages on October 4, 2015, causing 62228 cellphone users to be disconnected for more than 8 seconds to less than 10 minutes per person.
The court ruled that Li Xiawang had used the fake base station to send a total of 62228 fraudulent text messages to an unidentified majority, which constituted a fraudulent act.
The defendant's plea to imprisonment was that the defendant had attempted to commit an act without consequences, and the defendant's plea to guilty was better, and it was recommended that the defendant's views on the lesser penalty be taken into account.
The charges include the nature of the crime, the conviction, and other factors, and the punishment for fraud is four years and six months in prison and a fine of 10,000 yuan.
The Northeast Tiger is currently listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin, data from a joint monitoring of China, the United States and Russia in 1998 shows that there are only four to six wild northeastern tigers and three to five northeastern tigers in Jilin.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin, the protection of wildlife in Jilin province has been steadily increased in recent years, and the population of Northeast tigers and Northeast tigers in China is growing significantly, with a steady expansion of distribution areas.
The latest monitoring data from 2015 shows that 27 wild Northeast tigers and 42 Northeast tigers were observed in the province of Jilin alone.
As the world's flagship species of wildlife protection distributed in the border region of China and Russia, cooperation between the two countries is important for the recovery and reproduction of wild populations of Northeast tigers and crocodiles.
According to the Ministry of Forestry of the province of Jirin, the province of Jirin has established a long-term stable cooperation and exchange mechanism with Russia.
At the 2016 China Tiger Conservation International Forum, which ended on 11th, the forestry sector and animal protection organizations of China and Russia reached a number of consensus again.
The Forestry Department of Jilin Province said that strengthening cooperation between China and Russia for tiger and rhino protection is not only a very urgent task facing the Northeast China tiger and rhino protection, but also a pressing priority for maintaining the health of the Russian tiger and rhino population.
Sun Fu-Keng was a party leader, lost his ideals, and severely violated the party's discipline, and after the party's 18th, he was still not restrained, unharmed, unruly, and bad in nature.
The case, which was reported by various media outlets, became a focus of attention and had a very bad social impact.
After the incident, the police force of the Public Security Bureau of Haikou City was given high priority and immediately organized a team of skilled police to launch an active strike and investigations.
The police immediately executed the suspect's online manhunt, took several measures to contain him and searched the country by contacting the field police.
The suspect, who was a convicted burglar and was repeatedly beaten by the public security authorities, had strong counterintelligence capabilities, and was often interrogated for long periods of time, including drug abuse and drug addiction.
Greenland sloths, also known as the Little Sleeping Squirrel, are widely distributed in the North Atlantic Ocean around Greenland and Iceland, reaching a length of 4 to 5 metres as adults.
However, they grow extremely slowly, sometimes only about 1 cm a year, suggesting that Greenland frogs may have an exceptionally long life span.
Traditional methods of dating often use animal scaffolding, with some shark species using scaffolding, but this scaffolding is rare in Greenland shark.
A new study led by Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, uses the crystalline crystals of Greenland's cranberries to measure radioactive carbon.
This method has been used to determine the age of sharks in the past, but it is the first time that the age of sharks has been used to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis shows that the largest shark's life span is estimated at 392 years, with a misunderstanding of 120 years.
This means that the age of the shark is at least 272 years, with a maximum possible age of 512 years.
In addition, the female Greenland fox is said to reach sexual maturity at about 4 metres in length, which translates to at least 156 years of age.
The researchers therefore wrote in their paper that the Greenland spider is the longest known vertebrate on Earth, surpassing the previous longevity champion (211 years old).
The exchange rate has remained fundamentally stable over the past year, and has laid the foundation for the promotion of international exchange rate conversion.
In terms of market performance, the RMB has been fluctuating in two directions over the past year, with increased exchange rate resilience and overall expected balance.
The exchange rate has been changing since the yuan has been up and down over 100 points against the middle price of the dollar, but the process has been changing.
The last exchange rate action before the 8-11 yuan exchange rate last year was implemented in 2005, and the yuan has significantly appreciated against the dollar over the decade.
Since the new currency was introduced, the yuan has changed its previous upward value, with the average value of the yuan's exchange rate during the year devaluing by about 8%.
The International Monetary Fund will officially adopt the yuan as the SDR (Special Drawing Rights) weighted currency on October 1.
This week, the Chinese General Customs Office released statistics showing that China's total imports and exports amounted to 13.21 trillion yuan for the first seven months of this year, down 3% from the same period last year.
In July, China's total imports and exports decreased by just 0.9% compared to the same period, and in particular, exports increased by 2.9% compared to the same period.
The experts believe that while there are signs of stability in imports and exports in July, there should be no excess expectations.
In July, China's total imports and exports amounted to RMB2.09 trillion, down 0.9% compared to the previous year.
Exports of 122.2 trillion yuan, up 2.9%; imports of 87.3 billion yuan, down 57%; trade surplus of 34.28 billion yuan, expanding 34%; and the total amount of foreign currency in the country, which is about $1.4 trillion, increased by $1.9 trillion.
Despite the decline in total imports and exports, the export data showed growth, which is the fifth consecutive monthly increase in exports since March this year.
Shanghai police have been holding more than 3,400 people for four months against theft and robbery of 157 gangs
While investigating the case, the police also recovered over 33 million yuan in total from the pet pets.
According to the gang members, they entered Shanghai from outside by packing a black car, then dropped off the car, and after hours, they met up and left the house together.
In the process of prosecution, the suspect often used a single-story building to climb the walls and monopolise theft curtains, from top to bottom.
The suspect in the case was transferred to the Xuex District Prosecutor's Office to review the prosecution.
Police reminded the general public to lock their doors and windows when they go outside, and recommended that the public should choose steel with a harder material.
According to the Chinese Voice, Tonkin Jinping reported that in late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will visit Kenya to attend the Sixth Conference on African Development.
The Africa Development Conference, which is led by Japan, has been held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, and will therefore be the first to be held in sub-Saharan Africa.
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said that holding a meeting locally in Africa helped to raise awareness of Japan in Africa and Europe.
In support of Mr. Shinzo Abe's visit, the JPMorgan has sent delegations to the relevant countries.
Japan's entry into the conventional pipeline began in the early 1990s, and the African Development Conference launched by Japan also began in 1993, which is no coincidence!
With 53 seats in the UN, Africa is an important UN treasury, and Japan wants to get into the regular mess, how can it give up Africa?
The meeting will also discuss the role of the Islamic State in the fight against extremist groups and terrorist activities with relevant stakeholders from all countries.
The Western Cape Group of Nations will visit seven countries including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau and the United States.
Japanese Foreign Minister Shinoda Venkshi has also recently expressed his intention to attend the UN Security Council on the African Development Conference.
Abe announced that in order to stabilize sub-Saharan Africa, the country would provide assistance of 100 billion yen (about 61 billion yuan) over five years.
Observers generally believe that Japan's generosity towards Africa has always had two main purposes: to increase Japan's presence in Africa; and to seek the support of African countries on common issues.
Japan's expert on Japanese affairs, Zhengberg, analyzed that while Africa is relatively lagging behind in development, but with a relatively large number of countries, Japan has always viewed it as a so-called "big box".
Japan will not give up, and the work for Africa will not stop there, and will continue to be strengthened.
In economic terms, Japan's production capacity is relatively strong, but domestic markets are relatively limited, especially in the context of the current ageing of children, and domestic demand is relatively low.
However, from the first ten years of the war in Shiozun, to the next ten years of the war in Abe, Japan's many attempts to invade Japan have been largely ignored.
Japanese expert on Japanese issues, Zhengberg, believes that Japan's intention to enter the commonwealth is obvious, but the path to it must be difficult.
To achieve its goals, Japan must first establish good relations with its neighbours, where it needs to have the right attitude, whether in geopolitical disputes or in national disputes and in the question of historical knowledge.
The Haiku Maritime Court's early ruling ensures the rights of parties to the sinking of high-altitude fishing vessels
The family of the three crew members who died was on August 7 at 4 am in the Haikou Maritime Court to file a complaint against the former property protection for the seizure of the allegedly dangerous cargo vessel.
After 4 days, the alleged cargo vessel was seized by the Maritime Administration in Haifu-Shou, Hong Kong, assisting in the investigation.
Given that the 72-hour detention period expired at 9 a.m. on 7 August, the victim's family was entitled to file a claim for property protection with the court on 7 a.m.
At 4:20 a.m., the applicant filed a complaint about the property security, and the police on duty received the complaint patiently.
The conference was hosted by Professor Cao Xing, Permanent Vice-Chancellor of the School of Political and Public Administration at Shandong University.
What challenges do globalization and global economic integration pose to governance?
How does governance adapt to a changing world?
The first is the question of how to solve the problem of the problem of the whole world.
Dr. Vandechanshan, Ph.D. in Law from Peking University, is the Deputy Director and Secretary General of the Center for Global Governance Research at Peking University, and has served as Director of the Office of the American Cornell University in Beijing.
Currently, the focus of the study is on profound changes in global politics, economics, technology, culture, religion, and the opportunities and challenges these changes bring to national governance, leadership, and global governance.
Traditional customs introduced new highlights of the 2016 Hong Kong Vijapan Festival of Culture
The music of the drumming, the traditional snacks, the decoration of the flowers, the crowds of people.
The Hong Kong Tangier Festival of Culture, organized by the Hong Kong Tangier Society, is the largest Tangier Festival in Hong Kong, held from 12 to 14 July in Victoria Park.
In addition to continuing the existing single-player game, the family pool for the whole family can be added to the pool.
The site also features a 3D self-improvement area with a theme of the city, traditional dining areas and traditional crafts movement classrooms, which attract many children and overseas visitors to experience the history of the city.
A couple from France stayed at the event for almost three hours and experienced the flow of the mini-card classroom.
I was looking at this special festival online, so I decided to come and see it and feel fresh.
They said that while France has similar festivals to honor the ancestors, the atmosphere is heavy, unlike here, where there is music, food and you can learn traditional crafts.
She said that in Hong Kong, the busy financial capital, there are also large and organized rituals of ancestor worship.
The Chinese culture is not only diverse, but it also allows more people to learn and pass on these traditional arts.
The President of the event, Chi Chihyang-Teng said that we do not want to make the festival of culture in Myanmar so scary that people are afraid to approach it, especially young children.
We hope that through youth activities and arrangements, young people will know that the culture behind the festival is about showing kindness and gratitude.
He also said that this time, a total of 24 teams participated in the competition, which was not only organized by the community but also worked with some schools to get students to participate.
It is known that Hong Kong's Tangier Gang won't be left out of the National Register of Non-Property Cultural Heritage in 2011.
On the evening of 11th, the National Theatre of China, with its famous play, The White Snake, travelled thousands of miles to Mexico City, where it presented a dramatic banquet of original juice to the local population at the Palace of Fine Arts of the National Palace of Mexico.
As the main theme of the annual exchanges in Chinese culture, the National Theater of China will play seven dramas in Mexico City, Mexico City, and five cities including Cordoba, Varese, and others from August 9 to 23.
The audience was so happy to hear the actors' memories and to hear the actors' smiles and applause.
Marisa Himenis Cacho, who watched the show in Beijing 15 years ago, was accompanied by her daughter after the show.
I was impressed by the music, the lights, the stage performances, and I felt it was necessary to teach my daughter about Chinese culture and Chinese theater arts.
The enthusiasm of the Mexican audience impressed the young actress, who played the white daughter, Deli Carina.
I didn't think the Mexican audience was so enthusiastic, and I was a little worried about whether they would understand the story, but today I was surprised to see that they could capture the story and the many laughs.
Chinese Ambassador to Mexico, Liu Xiaobo, said that the cultural exchange activities of the Chinese Cultural Exchange Year this year have a positive role in promoting deeper understanding and friendship between the people of China and Mexico.
Next year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, and more cultural exchanges will be held in the two countries.
The two-city project is expected to raise the level of urban governance in Asia and beyond.
On the morning of the 12th, Mr. Liu gave his congratulatory address to the conference, where he heard reports on the progress of the pilot project and the recommendations of the relevant departments.
The President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Mr. M. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H.

Liu Jinwei stressed that the tri-region should seize historical development opportunities and play an important role in the development of the twin cities and the development of the twin cities as a pilot project.
To play a leading role in raising the international level of tourism islands, starting with the details, enriching the international elements, creating international delicacies.
To play a leading role in urban and rural integration and tourism throughout the region, to accelerate the construction of characteristic towns, to integrate tourism elements into each project, and to build every rural town and town in the Tri-Alaya into a tourist attraction.
To play a leading role in the 100 Days of Action in the field of investments in social services, to promote a number of major projects and the construction of parks, to ensure the placement of high-quality projects and to implement the requirements of the major actions.
The provincial commission's Standing Committee, the Shia Municipal Commission Secretary Zhang Yi, the Deputy Premier Wang Lu, and the provincial government's Secretary-General Lu Long took part in the research conference.
In her 14-year career, Liu won 18 world titles, becoming the first person in Chinese Olympic history to win four Olympic gold medals.
She is the longest-serving female athlete in the history of table tennis, having held the world ranking for eight consecutive years.
On 26 September 2010, he became Deputy Secretary General of the People's Daily and General Manager of the People's Search Network Shares Company, a senior executive in the department.
She will be joining forces with Kim Jong-un to create the country's first platform for sport industry innovation.
There is also a group of star coaches on the Chinese gymnasium: they have won countless national honours in the era of athletes, and after retiring, they have passed on their years of learning to later ones, cultivating the middleweight championship.
As the first Chinese men's world champion in gymnastics, Huang Yu chose to take up teaching after retiring.
From coach of the women's team to coach of the men's team, and then to head coach, Huang Yue made a team of Olympic gold medallists, leading the team to a legendary 9 gold, 1 silver and 4 bronze at the Beijing Olympics.
Since then, Tan has been a regular advocacy figure, and in recent years has played important roles in the likes of Taurus, Thunderbird and the others.
Many NBA players have proven their strengths, but some progress and some decline.
The team's performance has been declining every season, either due to age or limited playing time.
Of course, some of the stepping back steps may be just a shrinking of data, and the strength of these players may not have decreased.
Even though Wade is still one of the best point guards in the league, his performance with the Bulls shouldn't have been as hot.
He is limited in the backfield with the Rondo team, and the star Butler's three-point shooting percentage is only 32.8%, which makes their offense crowded next season.
When he arrived in Windsor, the Lightning would have given more of the ball to Butler and Londo, who would have been more likely to make a living in the regular season.
Okafor's situation was embarrassing, as the 76ers first pick last season forced him to compete with Simmons and Enfield for time and ball rights in the new season.
The competition may not come soon, Simmons needs to adapt to the NBA playoffs, and Enfield needs to recover fully from his injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafor can make it to the 76ers is a question.
Last season, Okafor scored 32% of his points from low-level offense, which was higher than Cousins, Vucic and Brooke Lopez, while his utilization rate was also higher in the league's top 40.
With Simmons already showing great control of the ball and Enfield having a better-looking character to play in the NBA, it is hard to believe that O'Keefe's position will be so firm again.
Over the past two seasons, Thompson's utilization rate has stabilized in the league's top 20, which is also the best two seasons of his career.
The problem is that Thompson's use rate will decline with Durant's arrival, which will affect his performance.
This will not only affect the number of starts, but also the number of offense in the next season, which in some respects will reduce the difficulty of the opponent defending against him.
The arrival of Durant will certainly shrink the numbers of the Warriors, but the biggest shrinkage is probably Thompson.
But that doesn't mean that the level of the team is retreating, it's more like he's sacrificed for the team as a whole.
Parker performed better than the data showed last season, not only because his basketball efficiency reached a career high, but because of his chemistry with Aldrich, which benefited the Spurs.
When Duncan retired, Genobilie declared another year of war, and the GDP portfolio finally came to an end, as the youngest of the three, the tank of a French sports car was running out of oil.
After winning his third world title ring, only Jabal, Jordan and Russellby James won more regular season MVPs, while Jordan was the only FMVP to beat James Stowe.
Oh, right, James just brought Cleveland its first professional sports championship in 52 years.
James, who is entering his 14th season as a professional, needs better physical fitness to prepare for the playoffs.
So in the regular season, James's numbers are likely to drop further, and he will put more of the burden on Owen, but he will still easily be the top three player in the league.
The Russian government has also been trying to develop the skills it has learned from its own country.
On 12th local time, President of the Moscow-based Chinese Association Huang Shih spoke in a stirred tone when he saw Chinese news reporters.
Recently, she attended a Chinese talent training course (literature, painting) at the Overseas Chinese Cultural Association of China, organized by the Chinese State Council's Office of Foreign Affairs, and held by the University of Nanjing.
When I first started taking classes, I had no idea where to start with bookmaking, and after the training I was able to draw and write my own work.
Once back in Moscow, he must use the knowledge and skills he has learned to contribute to the spread and promotion of Chinese culture.
The Secretary-General of the Russian Chinese Cultural Promotion Association, Nan Yengwei, who also attended the training, felt the same way.
She said she had made great progress with the help of her classroom teachers and felt the responsibility of being a Chinese cultural overseas communicator.
Yanwei said that after returning to Russia, he was determined to spread and spread Chinese traditional culture among Chinese and Chinese culture-loving Russians.
At 19:35 today, in a game leading the way in the 22nd round of the Super League, Chongqing Liang Stadium challenges Beijing's national security.
In the 29th minute, Wang Yi-gun hit the goal, in the 39th minute, the newly-elected Kaldek scored the first goal in the middle with Fernando's assist, in the 81st minute, the national security returned a goal.

After a couple of rounds of the Fernando right-hand drive, Caldecott was knocked out by the Thunder Dragon flying action while the forward plugged the receiver, the referee decided the goal and showed the Yellow Card to the Thunder Dragon.
The National Guard made a change of command at the 37th minute, with Zhang Xiaoping out of the game and Zhang Lingming in the game against the former Goh.
In the lower-level pass to the left of Fernandez, Kardec kicked the goal before the restricted zone.
This was also the first time that Kaldek had scored a goal in a Super Mid-Autumn event, leading 2-0 against Savannah.
In the second half, just before the start of the game, Fernando won the right-handed arbitrary ball with a strong break, unfortunately from a small angle.
After the delay was decided, the substitute, Khan Hing-li, also won the yellow card for his previous violations of the restricted zone.
In the 56th minute, Zhang Zhengming was in the left lane of the intersection with Zhang Darin-Zhe, whose arc ball attack was blown out by a small flying shot.
The former assassin of the Temple Square attacked Cremitz, who won the yellow card with his emotionally excited Prince.
In the 63rd minute, Fernando was hit by a car while running right, and was very unhappy with the move.
A minute later, Fernando once again demonstrated his ability to run on the right, and he also won a yellow medal in the Grand Prix.
The referee decided to kick the ball, the referee pulled the knife through the door, the power sail 2:1.
In the 86th minute, Sergeyev, who was on the right side of the road, shot the ball in the back of the chest in the restricted zone, and then came back to save the ball with a good kick.
After 4 minutes, the team kept the score 2-1 to the finish, defeating Guan.
After taking this valuable 3 points, the current strength of the sail reached 27 points, temporarily ranking 10th in the points list.
Lyman will be an expert in the Deca Asia media partnership and will participate in various local fan events.

The Bundesliga, known as one of the five European leagues (the Premier League, the Serie A, the Serie A, the Default, the FAA), is the flagship competition of the German football league.
As one of the strongest leagues in the world, the 2014-2015 season alone drew around 13.3 million spectators to the stadium to watch the match.
The company is known in China for its luxury brands such as Bayern Munich, Dortmund and famous stars such as Thomas Mueller, Ram, Guterres.
In conjunction with the already online Weibo, YouTube and Weibo Chinese platforms, the team hopes to provide a broader and more timely channel for Chinese fans to get the latest news about the league.
England won silver in the men's sevens and Fiji won gold
In the final of the seven-man rugby union match on Thursday night, the British team failed to do well before continuing their performance against Fiji, beating Fiji 43-7 at the Riotodoro Stadium.
Fiji won the gold medal for their unstoppable performance in control, stealing, dodging, support, running and strength, the first Olympic medal ever for the country.
The silver medal was also a great consolation for the defeated British team, who were the third British team to win the medal on the day. This was enough to make the British rugby team proud: they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa in their first ever Olympic seven-man rugby match.
Earlier in the day, the British team defeated South Africa 7-5 to potentially affect their position in the final.
However, the Fijians are now enough to beat a team of 15 people who are full of spirit.
Tomorrow, at least one Englishman will wear a gold medal, which may be a comfort to the English team, but it may not be. This Englishman is Ben Ryan, the head coach of the Fiji team from Wimbledon, who was the head coach of the English team.
The British team is not going to be able to achieve the results they have achieved today.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's coaching, they were undefeated in the Adelaide International Seven-man Rugby Championship.
And now they are just one step away from the championship.
The first is the "Spanish" movement, which has been undergoing a massive crackdown but has also made remarkable progress.
The Fiji Open took the lead, leaving the British team without any fighting power.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like hitting a series of buses in the driveway. When Ossi Corniso stormed into the Horned Frogs, the World Series champions had a 5-0 lead.
After just four minutes, Jerry Touy scored again with a right-handed touchdown.
The British team scored 12-0 and scored almost no goals.
Mitchell's strong blockade of the Giants allowed general manager Leon Nakarawa to miss the third time, but this only slowed Fiji's score.
At the 7th minute, Asa Vellamaru touched the right corner - 17 to 0, with the British team snowing.
The first half of the game... with one minute left.
The team then beat the British team to the goal line.
The score was 29-0 at half-time.
The Fijians are like they were born to play seven-man rugby, while the British team is still the first to play.
This is the case.
The British team made a huge change in the second half and shook the Fijians' defensive line for the entire quarter, which was good for the first half. But afterwards the Fijians played a great match, scored again by Joshua Tuesova.
Dan Norton created a scoring opportunity for England, turning the score 36-7 on his left, but the game was already under the control of the South Sea island nation, with their fans singing loudly, waving flags, carrying caroling dances on the platform.
The team's excellent performance was applauded.
The last minute, Mata William stopped a minor attack by Fiji.
The final whistle was sounded, the Fijians embraced each other, and the defeated British team could only regret retiring.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-final, while England beat South Africa in a fierce semi-final match.
In the first half, Kyle Brown helped South Africa to the lead, but Dan Norton scored in the second half with a great foot-breaking goal.
Afterwards, Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, with a brilliant interception, secured the team's victory, eventually leading the British team to the silver medal.
Helen Grauman and Heather Stanning, encouraged by their cancer-stricken coach, win the gold medal in the yacht race
The first is the "Golden Medal" awarded to the best player in the world.
From the first time they rowed to the present day, Helen Grauman and Heather Stanning have been trained in 220 punitive pulling events, and their win at the Estacio da Lagoa has been of even greater significance.
Although only the two of them rowed, the voice of the rowing coach Robin Williams, who was also on board, accompanied them to their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in women's doubles, the first British pair to achieve this height.
They have a record of 39 wins and an absolute advantage.
What we see is that these two talented athletes are doing well on the water, but that's not all of the victory.
There are many volunteers behind every gold medal, and it is their continuous dedication that makes the difference, and the biggest help is the one who learned about cancer 30 months ago and didn't know if he would see it alive.
As he said, death could come at any time.
I had bladder cancer and they had surgery on me.
If the cancer cells are not surgically removed, they will spread throughout the body.
This would make things much worse.
It will change your mind a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he started treatment in early 2014 and the effects will be minimal, although that may not be appropriate in this case.
I need to get paid, so I have to get better quickly.
I'm not sure what I'm doing.
I live in a hospital, and although they say walking is enough, I walk 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet around the hospital every time.
This is the beginning of everything.
The race itself is a journey, which makes it a little longer.
The moment they took the gold, they thought of Williams first - a bit more than usual this morning - to overcome his anxiety.
After Stanning, who was the captain of the Royal Artillery, travelled to Afghanistan, she said: "I'm in a bad mood this week, maybe a little extreme, but the meaning of this gold medal is extraordinary".
It repeatedly tells me how important this is to me, and how much effort Helen and Robin have put in.
This is the return of three years of hard work that Helen, Robin and I have been working towards.
Without Robin, we would be just a little underrated, and we are very grateful to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I can't find a better coach and coach than him.
Helen Grauman and Heather Stanning have not lost in five years.
The combination of the penalties set by the two teams is unmatched by their opponents.
Even as the final 500 metres approached, New Zealand and Denmark had a large body of energy.
I was so shocked.
Helen cries out: "Keep the pace, keep the pace".
It is important to not be influenced by your opponent.
We had a good start, and we didn't expect anything surprising.
We didn't want to think about the glory of today, we just wanted to make every move and win this race, and we did it.
The couple spent a year deciding their future.
Graeme is getting married next month to TV explorer Steve Baxter.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I don't want to say this is my last match.
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
I was so nervous about this experience that it was completely new.
It's been about four minutes.
She said, "Oh, I feel better".

Bulgaria's first inflation in eight months
National statistics show that the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria in July was 1%.
This is the highest inflation rate in years since June 2012 - the first time inflation has broken zero since last October (inflation rate 0.2%).
Compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015), the average annual inflation rate (measured by the Consumer Price Index) for the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, which is a monthly inflation rate of 1.0%.
The inflation rate for the year to date (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% compared to July 2015 and July 2016 at -0.2% per annum.
Compared to the previous month, the following categories of consumer goods increased in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transportation (1.8%); entertainment and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, home appliances and regular maintenance (0.5%) and health care (0.1%).
The price of alcohol and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, natural gas and other fuels, communications and education remained flat compared to last month.
Snapchat's animated anime effects are being accused of ironically taunting Asians
Snapchat says the film was inspired by anime, but some observers believe it is racially colored.
Snapchat's 150 million daily users can change reality and make people funny through its filtering tools.
You can turn yourself into a mouse, a dog, or a character in a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
These lenses have curved and curved features, producing over 30 million modified self-images per day.
Any mistake will be immediately noticed by the public.
Snapchat Lenses has been criticized for being a black-and-white-skinned app.
So when the app offered a filter that could create eyelashes, twists and turns of the face to some users this week, some critics called it a racial satire on Asian yellow-legged human beings.
They even question whether these recurring issues mean that the company has a greater problem with diversity.
The Verge and Motherboard reported on Wednesday that Snapchat had removed the feature, sparking outrage.
The company explained that the film was a tribute to the characters in the anime, not a satirical Asian.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of a damaging stereotype in reality.
The film was released in the United States on December 20, 2012, and was directed by John F. Kennedy.
One of the students of the Korean-American artists who tweeted about the photos and shared them widely said in an email that the lenses were at least unpleasant and uncomfortable.
She also said that it is difficult for Liu to distinguish between the extreme disgust of the Asian irony and the effect of the filter.
The film is about the life of a young man who is a victim of the Holocaust.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches on these cultural underpinnings.
From the board of directors to Hollywood and the equipment we carry, American culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusion.
Snapchat's large youth population may be more sensitive to racial diversity than the older generation.
When a Snapchat filter created an image of insulting users, 25-year-old Zuccetti (translated) said in an interview on Thursday: "These things are harder to get out of the public eye than before".
On Thursday, Ms. Ju, a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article she wrote for Medium and a telephone interview, she said she felt that the racial controversy reflected Snapchat's lack of racial diversity in hiring.
Ms. Ju criticized the company's employees as mostly white, the leadership as all male, and added a tag at the end of the article: #DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese-American, Ms. Zhu said: "Either their employees are not of any race, so they can make such a decision, or they have some race among their employees, but their positions do not allow them to say what they want".
Other observers shared complaints that she had not been responded to on Snapchat.
The company did not release data on employee diversity and said it was a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its employees on Thursday, but a spokesperson said the company recently hired a recruiter who focused on low-income internals and promoting internal inclusion.
Ms. Ju said she will close her Snapchat account: "I wonder if they need more users like us who are against this behavior".
The congressional team says military officials have distorted ISIS intelligence
A congressional panel released a report on Thursday that officials at U.S. Central Command changed their intelligence report to portray the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than it actually is.
The midterm report comes from a special task force composed of the chairman of the Republican National Committee on the House Military Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the House Appropriations Committee. The report reports widespread discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who say their superiors are distorting their assessment of the U.S.-IS war.
Centcom, located in Tampa, Florida, is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to a news release about the report, intelligence reviewed by senior Central Command leaders has been more optimistic about the U.S. counterterrorism response than the facts and has always been more optimistic than other intelligence agencies' analysis.
The California Republican representative said that the behavior of the Central Command was unacceptable. On the one hand, our soldiers suffered from war, and on the other hand, senior policymakers received the wrong analysis.
The issue of leadership of the Central Command has been extended to the highest levels of the institution.
The report details the longstanding problems facing Central Command in describing and analyzing U.S. training of Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the changes, the analysts felt that they were under pressure from the leaders of the Central Command, which forced them to make more optimistic comments about the threat posed by Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL), according to the report's description.
The report said that in the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and congressional testimony from the Central Command were more optimistic than in reality.
For example, an official at Central Command publicly stated that a major military operation to retake Mosul could be launched as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under Islamic State control.
Republican Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas said in a statement that the results were clear after months of investigation.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most of the top intelligence officials at the US Central Command manipulated the command's intelligence products to conceal the threat posed by Islamic State of Iraq.
The Republican Party formed a special task force after analysts learned that intelligence on Islamic State had been manipulated.
As the investigation continues, more findings will follow the report released on Thursday.
The Ministry of Defence's Attorney General also conducted a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their findings on Thursday, in agreement with some of the findings of the Republican Special Working Group.
The Democratic leader of the committee, representing She'anda, said in a statement that the Central Command developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessment of the Islamic State and Iraqi peace forces between 2014 and 2015.
Mr. Sheaanda said the process of the shutdown prevented the release of intelligence, lowered the morale of analysts and prevented the shutdown from accepting different opinions.
But Mr. Sheaanda and the Democrats also said they had not found any evidence to show that the palace was trying to pressure the Central Command analysts, so their conclusions were consistent with the conjecture or political narrative.
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of the Congressional investigation.
In August, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon's attorney general had begun investigating the complaints after receiving complaints from the Central Command division.
Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Department of Defense had not commented on the Congressional report until the Attorney General's investigation was completed.
But he said that while the intelligence community and the Defense Department are encouraged to have healthy dialogue on these important national security issues, the experts sometimes have differences in interpretation of complex data.
The impact of this investigation has far surpassed the question of whether the US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria have been successful (according to increasing numbers of Defense Department officials).
But last year, these claims raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can trust the Central Command's assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of ISIL intelligence is reminiscent of the controversy over a decade ago, when Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Hook wrote a study article that noted that despite opposition from numerous analysts, the George W. Bush administration insisted on sending small-scale troops to Iraq and little consideration for the situation after the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hook played a key role in this campaign against the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr. Hook's team concluded that the airstrikes on the ISIL refinery did not significantly reduce the terrorist group's financial revenues as the group built temporary refineries to continue selling oil on the black market, contrary to the statement made publicly.
According to the September report in the weekly manga magazine, the Central Command did not publish the findings to the public.
When several lawyers reviewed Senate testimony about over-optimistic assessments of the war, Central Command Command Commander Lloyd Austin III was criticized last year.
General Austin retired in April and is currently replaced by Joseph Water as head of the Central Command.
The United States won four straight games in women's hockey and will face England in the final
Katie Bamm, a three-time All-American in a 6-1 win over Japan, led the U.S. women's hockey team to a second-place finish on Thursday, helping the U.S. team beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games, four of which were impressive, but the 27-year-old said she didn't know she had such a great performance.
She said: "Oh, I don't know anything about this.
I'm not the kind of person who remembers having hit a few balls.
She knows that the U.S. has won four straight Olympic Games and will be competing for first place in the group with the British team, who have not lost since defeating Japan 2-0 in the group on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States faced each other in the final match of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams will play in the quarter-finals of the group stage, which will determine who will appear as group one.
The team that wins the group one will avoid meeting the strong Dutch team and thus go further. The Dutch team will be the first team to come out of the group.
In Saturday's game, the U.S. team performed a marvel. At the London Olympics four years ago, the U.S. team finished last out of 12 teams.
The team was also named after Pam.
Pam grew up in Bruebell, Pennsylvania, picked up her first hockey stick at age 3 (her twin sister was a hockey player at Drexel) and joined the national team at age 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team to date.
She missed the 2008 Olympics due to failing to make the final list.
In 2012, she and her teammates were not treated well.
The following year, Englishman Craig Panham took over as head coach, and everything began to change.
BAM: Oh, it's a cultural, mental and material change.
We were not at the level we are at today in London.
We have made a complete change.
On Thursday night, Bam took the lead with a close-up shot from the opposing goal in the first half.
India have not yet won the tournament, but the team has shown amazing stamina and maintained their 1-0 record until the end of the third period, when the boom came.
She ran the ball along the left side of the field, then cut the inside into the middle, and pulled the net, leading the American team 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The United States opened the scoring against goalkeeper Jackie Bridges for the first time in the competition, scoring a goal in each of the first three wins.
She's a superhero this time.
And so is Bam.
Panam said: "We are in a very good position now, but how good we are will depend on the outcome of Saturday's match".
The cold acidic food in the Great Depression in the food pantry
In March 1933, President-elect Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sitting in the presidential office for lunch.
As a culinary person, President Roosevelt enjoyed Fifth Avenue cuisine, such as chili peppers and Maryland salmon.
His menu was simple that day: tomato-flavored devil's eggs, potato mud and fruit pudding as a snack.
Jane Zigman says: "It's about sharing pain with people who are suffering from food.
Her husband, Andrew Co., added: "The food is also a reflection of the American way of eating.
The couple, who live in the Brooklyn Heights, are both food historians.
Mr. Koh's previous book, The Culinary Dishes, was about American Chinese food, while Ms. Ziegman, in her book, The Fruit Garden Dishes, told the stories of the lives of poor neighborhood tenants through food.
Their new book, The Great Food Bounty, will be published Tuesday by Harper's, which will explore the history of food in the United States during the Great Depression.
After showing some common food insights, they met a reporter at a sandwich shop in Eisenberg. This simple lunch counter in the Boulder area has been in business since the 1929 economic boom.
Ms. Zigman, 54, made a cream cheese with a slice of olive sandwiched bread, while Mr. Ko, 57, made turkey, potato mud and vegetable dishes.
The reporter pointed to a chicken roll that the couple thought was a good way to discuss the diet during the Great Depression.
Ms. Zigman said: "The bread was very popular at the time.
The first time I saw the world was in the middle of the night, and I was in the middle of the night.
They are made from a raw material and a cheap cap that can be coated on the raw material.
Imagine that your dinner is all peanuts.
Mr. Ko is acting strange.
He said, "Squeezing them in your stomach is like eating them in your stomach".
In the years before the Great Depression, Denton was a fast-food restaurant in the United States, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cooked food for the male farm workers, and they made cakes for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During World War I, it was the Americans who delivered food to hungry Europeans. The rich food chain documented how the country suddenly ceased to be a prosperous country.
Mr. Koh explained why he and his wife were writing the book: "At the time, food was the main topic of American unhappiness".
Another unpleasant topic is the new foods with cold acids: the delicious foods like bread and rice are the main dishes, and rice is the best way to cook leftovers, Ms. Siegman said, because chefs can use the cream in the food to mask the difficulty of eating.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap cranberries.
The meat that has been the main part of American food for years has become a rare luxury.
The strange thing is that the big snails only consider calories, rather than taste, and even basic nutrition.
During the course of her research into the book, including various recipes, Ms. Ziegman made a roasted onion filled with peanut oil.
Mr. Ko said: "It's not common for this to be on the dinner table.
Ms. Ziegman said: "Oh, that's very strange, too, Mom.
The first is that the tomato oil and the onion are not exactly the same.
This is a feature of many family-friendly meals.
Family economists have influenced the country's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as the head of the Federal Home Economics Bureau from 1923 to 1943, and this is unprecedented in history.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to be careful about cooking and courageously turning bad foods like cream pasta and carrots into delicacies.
The rich cuisine is a rich history of cuisine.
It is particularly interesting to see how the government responds to the starving population, and I cannot handle the outrage of President Herbert Hoover, for example.
Although he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse he had as a child, his diet was as refined as that of a millionaire.
Mr. Ko said that his mother likes to eat European Western food, such as fish with cucumber.
He was wearing a nightgown and eating in a restaurant with a gold plating.
He is clearly separated from the people.
If it hadn't been for his wife, Eleanor, who encouraged him to set an example in his diet, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
As the book says, the waiters employed by Mrs. Roosevelt were not interested in taste, so the cooked food at the White House was not only the hardest food in Washington, but also the worst cooked food.
When the United States returned to normal, many of the ways of cooking during the Great Depression were abandoned.
Ms. Ziegman said that what remains is our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to the diet.
The couple said that as they wrote the book, they learned more about Ms. Ziegman's mother's dietary habits, such as how she didn't throw away food.
Mr. Ko said: "Mom, she is very afraid of wasting food.
Ms. Ziegman recalled: "She actually caused many people to get sick.
The first is the case of the cream bubble.
After removing the plate, she and Mr. Ko took out a dessert they had prepared at home: this is the fruit pudding President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
Ms. Ziegman said: "The dish is called cream and fruit sauce and adds that a new trend in the name of a common dish is the usual trick of making sauces".
The dessert is made with no cream, only fruit juices, a little flour, sugar, water and meatballs.
The people are trying hard to make it into the deep, sticky brown paste.
Unsurprisingly, the dessert tastes good.
Mr. Ko ate the second spoon, the third spoon.
He thought it was an acceptable dessert and told his wife that a piece of crushed walnut would be better eaten.
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to rise in July, with Saudi production hitting new highs.
The report does not prevent the market from doubting OPEC's credibility, and the road to recovery is still paved with thorns.
On Monday, OPEC President and Qatar's Energy Minister Sadat said that OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
OPEC's monthly report released Wednesday showed that production of the entire OPEC organization, including the potato, rose to 36,110,000 barrels per day in July.
OPEC also said in its monthly newspaper that low crude oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil products, adding to the market surplus.
The news, coupled with the US's upward expectations of crude oil production and the unexpected increase in crude oil reserves, has caused international oil prices to fall for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday's close, the New York Commodity Exchange's September deliveries of light crude oil futures were down 2.48 percent and the October deliveries of London Brent crude oil futures were down 2.07 percent.
Reuters believes that the proposed oil congress is unlikely to significantly tighten supply and that the data released by the US Energy Information Administration is also undermining market popularity.
Iran's official news agency Fars quoted Iranian Oil Minister Zaganin as saying on Wednesday that Iran's production of crude oil reached a peak of 3.85 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
As soon as the meeting was announced, Russian Energy Minister Novak said that there was no need for a new round of talks on the production of lithium at current oil prices.
The last oil-producing countries' meeting was held in April and OPEC members failed to reach an agreement on any measures.
Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMIResearch, said that the market and media may be overreacting to OPEC's meeting.
Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at the Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC is changing market sentiment by releasing signals that they will promote the agreement.
This is like the smoke and mirrors that open the eyes of people (which deliberately give the wrong impression).
Eugen Weinberg, head of commodity research at the German Commercial Bank, said that OPEC was unlikely to try to stabilize the market through its September meeting.
This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, which has been a victim of a wildfire.
The focus of the exams is on the illegal publication of medical advertisements, the concentration of complaints and the fact that medical institutions have been punished multiple times.
The National Health and Medical Examination Commission, the National Medical Administration of China, will in due course conduct inspections of the special surveillance inspections carried out in some provinces.
According to media reports, the current problem of product homogenization is caused by the massive influx of capital into Internet medicine, which has led to a decline in investment and the capital enters the period of observation.
According to data from the Centre for Management Research at the Elipe Hospital in Hong Kong, internet healthcare companies have suffered a large number of deaths in the first year of their existence, and about 20% of the start-up internet healthcare companies have ceased to exist.
However, while most Internet healthcare companies struggle to find funding in Round A or Round B, some of the leading companies in the segment still have the opportunity to gain capital.
It seems that Internet healthcare startups are not going to be able to keep up with the demands of the market, but rather focus on the needs of the market, focus on the specifics and the deepest.
Fish jumped $12 million, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, and Kyushu General Mechanical Company invested $180.0 million, accounting for 60% of the registered capital.
In recent years, with the support of national policies on medical information, the electronic and integrated supply chain management systems have gradually entered hospitals at all levels.
The partnership with Kyushu General is targeting market demand to help hospitals build advanced supply chain management systems and to seek further cooperation as an opportunity.
Unlike many internet healthcare companies, iBaby has been focused on the vertical area of internet childbirth from the beginning, with both mothers and doctors deeply involved.
Pregnant women are not only able to consult a doctor for free 24 hours and one-on-one, but also pay for direct medical consultations.
On the doctor's side, iBaby breaks the geographic limit by taking organizational experts to give doctors at the grassroots level in the form of online lectures, peer-to-peer exchanges, case discussions, and more.
The three panels are currently being opened by doctors, namely for doctors to continue their education, doctors to socialize and doctors to seek help.
Provide services including online learning, case-discussion, academic exchange; social platforms with hospital and classroom doctors; legal assistance for patient relationships or personal life; and entrepreneurial support.
According to media reports, CEO Wang Yi recently said Ali Sanyoung was willing to take his heart to get big data on health.
Internet companies, data companies lack professionalism and are not unified in the way they write the same words.
Ali currently has three departments in the field of medical health: Ali Health, the Panther Medical Center and Paypal Future Hospital.
Wang said that healthcare startups are harder than other industries, and it's not just about how much money you have, but also about being calm and tolerant of loneliness.
Watching the Olympics at night is easy to hurt
The Brazilian Olympics are being held in a blaze of glory, and even if the games are broadcast at midnight in the country, many citizens watch them at night.
In this regard, doctors warned that watching the event at night is a health risk that could lead to cardiovascular disease.
If the hormone is released overnight, it is still highly secreted, and the body is continuously in a state of stress and excitement, unable to recover normally, and is prone to causing blood clots and high blood pressure, which can lead to cardiovascular disease.
The group of people with high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood fat, smoking habits, family history of cardiovascular disease, and other risk factors, especially if they stay up late, are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease.
If you stay up late, not only are cardiovascular functions affected, but also gastrointestinal function, immune system, and neurological system, and even the risk of developing tumors increases.
For his old friends, Han Ji Ji advised that they do their best not to spend the night watching the Olympics, especially those with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last World Cup of Hung Kong, Han Ji-hwan had a patient in his 60s who had a heart attack or watched a game at night.
Han Ji-yeon said that since this year, his clinic has been diagnosing some patients with heart attack or stroke around the age of 25, which is largely due to the long-term lifestyle of the patients.
1. Do not spend the night watching your favorite sports program every day, and occasionally watch your favorite sports program at night, and other programs may wait until the next day to watch the event.
2. Supplementing with water at night, eating more fruit, preventing blood clots and boosting the body's immune system.
Beijing Time 12 August 2016 News: In the women's 50 metre rifle three-point contest at the 2016 Rio Olympics, Chinese senior Duri won the bronze medal.

The film is expected to premiere on CTV and VHN in early next year, and will also be released in a full-screen VR documentary for the first time.
The documentary, The Polar Tombs, is a large-scale work focusing on the Tibetan Plateau at the Third Pole of the Earth, telling the story of Tibetan tradition and modern interplay and interaction with the world from a whole new perspective.
The biggest advantage of VR is that it provides a unique visual experience that makes the process more demanding.
The filming team for the special edition of the Panorama VR in Polaris said they wanted to make sure that every aspect of the film was unprovoked and that the audience felt like they were there.
On August 11, the main Shandong Station of the Armed Forces, organized by the Special Operations Sniper, arrived at Mount Kunming to train in the jungle at a high temperature of 34 degrees Celsius.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union sent missiles to Cuba, almost leading to a nuclear war.
The incident was seen as the culmination of the Cold War, and history calls the Cuban Missile Crisis a catalyst.
But it is little known that a severe solar storm that was also a threat during the Cold War led to the United States launching a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, which was not first reported by researchers outside until August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a powerful solar storm severely interfered with radar and radio communications for the U.S. military in the Arctic.
The radar was part of the US ballistic missile warning system used to monitor Soviet missiles.
The paper, completed by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed US military personnel who were involved in forecasting and analyzing solar activity at the time, and consulted non-classified literature.
The paper notes that in the 1960s, the US Air Force always had a portion of the warplanes carrying nuclear warheads flying in the sky to prevent the Soviet Union from starting a nuclear war.
The US military commander did not know that the culprit in the interference was the solar storm and not the Soviet Union, so he ordered the fighter to be brought into combat readiness.
Fortunately, the US military's research into solar activity and electromagnetic interference with Earth, which began in the late 1950s, ultimately prevented this potential military conflict.
He later compiled information from the US Air Force Air Weather Service and submitted a detailed report.
The direct consequence of the solar storm was that the US military has since considered space weather an operational concern and has established a stronger space weather forecasting system.
Citizens on daily journeys find their car being blocked by a strange vehicle, and can use the WeChat to solve this problem without contacting the driver.
On August 11, the Xi'an Police WeChat Service, called Xi'an Police, launched the service of wireless carrier.
With the launch of the service, citizens can solve such problems in their daily lives by using the WeChat navigation function when they encounter a strange vehicle that blocks their vehicle when the driver is not there.
The new service features are quick and administrative cost-saving; respect for citizens' privacy; and full-time, full-time service.
As long as citizens have WeChat, it is very convenient to operate on their own, which allows both parties to move vehicles to meet in a friendly and easy way, alleviate parking problems and reduce the number of traffic safety cases.
On the other hand, for the refusal to move the vehicle, the illegal parking or obstructing the passing of the car, the Sichuan transport authority said that the police will take different handling measures depending on the actual situation.
On August 9, in the Cultural Tourism District of the city of Phong Phong, Dung Kong, more than 10 youth workers from the Commerce Power Company came to the city to hold the festival-themed event "Seventh Night of the Powerful Power of the City of Phong Phong".
The company, which supplies electricity to the city of Shenzhou, is working to build a spiritual civilization and actively organizes the festival and the 7th of July thematic activities in the city of Shenzhou.
The company employees who participated in the event said that they spent their time working and studying, lacking time and platforms to communicate with colleagues and friends.
I love that this company provides us with a platform that is easy, happy and harmonious, meaningful and not uninteresting.
The event was widely praised by youth workers in the area, who hoped the company would host more events like this in the future, to strengthen communication and exchange with more young people.
The highly-regarded Beijing Olympic men's singles champion, Spanish giant Nadal, won the men's singles title in two straight sets and advanced to the final.
As the gold medalist, Nadal, who was unable to recover from his injuries, was the only one to win the Olympic medal.
He and his teammates Lopez will compete for the gold medal in the men's doubles final with Romanian players Tekau and Megia.
The Rio Olympics women's singles event saw several seed players withdraw from the competition, and after days of intense competition, the women's singles were all born on the 11th.
Kovitova will compete for a final entry ticket with Pujeg, while another final seat will be won between Keys and Kobel.
The women's doubles were also made up of four teams, with Singer/Bashinsky facing Hradka/Heravakova; Makalova/Vishnina facing Strikova/Saffalova.
The mixed doubles event on the same day also decided on the eighth round, but the first-seeded Mahú/Gácia combination and the withdrawal from the NATO combination made the mixed doubles match somewhat colorless.
On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly published a new edition of the Japan-US Defence Cooperation Index in New York, allowing the Japanese armed forces to play a more aggressive role globally.
This was the day that US Secretary of Defense Carter, US Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Kishi Tanaka and Japanese Defense Minister Shengyuan attended a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth time that the Chinese People's Republic has published the Japanese Military Force Assessment Report and the fourth time that it has been published in English.
Chapter 9 of the report includes general policy adjustments, military strength, defense budget, military deployment, weapons equipment, institutional reform planning, military training, military security cooperation with foreign powers, and military security relations with China.
The report said that 2015 was the year of the phased reimbursement of the Abe government for the years following its major policy adjustments in the security field.
From now on, Japan's security initiatives will focus on operational levels such as legal implementation, strategic implementation, policy implementation, rather than on substantial adjustments and changes to frameworks, mechanisms and policies.
The report stresses that Abe's Cabinet is trying to break through the above three points to achieve the multiple goals of promoting Japan's normal national makeup, self-defense forces to intervene in international security affairs, strengthening the alliance with the United States and Japan, and anti-China.
The Strategic Cultural Promotion Council of China has previously released its Japanese military force assessment report on June 5, 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014, and June 30, 2015.
The Financial Times of Great Britain published a graph of the US ambassador's residence in China on August 12.
The article said that the US ambassador's residence, in contrast, could be seen as a safe house in the next film adaptation of John le Carré's Cold War spy novel.
The official residence is gray and is protected with a guardrail, a second-floor interior wall, a threaded rail and a vehicle roadblock.
Filling up the shortboard for public sports facilities
The black-and-white coalfields, warehouses, turned into a green-green football field; the red-hot factory, turned into a modern sports hall.
On National Fitness Day, the South Ramoam Sports Cultural Park outside the Changjiang Gate in Hangzhou unveiled a mysterious face.
The site was once a coal mine, which was abandoned after closing more than a decade ago, leaving a large amount of illegal buildings and living waste.
After being restored, it became a sports and cultural park and will be officially opened to the public in November, providing free sports facilities to the public, and without a doubt, opened up a whole new ground for all-national sports.
This is reminiscent of Hangzhou Chenhua University, a Chinese swimming pool and military academy that has swam multiple world championships.
The name of the pool will be generated continuously, and the rich public base for selecting professional athletes provides a vivid interpretation of the relationship between athletics and public sports.
The level of athletics is closely linked to the foundations of folk sport, whereas athletics is in some sense dependent on folk sport, while folk sport is dependent on the conditions of the venue.
According to reports, as of 2015, the area of the country's per capita stadium is 150 times larger than when the new China was founded, but it is still far behind the sports powerhouse.
In June, the State Department issued the Jiabao All-People Fitness Plan (Jiabao 2016-2020) which focuses on the development of mass sports.
To make up for this shortcut, on the one hand, the relevant departments should take full account of the layout of the sports venues when planning the city.
On the other hand, public sports venues that have been built, including sports venues in schools and other units, should be opened as much as possible and improve their efficiency as possible.
The Rio Olympics, which are currently underway, have sparked a lot of enthusiasm and a sense of participation.
Guild gets a lawyer's fee in his patent fight with Merck for hepatitis C
According to the judgment of the United States District Judge, Gilead Science is entitled to attorney's fees arising from the patent litigation with the American Merck Group of pharmaceutical companies for hepatitis C.
In June, after a U.S. judge found Merck to be guilty of fraudulent acts, including perjury and other immoral conduct, Gilded was exempted from paying $200 million in damages for the violation of two of Merck's patents for the sale of the Gilded drugs, Sophie Bouvey and Havana.
In a lawsuit Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Lampton Freeman said Guild did not have to bear the costs of the defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the new generation of hepatitis C drugs. Gilead's drugs can cure more than 90% of hepatitis patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Guild and Merck filed a lawsuit against each other, both claiming to be the owners of the works of the laboratory of the active ingredient in Guild's drug, Sophia Bueway.
US-backed forces announce they have recaptured Manbij from Islamic State
A spokesman for the force said on Friday that all ISIS soldiers remaining in the city had left and that US-backed forces had taken full control of the northern city of Manbi, near the Turkish border.
After the militants had left the city, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now sweeping the entire city.
Shalon Darwish, the military commissioner of the Syrian Democratic Forces Alliance in Manbij, told Reuters that they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians who had been kidnapped by militants.
He told Reuters: "The Boomman Bee season is now under our control, but we are still doing a sweep".
The Clinton couple paid 34.2% of federal taxes on their income of $10.75 million in 2015.
Hillary Clinton released her 2105 tax return on Friday, showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal taxes.
In 2015, the Clinton couple's charitable donations totaled $1 million, most of which went to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton's speech fee was nearly $5.3 million, and the former Secretary of State received $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster from a book about her tenure in the State Department.
Clinton's campaign partner, Senator Tim Kane of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, have released their 10-year tax return.
Both of them paid 20.3% of federal taxes in 2015.
In a statement, Clinton's campaign assistant, Jennifer Palmieri, said that Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine would continue to be the benchmark for financial transparency.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump has been falsely covering up and withdrawing his previous pledge to release tax returns.
Although the law does not require it, as is customary, U.S. presidential candidates must make their tax returns public.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyers used the IRS audit as a reason for refusing to file a tax return.
Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams tweeted that you are the boss and attached a link to the Democratic nominee's tax return.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special counsel, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release tax returns until the audit was completed.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and others, said Trump's refusal to release the tax return file raised questions about his net worth, charitable contributions, business transactions and various other relationships, including with Russia.
Clinton took the issue to heart and posted a video online on Friday, highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Trump to release his tax bill.
She raised the question Thursday in a speech on economic policy in Michigan.
She told the crowd: "For decades, he has refused to release his tax returns like other presidential candidates".
According to the official Gazette News Network, Trump paid almost no penny of tax in the 1990s for two years, and the New York Times quoted several tax lawyers and accountants as saying Friday that the situation may still be the same.
Federal taxes have become a major issue in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named a provision after Warren Buffett, a billionaire investor who guaranteed that people earning more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% of the tax.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire Hathaway was headquartered, and Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also undergoing an IRS audit, and Trump's fear of Trump is not the tax authorities but voters.
The first tax return issued by the Clinton campaign was in 2007.
The average federal tax rate paid by the Clinton couple, who currently reside in Chapaca, New York, was about 32% between 2007 and 2014, and the combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton and Clinton tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, they earn less than $100.
Their main investment is the low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons have dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Jewish filmmakers criticize Berlin Hotel for its Arab customers' demands that it remove Israeli phone codes
A French filmmaker of Jewish descent told the media that the Berlin-based Kabinski Hotel did not list the Israeli phone number and that the hotel staff said it was a request from Arab customers, sparking a stir.
Claude Lonsman, author of the Jewish Holocaust documentary The Pillage, expressed his disappointment with the Kebbinski Hotel and published an open letter in the Frankfurt Reporter in Frankfurt, Germany.
During his recent stay, Longman wanted to find Israel on the phone code list provided by the hotel.
Israel is not among the countries where guests can call directly from the room.
Did Israel disappear in 2016 from Berlin, the capital of Germany?
The first is the "Fireflowers".
The hotel is located in the heart of the city, and offers a number of free and free phone calls to guests.
In order to seek an explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel's front desk.
In the letter, Longman said he was shocked by the response he received from the front desk.
The hotel staff said that this was a deliberate decision by the management of the Penkinsky Hotel.
The reason for this was to anger the filmmaker.
Longman quoted the employee as saying: "Most of our guests are Arabs and they want to remove the code of Israel".
According to the JNA, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadassah Handelsman, called the incident a "strange outrageous outrage".
We were surprised to learn about this incident.
This is a huge shame in itself.
The German hotel chain is even more disappointing than the German hotel chain.
The government has not yet approved the proposal.
The hotel is also a popular destination for tourists and visitors alike.
The incident sparked a heated debate online, and everyone thought it was a scandal.
Some people think that the Cabinsky Hotel is simply a place where Arab customers are bowing to their demands.
Another post pointed to the hotel's cheek-free location and pointed out that the street is located on the famous Kudam Street near a Jewish synagogue.
According to the Weekly Shōnen Magazine, the hotel quickly clarified all the allegations, claiming that everything was a complete miscarriage of justice and apologizing to Longman.
The PNDA quoted a representative of the Cabinsky party as saying that PNDA had never issued a direct order to remove Israel from the list of rapid dialings.
The newspaper also said that the code of Israel has been added to the list.
Brazilian students expelled by police with tear gas and shrapnel
On Thursday, students clashed with police in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in protest against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and cluster munitions to drive out protesters.
The incident was caused by law enforcement officials attempting to disperse students, so police used cluster munitions and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the march, expressing their dissatisfaction with the programs.
In order to save money, Governor Paul Okmin plans to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students will be transferred to school.
Some students who took part in the protest expressed their displeasure with the interim president Michel Temer by graffiti on the walls.
Just days before the latest protests, protesters took to the streets in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the National Senate.
Scottish cyclist Carm Skinner returns to the glory of winning the gold medal for his bike
Scottish cyclist Carm Skinner helped the British trio win the Olympic gold medal in the men's team event at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night after the 2012 London Olympics.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist replaced his Scottish compatriot Sir Chris Howe as the team's centre-back. Even the legendary cyclist was proud of him when Skinner beat and won the title of New Zealand's top-ranked team.
Four years ago, the British team was shocked when Hoey won the fifth of six individual Olympic gold medals.
Hoey retired from the sport after finishing sixth at the World Cycling Championships in London in March.
The problem with the British team was replacing first-round specialist Jamie Staff during the Beijing Olympics and London Olympics.
The team did this just as Sinda appeared.
Hoey's retirement also left a gap, and both Chin Emady and Matt Clanton wanted to fill it.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the England men's team coaching staff insisted on getting him into the national team, and Skinner ended up not being in the spotlight.
Skinner's partners were Sindes and Kenny, who won gold with Hoye four years ago. The three set Olympic records in qualifying but were beaten by New Zealand in the first round.
The three British cyclists eventually beat their opponents to win the gold medal.
Although Sindags was slightly behind, Kenny led the team, and Skinner kept that lead until the end.
The change in strategy was key to this reversal, and Sinds chose a larger aircraft, which was slower, which allowed Kenny, especially Skinner, to keep pace.
Hoey was watching the match as a BBC commentator. Skinner, Kenny and Sinds saw him on the podium.
"I was shocked by this", said Skinner, a 23-year-old cyclist from Glasgow.
I only do my best to make myself famous.
We set Olympic records in the final and beat the world championships.
It's incredible.
There is nothing better than this victory.
After winning gold medals with Kenny and Howie at the 2012 London Olympics, Sinds admitted to deliberately falling onto the track after a poor start.
He later withdrew the comment, and the English team's opponents could not appeal.
The first time I saw the video was in the video, and the second time I saw it was in the video.
The British flag is on the platforms of London, and the British flag is on the platforms of London.
We just teamed up three months ago.
We have lost so many world championships, so it is so surprising to be able to defend the Olympic title.
This is just one game, one gold medal for the British team that won seven of the 10 medals in the Olympic cycling events in Beijing and London.
If this is a sign of the progress we have made in the last five months, then we will continue to succeed in the bike shop for the next five days.
According to Kenny's statistics, he is not unlikely to repeat Hoey's three-time Olympic gold medalist achievement.
If so, then the 12-year-old Bejoy and also the 23-year-old Kenny, who was born on March 23 (the day that seems to be a holy day in British sports, and Steve Redgrave, Mo Farra and Roger Bannister were born on this day), would have 6 gold medals and 1 silver.
The result was similar to that of Hoey.
Kenny will be competing in the next three-day race starting today.
The 28-year-old Bolton said: "I'm going to focus on the game for a while.
The team competition is always the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
The first is that the people of the country are not alone.
He was also the first to win the gold medal, and he was also the first to win the gold medal.
This was the only medal-winning match of the day, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Vikings, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Durr were the fastest qualifiers in the four-man four-kilometer group chase.
The result was 351,943.
The world record for the 2012 London Olympics gold medalist was 351,659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will be played on the second day of the tournament today, and Vikings will undoubtedly be the focus of everyone's attention.
He had a dispute with the officials yesterday before the qualifying match, when they asked him to measure his height.
In the women's group stage that ends tomorrow, Laura Trot, Joanna Roser Sand, Elino Buck and Kate Archibald from Milwaukee advanced to the new world record 413,260.
The British team relied on their strong local cycling team to take the lead in the mid-Olympic and won multiple medals.
After demonstrating their absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British cycling team was a bit disappointed on their way to Rio.
There were many upheavals during the period, including the resignation of Tech Director Sean Sutton in April for allegations of sexism and bullying, and the retirement of legendary figures such as Howie, Victoria Pundleton and others.
But the first match of the night at the bike shop was enough to prove the legend that the British team will once again play at a crucial moment in the peak.
After a child's birth, parents are responsible for this life, which is not only about their physical health but also about their spiritual development, that is, their education.
If you fail in your child's education, even if your career is successful, you cannot make up for the shortcomings of life, the failure of your family.
When a new life comes, new parents need to spend their time and energy to care for and educate their children and be responsible for them.
The responsibility lies not only in caring for them physically, but also in their spiritual education, which is to teach them how to be human, how to grow up and how to succeed.
A good family education means that parents need to be with their children regularly, to give them care and patience, and to teach them civilized speech and behaviour, to teach them to learn better and to improve their intellect.
Parents' words affect the growth of their children, and they will imitate their parents, which is often said to be dragons, dragons, rats, and mice.
So parents need to set a good example in front of their children, regulate their speech and develop their own good qualities, which can indirectly help them to shape a good mindset and make them better.
Amy is a smart, beautiful girl.
She is a very lively character, who can get along well with friends and is able to adapt to the environment.
But there was a little secret in Amy's heart: she couldn't concentrate on her studies and work for long.
This secret has been with Amy for a long time.
Even through decentralized, modular time to study and work, she is basically able to complete tasks and get good results.
But when the task was heavy and time was tight, Amy felt very painful and tortured.
Individuals resist self-exposure and emotional experiences, with the aim of keeping their self-awareness and self-esteem from being threatened.
Some behavioral psychologists also consider resistance to understanding to be an individual's disobedience to his or her behavior.
I tried to get Amy to do an exercise to calm herself down and feel the smell of the smell by breathing in a relaxed way.
She was a woman who had been in a state of disrepair and was unable to find her way back to her former state.
The 63-year-old wanderer Hanmoo, who was stabbed to death with a knife after a fight with another wanderer, Shao, after drinking.

The family of the victim demanded more than 530,000 yuan in compensation for the funeral and death expenses.
Uber entered the Taiwanese market four years ago, and it has had a major impact on the local traditional taxi industry.
Taiwanese Taipei United reported on August 12 that more than 100 taxis bypassed the Taipei City Hall to protest the march, causing severe traffic jams around the area.
The chairman of the Taipei City Drivers' Union, Mr. Wang Jiang, said that Uber has been in power for four years and that the authorities had only convened a meeting at the end of this month.
The government has not believed the statement, and it has been delayed.
A taxi driver who is a law-abiding employee who is unrestricted to compete with Uber, who is illegal, feels cheated by the authorities.
Origin: Jiangsu Farming Farm 2000 chickens for sale by the court seized by the owner of the farm
After the verdict came into effect, as Li did not automatically fulfill the obligations established by the verdict, Wang made a request to the Yangtze Court for enforcement.
On October 16, 2014, the Yangtze Court issued a civil ruling that 2,000 eggs from all Li's farms were seized without permission to be transferred or sold.
After receiving the seizure ruling, Li Mao privately sold some of the eggs seized from the farm without permission from the Yangtze court.
As of March 8, 2015, the Jinan County Public Safety Bureau surveyed 142 eggs remaining in the farm.
On August 12, the press was informed that the Beijing 2022 Olympic Committee for the Organization of the Olympic Games in Winter and Paralympic Games in Beijing issued an announcement stating that the Beijing Olympic Committee for the Olympic Games in Winter had inherited the IP rights of the Beijing Olympic Committee for the Olympic Games in Winter, the symbols and other items.
No one shall use the Beijing Olympic Committee flag or badge for commercial purposes without the permission of the Beijing Olympic Committee.
The head of the Industrial Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission said today that excess steel capacity is a global problem.
In recent years, China's capacity utilisation rate has been higher than the global average and higher than countries and regions such as the United States and Europe.
The country has taken firm and effective measures to eliminate excess capacity and the results are gradually showing.
The head of the party noted that the CPSU attaches great importance to the global issue of steel overcapacity.
The State Department's deployment and serious work in all sectors and regions is being actively implemented, and this year we are pressing for a reduction of around 45 million tonnes of crude steel capacity.
In our country, we do not encourage steel exports, but instead, we take a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The head of the group stressed that international trade in steel products is essentially market behaviour, based on the demand of the importing country, and the independent choice of consumers based on factors such as the overall consideration of product price.
The implementation of trade protection measures does not contribute to the fundamental solution of the development of the global steel industry, but instead only further impacts the international trade order.
Speaking about debt, the Head stressed that debt resolution is an important issue that needs to be properly addressed in the process of resolving excess capacity.
Due to the large assets of steel companies, which involve large scale, some companies have complex debt relationships that could pose regional risks if mismanaged.
According to the head, in recent years, as the pressure of the downturn increased, the total demand of society gradually weakened, the capacity utilisation rate in some sectors decreased, and the difficulties in operating production in enterprises increased.
Some companies are not adapting to the changing market environment, production operations are difficult to maintain and even close to collapse, but are constrained by some institutional mechanisms and are becoming a zombie enterprise.
The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces resource efficiency, increases social management costs, and hinders the establishment of a fair competitive market environment.
The main causes of the losses are the volatile market demand and low capacity utilisation, as well as the difficulties facing the global steel industry.
The main objective of the government is to work on the labour base and social stability, ensuring fair and equitable market order.
The head of the company stressed that the next step is to continue to work on the capacity and ensure the completion of the target of 100-150 million tonnes of raw steel capacity in five years.
On the afternoon of the 10th, the Chinese tourist police appeared on the Moscow Red Square and immediately caught the attention of the people, Chinese tourists waved their welcome with surprise, and local and foreign tourists could not stop to look back.
On the same day, members of the first professional tourist police team in China, the Shia Public Security Agency (SPS) tourist police branch in Hainan Province, came to Moscow Red Square to exchange views with local tourist police officers.
The Moscow tourist police were assigned to three teams of duty patrols at Red Square, Nikolaysky Walk, and the Gum Shopping Mall, where they studied with Liu, who was a Chinese tourist police officer, for over an hour.
The young woman, a police officer in her 20s who speaks English and Spanish, joined the tourist police force last year.
He observed the words of his Russian counterpart on the way, not interacting with her regularly.
When meeting Spanish tourists to consult, the Moscow tourist police patiently explained to each other in fluent Spanish, which impressed Wang Ice.
The tourist police in Moscow are all fluent in foreign languages, some even have more than two, which is very touching to us.
As an international tourist island, Hainan is increasingly focusing on attracting international tourists, and we want to improve our capacity to match the status of international tourist island.
Before the training, the Chinese tourist police also visited the Moscow Metropolitan Police Station to communicate with their Russian counterparts.
I often talk to Chinese tourists and I am very happy to see them come to Russia.
The questions they often ask are: how to get around, where is a monument, how to rent a house, how to get back to the hotel.
In recent years, the city environment and tourism atmosphere in Moscow have improved, and the attractiveness of foreign tourists has increased, said the head of the Moscow Metropolitan Police's tourism squad, Captain Resaikov.
In July 2014, a tourist police force was established to protect, assist and evacuate tourists in major tourist attractions.
Currently, all the Moscow tourist police are fluent in English, with some speaking Spanish and German.
The police force divided them into nine groups based on their foreign language level, taking classes twice a week to learn self-defense tactics, legal regulations and foreign languages.
The two tourist police officers who are currently learning Chinese have already said well, and we will continue to improve their Chinese language skills, said Zoresakov.
Resaikov told reporters that the Moscow Tourism Police had gained some experience since its formation and hoped to inspire its fellow three-year-old.
He believes that cooperation between the police departments of the two Russian-Chinese countries will increase the sense of security of tourism to each other's countries.
The recruitment of the staff of the Moscow Tourist Police, the police model, the equipment, and the good interaction with tourists have given us a lot of inspiration, Chen Xiaokun said.
Xinhua news reporter Liu Li found that at least nine provinces in Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian, Beijing and others have issued residence permit regulations.
The conditions for applying for a residence permit are generally stated in the above areas, which require residence for more than six months and meet one of the conditions of legitimate stable employment, legal stable residence and continuing education.
Xinhua noted that the amount of uranium in the country varies in terms of treatment provided by residence permits, and that the range of public services and facilities offered in some areas is broader than the national version.
These areas have increased the ease of children taking local high school exams under the relevant conditions.
In addition, many places such as Beijing have made clear demands to gradually expand the scope of public services and facilities and to make them publicly available on a regular basis.
For example, Fujian proposes that at least once every three years the public services and facilities enjoyed by residents of the country be made public to the society.
The Provisional Regulations of the Residence Permits Provisional Provision stipulates that the public security authorities shall produce and issue a residence permit within 15 days of the date of receipt of the residence permit.
The majority of the regions agree with the national version, which is issued within 15 days.

As a rookie 12th overall pick in 2014, Saritz will officially enter the NBA next season and join the Philadelphia 76ers.
While many fans don't know him as a young European player, Saritz is convinced that his performance will leave a deep impression on the public through the Olympics.
In the last game, Croatia beat Spain, Saric successfully blocked the last minute attack by Paul-Gasol, who was trying to drag the game into extra time.
Recently, 76ers captain Brett Brown gave Saritz a high rating, saying that he saw the shadow of Manou-Ginnobile as a young man.
It is clear that Saridze has already demonstrated his talent and has made 76 people look forward to him.
In his first two games at the Olympics, Saric scored 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Saritz showed his ability to take up space on the pitch, by dismantling his teammates and hitting a three-point shot.
Although the 76ers currently have a lot of talented young players, they do not have the ability to play outside of Saritz.
From the cap to the starting lineup, the number of inline players who can do this on the NBA court today is countless.
Since the start of the Olympics, Saridze has been a complete player with 13 points, 8 rebounds and 5 assists in three games.
James has signed two consecutive 1+1 contracts since returning to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014.
As the NBA's current salary agreement enters its final year, James will be at the forefront of negotiating the salary agreement as vice president of the NBA Players' Union.
Given the dramatic increase in league revenue, thanks to the new TV broadcasting agreement and the dispute between the owners and players over how to handle the money, the outside world fears the NBA will be shut down next summer.
But for James, he doesn't have to worry about becoming a free agent next summer, as he has signed a three-year contract with the Cavaliers.
James is under contract regardless of when the 2017-18 season officially begins.
The iPhone SE has been a huge hit in the mobile market since its surprise debut.

The future of the Portland refinery is uncertain as power contracts are cancelled
The future of the Portland refinery in Victoria and hundreds of its workers is uncertain as a power company that supplies the plant with electricity discloses that one plant owner will terminate a supply contract, which will invalidate all supply contracts.
The move comes after the Victorian government decided not to continue granting subsidies to ensure the plant operates.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will end in November.
The company's Portland plant could be unemployed for 2,000 workers.
Once the plant is closed, up to 2,000 people may be directly or indirectly unemployed.
The plant's electricity consumption accounts for about 10% of all electricity output in Victoria, and a chain reaction is also likely to occur.
In 2014, Merck closed the Henry Cape refinery, which led to the closure of the Angels Island power plant last year.
The Portland refinery of American Co. is currently in disrepair and at risk of closing.
The move was made after making predictions about the plant's future years, initially due to the strengthening of the AUD and more recently due to the price of the plant's products.
AGL is providing electricity to the large refinery through the old Euphrates plant in the Latrobe Valley. The company predicts that the owners of three other plants will also terminate their agreements.
The largest shareholders of the plant are a joint venture between the company Meridian and the company Hydrogen Oxide, while China's China Shipping Group and Japan's Muro Red Stock Company also hold a small number of shares.
The joint venture said that AGL expects the Portland refinery to continue operating, meaning that the refinery will continue to generate electricity demand.
AGL said the contracts were the backbone of the silicon hedge contracts that were supposed to go into effect in November 2016.
The contracts are for a period of 12 months, so they will end in 2017.
The power company said: "As a result, AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in fiscal year 2017".
Any potential revenue impact on AGL from fiscal 2018 is currently being optimistic about wholesale electricity prices in the futures market.
AGL said the company had reduced the contract value of $187 million in the expected amount of the contract in the pipeline.
The company said the decision to terminate the contracts would not affect the company's ability to operate the refinery or guarantee the power supply.
The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Old Ewing in 2010 that was due to come into effect in November, but the company did not explain why it withdrew.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland refinery in Victoria and the Tomahawk plant near Newcastle will close due to the poor economic situation in the industry.
Commenting on analysts earlier this week, AGL's chief operating officer Stephen Mickelson said Portland's annual electricity consumption was about 600 MW and the Tomaho plant was about 900 MW.
If the two plants are closed, the demand for electricity will be greatly reduced.
He said: "As an electricity company, this is not good news for us, but it is good news for us".
Community Law Center rejects 160,000 people every year
More than 160,000 vulnerable groups are denied access to the community legal center each year. The funding for the service has been overwhelmingly cut and is now facing further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of five people are denied free legal advice and representation, mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without the resources to fight unjust expulsion.
The lack of funds for community legal services has long exceeded the threshold and now faces further funding cuts.
Starting next June, federal funding for these law centers will be reduced by another 30 percent.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Centre, said that thousands of people are turned away from their homes each year, according to the latest National Community Association Law Centre Survey.
Mr. Farrell said that the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change the existing decision.
He said that the community law centre in Queensland had been in a long-term financial crisis, which meant that thousands of people would not have access to the essential services they needed.
People who need to stay away from violence, those who have huge debts that cannot be paid, families that are falling apart, and oppressed workers are facing legal problems and the report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut 30% of its funding from June 2017, meaning that thousands of vulnerable people in Queensland will face complex legal challenges without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Queensland MP, George Brandeis, to immediately withdraw these cuts so that people can get the help they need when faced with legal issues.
Last year, the state government pledged to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
The need for community law centers and their communities must now be addressed, and the White House government must also be involved in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team is being sued for staff shooting
New York: Trump's campaign team is being sued for failing to act after a staff member fired a gun at his North California boss while driving a jeep in February.
Vincent Bodini, a former software trainer for the state's campaign team, described the incident Wednesday in a state court in Charlotte.
Bodini said he had hoped the matter could be resolved internally, but after months of waiting he realized that it was unlikely.
According to Bodini, the head, named Earl Philip, pulled out a gun, placed his right thumb on the dashboard, and pointed the gun at Vincent's knee.
After complaining to the leadership of the local and regional campaign teams, Bodini learned from the book that at least four other people had experienced the same thing.
In his complaint, Bodini said that not firing a shot does not mean that no harm will be done.
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential candidate in North Carolina told the crowd that if his opponent Hillary Clinton were elected and chose the judge she liked, the people who supported the Second Amendment, the gun-supporting people and gun lovers, would probably take action.
Trump's campaign team said the media took his word for it and that he did not advocate violence.
Bodini in his complaint demanded that the campaign team compensate for its neglect of supervision, while also demanding that Philip compensate for his assaults, beatings and mental harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the news.
I can't get in touch with Phillip.
According to the WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte, Philip recently left the campaign team.
His consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services did not immediately respond to his calls.
The campaign team of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is controversial.
Both parties filed the case in the Court of Common Pleas of the McCormick County (Charlotte) Superior Court, Bodiney v. Trump, 16-CS-14300.
Britain must convey the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our community, London and the entire country.
For me, that's what makes Heathrow so attractive, and as we did at the London 2012 Olympics, we do our best to ensure that our countries and regions benefit from these events.
The Olympics have been a huge benefit to Stratford and the East End.
We will also benefit the region once again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses in the area of Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and help the youth around the airport to escape unemployment.
As before the London 2012 Olympics, some people thought Heathrow's expansion project was too big.
I was told that Britain would not be able to prepare for the Olympics and that we would be ashamed of ourselves in front of the world.
The questioners' doubts about the 2012 Olympics are wrong, and their doubts about the Heathrow project will be proven wrong.
While there are always obstacles to overcome, Heathrow is solving every problem it faces.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority rather than the minority.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs, bring about 211 billion pounds of economic growth, and leave a wealth of technology and employment around the airport and across the UK.
We have a spending team on the Heathrow project. The team has completed 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment projects on time and within budget, including T5 which has been voted the best airport terminal in the world for five consecutive years and T2 between the world's two busiest runways.
Now, they are preparing to build a third runway with private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The UK has successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics, and I am confident that the Heathrow Airport expansion project will also be a huge success.
It is time for us to pass on the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport so that we can sustain our future and create a wealth of technology and jobs that will make the whole of Britain proud.
Sir Paul Dayton is Chairman of Heathrow Airport and former Business Compensator at the UK Treasury
A woman commits suicide and is stabbed to death on a Swiss highway
The victims were lying on the highway at midnight.
The woman who tried to commit suicide was hit by multiple vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning.
The accident occurred early Thursday morning on the A1 highway near Morg, Wau.
According to Wu State Police, a woman was lying desperately on the road in the middle of the night and was hit by multiple vehicles.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was clearly suicidal. She was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
The woman died on the spot.
Police said that several drivers involved have been investigated, but some have not been confirmed.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstadt told the Geneva Forum that a criminal investigation was underway, which is the normal course of such cases.
The driver of the car is not yet charged with any offence.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
The court of appeals for the district court's decision to dismiss the case, said Hofstadt.
According to the results of two other similar cases in the past five years, the driver will not be held responsible.
The report said that both cases were caused by people walking on the highway at night. The final verdict was that drivers could not expect pedestrians to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was charged with causing death by negligence in August 2014 for hitting and killing a man on the A1 motorway near Payet.
The court learned that the 22-year-old victim was crossing the road after drinking.
After the investigation, the judge said that the woman was driving completely legally at the time, and that the man was found on the road in a completely unexpected and unexpected situation, and that the woman police officer called an ambulance after the incident.
Anyone who can provide information about the incident near Moray on Thursday should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable place
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was once a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Institute have developed a model that explores Venus' past, using tools and algorithms very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, which has a surface temperature, is waterless and has an atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, has ever had an environment similar to Earth.
Scientists previously believed that Venus' rotation was slower because of its thicker atmosphere.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus may have had a thinner, Earth-like atmosphere and a slower rotation rate.
The model also shows early geography of Venus.
Venus' dry regions may be larger than Earth's, but there was once enough water and geographic changes to support life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early on, the brightness of the sun on Venus was 30% darker than Earth.
Anthony Del Genio, a scientist at the Goddard Space Institute, explained at a press conference that Venus's slow rotation in a model simulation at the Goddard Space Institute has extended daytime on its side for nearly two months.
This warms the surface and produces rainfall that can form thick clouds, which block most of the sun's heat to the ground like a sponge.
The results of the simulation are that the average climate temperature of Venus is actually several degrees lower than that of Earth today.
The model simulates the evolution of Venus in close proximity to previous planetary scientists' predictions.
Although life may have existed on Venus, it has been exposed to extreme temperatures and ultraviolet radiation over the course of billions of years.
The oceans on the planet evaporate and the water vapor is burned by ultraviolet rays.
As the hydrogen escapes, only thicker atmospheres of carbon dioxide and deadly greenhouse gas effects remain, forming the planet Venus we know today.
Researchers published a simulation of the new Venus climate model in the journal Communication of the Ecological Physics Research of Venus.
Patrick Roy resigns as head coach of the Snows
Patrick Roy resigned as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche Ice Hockey Team on Thursday, saying he had no say in team decision-making.
Colorado Executive Vice President and General Manager Joe Satchis confirmed the news and said the club would immediately begin looking for a new head coach.
Roy, 50, said in a statement: "Over the past three years, I have been living with the vitality, passion and determination to serve as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche.
I spent the whole summer thinking about how to improve the team so that it has the power to go higher.
The goal of the head coach and vice president must be consistent with the goals of the club.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
The government has not yet met these conditions.
Sachies hired Roy on May 23, 2013, to thank Roy for his contributions to the team.
Sadhis said: "Patrick told me today about his decision.
We thank him for his contribution to the club and hope that he will be successful in the future.
Roy was named the best coach in the Jack Adams Award-winning league in his first season as head coach of the Snowyers in 2013-14.
He helped the club to 112 points, placing first in the Central Division. But Colorado was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Minnesota, where they have lost in the playoffs in each of the last two years.
In the 2015-16 season, the Snowyers finished with 39 wins, 39 draws and 4 losses, and eventually lost their second outright playoff berth in the Western Conference Conference by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups, including two each for the Montreal Canadiens and the Snowy Colts.
Workers of the North Sea oil field stop strike and continue negotiations
The chief negotiator said that workers at the North Sea oilfields had stopped the strike on compensation, and that the parties to the dispute had started a new round of negotiations.
The North Sea oil platform operated by Royal Dutch Shell has been the target of several strikes by the Wood Group, an oilfield services company.
According to a joint statement, the Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the ongoing dispute resolution process.
We will start early next week with a series of full-day meetings in the coming weeks to review these issues.
The union said its recent action was to protest against a pay cut of as much as 30% as possible, the first such action in 25 years.
Wood Group has cut its payroll to North Sea contractors by about 9% this year due to market pressure.
Prior to this pay cut, the company reduced the remuneration of offshore contractors by 10% in 2014.
The company said that the further wage cuts would help the company to overcome the difficult times of the market recession.
Shell has laid off thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas facilities in 10 countries as the company needs to streamline its operations after merging with British Energy Group UK.
Energy companies are facing pressure from the fall in crude oil prices and the UK's decision to leave in June.
Scottish Parliament MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute of the generation in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
Dave said in a statement: "In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that serves the majority rather than the few".
In 2016, spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to be less than $1.4 billion, compared to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of the stars of the constellation Ongsu
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope helps astronomers gather the most complete speeds of rotation of the constellation of Ongshui.
New data is helping astronomers understand why the stars in the galaxy have different rotational speeds and the association of rotational cycles with the composition of the planets.
In a press conference, Rosa Reeble, a research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing Analysis at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said: "We want to understand more about the relationship between the mass, age, and even the history of our solar system by comparing our results to other galaxies".
The Aung-Jung constellation is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the constellation were born about 125 million years ago and are just reaching maturity.
They reach their highest speed of rotation in their lifetime.
At their peak rotational speed, these mature stars emit massive stellar winds.
When these stellar winds pass through the star's magnetic field, they act as brakes on the star.
As the star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time of the appearance of identifiable black stars (such as the sun's black hole).
The latest spin velocity data sets show that stars of higher mass spin slower than stars of lower mass.
Rebel compared the stars to dancers, who were larger than the body, and were slower than the smaller dancers.
"In the dance-dance performance of the Young Ballet of the Songju Group, we find that stars that spin slower are often of higher quality, while stars that spin faster are often the lightest", said Rebel.
Because of the nearer distance, the Aung-Jung constellation can serve as the ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing the mass of stars with their rotational velocities.
Rebel said the constellation laid the foundation for a two-way rotation model of young and old stars.
There is still much to know about how, when and why the stars slow down and the monkeys pick up their own dance shoes.
In three new papers, Reebur and her colleagues detail their latest analysis of the rotational speed of the Aunt Zhou constellation.
The head of the Department of Water Management at South Lake Park, Liu Jiang-jun, said that the depth of the water below South Lake is more than 10 meters, and that if the water is not understood, there is a high risk of danger.
Although the South Lake Rescue Team is very professional, Liu still wants to see tourists who sail large boats wearing life jackets, not doing illegal activities on the lake, and playing safety games.
The village has a unique marine environment, with two major recreational tourist resources, the natural ecological and the human ecological.
But the individual owners of the parish car park, who feared that doing so would affect their car rental price, and also suspected that others were being private, were behind the destruction, causing the car park renovation to be put on hold.
The question of when and by whom the tomato was introduced remains a matter of debate among scholars.

The Beijing Municipal Office of Social Communities Administration will conduct a special inspection of the use of uniform receipts for social groups' fees.
The two types of inspection are self-examination and focused sampling.
The relevant officials of the Municipal Community Office said that the scope of the inspection includes the social groups that received the uniform receipts from the Municipal Community Office for the years 2013 to 2015.
In a 2012 Olympic strategy, Rio's organizers said that the success of the Rio Olympics was defined by who shared their stories on social media.
According to the Olympic report, media has made significant changes in many aspects of how it is spread, product form, language style, and news perspective.
The International Olympic Committee and media practitioners from around the world seem to be already facing this challenge.

A brokerage analyst in the country said that the Eastern securities are not good on a port basis, and its capital management business is the head of the Eastern securities. Compared to the banks such as China Bank International, China Securities, seems to be inadequate.
Experts note that many of the stock market's performance has declined since this year as the stock market has returned to flatliness, but it is not possible to make a general statement about the company's own business development after the company goes public.
After the new regulation comes into effect, Suzhou will become the first city in the country to reopen second-tier purchasing restrictions.
The second-tier cities that have or are about to have a housing market regulation policy are not just Suzhou, but also cities like Co-op, Nanjing and others.
Prior to this, Co-op had been the first to issue a limited lending policy, which would have been rejected by banks for those who had two houses under the name of Co-op and one home loan that had not been settled.
Last week, the classic drama, The Cosmetics, was temporarily suspended, which unexpectedly sparked a heated debate about fake national drama ratings.
Civil rights groups issue travel warnings against Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued travel warnings to people of color who are preparing to travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racial attacks in Missouri.
In the NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which took effect on August 28, 2017, Liu called for all African-American travelers, tourists and Missourians to exercise special caution and extreme caution when traveling to Missouri in light of a recent series of suspicious racial incidents in Missouri, citing the group's statement.
The NAACP noted that a recent Missouri law that makes it harder to win discriminatory lawsuits against minorities, and to a lesser extent, law enforcement in the state, prompted the organization to issue travel warnings.
The report also highlights the importance of the right to privacy and the right to privacy.
They were questioned, beaten or killed because of their skin color, Missouri NAACP President Rod Chappell told The Kansas City Star.
We have received many complaints, unprecedented numbers.
This is the first such warning issued by the organization against a state in the United States.
The group cited the racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old Tennessee black man Tory Sanders.
Earlier this year, Sanders died in suspicious circumstances. He ran out of fuel while traveling to Missouri and was detained by Missouri State Police without charge of crime.
The consultation also noted that a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office showed that black drivers in the state were 75% more likely to be screened for parking than white drivers.
Chappell said the consultation was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri.
The people who are traveling must be prepared, whether they are going to Missouri with bail money or to let their relatives know they are traveling in the state.
According to the latest data from the FBI's Hate Crime Reporting Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; the state ranks 16th nationally in crime volume.
Travel warnings are also a response to a new Missouri law that will make it harder to sue housing or employment discrimination businesses.
Previously, states passed immigration law requiring local law enforcement to detain immigrant offenders, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the move would increase the number of racial litigation and issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government to other countries, but recently, advisory groups have adopted this approach to address certain laws and trends within the United States.
After the booming cinematic era of 2015, the overall film market entered a period of calm in 2016, and it became a matter of debate whether it could break the previous year's total of 440.69 billion yuan.

BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city: making old people feel like they're living in a new era
According to the January 18 news website, Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly becoming the modern city of charm today.
With an amazingly fast internet, cutting-edge technologies such as facial recognition software, huge investments in artificial intelligence and unrivalled international energy, it is one of the most exciting cities for exploring-minded foreigners.
According to the BBC website, German drummer Clemens Seisch said on January 16, "Oh, if I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere later". He quoted singer Frank Sinatra singing in New York City.
Seishi, creative director of the traveler's archives magazine, said: "If Sinatra were alive today, he would probably sing in a city like Beijing". He said that living in this city will make you feel like living in a new era of fashion and always keeping up with the trend.
Simon Norton, who lives in Beijing, but is from England, recently wrote on his personal blog 4Corners7Seas: "It's hard to say exactly how people feel about being in the center of something big, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it will look like and want to witness it".
The city's high-speed internet and technology-friendly environment have made everyday life easier than ever before.
Andy Penia Fuert, who is currently the deputy editor-in-chief of the Beijing Children's Kitchen website, said that Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society, with the Internet integrating the functionality of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions.
But the report said that smartphones were just the beginning of Beijing's technological ambitions, facial recognition software has become popular, and many mobile phone applications use this technology to make bank transfers and payments, allow people to enter apartments and offices, and even to verify the identity of online car drivers.
Beijing recently announced plans to invest 13.8 billion yuan to build an AI technology park, which will house more than 400 businesses after completion, focusing on developing AI technologies ranging from bio-based to autonomous vehicles.
Food is also the heart of many major festivals in the Chinese calendar, and the celebration is celebrated by foreigners, with Spring Festival being the most important social and economic festival and one of the easiest to participate in by foreigners.
Shehi said: "Well, I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the new year, cleaning apartments and writing a red spring line on their doorstep with a New Year's greeting is as important as it is, and on that eve, all family members should get together for a lavish meal, and then celebrate the new year until midnight, with a bright flame.
While the number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, Chinese language barriers and the ease of communication between the people of Beijing are easy to justify their lack of integration into the local culture.
Shehi said: "Some foreigners have been living in China for years but have little experience with their host country. If you initially try to contact the Chinese people without success, you will easily have or feel more comfortable with other foreigners".
The so-called "out-of-town bubbles" (the "out-of-town bubbles") refer to foreigners mixing only among foreigners, without contact with locals and local cultural interpreters), foreigners holding groups in their own communities, eating in Western restaurants, and friends with only foreigners.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin, which is easier than people might think.
Shehi said: "One or two hours of private Chinese lessons or an entry-level radio drama should fit everyone's busy schedule.
Even learning a few classic short sentences can be helpful when shopping, ordering meals in restaurants or talking in a taxi.
The report said that persistent air pollution is a fact of daily life, although in recent years the government has tried to curb some problems.
Residents stressed that it is important to go outdoors during the often mildly polluted warm months to view those blue days as a chance to explore the historic void or the popular Sunrise Park.
"Beijing is the most under-the-ground Chinese city, and you can find great art and music, lavish nightlife, historical wonders, super-modern business districts and ancient squares", Norton said.
The report notes that the barrier to growth of human capital is increasingly evident, particularly in the Northeast, where the average annual contribution of ageing to human capital growth is 1.28%.
Pan Feng-sheng pointed out that the risk of cross-border capital flows is currently controllable and that the fundamental factors supporting the balance of international accounts remain in place for a long time.

The European Commission accused Google in April of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre-install software such as Google Search and Chrome Browser, or not allowing them to use other Google apps.
The European Commission considers this to be harmful to consumers' interests and to impede competition.
The EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
If the anti-monopoly charge is upheld, Google faces a maximum fine of 10% of its global revenue, which is about $7.4 billion.
Google has not immediately commented on this.
Google is also facing an EU investigation for its bias towards home-based shopping services in search results.
Zhang Yunin's success in the dance was not accidental, and his jump to the top of the world rankings was surprising.
A chart of the legal status of Bitcoin around the world
Summary: Apart from the natural price reshuffle triggered by speculation, the downturn in the digital currency is not related to the risk of regulatory oversight by the rivals.
From a visualized map, the attitudes of Eastern countries towards Bitcoin are more conservative than those of the West, and the countries that make up the global mainstream are still watching the legality of digital currency, representing a large risk of the Black Swan.
*This article is from Wall Street News, editor Wang Mu. For more information, please visit wallstreetcn.com or download the Wall Street News App.*
With a regulatory storm surging in major bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union, and a bloodbath this week with the global digital currency led by Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin fell below the psychological total of $10,000 on Tuesday, creating the biggest one-day drop in three years.
In addition to the natural price reshuffle triggered by speculation, the downturn in the digital currency has nothing to do with the longstanding risk of regulatory oversight by the hosts.
In this important passage, the visualized big data website HowMuch.net produced a chart showing the legality and regulation of Bitcoin in countries around the world.
As shown below, green represents the legal market for Bitcoin; yellow represents the neutral market, although it has not publicly legalized Bitcoin's status, but there are no major restrictions on its use; light pink represents restricted markets, i.e. local governments attempt to approach the use of digital currency through red line policies or regulation; dark pink represents Bitcoin as an illegal country; gray is a country that has not yet been commented on.
(The above chart was taken from the HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15.)
The article notes that the distribution of green African blocks in the chart shows that in the traditional sense, Eastern countries are more conservative towards Bitcoin than Western countries.
Russia is currently the largest country to define Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest Bitcoin restricted markets, and India is one of the largest countries that has not yet commented on or implemented a policy on Bitcoin.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of Bitcoin, meaning that the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
The views of the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are markedly different, with the distribution of the blocks in the above regions more mixed.
Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Brazil are all legal bitcoin markets, with some restrictions on trading and use in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bolivia, and more Latin American countries have not yet spoken out against bitcoin.
The data collected from the above shows that 99 of the 246 countries surveyed globally - or 40 percent - have no restrictions on Bitcoin transactions and use, namely the green and orange zones.
There are 7 countries (or 3%) that are restricted markets (or pale pink), 10 countries (or 4%) that define Bitcoin as illegal (or pale pink), 130 countries (or 53%) that do not have more digital currency information (or gray).
This indicates that the global economy (53 percent, over half) is still looking at the legality of the Bitcoin-led digital currency domestically, and represents a significant risk of Bitcoin's demise, as some of these countries may eventually make legislative decisions to limit digital currencies.
The article argues that global regulators do not fully understand the emerging category of digital currencies, which is probably the main reason most countries have not yet made any comments.
While the popularity of Bitcoin has been rising exponentially since last year, it is not of interest to all countries, and some countries may fear that local fiat currency is threatened or even more so that digital currency is being used by criminal organizations.
The Wall Street Journal has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news against Bitcoin since last week, including China's start to crack down on centralized online platforms and mobile apps for off-site exchanges; South Korea's ongoing consideration of shutting down digital currency exchanges; the EU's view that Bitcoin is not yet widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of losing its currency to the bloodshed.
The Wall Street Journal selected the 2018 calendar year for the launch of the global central bank's digital currency, which Mr. Liu has said will be the year for the global central bank's digital currency from any point of view of regulation, acceptance/criticism, adoption.
The legality of Bitcoin has been criticized by major powers such as Russia, which is actually trying to give way to official digital currency issuance.
The Barcelona-based newcomer Coutinho 8 made his debut in a Bassa shirt at the Nottingham City Championships on 8 January.
Coutinho passed the health check-up on the morning and signed a contract with Bassa President Batomeu, which expires in the summer of 2023.
He then made his debut as a player for Bassa in front of nearly 7,000 fans at Camp Nou.
According to Spanish media, the total transfer fee for Coutinho, or 160 million euros (€1 is about 7.77 yuan), is the first price in the history of the club and the Premier League.
As he is still injured, he will have to take a break of almost 20 days before he can make his debut in a full-size baseball jersey.
What else is sacred?
Now the White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most defining sign of the regime's change was when they began attacking the statue.
The Americans and everyone else agree with this. So in 2003, Saddam Hussein was overthrown in Baghdad's Paradise Square.
Stephen Miller, one of the key thinkers in the Trump administration, was sure of what would happen to his iconic axe cutting off a statue of the goddess of freedom when he argued with CNN's Jim Acosta about the president's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, a group of sailors and liberal followers would surely devour his life.
But he did attack the meaning of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was engraved on the foundation in 1903 (the monument was completed 17 years later).
As Miller reproached Acosta: "Oh, I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the goddess of freedom is like a symbol of America's freedom to light up the world"...
The poem you mentioned was later added and was not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller is right, but as he himself says, it's not really about history.
This is a modern echo of Lazarus's resurrection speech, where the only country seems to invite not only any old immigrants but also the poorest of the poor: your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowded crowd of people who crave for freedom of breath,/the suffering people who refuse your crowded beach.
People who don't have pain in their eyes refuse to look at our screens for a moment that becomes more acute.
Miller has never worked as a literary critic, and he made it clear that these people would not be welcome in the Trump-era United States.
This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, and her friends at the base of the poem, who were in attendance after her death, were aware that their actions were highly political.
The sculpture is intended to express the connection between French and American republicanism through an ancient classical metaphor of the female incarnation of the goddess of freedom.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the poem: "In her poem, the image of a woman is no longer abstract, but she is speaking".
She gave herself a very different name: Mother of Exile.
The poem combined with the painting was a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to Native Americanism.
As Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers have been trying to change it.
The great speaker, Rush Limbaugh, was a Baptist at the time of Trump's arrival, who in 2010 believed that liberalism was not inviting anyone, and he is now an early neo-conservative who brought the flame of American wisdom to a world of ignorance: the goddess of freedom is brave to be unprecedented.
She was going to bring the free spark from the United States to the rest of the world.
The fireworks are not the way to light America.
The unusual thing is that Limbo was actually hit by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the perceptual angle.
Lazarus's imagination was so rich that he could see it. When tired, poor but hopeful people saw it on the deck of a ship after a long and often dreadful journey, he was able to see it.
On the surface, this is about the worldview of people seeking asylum, who have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveys to them the hope and welcome they need to hear.
Of course, this is not what Miller and Trump wanted to admit.
They are not lighting their torches to light the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.

World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish national team in England
Eilidh Doyle recalled that the England national team had only two Scots players.
Neil Blake, the executive director of the British Athletics Association, said the 16 strong Scots in the World Cup squad would make a huge contribution to the national team.
The record number of Scottish athletes selected for the 2017 World Championships in Athletics in London, which opened on Friday, set a record.
Blake believes that the Scottish team is developing an unusual developmental style that British athletes must learn from.
Well, we're going to accept and try to understand this, and we're going to stick with it until we succeed.
I've been talking to people at the Scottish Academy of Sport who think it's about their role.
The Scottish athletes believe this is related to their performance.
The British Athletics Association believes this is related to their role.
Even the people on the streets think so.
In any case, it is extremely ridiculous.
Several Scottish athletes competing for the medal, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, will be below Mo Farah at 5,000 metres, while Elidh Doyle will be selected as team captain.
I'm not sure what I'm saying.
She was a great captain, and she was incredible.
Many athletes, whether they are Scottish or wherever they live or train, walk out of their doors proudly and proudly.
The passion and genuine feelings that Airtel naturally put into it are good.
The Commonwealth silver medalist in his fifth World Championships in the 400m sprint said that 16 Scottish players were in the British national team, which was an incredible feat.
The highest number of Scottish athletes competing in the World Cup was seven, which was achieved in 1983 and 2015.
In the past year, she has set five British and two European records.
She will compete in the 1500m and 5000m events.
Chris O'Hare, who competes in the 1500m event, is another notable Scottish athlete, having previously achieved good results in the season, winning both the Preliminary and Olympic Anniversary competitions in the UK.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first World Championship, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said that she is very proud that so many of her compatriots not only join the team but will also challenge for medals and qualify for the finals in some cases.
The special thing about being a national team captain is that it is voted on by the other team members. So knowing that your teammates voted for you to achieve something very unusual, anyway, is a great honor for me, Mom added.
I am very proud of all the Scottish players.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are all old-fashioned athletes here, athletes who are about to move towards the goal of winning the trophy.
How is my captain's speech?
Oh, I think it's great.
I just saw the fact that in this situation we are very lucky because we have a World Championship at home.
So it's really important that we get back on track with the support of the home team and that we get back on track with the Olympic Stadium.
I will get a second chance to compete, and the atmosphere will be amazing.

Facebook blocks critics: If you can't stand the criticism of voters, don't run for public office
Our father knows the way bad media works.
Americans loved Washington, but soon the major newspapers began to lash out at him, from domestic policy to political principles, not one of them being left out.
He was furious with the criticism, no doubt.
But he did not silence the critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington had said that if freedom of speech were denied, we would be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance.
It reminded me of Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who needed to study in Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 posts because they shared their views on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's officials considered the lawsuit to be very rash, and online reports filled with their strong opposition: Who cares?
Many people say, "Oh, this is just Facebook".
But it's important.
This is especially important because people like Hogan are faced with this.
This is a Republican who is the governor of a democratic majority state, and he is also surprisingly popular.
He was ranked second among the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not a reactionary, hasty person.
He ran Maryland smoothly and strictly by the rules.
He is also very good at using Facebook as a major way to connect with voters, and has shown his post-chemotherapy bra for the first time on the homepage.
So it is completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block comments from those who come to the governor's homepage. This homepage is a public forum and is the official management platform for the publicly taxed feed list of employees.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Shas, defended the governor's actions, saying she believed that blocking their comments was only to get them to restrain themselves a little.
But they are overly rash in describing it as a flood monster or cynic that is sweeping the web.
The Washington Post has spoken face-to-face with people who are being shielded by Hogan.
They are nothing more than ordinary people's dialogue with their chosen leaders: their identity as teachers, small business owners and pastors, not a flood monster.
The comments were deep, respectful and not discouraging.
The pastor quotes from the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Ramani, a Maryland attorney general in Boise, was not cynical, but she did ask questions about hate crimes.
She wrote in the Washington Post's News Story Commentary section of the Washington Post that she was polite in commenting that I was disappointed that he did not respond to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also don't like a group of people commenting on the same topic because they are being ignored by some people, who think they are so-called psychopaths, rather than considering them as a group of concerned citizens.
The government officials have said that the bombing of the pumpkin-dense junk information pumpkin may have been a claim that pumpkin is insisting on.
The age of Facebook made it easy to change a message, with only one critic being blocked or a negative comment removed.
And it's much cleaner than in the past, and in the past, to achieve the same effect requires sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical comments or arrest or whistle-blowing protesters.
But that's what's happening right now, but on a digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of gossiping about others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
Last week, a landmark ruling was issued in Virginia on such matters.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. Katharis of the City of Alexandria, the Chairman of the Lauderdale County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment by blocking voters from her Facebook homepage.
Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) was also criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, the affordable postage and the Internet have a similar impact.
The number of newspapers in the country quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters were written to strongly criticize his leadership.
And even then, Washington had a flood monster against him anonymously.
People have written to the press using the pseudonyms of Eureka, Valerius, Belizarius, and Pocus, which have been harshly critical of Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by George Washington newspaper's online project, his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his attitude toward the British-signed treaty of friendship, commerce and shipping with the United States.
But he didn't make them cry.
Freedom of speech, freedom of dissent and freedom of speech are the foundation of this country.
The real leaders need to accept this.
The winds of the marketplace are shaking people's sensitive nerves.
The restricted purchase is a tough one for many urban real estate regulation policies.
In May 2017, Jinan introduced a provision that undergraduates pay for social security for six consecutive years and enjoy the same housing policy for residents living in the local permanent residence.
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that states that university students can be hired with a diploma and employment certificate within three years of graduation.
The policy was subsequently codified, with the official saying that students could buy a house at a price below the market price of 20%;
In July, Chengdu introduced a rule that young people with undergraduate and graduate degrees from foreign universities can apply for permanent residency only with a diploma.
In addition, cities and regions such as Kunsan, Shanghai and the port have introduced policies to reduce the threshold for talent acquisition.
Zhang Maong believes that this is actually the main meaning of these real estate policies, because the cities are competing for population, especially talent, and keeping the population, especially talent, and the cities are competitive.
Some even believe that this means that the time has come to lift the housing market cap on purchases of tickets.
The director of the film, Lwin Li, said that the filming plan had been in place for a long time, and that the first adaptation of the script was in 1999, and that he was even ready to find Golden City Wu to play the role of Wu 13.
Ron Lafferty looks forward to the feeling of being at home in the Renaissance Club
East Lothian Renaissance Club is hosting the 25th Scottish Open, and former European champion Ron Lafferty will feel at home for the next three days.
The Northern Irishman led his neighbour, Acherfield Lynx, to the final last year but lost to Paul Irs. He now works for the new venue as a tournament ambassador for the club's founder and CEO Jerry Salvati.
Rafferty: Well, I witnessed the founding of the Renaissance Club and we will witness its glory through this competition.
The athletes will see the best looks and best condition of the stadium.
Jerry is the one who created this place without precedent.
He is a passionate supporter of the competition and is very proud of his achievements here.
This is the best stage to showcase the stadium.
Englishman Ayres is looking forward to his first defence, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
The athlete from Shawspot said: "Oh, this is really special.
I didn't win the Estremadura Open because the race was cancelled the second year after I won.
It feels magical to come to this place.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories have been flashing back and for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was a special one for us.
It was a special memory that we will always remember.
Returning to his hometown, Gary Orr, who turned 50 earlier this year, also played on the European Tour.
This is his first Scottish tournament since the Scottish Open in 2013.
Heinzburg's Orr said: "It always makes more sense to play home games, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it.
You want to do well; but you can feel the extra pressure.
I'm really enjoying playing golf again, and I've been playing golf.
I am happy with the current situation.
The three players who joined the group were former Masters winners Ian Woosnann and regular-season champion Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark Maynutty.
Six Scottish players were in attendance, including two from O'Reilly and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, and four others were Andrew O'Donnell, Stephen McAllister, Bill Lowe and Ross Drummond.

In Beijing, Director of the Environmental Supervision Office of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, Liu Zhejiang, 22 introduced in August that 57 cases of continuous penalty cases were implemented nationwide, and the newly revised Environmental Protection Law of China, implemented earlier this year, clearly codifies China's environmental enforcement power.
Currently, environmental protection authorities across China can use punitive measures such as daily penalties, seizures, production cuts and administrative detention to detect environmental violations and cooperate with judicial authorities to punish environmental crimes.
In August, a total of 335 searches and seizures were carried out in China; 177 cases of child-limiting and child-sharing were carried out; 189 administrative detentions were transferred and 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution crimes were transferred.
Of these, Henan has implemented seven consecutive penalties per day, and China is currently fully embedding, comprehensive, reinforced environmental pollution governance from end-to-end control.
Although the downward pressure is apparent, the Ministry of Environmental Protection has already made clear that China should correctly handle environmental protection's position in economic development, strengthen the green tensile strength of the chain, and the slower the economic growth, the more it cannot relax environmental protection, and play the optimal role of environmental protection in the economy.

Chinese Communist Party and World Party Top Dialogue Speak
Zhejiang Province has been strongly encouraging the spirit of the Red Boat, with steadfast action, to keep the work ahead of the times.
When the new batches of water were collected, the mother and her colleagues were immediately busy.
The report also highlights the importance of the new rules.
This year, they are working to tackle the issue of smart management of rural wastewater.
How to manage it is actually a very serious challenge.
The Institute of Ecological Environment at Zhejiang Qinghua Chengdu Institute is located in the heart of the Red Boat Spirit.
The first is that the company is a real estate company.
The Zhejiang Qinghua Triangle Institute has developed into a three-state innovation platform with nearly 400 overseas students who are concentrating on regional innovation in Zhejiang.
The Red Boat Spirit is a force we must follow and understand, and innovation is hard.
Every innovation here
The point is that you have to keep going, and you are going to keep going, and you are going to keep going.
The people went up the door, now they go up and down, so that's what I say.
Doing something for the people
As of now, through this method, the Yangtze region has collected a total of 5985 problems, of which 38668 have been solved and 1496 are being addressed.
The main thing that we have in Zhejiang is that we have a saying:
The geographical advantage is less than the strength of the cadres, the policy advantage is less than the quality of service, and the spirit of dedication of the Red Boat inspires us to push forward, and to be more effective in this.
Courage to Fight
Recently, 19 representatives of the Chinese Cultural Organization and well-known artists from the arts community have been sent to preach the 19 great spirits in Myanmar, the state of Hlong Kong, Gansu, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Guangzhou.
They explored the new cultural mission of the 19 great minds of Chinese artists in the grassroots art museums, local academies and some universities in Inner Mongolia, the Yellow River, and Gansu.
I am so proud and happy that I am willing to go down and down again and write the fate of the little people of the old age.
I think that the idea of a new way of doing things is to make the world a better place.
The popularity of the arts is now very high and there is something about it.
The first is the "Sweetness of the World".
It should be rooted in the ground, deepened in life, and then made with a certain cultural thickness, positive upward, while having lasting artistic charm.
The total number of projects has reached 28 and the total area of the project is 15.2 million metric tons, of which 11.1 million metric tons have been completed.
The report to the Central State Council of the Party of the Republic of China (CPS) has been completed in seven provinces, including Sichuan, which account for 82% of the land area for two-wheeled families.
The country's contractual validation is expected to be completed by the end of the year
In the future, the Ministry of Agriculture will explore the real results
The first star in the Chinese space science satellite series and the world's first dark matter particle detector to probe the satellite.
In the space of nearly two years, four scans of the entire sky space have detected more than 3.5 billion high-energy particles, giving the world's most accurate measurements.
The results of the study were published in the international academic journal Nature's Nature.
In space, we observe something new that has never been observed before, something that cannot be explained and explained using the existing theory.
The results of this research are of multiple meanings, and most importantly, it shows that Chinese scientists are using cutting-edge technology.
The ability to make scientific instruments to detect a very difficult scientific problem.
The first time I saw a Chinese toilet, I was in the bathroom in the last century.
And it's also incorporated into more and more human design.
The bathroom is very nice and has a nice atmosphere and is very pleasant to the visitors.
Now you don't have to go to the bathroom with your nose.
The software is not only changing the hardware, but also the software.
Tourism sector demands that the toilets in the tourist areas be equipped with toilet paper and hand sanitizer
But in some areas
Is it because of the uncivilized behavior of individuals that this public service is stopped?
The decision was made by the managers in different places
The government is also working to promote savings through civilization, while technological innovation is also being pursued.
Public toilets in Nanjing, Guangzhou and other cities in Jiangsu
If you brush your face for three seconds, you get a free piece of paper, but if you want to get a double, it takes ten minutes or more.
Avoiding the Misuse of Public Resources
It's a habit that some tourists may be thinking about taking the paper back, but on the other hand we also have to think about it.
The next toilet we have to go to is without paper, so this is something we have highlighted in our new three-year plan.
The problem is that the government is not doing enough to solve this imbalance.
To push the toilet revolution deeper is to think more about what the masses think.
The third toilet should be available, so that families can accompany the elderly and children to the toilet.
We brought babies and boys to the bathroom and we were not happy to go in with them.
The little girl in the kitchen seems to know a little embarrassing, and the board is particularly comfortable, convenient for us to carry children with us.
People feel civilization and become the builders of civilization. In the countryside, villagers in the Gwangsi River pond are building new baths in their homes.
The fact that the toilet revolution has been proactively promoted has been very effective, not only helping people to avoid diseases, but also driving economic development and reducing regional development gaps.
The problem of the toilet is a general problem, a node in the development of social problems.
It is a national civilization project, guided by the state from the point of view of the state, and then from different levels of participation in all aspects to solve small social problems.
This is how we complete all our shortcuts.
With the recent start of construction of the Irrigation District of the Yellow River, 14 major water projects have been started in the country this year.

The first railway line of the Yellow River was opened to traffic on the same day.
The tunnel is 3.7 km long and will be built directly through the Yellow River to connect the main city of Jinan.

This is the world's first company to develop and manufacture educational robots, after graduating from the University of Xue, 23 years old.
He decided to come to Shanghai and within six months he had his own team.
My dream is to create a robot that can help others.
The robot needs a motor, a pump, and then a controller, and now it can all be developed by itself.
The introduction of a preferential policy in Shanghai

In the process of innovation, there are many disadvantages.
The bees are emitting their energy.
In the new era, technological innovation is becoming more and more possible
The Institute of Microsatellite Innovation at the Shanghai Institute of Technology is a pioneer in satellite technology research in China.
The goal of doing something new is to make the task a new choice.
The average age of researchers at the Institute of Microsatellite Innovation is only 31.
Five more satellites will be launched in the near future
The whole range of innovations from materials, devices to components has led to the transformation of the upgrading of China's manufacturing industry chain.
The 19th report clearly states that China has entered a new era and that the standard of power I personally believe is to lead.
You know, all the satellites that we've launched so far, all the satellites that we've launched at our little satellite lab, are groundbreaking, and we're not going to follow the path of others, and we're not going to go after others.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia
Badina Daje does not use the stove when cooking.
She rarely even uses a pumpkin.
Her wooden house is located in Enarotari, the capital of Panay Province, Papua, Indonesia, and the housewife usually simply puts a redhead, which the locals call a "notch" redhead, directly into the fire.
After half an hour, the burnt red chicken was quickly taken out by a pair of unwashed hands and eaten by the wolves.
Daisy sits on the mud and she is unfurnished, and this is where she does her daily household chores, such as washing clothes, washing the clothes with the water, all from the nearby swamp.
In a room without a roof, there is a bathroom.
She was the youngest of four wives, so she was not assigned to the fields to care for her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late is dangerous: most of the men in the village are out of work, and many are as dirty as mud, plus there are many soldiers here.
She said: "No one dares to walk around the village after 5 pm.
This is a rare occurrence in the daily life of the Babu Highlands, a former Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after a referendum in 1969, but was also controversial when only 1026 chiefs were forced to vote by hand in front of the occupying army.
The current movement for independence and opposition to Dutch rule is soon turning its sights on the Jakarta government, which has imposed a high-pressure regime on the region, isolating foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially split into the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
The remote, smoky location of Enarotalli requires a 90-minute flight from the provincial assembly of Chiappara to Nabireh, a five-hour rental car ride across the river from the city.
There is no public transportation.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the wooden roofs are surrounded by bamboo tiles, and the iron leather roofs are made of various types of yellowish-orange covers made of iron tiles.
There are few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Mei Pago Babians believed in a god named Uga Tamee.
The government has also made other changes.
Daisy said we're not used to wearing these clothes. She was referring to her brightly colored hand-woven headscarf, dark shirt and bright half-shorts.
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line and the highest infant mortality and lowest literacy rates in Asia.
But here is also Indonesia's gold.
Panay County is located at an elevation of about the same area as New Jersey, with 153,000 people. The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, the Glasgow Gold Mine, is only 60 miles away and is owned by Penn City-based Philip McMoran Copper Gold Company.
In 2015 alone, Philips mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper in the area.
In addition, Papua's timber resources are rich, estimated to be worth $78 billion.
However, these rich resources are also the source of the tragedy of the Babai people, and the powerful Indonesian military forces have been able to suppress them.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation report, Philip paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 per officer.
The Barbarian demands for independence were increasingly strong, threatening the gold lord and causing them to suffer cruel treatment.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Barbadians have been killed since 1969, and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by Indonesian forces.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the 1970s in the highlands of the Babua tribe have escalated to genocide.
In the past year alone, Indonesian police have arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane said we would lose everything, including evidence of the infamous killings of the previous year, such as extrajudicial killings, torture, and another report that rape and electrocution were particularly commonplace, and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
According to Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch, the number of victims is difficult to count because gang violence is happening every day.
The repression began with the arrival of large numbers of migrants from outside Indonesia.
While 83% of the province's 3.5 million people are Christian, the population has changed since Muslim economic migrants arrived from the densely populated islands of Java, Garimandandand, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese snacks sell fried pasta and vegetable-mixed cardamom with peanut butter.
The local people struggle.
Apos Yu, a 24-year-old from Paniay, who moved to Chiapra, a provincial assembly, to find work, explains that the migrants began selling chicken and vegetables at lower prices than the local Babai people in traditional markets.
This has led to the loss of markets for local Babua women (mama-mama).
Indonesian President Zoko Vidodo (often referred to as Zokowi) vowed to address inequality and abuse of power in Papua during his 2014 campaign.
The former carpenter, who was on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, has been supported by 27 of the 29 districts, including Paniyeh.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
In 2014, we voted for Zokovy, hoping that he would fulfill our wish to restore justice.
In fact, only two months after Zokovy took office in October, Panay experienced his worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotali were singing Christmas carols in front of a fire outside, when two Indonesian soldiers suddenly came by on motorcycles.
The children were shocked and told to turn on the headlights.
According to the local priest, Ayutthaya Tbey, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses claimed that the drunk soldiers used their guns to chase the children.
Then one of the soldiers shot the children.
In the early 1990s, the younger Julianus Yemin, 16, was severely beaten and passed out.
Hours later, the building of the Election Commission of the nearby governmental body caught fire and the following day the incident escalated.
About 1,000 young Barbadian men, women and children gathered in front of a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They were used to perform ceremonial bows, dancing around the circle, and imitating the bird's nest, dancing the waita of the Babulian Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the military, often with a whistle.
According to an official document seen by the Time magazine, when the mood continued to intensify, soldiers received orders via internal radio: "If the crowd resisted more than three times, shoot immediately".
Jeremiah Kaiaumi, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotaly, who felt that something dangerous was about to happen, called on the crowd to calm down and begged them to go home.
But no one was willing to listen to him.
He stood on the porch of his brightly colored wooden house and told the Times of India magazine that when I turned around, my left wrist suddenly shot.
Kaiaumi still doesn't know who fired the shot, but he says the bullets came from among the soldiers who had gathered.
He also said that the crowd was crowded and they fired a lot of guns.
According to local sources, he witnessed the shooting and saw three guns in the body of Orpheus Euler.
Eugen told Time magazine in a sad tone that Eugen had run past to check his body to see if he was the one.
I found out he was dead... and I kissed him.
Papua Police Inspector General Juergen Mende told reporters that his subordinates were only protecting the police station after the police station was attacked.
In 2015, Papua Police spokesman, Police Chief Pujjo Sulisto, said that when someone threatens to kill us, we must defend ourselves.
It's a matter of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and more injured.
The news of the killing spread slowly in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Zokovy gave a loud and vocal speech in Chaipura, expressing his deep sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the abuse of power in the historical legacy of Papua.
He said, "I hope this case is resolved as soon as possible so that this does not happen again in the future".
In October 2016, Minister of Security Villardo said he would set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuse for the push came up almost immediately.
He said that most of the attacks on the shark occurred long ago.
Some of them were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have been working to address these violations, but it takes a process.
Then, on June 5th, in Jakarta, Vilanto spoke to the Times of Bahia magazine, saying that he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
He said that everything will be settled according to the law.
The United Nations has already filed a lawsuit against Vilanto over the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the bloody 1999 East Timorese independence vote, but he says 11 human rights violations in the Papua region have been resolved, including the Panyai case.
The family of the victims of the Panay incident took a breath away from the comments.
Eugenides said that I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but nothing has improved at all.
After years, he said he was tired of me.
He still lives in fear.
He said, "Oh, I'm scared.
I was afraid of being arrested by the army, I was afraid of being shot.
His brother Yuccabus also said that the people of Panipat were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said that after the body was buried, the military came to me.
The shooting has not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Deai County, near Panay, Indonesia.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a coma man to the hospital, and the two sides clashed, killing one and injuring 17 others, including children.
Lavianus Durwood, 24, drowned while fishing in a nearby river and died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested outside the company's local office.
Police said villagers threw stones at police, so police fired a warning.
But the anti-riot mobile force (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one person.
Domingulu Bady, 29, told Time magazine that Mom and I were all panicked and now fearful of retaliation.
I've been hiding at home for two days.
The DAI Parliament has called for the police to be brought to justice and the anti-riot mobile forces to evacuate the area.
The Indonesian government has always considered Panay a no-man's land.
The lack of effective development has fueled discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who are scattered in the central highlands of Panay-Tulp.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the Papua people by hijacking Indonesian soldiers through scattered attacks and raids.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Panipat, including Tadyuus Yugi and Daniel Yudas Kocaja.
As a result, thousands of Panayis have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military in recent years in the guise of maintaining the sovereignty of the country.
Some of them have never appeared.
In the eyes of the Bavarians, Panique was a place of forgotten tragedy.
Poverty has created discontent.
The people of Enarotaly are poor and cannot afford rice.
The bread is not far from reaching.
They planted everything they could eat, mostly red peppers and some fruits and vegetables with leaves.
Farming is a woman's job, and each woman can take care of four or five pieces of red grain land.
They usually leave most of their crops to the writers, and the rest to the local market.
The ten pieces of red rice are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has been drawn between local Babuans and new immigrants, and the number of these immigrants has increased dramatically since the opening of the new route to Nabireh Airport.
The small number of jobs that exist usually fall into the hands of better educated and wealthier immigrants.
The Barbarian people have few funds or skills to run competitive companies.
John Gobey, the president of the Panay Tribal Council, said that young people do not want to stay in the village... because there is no work and no money.
The country is isolated from the rest of the world.
The reporting of the international media remains tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudie and Basel Ronsan were expelled from Papua for refusing to cooperate with the authorities, even though they had rarely received a filming license.
According to Human Rights Watch's Deputy Director for Asia, Phillim Kane, Zokovy's revoking of the reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development in elections was not met.
In a statement, he said that if foreign journalists try to report on the most eastern Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua, they are at a new risk: refusal of visas and blacklisting.
The lack of media surveillance means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the neighbouring country of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries, including Tonga, Honduras, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands, requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the widespread human rights violations in Papua New Guinea, including the Panyai shooting.
The two countries also supported the Free Papua Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arman Nata Nasir, who is not concerned about the allegations against the group, told reporters in Jakarta that Indonesia still has a democratic system and media freedom, so evidence of human rights violations is difficult to cover up.
The local people want more attention from foreign governments.
According to a source, on May 4, when Dutch human rights ambassador Kaas Van Bal led a delegation of officials to visit Chiapra, the local people broke their silence and shouted for freedom.
The next presidential election will be held in 2019, but the Babua people say they are unlikely to vote for Djokovic again.
Goby, the tribal council president, said that Djokovic's intentions were good, but that all those around him were involved in the Panyai shooting.
He wanted to let Zokovy know that the people of Panay are not only living under the threat of a greedy army, but also that education is scarce and public health services are scarce in the region.
Gobai said the people of Paniay, like other Babuans, thought that voting for Zokovi was a debt he had to pay.
He said, "Oh, they don't need money, they need justice".
Even under threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Panyai shooting continued to carry out their last symbolic rebellion: burying a victim's body across the street from the military police station.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they will not let the guilty forget their crimes.
Eucarbus nodded and said that my family had been killed.
What else can we do?

The fire again engulfs the Dubai Tower
On Friday, a fire in Dubai's tallest residential building forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-high, 79-story building.
This was the second major fire in just two years to sweep through a high-rise building, and happened to be in a skyscraper known as the Torch Tower.
The building has been evacuated, no injuries were reported, and the cause of the fire has not yet been determined.
We were asleep, and then we were awakened by a fire alarm, and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from 50 floors, a resident named George told Reuters.
The fire department extinguished the fire around 4 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and is currently cooling the building, according to the Dubai Civil Defence Authority.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The accident could again raise concerns around the world about the safety of the use of exterior wall materials in high-rise buildings.
An investigation by the administration of the Monument after its 2015 fire found that the majority of the damaged objects were covered wall panels for decoration and insulation.
Police have said they believe problems with the insulation and roofing systems at the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
Williams's carrier also hinted that Massa might return, even though he had already announced his retirement.
The Korean Olympic Winter Games are set to open on January 9, just one month before the start of the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and the atmosphere of the Games is intensifying as the Olympic flame is transmitted from the south to the north.
South Korean commentators are looking forward to this long-running Korean-Korean meeting, which could bring a month's worth of eggshells to the Pyongyang Winter Olympics.
On November 1, the Pyongyang Olympic Winter Games came to South Korea.
The excitement of the St. Turin event was directly reflected in the ticket sales for the Pyongyang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the Pyongyang Olympic ticket sales were only 32%, while the Pyongyang Olympic ticket sales were only 4.3%, and the low ticket sales were once a source of concern for the popularity of the Pyongyang Olympic Games.
But as the chairman of the Pyongyang Olympic Committee, Li Feng-fan, recently predicted to reporters, the heat of the Winter Olympics is rising as the fireworks are being spread throughout South Korea, and he believes ticket sales will soon turn around.
According to South Korean media, as of January 3, ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics have reached 64%, and the ticket sales rate for the Winter Paralympics have surpassed 50%.
To encourage foreigners to visit South Korea, the Ministry of Justice of South Korea announced on 8th that foreigners visiting South Korea to watch the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics will be allowed to stay in South Korea for a maximum of 120 days.
The survey found that more than one-fifth of U.S. travelers carry illegal items on board
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20% of passengers had deliberately or unintentionally carried illegal items through the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration to check their boarding stations, and at least 6% of passengers had accidentally boarded with prohibited tools or other blade-bearing items.
Less than 1 percent of passengers claimed they had not travelled with guns, ammunition or explosives until after the accident.
The survey of more than 1,000 people conducted by the charter carrier Stratos Jet Charters Inc. found that young travelers are more likely to ignore regulations.
19.7% of respondents who admitted to intentionally trying to carry TSA on board were Millennials, compared to less than 15% of Gen X.
The most common items that TSA security personnel intentionally collect are food and beverages.
More than 3% of respondents admitted to deliberately carrying a blade through security, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also said they deliberately carried illegal drugs on board.
The company said the survey was conducted to determine the number of people who accidentally and intentionally carried the prohibited cargo through the airplane.
It is no surprise that those who are most likely to fly with smuggled goods through security checks, whether intentionally or unintentionally, are the ones who fly the most frequently.
However, the company notes that TSA guidelines are somewhat complex and difficult to understand.
It is often uncertain what type of fluid or how much fluid can be carried.
It is no wonder that the TSA has captured the most illegal liquids.
It was once thought that the TSA might also have banned books.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry them.
US Environmental Protection Agency Director Prut changed his mind about Obama-era emissions cuts
After a day of prosecution by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Prutte reversed his earlier decision to postpone the Obama-era implementation of regulations to reduce smoke-emitting air pollutants.
Proud proposed the change because the EPA was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state environmental regulators than previous governments.
He did not mention the legal challenges raised by the Federal Court of Appeal against his former position.
The focus of the dispute is to set a deadline for states to start implementing the 2015 ground ozone standard on October 1.
In June, Proud announced he would delay the program for about a year to allow the EPA more time to study the program, to avoid interfering with local decision-making or hampering economic growth.
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Pratt was the Attorney General of Oklahoma, and has long opposed stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Proud has repeatedly turned to restrict or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is one of the latest legal obstacles to the return of Prut's regulation to the agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency director had delayed the implementation of the Obama administration's requirement that oil and gas companies monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Proudhon expressed his strong reaction to the Ozone Standards, saying he was committed to strengthening the EPA's commitment to cooperate with states to develop complex procedures to achieve new standards.
Prut said that under previous government administration, the EPA would usually not meet the deadline, then wait for the activists and others to sue and agree to a deadline agreed to by agreement.
The court also ruled that the lawsuit was not a legal one, and that the deadline was not a legal one.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously.
Nevertheless, the EPA's statement said that Prut may again use his patent extension and all other legally available patent licenses to ensure that the regulations are in line with the best available policies and information.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a sweeping overhaul of the ozone layer regulations.
The House Bill, which was approved last month, aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who leads the state coalition, this week sued the EPA, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's backlash is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, whose communities are directly affected by the smoke emissions, after we filed the lawsuit.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia joined the ranks of New York to participate in the case.
Ground ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants emitted by automobiles, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources to the atmosphere under sunlight.
The smoke from the smoke causes severe respiratory problems for sensitive people, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered for Prut's amazing transformation.
Laurie Ann Bird, of the Center for Biodiversity, said: "What is disturbing about the common sense is that this measure is under a lot of pressure from the department that protects the air we breathe.
We must fight the Trump administration to fight the mind-set movement to address polluters and special interest groups.

In the past two years, the planting area of the plant has expanded to 30,000 tons, reaching a total area of 180,000 tons; while actively developing beyond the zone, the plant is now building up to 80,000 tons of planting bases across the country, an increase of 30,000 tons from 2008.
The quality of seedlings is constantly improving, the value of the crop is increasing, the large-scale, high-quality seedlings are more and some of the seedlings are being sold.
He also reminded that in the face of the current booming market, producers should calmly face, objective analysis, and see that society's demand for flowers will be long-term and increasing, while also recognizing that the market competition will be more intense.
In the early morning news of July 13, Beijing time, US company Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the East Texas District Court alleging that Apple infringed on a patent for its 2010 application for a battery technology.
The company has previously filed similar patent lawsuits against Huawei, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.
The lawsuit alleges that the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices infringe US patent 7,657,386, which is known as the Silicon Integrated Battery Service System.
The plaintiff wishes to obtain compensation in cash or to collect a patent fee for infringement equipment after the verdict is announced.
From the prosecution's judgment, the plaintiff appears to believe that the iPhone's fast charging capability violates the company's patent.
The fast charging iPhone will quickly charge to 80% of the power, and then charge with a stream of hydrogen.
Somaltus is actually a so-called Silicon Patent Flow because the company does not offer obvious products and services and it is difficult to find relevant information online.
However, they have managed to reach an out-of-court settlement on the patent with car manufacturers such as Ford and Nissan.

According to leaked phone records, Trump has pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post leaked a record of US President Donald Trump's phone calls with Mexican and Australian leaders.
On January 27, in a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The US president reportedly expressed his displeasure over his public attack on the wall, alleging that Trump had told him: "Oh, you shouldn't tell the media".
Trump pledged to build a wall on the southern border of the United States during his presidential campaign and announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
His phone records with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, which showed tense interactions between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal for the United States to take refugees to Australia was a ridiculous hoax, a disgusting hoax and a stupid hoax, that he had suggested the United States ban refugee resettlement and now holds on to the Obama administration's whimsical deal that would make him look like a fool.

Moreno massacre: activists repeat racist genocide and justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car was driving through the small town of Monroe, Georgia, with a group of spectators running towards the small Moreton Bridge.
The car, carrying four black passengers and a white driver, was approached by a group of white men with guns before reaching the bridge and blocking the road.
The gang's head - a middle-aged man in a thin striped suit - was in a cigarette and staring into a storm glass.
The passengers in the car are full of fear.
Oh, we want it - Roger! Oh, that guy is screaming.
Mom dragged him out of the car!
A young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat, screaming and breaking his silence.
Fortunately, the terrible scene on July 22 was just a repeat.
However, when Roger Pan's necklace was put on the back of the neck, almost all the surrounding audience gave a genuine sigh.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moran Bridge, reenacting scenes of two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Marcon and George and Murray Dorothy - who were lynched by the K-Party that night in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
While we know who they are, and although we have seen them in the community, they have not been arrested in years, it is incredible, says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the replay.
Oh, this is the stain of history, the burden of our souls.
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia state legislator and lifelong rights activist.
For him, the reenactment is a remarkable call to action that reminds the people of the Monroe community every year that injustice has never been rectified.
"We want to sue, we want to settle, we want to heal, we want to reconcile, but we must first get justice", he said.
The first is that we are not going to be able to heal and reconcile unless we are being justified.
On July 27, 1946, the coroner's office placed a sheet over the body of a Moroccan murder victim.
According to FBI files obtained by the US National Broadcasting Corporation, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in the murder.
But none of them have been prosecuted.
While the suspects have been in a state of remoteness for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motives for the execution are well known throughout the town: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote in the primary for the first time later that summer.
According to FBI statistics, around the same time, black farmer Roger Malcolm assassinated a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight - apparently for a woman.
Brooks said the town was rumored that Hurst slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, whose baby was not her husband.
The FBI reported that on July 25, 1946, prominent white landowner Roy Harrison spent $600 to bail Malcolm out.
Dorothy and her cousins Mae Merry and George Dorsey accompanied him to prison.
But when they returned from the prison, and were about to reach Moreno Bridge, a mob surrounded the car.
The FBI reported that Harrison had organized and ordered the murder, and concluded that the murder was committed by the FBI.
It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement agencies that not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of witnesses.
Brooks is very clear about this.
He said, "Oh, this is a disaster of voting rights".
The murderers sent a message to the black people in the community: "Oh, if you register and vote, you will end up with the same thing".
For the past decade, Cassandra Green has been responsible for leading the annual reenactment of the Moran Bridge massacre.
Her performance was vivid, catchy, and had a deeply racist background. Many people hope that racism will no longer exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, not harder, but Green says that's the key.
"We don't want to talk about the death penalty because it makes us face the ugliness of everyone", she said.
But if you don't listen to me or tell me about my experience, I can't have a relationship with you.
The first day of the show, which began in June, saw nearly 30 actors - dozens of white and black - gather in a room to listen to Green's rehearsal.
Wade Malone is the co-director of Green.
He has been playing the role of the Three K Party for years, but he says this role has never been easy.
I feel dirty because I'm not that kind of person, says Ms. Malone.
But I think it's important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to that era.
In the room, actors Darius Bradshore and Nick Lascona, playing Roger Malcolm and Barnet Hearst, rehearse their lyrics.
When the play began, Malcolm shouted and pushed Hester away, becoming angry with his wife Dorothy for sleeping with him.
Oh, I said, "Roll my plate!"
Lascona is back.
And then they started.
Then everyone -- at least all the black actors -- burst out laughing.
Green laughed the loudest.
"What's wrong?" asked Lascona.
He was terrified and confused.
Am I acting too much?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not
I just don't think white people say "hey" when they fight back.
And yes, there is another black actor playing the joke.
You have to be tough to speak.
The energy in the room changed; the feeling of friendship drove away the discomfort.
Everyone is trying to do this, not only to perform the play, but also to remember the four victims.
The scene begins again.
This time, Lascona spoke the word "oh" with a sharp and powerful tone.
There is no laughing room.
The re-enactment ended strongly and quickly.
The screams, the gunshots, and then, there's silence.
A woman in a black funeral dress stands beside the actor's body, singing Billy Halley's condolence for the strange fruit of the vine.
She was a voice that overwhelmed other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators were wiping their sweat and tears.
The audience was almost half black and half white.
A couple of people from the New York City area, Isaac, came to see the show, and many more people lived near the road.
Brooks takes them to the graveyard of Malcolm and Dorothy, a nearly eight-hour drive away, where they all endure the uncomfortable humid heat of Georgia.
The murderer was still a fan until now, but now, standing on the same ground as the massacre, there is anxiety in the air.
When the last note of the song disappeared, Green asked people to come closer to check the bodies of the actors.
The children bowed their heads and looked at the fake blood and bodies, whispering to each other.
They were not really dead, and a little boy was talking like he was reminding himself.
After a few minutes, Green thanked the crowd and the show ended.
The actors opened the death rope and wiped their tears.
Brad Shaw embraces the male Malone in the three-K party headliner suit.
Nick Lascona hugged two of his colleagues, crying in their arms; the emotion in the performance eventually infected him.
It's okay, one of the women said, "No".
Oh, we know your heart isn't like that.
You do this for a reason.
Afterwards, the audience sat down to eat dinner with the actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted intimately with a black couple they had just met and talked about the reenactment.
In the film, she is portrayed as a young woman who is forced to live in a house where her father is a criminal.
It's hard to imagine the horrible words and actions that people like you say and do because they look like you, Mom said.
To me, this really makes me think that the lynching is still going on, and she added that it is now simply called police shooting.
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sits at the table watching, tasting and smelling civil rights.
He said he had already started planning to perform next year.
The reenactment of the film is an inspiring way to describe the horrors we've been through, but it's also very educational, he said.
If you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not study, who do not understand their own history, are doomed to repeat this.
The importance of the reform of the pipeline's independent pipeline is obvious for the reform of the gas market, but there is also a lot of resistance and controversy.

Chinese Air Force Engineering University scientists study laser satellite for space waste
According to the US media, Chinese scientists have proposed a bold innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up the messy Earth orbit and destroy old satellites and their sky debris.
According to the US-based Sun News Weekly Sun website, on January 15, researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper titled Sunrise Laser Removal Small Scale Space Fragment Transformation Model Study of Sunrise, which described how space fragments can be reduced to smaller, less harmful fragments by laser radiation using a Sunrise Platform Laser.
Space junk has been a concern of the International Space Agency for years, and the U.S. Space Agency has considered multiple options for tracking, detecting and removing man-made debris.
Methods for removing large-scale space debris include a huge web of waste to be cleaned and collected, and magnets that can be used to remove them from orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted laser simulation studies and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean Earth's orbit.
The paper's abstract is: "The simulation study provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris removal technology to the ground-based platforms".
A 2014 study by US defense giant Lockheed Martin found that about 200 threats per day occur for satellites that are in orbit.
High-speed debris along Earth's orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions, described by experts at the European Space Agency as a series of deadly threats.
According to the January 17 issue of the American magazine, Space is essentially empty, but space near Earth is becoming increasingly crowded. Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris that runs around the Earth, and over time, it will pile up.
The more debris, the more likely it is that a satellite that is still in normal operation will be hit by debris, damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of dollars.
The report said that all space agencies have plans to clear space garbage in the future.
NASA is considering reducing the speed of the debris by jumping gas to remove it from orbit, Europe is considering launching a satellite with a large net to capture the debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan is thinking of using an electrical chain to capture the debris.
Now China is proposing a way to tackle space junk, which is to use a large laser to shed floating space junk into less harmful pieces.
According to a paper published in the German journal Fluorescent Optics Monthly by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University, installing a laser on a satellite would clean space efficiently enough, at least according to the simulation results.
The only way to confirm its effectiveness is to test, which is not yet scheduled, but it is possible that early on or late on someone will install a laser on the satellite and send it into space.
Once we do this, we can finally start to eliminate space junk once and for all.

According to reporters, the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State (IS) in the Karabakh region are increasingly raising serious concerns about NATO forces stationed near Baghdad.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, while the capital accounted for about 20 percent of the death toll.
At least 30 people were killed in a suicide car bomb attack in a Shiite-dominated area of Kabul in late July.
The Taliban claimed to have launched the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in downtown Kabul killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since the overthrow of the Taliban by US-led multinational forces in 2001.
The violence highlights the security situation surrounding the country as President Donald Trump weighs whether to increase troops in Afghanistan to support its troops and police.
The suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also sparked a crisis of public confidence in the government and its policies, especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani, according to reporters.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) overturns the resolution, delaying the smoking regulations after a lawsuit
During his tenure, Obama made provisions requiring states to curb all types of smoke-induced emissions, and 15 states filed lawsuits against the U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency for that purpose. The EPA overturned the rule a day after the indictment.
The EPA announced Wednesday its decision to continue the implementation of the so-called Ozone Layer 2015 Ozone Layer and pledged to work with states.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement that we are confident in the dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to it.
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA plans to delay implementation of the Ozone Layer Standard until October 2018, a one-year delay - a measure of existing smoke pollution in some areas to determine which areas should reduce emissions of smoke to meet air quality standards.
Fifteen major Democratic states and the District of Columbia filed lawsuits against the practice on Tuesday, declaring it illegal.
As part of a broader agenda, the administration of President Donald Trump has been working to restore various environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama to stimulate economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups, who fear that more emissions will affect public health.
The US Environmental Protection Agency's website claims that breathing oxygenated air can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma.

Mackey Garcia and Vasily Romchenko meet for the first time to discuss the possible future of the final
The most notable under 147 pound boxing match will be held shortly afterwards, with Vasily Romatchenko and Mackey Garcia meeting for the first time on Thursday, while they are currently in a potentially conflict situation.
They were in a separate room at the ESPN office in Los Angeles, where the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia walked down the hall to greet World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion Lomachenko.
In Saturday's Showtime boxing match, the referee unanimously confirmed that Garcia had won the quarterfinals by defeating World Champion Adrian Bruner, who had both been ranked in the top five of the same weight class.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said: "Champion, are you okay?"
I wish you good luck.
In the 7pm ESPN game on Saturday, Romatchenko beat Miguel Mariaga to retain his position.
When they were both photographing, Agis Klimas, a Romatchino agent, noted that the potential confrontation between the two players depended on the perfect size of the ball.
The first time I was a lightweight, said Benghazi.
I was upgraded to fight Bruno, 140 pounds, but I didn't weigh that much.
I'm a little weaker than 140 pounds.
I want to go back to the lightweight level.
He must reach a lightweight weight of 135 pounds, and then we can fight.
This is what fans want.
We'll meet them.
Romchenko agreed to this.
The world of boxing needs this fight.
Klimas asked if he should be paid in installments, and his part of the strategy was to have Lomachenko make his debut later this year against a 135-pound player, hoping to set a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 elimination). Garcia was also interested in a match against the winner of the fight against Holger Linares-Luc Campbell after the September 23 Forum lightweight boxing match.
The fight may be a pay-per-view, as all fans are asking the question, said Gangascia. He later expressed his openness to the competition on the network that offers the best financial solutions.
We are the main characters.
The other side of the coin is not likely to generate this much attention.
As long as they're ready...
Garcia appreciated Lomachenko's excellent bowling ability and could watch his boxing match on Saturday.
However, Romatchenko was reluctant to praise Garcia, saying he thought the third-tier champion from Riverside looked slow.
Garcia said the focus was on showing the strength of the fist, and then the fight.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their own boxing match.
And the people of the country are not going to fight.
The focus and enthusiasm of the match were unmatched by any other boxing event.
I am very happy to participate, says Bengascia.
Romchenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, this time it's Mickey's turn".
It will be a great battle.

The Chinese Development and Reform Commission officials' comments on the early completion of the 11th-15 emission reduction target have given the steel industry, which is being squeezed by the power limit, strong rebound expectations.
While the steel mills have not received a clear notification from the local government that the energy-saving work has been completed, industry estimates that around December 15, 2010, steel plants in various parts of the world that were previously restricted to production will continue to be re-produced, steel prices will continue to rise or will begin to suffer pressure.
No notification has yet been received of the end of the production of the limited power, but in fact the pressure on the companies is much greater than in September and October, a private steel company in Hebei province told reporters.
Several parts of Hebei have repeatedly lowered the electricity production limitation document and once adopted a forced drawdown method to limit enterprise production.
The reporter learned from local businesses that the vast majority of steel plants in Hebei have been rebuilt and production pressure has been reduced.
My steel network analyst Zhang Tian-san expects that as the northern hemisphere enters winter, the demand for terminal building steel will gradually decline from strength to strength.
The government has also announced that the steel industry will be fully restored after the end of the energy-saving phase, and that most steel plants will be fully restored by December 15 and products will be available in all markets by New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put some pressure on the current booming steel prices.

International Online News (Reporter's Note) On 18th, the Italian Embassy in China held a China-Italy Environmental Affairs Dialogue, where business and research institutions from both countries exchanged views on the new situation and reached a positive consensus on cooperation in the field of renewable resources between the two countries.
It is reported that China is represented by mainly China Renewable Resources Development Limited, China's international technology transfer cooperation network, and China is represented by the Global Energy Environment Exchange Organization, the Italian Federation of Enterprises of the Bologna metropolitan area.
The Italian representative said that Italy has a wide range of environmental protection technologies and solutions in the field of renewable resources, and proposed pilot projects with China in the three areas of industrial waste treatment, waste oil treatment and waste incineration treatment equipment, while looking forward to extending its experience of environmental cooperation with China to other parts of the world.
The latest results of the Swedish refugee age assessment test are published
The Swedish refugee testing uses the latest methods to assess their age from a medical point of view, and the latest results show that over 80% of respondents are determined to be over 18, but not everyone believes its accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (Rttsmedicinalverket) began testing this test earlier this year.
The Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) has designed these tests to provide a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process after it was found that some of the claimed minors were unable to assess their age.
So far, the Swedish Immigration Agency has sent 6880 test subjects, and the Forensic Center has published the results of a total of 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
80% of the subjects were determined to be 18 years of age or older, but in 25 other tests, the Swedish National Center for Forensic Medicine determined that the subjects were 18 years of age or older.
In 432 tests, the result was that the person may not have been 18 years old.
The test is only for people with age-doubts.
According to John Glanton of the Center for Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with those of the previous few months.
He told The Local: "These figures are not very different from the previous months, and the numbers are very similar.
The high proportion of cases where the age of 18 or older is determined does not necessarily mean that the refugees have lied about their age.
In May, the center released 581 test results and said 442 cases showed that the subjects were 18 years of age or older.
The Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet surveyed 581 test results published this year, and found that 243 of the subjects had publicly stated that they would be 18 years old this year.
X-ray examinations of the brain, nuclear magnetic resonance scans of the joints, and analysis by dentists and radiologists are questionable in some areas.
One of the suspects is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of Caroline College, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they experience puberty earlier or later than normal age.
He told the news newspaper Metro: "Oh, I have reason to think so, and I don't think the measurement method should be used that way".
The biological age is not accurate in this way.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can.
However, the forensic center's Glanton defends the accuracy of these tests: "It's generally fair to say that judging a child as an adult is a small risk of uncertainty".
The biggest risk is that the person is just under 18, which is about 10 percent.
West Virginia Governor announces change of party
On Thursday night, Democratic Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia announced at a meeting of President Trump that he would change the party.
The governor said, "I don't care if you like it or not, the Democrats have already left me", and the governor said, "I don't care if you don't like it".
Well, today, after a lot of prayer and a lot of thought, I'm going to tell you... today I'm going to tell you as a West Virginia man that I can't help you anymore as a Democratic governor.
The rally was a huge success.
So, tomorrow, I will turn my party membership into a Republican flag, Justice added.
As a coach, I'm going to tell you that it's time to start another game.
Trump earlier pledged to make a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42% of the vote in West Virginia, while Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice was named the state's only billionaire in 2016.
According to Forbes, he inherited his father's coal industry and owns coal mines in all five states.
He is currently worth about US$1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying that the change of Governor Justice was another blow to the Democratic Party, which will not only prevent our nation from becoming great again, but will make our country great again.
With only 15 governors currently in the Democratic Party and the lowest number ever in the state legislature, Justice's statement is the latest rejection of a party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unified slogan.
The music is a story that is told in full, and it is a dream of mine.
It is difficult to tell a story in four or five minutes.
I've always felt sorry for myself when I write songs with no emotion, no story line.
Sebastian Koh praises Russia for its frank apology for the doping scandal
On Thursday, the president of the International Athletics Federation, Sebastian Koh, appreciated Russia's apology for the doping scandal, saying that the apology was sincere, but he reiterated that now is not the time for Russia to re-enter the sport.
At the International Tennis Conference on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics, Russian Athletics Federation President Dmitry Hilaking said that his country's ban on the sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He expressed regret that all the athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were stripped of their medals.
Despite his comments, the International Tennis Association still voted in favor of maintaining the ban. Previously, a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) mentioned evidence that Russian states sponsored the use of doping, which was implemented in November 2015.
I think today's response is very candid, very candid, I think, the Chairman of the International Tennis Association told reporters.
The whole Council and the General Assembly of the Russian Federation are pleased... The Russian Federation acknowledges that it has been going through a very hot period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can participate again in the competition.
Ko said he was also thrilled that Russia accepted the criteria for re-entering the competition.
I think this is a very constructive day and I think we have made some progress, but the recommendation of the ATL Group for the support of the team is not yet the time to restore Russia's eligibility, said Yanko.
And we need to do everything we can to make this normal in the coming months.
Our guiding principle has always been to keep clean athletes from being contaminated, he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict standards of international athletics will compete as neutral athletes at the World Championships in Athletics on Friday in London.
Voten Andersen, head of the International Athletics Team, said on Monday that Russia has not met several criteria to resume the competition.
After speaking to the International Council of Athletics in London, he told reporters that drug tests were still insufficient and that banned coaches were still coaching.
During the annual campaign for the implementation of the Beijing Convention on Tobacco Control, held this morning, the youth student representative of the National Youth Tobacco Control Micro Video Award winning Youth Tobacco Control Student Representative interacted with the National Tobacco Control Image Ambassador, Huang Chen, and reviewed the campaign videos and the exhibition of the award-winning works.
The event informed the French evening reporter that young actor Huang Xiaou was hired as the national image ambassador for smoking prevention.
Huang, who smoked during his university days, successfully quit after fully recognizing the dangers of smoking, this time taking on the role of an ambassador for smoking cessation, calling on teenagers to avoid tobacco.

The Fed's Economic Growth Book shows that almost all 12 Fed regions reported moderate to moderate economic growth in early 2018, and remain optimistic about the outlook for the year.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate in December remained at 4.1%, the lowest since 2000, and companies are expected to raise wages in the coming months.
Federal Reserve officials generally consider tax reform to be a factor in supporting this moderate economic prospect, with the Fed forecasting 2.5 percent economic growth in 2018, and a three-fold increase in interest rates.
Market participants noted that in recent times, the ECB's monetary policy tightening has led to the expected boost in the euro exchange rate, the dollar index has been continuously declining, and the yuan against the dollar has seen a rapid uptick in the exchange rate, but at present, it is unlikely that the ECB will quickly adjust its policy position, and it is likely that the short-term volatility of the foreign exchange market will eventually return to fundamentals, and the yuan exchange rate will continue to operate smoothly.
It is noteworthy that as the market's expectations for the RMB become more stable, the attractiveness of RMB assets to foreign investors is also increasingly highlighted.

What are the financial rules of football that affect Neymar's move to Paris?
The rules aimed at preventing European luxury football clubs from being restricted in their spending do not prevent Neymar from moving from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in France for a record price.
The result was a further downgrading of the UEFA European Football Association (UEFA) to the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club. The UEFA is the governing body of European football and has the right to prohibit teams from participating in the highly regarded UEFA Champions League.
The 2011 UEFA introduction of the Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP) meant that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club would ultimately have to prove Neymar's transfer was financially supported without causing huge losses.
Barcelona have already paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to pay the Brazilian player's release fee, while Neymar's salary will be in the tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are some of the financial implications of Neymar's move to France.
Given that the team's funding came from the financially-deprived Qatari ruling family, the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club could of course sign Neymar in cash and put him in the squad of other star-studded clubs.
The clubs can spend huge sums of money to buy players, but they must use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge sums of money they have spent, allowing them to achieve a balance of profits and losses in the football-related business.
The concept of the Financial Fairness Rules of Competition was first proposed by Michel Platini after he was elected as the president of UEFA in 2007.
The former Frenchman believes that for clubs that build up their debt to succeed, if the banks or everyone else withdraws their support, they are actually cheating and risking their destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the club's bankruptcy rule shifted from the club's debt issue to the monitoring of the club's losses.
The change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich when he bought Chelsea in 2003 - buying a potential club and then investing heavily in improving the team and building a global brand - is now facing a more demanding situation.
During the three-year league rules league assessment period to 2018, the club could lose 30 million euros.
Despite being ousted by the then president in 2015, UEFA successor Alexander Ceferin is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
Of course, the rules of the game have not yet expired, and we will certainly strengthen future regulations, Andrea Traverso, the UEFA's head of rules of the game, told the Associated Press last week.
Although the Paris Saint-Germain F.C. will pay Neymar's purchase terms on a one-off basis, it can also allocate the amount for accounting purposes within the contract term.
Neymar has signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee could be worth €44.4 million in the next five years' annual accounts.
The first wave of the Stirling Rules imposed in 2014 put the Stirling Sanctions on the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and the Abu Dhabi-based Manchester City Club.
Paris Saint-Germain was fined €60 million ($82 million at the time), later reduced to €20 million, and asked the Champions League team to reduce its players to 21 instead of the normal 25 for the 2014-15 season.
UEFA is watching the clubs who try to increase their income by linking to the club's owners and cheating financial regulators.
Although Qatar's companies can sponsor the Paris Saint-Germain, if the amount of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market price, UEFA will not consider it legal income.
This was in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount of Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of Paris Saint-Germain FC was exaggerated.
According to reports, Neymar's part of the revenue for the St. Germain Football Club in Paris may come from payments made by the Qatar World Cup organising committee in 2022.
However, both the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and the organising committee deny Neymar will be the World Cup ambassador, and it is easy for UEFA regulators to make such a move.
The recent sanctions imposed on the Paris Saint-Germain football club mean that UEFA will be more vigilant about any attempts to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, sources told AFP that UEFA had not discussed Neymar's transfer with Paris Saint-Germain.
The above individuals only contacted the Associated Press anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
The last published accounts show that Paris Saint-Germain FC earned over €10 million in revenue and an operating income of €542 million in 2015-16.
The accounts for the previous financial year have not been released.
The Paris Saint-Germain Football Club expects Neymar's membership to bring good news to sponsorship events, franchises and shirt sales.
The club expects revenues to grow by at least 30% after the signing of Neymar.
It was clear that the Spanish league was furious to see the biggest players of the franchise leave, and tried to prevent Neymar from making the move, claiming that Paris Saint-Germain had broken the rules of the game.
La Liga president Javier Tevez told the Spanish newspaper AS that the ban was a clear example of a 'financial doping' that the club and the country were the same ban, referring to Qatar as the ultimate owner of Paris Saint-Germain.
Arsenal's all-time leading scorer, Arsene Wenger, has reservations about the club's state-funded attitude and the Premier League.
The result of ownership has changed the entire ecology of football for the past 15 years, Wenger said on Thursday.
The country has a club, and anything happens.
This would make it very difficult to comply with the rules of poker because for a country, there are many different ways or various interests to require players to play for a country.
Smart interactive robot R&D developer Rokid receives new investment from Tamasi
In recent years, AI startups have continued to receive capital gains.
The new round of financing was recently completed by the AI-Rokid, a group of companies including TCM, Swiss Credit, CDIB (an investment firm owned by Taiwan China Development Financial Holdings), and former shareholder IDG Capital.
The round of funding, which is reportedly around $100 million, is the first time that Reliance and CDIB have been involved in domestic AI financing transactions.
Rokid is a research and development company dedicated to the field of intelligent interactive robots, with products that can control smart devices in the home, with continuous autonomous learning and growth capabilities, and with capabilities for identification, understanding, and feedback.
The round of funding will be mainly for R&D, talent introduction, strategic advancement and investment in industrial chains.
Previously, Rokid had received a $8.3 million angel round of investment from IDG, Linear Capital, Mfund, and Merger Capital in August 2014; a $10 million A round of investment from the company's parent company, Warner International, Angel Investors, in October 2015; and a B round of funding from institutions such as IDG, Mfund, Merger Capital, and Merger Capital, in November 2016.
At the time, Rokid said the company was valued at $450 million after round B funding.
In May 2017, Rokid released the consumer-grade smart voice robot, Ryo-chan Moon-shi, which combines AI and home scenes, for $1,399.
The robot uses speech synthesis, natural language understanding, speech recognition and microphone array technology, with chat conversations, music playback, and smart home functions.
He has won two major awards at the CES International Consumer Electronics Show (Tech For A Better World) and Home Audio/Video Components And Accessories, as well as the German IF Design Award, which is considered an Oscar by the design community.
At the 2018 CES, which just closed, Rokid launched a new product: consumer-grade AR-enabled reality glasses, RokidGlass.
The lens will be used as a standalone headset, without the need to connect a smartphone or external computer, and is expected to be commercialized in 2018.
Previously, the company had released the first generation of the product home robot RokidAlien and the second generation of the product smart speaker RokidPebble.

According to Apple, from February 28, this year, the iCloud service in mainland China will be transferred from the cloud to the company in Guangzhou.
Apple said that the collaboration between Huawei and Huawei on the cloud will allow us to continue to improve the speed and reliability of iCloud services while also complying with new rules that Chinese cloud services must be operated by local businesses.
During the shutdown, the data that users have previously stored in iCloud will be stored in iCloud and will not be lost.
If users want to use iCloud after 28 February, they will need to accept the new terms and conditions to ensure that their accounts are reactivated and moved to the cloud in Guangzhou.
Apple also stressed in a statement that Apple has a strong data privacy and security protection mechanism and will not create a backdoor in any of our systems.
iCloud's main data center in Guangzhou will also be the first data center project Apple has set up in China, which will be used to store data for Apple users in China once the project is completed.
When built and put into service, Chinese users will not need to upload and download data over long distances between China and the US, increasing speed and reducing latency.

The story is retold to commemorate the actors' fashionable 80s and junk years of the 90s (after David Wayne and Michael Thwart created the sketch comedy series National Dilemma for MTV); and the nostalgia for the year 2001 itself; before that year, many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poole and Paul Loud had not yet been born.
As a cultural artwork, it is a perpetual imitation and reflection of the memories of our Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is running out.
The first day of Camp Zero was a strong response to the first day of camp Zero, but not only because of its absurd humor. The story is about an original story about a talking vegetable head, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin.
The double use of the core laughing stock - the middle-aged actor playing a child of the age of eggs - makes it a funny part of the story to not be able to go back in time.
In the decade since, the real-life adult role of the protagonist has become less deeply ingrained and more widespread, including improvised work on films from the 1990s, such as the cradle-driven handkerchief.
At one point, a character was trapped in an Apple laptop, some straight-line skates and some other 1991 stuff.
Many of the core stories are the same.
Mr. Sweet (Mr. Thwart) is now a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten about Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
The film is about a young man named Victor (Ken Marino) who is still a man.
The play also contains another villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (played by Mr. Howard) and inspired by George H. W. Bush (played by Michael Ian Blake, who impressed).
As always, the best part of this series is the interludes.
It's especially interesting to see this ever-young Mr. Luthor, who is featured in the movie The Single Noble, featuring the soul patch of Matt Dillon, and Andy, who was once a schoolboy, now feels like a giant.

The comedy, written by Brian Gatewood and Alejandro Fielding and directed by Rhys Thomas, was a hard-fought, dark-blooded comedy set in Romania in the 1980s, telling the story of two Bucharest officials struggling for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The main characters - the hard-line Gregor and the idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Pierszi Jr. and Cornelius Ulich, respectively, with dialogue by Channing Tatum (who is also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English-language voice.
It's a wonderful idea.
But this is not just an idea.
Some of them are good visual headers. (Police watch chess on TV and send time because Americans like to play football.)
And many famous voice actors - including Jenny Slater, Nick O'Ferman, Mahesh Hashbaz Ali and Kolo Sevini - have created a great sound event.
However, Detective Duolingo is so committed to creating a noisy, realistic propaganda comedy - the show features a killer wearing a Reagan mask - and it usually plays a similar role.
The six-episode series is slightly dragging and the comedy effects are not released fast enough or often enough.
The editor of the film, Detective DuBose DuBose, was more strict and had better provocative irony when Gregor and Aitken visited the US embassy repeatedly, as there were always two fat wolves in the embassy lobby eating a bunch of burgers.

In a recent interview, the journalist learned that the benefits of steel, rail transport, shipping, mechanical manufacturing and other industries in the Northeast region have generally declined, even causing losses.
Some experts believe that under the current situation, the new industrial revival in the Northeast is not only related to the national economic recovery, but will also have an impact on the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, so we are waiting for the adjustment transformation.
The decline in corporate profits in the traditional industries, as well as the loss of raw materials and heavy machinery manufacturing, is the first manifestation of the economic downturn in the Middle East and North Africa.
In the past, the downturn in the economy was mainly characterized by low-end, primary products, but in this economic volatility, the traditional industrial high-end, low-end products of the Northeast are affected.
The company has started to adjust the product structure in recent years, focusing on the development of high-end boards such as container boards, steel rails, boards and electrical panels for the public, but this year sales of these varieties have declined significantly, especially boards sales, down 50% from the same period last year.

In May, the production of crude steel in Penning province reached 215.4 million tons, the state policy encouraged the local government to build strong projects, the sales of products were better, and the market competition was more fierce, and the product decline was greater, which is another feature of the Northeast manufacturing industry.

The Japanese Olympic Committee recently said that the Japanese delegation's goal for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics is 30 gold medals and it is in the top three in the list of gold medals.
In October, the chairman of the Japan Olympic Committee's Committee for Sport, Shin-taeyuru, said he expected Japan's total gold medal count at the Tokyo Olympics to be 2.5 times that of the Rio Olympics.
At the 2016 Rio Olympics, the Japanese delegation took sixth place with 12 gold medals.

Bank of England to maintain 0.25% interest rate
The Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged, as weak economic growth and loose inflation have already ruined hope for a reversal.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to weaken as it strengthens its interest rate control while tightening household incomes.
The bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to maintain the 0.25% rate, while a minority of members this month called for a rate hike even as weak economic growth has weakened the upward support.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England shrank its growth forecast for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7 percent and 1.6 percent respectively, and warned that the tightening of household incomes would continue, while inflation would soar to nearly 3 percent in the fall.
But it said that interest rates would need to be raised in the coming years to curb the inflation brought about by Brexit, while borrowing costs may need to be raised more substantially than expected in the financial markets.
The EU has been pushing for a massive economic promotion policy to be implemented a year ago, and members have voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce a suspension of its regular funding plan to provide cheap funding to banks starting in February next year, although the bank said that under the plan the bank would need an additional £15 billion on a £115 billion basis.
In a record of the interest rate decision-making meeting, the Bank of England said: "The core forecast of MPC is that gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term as real household income contraction continues to suppress consumption".
Regarding interest rates, the Bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for monetary policy tightening to suppress inflation and to tighten to a greater extent than market expectations.
Currently, the market is expected to achieve its first growth in the third quarter of next year and its second growth in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any upgrades would be slow-moving and contained.
The bank's growth forecast for this year and next year is downward, with forecasts for May at 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively.
The bank maintains its forecast of growth of 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar, followed by the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% against the dollar, reaching 1.31, and the euro fell 0.4% to 1.11%.
The steady decision was preceded by a sharp upward trend that was shattered by recent unopposed growth figures. GDP grew to 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with 0.2% in the first three months.
The bank said growth in the third quarter could remain at 0.3%, although it will increase slightly by the end of the year.
The average family is shocked by the inflation bubble and the wage growth is negligible, and the Bank of England's recent inflation report is not good news for them, as the bank says that the tightening will get worse before it gets better.
The government also said that the monetary policy fallout could not prevent the fallout from hitting income in the coming years, but wages are expected to recover in large numbers by the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, the economy will be stimulated by the strong growth in demand for British goods due to the value of the pound, which will offset some of the effects of low consumption.
The decision was taken a year before the shocking EU referendum, which brought the pound down to 0.25% in August.
The Bank of England estimates that it may take four years before it has a full impact on prices and the UK economy.
The bank's latest rate ruling was not without its ears, as inflation has added to the snow of the average family already under pressure, while the three policymakers called for a 0.5% rate hike in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in June last month, although the Bank of England said this was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that its target of 2% was relatively low, and that the remainder was already the weakest pound.
Andrew Montray, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in recurring interest rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more competitive again as lenders strongly call for more business and look forward to making the perfect line for the year".
For those who may be close to ending an existing transaction, this market looks particularly advantageous, as re-posts (many of which are free of charge and with low interest rates) are becoming increasingly popular.
China's earthquake platform officially confirmed that at 19:02 on November 13, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck New Zealand (about 42.53 degrees south of the equator and 173.05 degrees east of the equator) at a depth of 10 kilometers, and the capital city of Wellington was strongly shaken.
The National Health Service (NHS) is the green light for controversial HIV drugs
After the High Court has decided on the NHS's funding of medicines, patients will be able to receive treatment for HIV-related HIV-related illnesses starting in September.
NHS England announced that PrEP, a medication available before sexual intercourse, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk populations by around 86%. Health services will now provide the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year initial trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year. The ruling said that although the NHS claimed that local authorities should fund the drug, the NHS was entitled to pay for PrEP.
The move announced Thursday was described by NHS chief executive Simon Stevens as a major new intervention wave, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a critical moment in the pandemic.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to register. More clinics will be added in October, followed by full implementation across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug used to reduce the risk of HIV infection before sexual intercourse.
Trials have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
PrEP before sex means that there are enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The group of people eligible for treatment includes gay, bisexual, transgender and HIV positive people who have not received treatment.
The clinic will determine whether the participants who qualify and agree to the trial, including men, women, transgender people and unknown persons with HIV infection status in their sexual partners, are receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and are registered as GP can also register for the sexual health clinic they attend in their local area.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England has signed a contract to purchase the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The trial aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is positioned, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr Stevens said that this important new intervention should be a broad and increasingly successful complement and reinforcement of HIV prevention.
This is another milestone in over 30 years of action that is worth taking to address major human health challenges.
The CEO of the UK's AIDS Trust (NAT), Deborah King, said: "This is a critical moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it is indeed targeted at people in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offers the possibility of altering the UK AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, the NHS-funded trial in England will provide a new authorised tool for people with HIV at high risk, which can be implemented individually and without consultation with sexual partners, and will improve the lives of many people.
We are in favour of this announcement.
Ian Green, CEO of the Trident Higgins Trust Foundation, said: "The first priority now is to ensure that the trial is rolled out nationwide quickly and that no HIV infection is dropped".
Now that we have purchased the PrEP test drug, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV.
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson claimed: "After months of delays and government delays, the start of the preliminary PrEP trial is popular and should be coming sooner".
Evidence shows how the drug can change the way we prevent HIV and stop the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This experiment will give us a better understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
Now, it is very important to launch this trial nationwide as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and help us further stop the spread of HIV in society.

High quality living: applying tower and clever design to make the small condo apartment a spacious home
Joanne Ray is a former banker who is passionate about home improvement and moved from her large house on Knight Bridge to the small apartment at the Earl's Palace in 2014.
The apartment is located on the first floor of a stylish Queen Anne terrace - which Joanne did not pack and sold, a powerful testament to the new design.
Before that, I lived in a bigger house on Knight Bridge with my ex-boyfriend, Joanne said.
I was looking for a house that was right for me.
I saw this apartment in the county court, and it had a very high ceiling.
I'd love to have a call that day.
After first seeing the house, the 1,000 square foot apartment has now been completely renovated.
The apartment was originally a complex one-room apartment - which required a kitchen to get to the bedroom - and Joanne wanted to add storage space and a loft to make the most of the height of the ceiling.
I want a high ceiling, big windows, enough light.
"That's what I want", she said.
To do so, she hired Elvan Azadi from Duck & Shed's architecture and design studio (Notting Hill) to use the 12.5-foot ceiling to build a house.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to add two upper and lower spaces, so the challenge is to create a tower high enough to stand.
The first is that the new government has to be able to create a new way of thinking.
The structure of the aluminum steel is quite complex, he explained.
Well, we have to make room for it to be on the floor and not have to shoulder the bow and arrow.
It is not only simple to build a simple platform, but also to move the steel to the right height or at the right height to achieve its function.
With this arrangement, Elvan was able to get two full-height rooms in the space - adding many interesting elements.
The tower features retrouvius-branded, retro-copper windows that overlook the charming living area.
The collection of mirrored gold furniture, silver pieces and Serge Mouille's retro lighting laid the foundation for the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing atmosphere, space and light.
The mirror is placed on both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored shutter is like a window to another room.
In the front door, a small window with mirrors provided storage space for Joanne to store dining and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an attractive sense of space, which allows the kitchen to be collected when not in use.
Folding kitchens are not new.
The kitchen is a small, folding kitchen with a garage-like elevator door.
The MDF gate is a steel reinforced steel-plated gate, which is used to provide an explanation of the MDF gate.
The principle of balance is used, so it's easy to slide when you push the door.
Thanks to the clever use of space and resources, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, a bedroom and an improved layout.
Well, in the end, you sell the area of the house -- or your property is valued based on the area of the house, says Elvan.
The real estate agent goes into the room and calculates the size of the floor.
They will try to increase the space and use quality materials to create a luxurious feeling for the space.
Ervan says that the materials of the foam are personal choices and thus help to create emotional bonds in the home.
Oh, you're not gonna love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they won't hold you back.
It turns out that with a good design and the addition of extra space, standard apartments can swing you to the surprise.
In fact, you might choose to stay, like Joanne.

Two brothers playing a $500 million real estate empire fighting for the war
Forty years after their Italian family founded the dynasty, the brothers launched a war for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth over $500 million.
Colin De Lutis, former Carleton Football Club director and developer, lives in a mansion in the Tucala area, three blocks from his brother Paul's home. The latter sued him in the Supreme Court over the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul had wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the two brothers had a fierce argument in the Supreme Court over the division of the assets.
The brothers and their mother own 38 properties worth more than $500 million, which have accumulated since the family bought them in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew to 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company was sold for $85 million.
The money was then put into real estate. Currently, the DeRouetys family's portfolio includes city offices, the Blenrick and Sorrento development projects, the Gold Coast and Blair Mountains apartments, and suburban shopping centers.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, the main promoter and dominant figure in the DeRuth family, who was known to his brother Paul, owned about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul owned about a third.
The documents filed with the court said that, according to the settlement, Colin's property was worth $316.0 million and Paul's was worth $176.0 million.
Paul believes that the division of real estate and cash is the symptom of negotiations.
The Property Divide Proposal proposed by Colin left him with what I consider to be the best property, he wrote in a first court oath in 2015.
Last Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several failed mediations.
Now the brothers were still fighting for control of the existing business, and Paul said that Corinth had thrown him out.
But Cornelius denied this, accusing Paul of not managing some property.
In his early affidavit, Colin expressed his desire to resolve the dispute.
My Italian tradition dictates that family is the most important option. My Italian ancestry dictates that family is the most important.
The costs of the case have been rising, and there are hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and reports from top law firms like Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both companies.
Mrs. DeRouitis and her late husband, Luigi, both immigrated to Italy. They started running mass catering and fast food stores in the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the mortgage to buy the Colinwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says, "Mom, I was in high school when I was three, and he started Westco, and Paul was very young (about 10 years old) at the time".
Anna de Rutes said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass the property on peacefully to their son.
Louise Luigi often told me that she never wanted the brothers to end up in court, she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of the DeRuthis Group, and Colin said Mark paid him $10 million when he left the company and Luke $26 million.
Paul says that Luke and Mark were equally unhappy with the terms of their property division.
According to the biography of television star Eddie McGuire published in 2015, although Colin was a member of the board of directors of the former AFL club, he kept his tone low.
Fairfax Media on Friday contacted Colin and Paul, and their lawyers.
However, only Colin responded by text. He said that since the case had been submitted to the court, I really can't say much.
My brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family affairs to court, which is very, very sad, he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
He said: "My father does not want to see Paul and I end up with a dispute like this, and he added that he still has hope for a resolution of the dispute".
On Friday, this hope seems to have been shattered.
The issue of the issue will be resolved in court in the near future, Colin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media time
The other two have tried, but all have failed.
John F. Kelly might actually be able to do that.
If so, he was the first.
According to the political news website Politico, the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports, in order to ensure greater employer stability.
The following is a quote from journalist Josh Dawsey:
When new White House chief of staff John F. Kelly began his first day of work and met with senior officials to discuss his work, he pointed out that he was working to address one of the key issues that President Trump was facing in the White House: the flow of bad information into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the president make better decisions, so information would need to be handled by him, either in writing or briefly.
Kelly's diagnosis is similar, but others have tried to dissuade her by monitoring Trump's media time, but all ended in failure.
President Trump's long-standing TV habit of watching TV is still deep in the White House.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Naberg told Politico that it would be helpful to let him know that he has been receiving positive news from a credible channel if candidate Trump is frustrated with the unfair reporting.
Tallahassee Palmer of Politico wrote at the time that, based on the experience of six former campaign officials, the focus of controlling Trump's tweeting habits was to ensure that the media messages he received personally always contained a certain amount of praise.
It's not a problem.
But Trump's Twitter habit of being a controlled-minded person is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know about, which is that Trump's tweets would have been even more heated if it hadn't been for their intervention.
We may never know what Trump hasn't tweeted.
If his servants can save him from the fire, even if only a few times, their efforts are worth it.
But nobody has been able to stop Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing groups, people are promoting their worldview and flourishing their careers by providing Trump with information that may or may not be reliable.
Politico was all about the story, and in May it reported that advisers were keen to provide the president with suspicious information strategically.
This is an example of what journalist Shane Goodmancher describes:
The current and former Trump officials said Trump's reaction to negative news clips such as volcanic eruptions, especially those that have devastating information leaks, would be crazy about finding out where they came from.
In late February, a maliciously copied article on the website GotNews.com, a website of cyber insurgents, was sent to the president, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the source of the massive White House leak, which Trump was doing at the time.
Johnson has denied that he has made a number of false accusations and that he has not provided any concrete evidence of his alleged harassment.
Trump read the article and started asking officials about Walsh.
Goodmancher also said that then-Chairman Raines Prebbas and White House Secretary Robert Porter tried to create a system to manage and record the files Trump received.
What about the results?
Kelly intends to do the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more efficient administrator than Prebbs, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his aides are still competing for influence.
These enduring influences make it difficult for Kelly to do his job.
Tourism town: How to get the tourists drunk
The potential of Zhejiang Township is being gradually awakened.
These towns, which are now important destinations for tourists to visit and enjoy the waters of the mountains, read about the culture of the mountains, and feel the nostalgia of the mountains, will also be a major contribution to my efforts to create the most beautiful tourist destination in China.
How to Win
The music of the band is accompanied by a drumming of the moon, and the smell of the sausage is accompanied by the wind.
The traditional handicraft techniques of making bamboo, knitting, iron, sandal, picking, cotton, etc. are everywhere, fully showcasing the non-material cultural heritage of the town, and visitors are immersed in the atmosphere of the traditional culture of the city.
It is reported that during the three-day New Year's holiday this year, more than 650,000 tourists visited Anhui.
In Zhejiang, the unique towns of the atmosphere such as Anhui Town are: the waves of the Gajing West, which float around the warmth of the Yangtze water region; the white walls of the 28th district of Zhejiang, which tell the story of the years of the millennium old town; the fishermen paintings of the town of Shijiazhuang, which depict the traditional and modern life of the fishermen ... these towns are the jewels of the Zhejiang tourism and the favorite tourist attractions of all over the world.
In recent years, the potential of Zhejiang Township has been gradually awakened as tourism is being built throughout the province.
In 2016, the provincial government office officially released a draft implementing plan for the creation of tourist towns in Zhejiang Province, proposing that over a period of about five years, the names of about 100 popular folk towns with strong winds, ecological beauty and tourism-rich provincial tourist towns be accepted throughout the province.
These towns, which are now important destinations for tourists to visit and enjoy the waters of the mountains, read about the culture of the mountains, and feel the nostalgia of the mountains, will also be a major contribution to my efforts to create the most beautiful tourist destination in China.
The provincial tourism authority said that in the wake of the boom in tourism-friendly towns, the towns and villages of the province are now focusing more on building a personalized tourism industry, and new tourism projects and business models are emerging, bringing rich experiences to tourists and gaining a good reputation.
The newly-adopted
Recently, the Zhejiang Tourism Board, Zhejiang Daily News Group, and Zhejiang Tourism Media Center organized the Zhejiang Group's Zhejiang Towns and Future Artists event, which was held in Zhejiang Province, China, to share the poems of Zhejiang Towns with the spirit of Zhejiang.
The town of Hurricane has artistic beauty and a life temperature.
The town's atmosphere is original, original, original, and an original ecological purity.
The film is narrated by the Chinese Academy of Fine Arts's teacher of the film department, the country's leading director of video advertising, Shei Chen, and Professor Xu Wen, the director of the School of Arts and Communication at the University of Measurement in China, who tells the story of the transboundary story of the small town of Changzhou, which is in the footage of the film.
Many of the scenic tourist towns in Zhejiang have rich cultural resources, and Dong, a representative of the town of Nanchang in Huzhou City, has been presenting the exhibition.
The atmosphere of Jiangnan Water Country has been a favorite of book artists since ancient times, and today, Nanchang has a deep collaboration with art institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Arts.
Tourism is essential for tourist towns to have a sense of humour, tourism, service and environmental elements.
The tourism industry is also a major contributor to the tourism industry.
The town is also a popular destination for tourists, and the town is also a popular destination for tourists.
In this era of sharing, the most popular sharing company, Rainbow, has created a series of poems by Zhang Jiang, in an effort to promote the idea of green tea sharing, to raise tourism awareness and civilized values among tourists and townspeople, and to create a beautiful tourist environment.
This is a highlight of the 2017 Zhejiang Tourism and Windshow Town Promotion Season.
I look forward to it.
As of now, Zhejiang Province has released the first list of 21 provincial tourist attraction towns and 115 provincial tourist attraction towns to cultivate the list.
As a priority area for rural tourism during the 13th and 15th Dynasties, the windy towns will eventually be built into tourist attractions above 3A level, becoming a new model for tourism products, tourism benefits and industrial integration.
The tourist attraction of the town is its original juicy taste.
The beauty of the tourist town is not only the flowing water of the small bridge covered in smoke, but also the long-standing cultural tradition; the revitalization of the countryside is the result of cultural confidence.
The international, Dutch town of Leither, the Austrian town of Halsted, and the French town of Nambour, which are the main attractions of tulips, salt peppers and bananas, each year attract large numbers of tourists from all over the world to help boost the economy of the town.
For the towns of spirit, the emphasis on the characteristics of the towns, the emphasis on the country-oriented towns, the emphasis on the towns' identity and soul, the emphasis on providing cultural immersion, local context, and indigenous civilization.
The tourist towns, which are linked by culture and country, and are a carrier of humanity and landscape, are connected to tourists from all over the world, allowing traditional atmospheres and cultures to be passed on and innovate in the sharing of co-building.
In essence, the tourist town is a complex open tourist area, and should be a living space shared by locals and foreign tourists and even travelers.
As the main battlefield for future tourism growth, tourist towns are not only capable of changing the ecological landscape, economic and social development, the direction of industrial movements, but also of closing the urban-rural gap and awakening the rural cultural recovery.
In the midst of a boom in rural revival, the tourist-friendly town of Zhejiang will tell a richer story.
According to data, 70% of China's travel demand is concentrated within 3km, despite the fact that the entire short-haul market is a day of bike sharing.

The campers negotiated the tunnel and returned to the Rich Street tunnel
There was another dispute between some of the wealthiest landlords in the West Midlands and the will-owners, who negotiated a government-built ditch to return land outside the mansion.
The tenants of the house parked their 20 trailers in an empty area outside the bustling Solihull Street, which was renamed the Rich Street Bridge.
The campers, who were staring at their horses, hugging babies and leading the campers, returned after being driven out in May, and the city government's excavated ramparts did not stop them from entering.

Angry residents have been fiercely critical of the Solihull Council, saying that it has performed poorly in dealing with the issue.
One of the residents, who did not want to be named, said, "They came there on Monday night, and before they got to the street of Binselis, they threw stones at the passersby".
The committee should be ashamed of their actions, because they are simply nothing in their dealings with the issue.
The guest cars came here in May, then were driven away, and now they are back again.
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it today.
She added: "The Birmingham City Council knows how to handle the way it protects its parks by imposing a long-term ban".
I live on Streetsbrook Street, and I don't want to continue paying municipal taxes if Parliament can't stop this.
One local resident, who declined to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the first group of passengers leave, and another group gets destroyed".

A spokeswoman for the Solihull Committee said: "We know that someone is camping in an empty area on Szwahritzbrook Road without permission, and we are now working with the Solihull Police and taking the necessary legal action to get them out as soon as possible".

Italy takes a tough stance on non-governmental migrant rescue vessels
Italy has issued a warning to NGOs operating migrant rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue rescue operations unless new operational management regulations are signed.
Interior Minister Mark Minnitti said in an interview with the Turin Daily News: "It's hard to see what they'll do if NGOs don't sign the new code of conduct".
The day before the warning was issued in Minnetti, Italian officials arrested the crew of a rescue ship that was being used by German aid groups to help people smugglers and illegal immigrants in the wake of suspicions that it was actually a conspiratorial operation.
The aid group has only been in operation for one year and refused to comment on the specific allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
In a statement on social media, the group said that for us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing now, and that we regret that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area.
After collecting all the information, we can only assess all the allegations and situations.
Italian officials have been monitoring the Iuventa, a boat that has been rescuing young people from the sea since October.
Its crew were suspected of carrying migrants transported directly by small boats from human traffickers and allowed smugglers to rush to escape and reuse the vessels.
According to prosecutors' documents, at least one such meeting was allegedly held in the sea 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya.
Its crew is alleged to have publicly disregarded the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees the relief efforts in the area out of humanitarian zeal and not any other motivation.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as the Iuventa clearly require an Italian policeman to supervise their activities on board.
Currently, only three of the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue have agreed to comply with the code of conduct: Save the Children, the Malta-based migrant maritime aid station and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring any significant changes to its rescue operations and impede its implementation.
Among the organizations that refused to sign were the Nobel Prize-winning MSF.
Meanwhile, Minniti said the number of migrants arriving in Italy has plummeted in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and unite local mayors have seen first-hand results.
The minister said: "In the last few days, we have started seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.
He announced plans for a deep-rooted meeting this month: to discuss economic development with the mayors of Libya and to discuss ways to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave these countries for Europe with Chad, Niger and Mali.
Transport Bank chief financial officer Lin Ping said that due to the fact that the industrial value increase in the first three quarters of 2017 was characterized by a quarter-on-quarter increase, the growth in industrial value increase is expected to accelerate to 6.6% in December.
Fixed-asset investments are expected to grow at a cumulative rate of 7.2% in December, down from last year.
Although industrial production will be weak in October, it remains essentially on par with November.
While the Chinese manufacturing sector's investment in December was low, but infrastructure investment improved slightly, so it is expected that fixed asset investment will remain flat in November.
More than 200,000 people have entered the United States, mostly as smugglers; they are abroad, they are not allowed to return home, their relatives are separated, and similar scenes continue to occur.
Beijing Yangon University evacuates new initiative: 10,000 students from North Chemical will be in the Yangon New Campus
The opening ceremony of the new campus of Beijing Chemical University 2 was held in Beijing's Xi'an District, and the 1,800-acre green campus was officially inaugurated.
The ceremony informed the reporter that in recent years, in the context of the development and disengagement of non-capital functions in the Jinan Jinan Jinan cooperative, Beijing has accelerated the disengagement of central city high schools to the suburbs, and that some high school students are gradually moving to new campuses in the suburbs of Shunxi, Daxing, and Xinjiang.
The North Chemical New Campus, located in the town of Nanjing, covering an area of 1,800 hectares, is one of the key projects in Beijing's efforts to remove non-capital functions.
The new campus is being built in three phases, with the first phase completed and the second phase expected to be fully operational by the end of this year, and the entire project will meet the needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty staff to learn and live.
As we look back at this year's film market, we find that the original script and the two star cast have become an important part of the film's expectations.
At 17:10 hours today, the 119 Command Center in Yangon City received an alert for a fire at a large machinery plant in Dongxi-dong, Tsin-cheng district of the city.
The Yangtze City Fire Department immediately sent five squadron of 20 fire trucks carrying heavy anti-chemical clothing, anti-chemical washing machine equipment to the scene.
After initial detection, the fire was started by a small storage tank of chemicals such as foam, which produced large amounts of smoke.
As of the time of the press release, firefighters are working to rescue, and municipal health, safety, environmental protection, security, transportation and other departments have been on the scene without any injuries.
Michelle Carter is sentenced to life in prison for the suicide of Conrad Roy by text messaging
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for murdering her boyfriend through texting and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months in prison, which can be commuted to probation.
Carter was convicted in June of involuntary manslaughter for Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is devastated.
My son is my best friend.
During the pending appeal, Carter was allowed to remain free.
She faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, but her lawyer group believes she and Mr. Roy both suffer from mental illness.
At the time of the sentencing, Carter was standing, wearing red jeans and pink shirts, with his hands clasped, his eyes covered with wax, and his eyes facing down.
The prosecutor told the court that her actions killed Conrad Roy, who was a suspect in the shooting.
She ended his life to live better for herself.
She has not taken responsibility, the prosecutor said.
She doesn't mean to regret it.
But Carter's lawyers said it was a terrible consequence, and she regretted it.
However, Justice Lawrence Moniz said he did not find her age or maturity, nor did he find that her mental illness would have any significant effect on her behavior.
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said, "I have not spent a day not grieving the loss of my beloved son".
I hope he is proud of me and everything I have done. I am trying to stand with him and his sisters in all my pain, which will be with us forever.
Camdyn Roy, Mr Roy's sister, testified that she was in a mental breakdown when she realized she would never be able to attend her brother's wedding or be the mother of his children.
The loss of a person who has been with me since I was born is a pain and will be with me for the rest of my life.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as Massachusetts law does not require anyone else to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his car; this year, Carter was 17 years old.
Carter's text message revealed that she had stabbed him to death, and the case sparked national attention.
There are many ways to hang, jump, stab himself. She said in a few text messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was on holiday with his family.
In the time before his suicide, she wrote: "Oh, you need to do this, Conrad, oh, oh, all you have to do is start the generator and you will get freedom and happiness".
Judge Monitz said Carter had gained attention through Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
In this case, there are legal differences.
Among the few people who defended Carter, Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy and was acquitted two years later.
In a column in the Los Angeles Times, Ms. Knox, 30, said: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail".
Zhang Jiejiajie is destined to be a controversial film artist who has been a controversial figure since he started shooting his first film, Red Hat, and has also garnered a lot of uncredited rewards while leading the Chinese film scene.
Reporters from the Lhasa Netto Ground Basketball Club learned on 2nd that recently, the Lhasa Netto Ground Basketball Youth Team finished fourth in the final of the National Junior Basketball League in Beijing.
The Lhasa Netto Ground Basketball Youth Team is composed of 11 local players, with the head coach being assistant coach of the Lhasa Netto Ground Men's Basketball Senior Team, R. Sanju.
The youngest Tibetan basketball player to play in the final before heading to Beijing.
Liang Jun-ho, general manager of the Lhasa Net Earth Basketball Club, told reporters that the team's performance has improved significantly compared to last year, and that players' confidence and grasp of the field have improved significantly.
After the match, captain Jiang Zhou said he wanted to do his best for his basketball career in Tibet by gaining experience by participating in the tournament.
It is understood that in the Beijing Games, the players overcame factors such as low altitude intoxication, which showed the Tibetan image.
Although athletics is a big gold medal in the Olympics, and athletes have to be under the stars, the name of the sport is more popular than the gold rush.
Audi to upgrade up to 850,000 diesel cars in the face of shocks from car manufacturers
The day before Audi announced the upgrade, BMW said it would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 cars.
The chairman of BMW said that BMW believes that driving a diesel has more intelligent options than restricting a diesel, meaning that major European cities - including Munich, where BMW's headquarters are located - are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would repair 3 million Mercedes-Benz cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
No company has claimed the move was a recall.
European automakers have been promoting diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
However, the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset diesel exhaust emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to keep diesel cars competitive in prices.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government led by Prime Minister Angela Merkel has also been accused of over-indulging in these powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid repeating the cover-up of the masses, which is to cover up their alleged failure to use the device, adjusting emissions during vehicle testing to meet legal regulations and returning to normal driving conditions.
Several executives at the company have been charged in the United States, while others are under investigation in countries on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the Department of Thermo-Mechanics at Audi's engine research and development was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zacchero Giovanni Pameo is Italian and therefore not subject to extradition protection and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the general public, which the German government accused of expanding the scope of the investigation to the United States, which had previously limited Audi's installation system to avoid European emissions requirements.
Audi is under investigation for the potential for a major impact on the general public: luxury car manufacturers hold a disproportionate share of the profits of Volkswagen.
The film is a classic, and it takes a year or two or even years from the time of its release.
The animated film, which was announced ahead of the Big Fish Beach Day, will be released on July 8, 12 years after its release!
Liang, 21, from Qinghai University of Heat and Energy, co-founded the company, Beyond the Sun, with his friend Zhang Chun, and in 2008 he received a million-dollar venture from a joint venture to launch the anime film Virgin of the Moon.
The film has won numerous awards at home and abroad during its creative stages, and has been acclaimed as one of the most outstanding works of art by the Centre d'art contemporain de Pompidou in France.
The film was dubbed the "Crater of the Gods" by millions of fans due to the six years from its creation to production.
The Great Fish Beach tells a Chinese fantasy story. The release of this archival trailer brings new expectations to all audiences.
Liang said: "I've only done this for 12 years, and now it's become a dream come true, and I'm both nervous and excited".
Zhang Chun said: "I'm driving the team crazy when I think about using one-fifth of everyone else's budget to produce the same picture effects as everyone else".
The world's largest cement factory, which once relied on raw materials and a large number of manufacturers, is focusing on the high-level talent who can lead the city's relocation.
During the recent week of the high-level talent event organized by the Dongguan Municipality, the first financial journalist saw that some local companies with strong equipment were attending the talent talks.
The price tag is marked with a price tag on the brightly lit billboards below the pink-red wall.
Therefore, the Chinese Television Production Industry Association decided to unite the national television production industry to sign a self-discipline convention.
Provence's cotton is threatened by climate change
The garment has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but the bad news is that it is under threat from climate change.
The decline of the garlic industry is caused by a continuing drought and the emergence of virus-carrying insects, which has left scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions with headaches.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute of Agriculture in Provence (CRIEPPAM), said that the plant is facing a major threat because of the effects of climate change in recent years, with significantly reduced rainfall in spring and prolonged monsoon in autumn.
This will affect the life cycle of the garment.
There is also a smaller individual, a leafy shrub that can spread microorganisms, and in very dry weather they appear in large numbers.
The key is that it is huge.
Apart from attracting tourists, the clean laundry facilities are also sought after by the perfume and make-up industries.
Eric Jones: "In contrast to plants that can grow many large flowers and have long-grain spines, we have problems with smaller individuals, poor development, lack or lack of stems".
So we have less essential oil.
Solutions under study include better irrigation techniques and reducing soil water evaporation, spraying protective mixtures of clay and water on plants, and developing more drought-resistant varieties.
The two main characters have expressed their interest in the story rather than the science fiction elements in the film.
On the afternoon of September 5, a reporter from the Washington Post interviewed several prominent figures in the photojournalist community, as well as two photojournalists, who were surprisingly almost unanimously silent.
One was a Berlin filmmaker, one was an up-and-coming young actor, and a psychopath who was also the first partner of Ivan and Li Li Feng.
Mexico's dangerous situation: journalists killed
The entire staff of Riodoce Weekly usually gather on Wednesday to review their plans to report on the riots in Sinaloa, which have been caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and an endless drug war.
But today, the shadow of tragedy overshadows them and they come together to discuss security issues.
They are told that it is important to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed which was safer: whether to bring their children to the office (the office was hit by a grenade in 2009) or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemy, neutral and ally.
They have these journalists listing names under each of the shelves without the need for evidence, observation and intuition.
There are suspicions that drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists, or cartels on the government's list, are putting the reporting in Mexico at risk.
Violence has never ceased, and the country is full of journalists: at least 25 journalists have been killed since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 journalists have been federally protected from attacks and threats; and at least seven journalists have died so far this year in seven states.
The last person to die was their editor and inspiration, and co-founder of Riodoce Fountain, Javier Valdés Cardenas.
Valdis has written many books about drug violence, one of which he wrote: "The biggest mistake you make is living in Mexico and becoming a journalist".
It was felt deeply that he had left, although he was everywhere holding a huge photo hanging in front of the Riodoce building, Valdis staring at his middle finger, chanting the words "Justice is in the air"; and the T-shirts worn by Aaron Ivala and Miriam Ramirez, journalists in their 30s, also showed his smile, with glasses or his iconic Panama cap.
The workshop was held less than two months after his death; journalists discussed their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and multiple disorders.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, the office has prosecuted only two people, according to records from the Committee to Protect Journalists.
The majority of the thousands of criminal cases per year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so it is rare to bring the killers of journalists to justice.
In Riodoce, they insisted on reporting the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts were broken, even though the land was a thousand holes in the ground.
Iwara said that without information about the killer and without justice, it would be useless to hold a security debate.
He said that it was stupid to waste time at such a workshop.
You won't believe anyone unless we know why.
On the morning of May 15, Valdis left the Riodoce office in the capital, Curiacan.
His red Toyota Carola was only blocked a few blocks away when two men stopped him; they forced him out of the car and fired 12 guns, presumably because the newspaper's name translates to "Twelfth Street".
The bandits drove his car away and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
He left behind his wife and two grown children.
The Kuriacan is rumored to be four.
But as far as the subject of Valdis is concerned, there is nothing really but silence.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States in January last year, Sinaloa has become the country's bloodiest battlefield, where hostile forces have been rampantly slaughtered.
Every day, one or more people are shot on the streets of Sinaloa, and the two-story mausoleums are filled with toxic substances, which are commonplace.
The temporary state of silence is only forgotten when a cartel controls the state of Peshawar and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdis was well aware of the dangers of the job, 60-year-old Riodoce Young co-founder and director Ismail Bohoquay was still not guilty of not protecting his friends.
He believes that two mistakes caused the tragedy.
The first, published in February, was an interview with Damasso Lopez, who led a cartel group fighting against several of Guzman's sons.
The report may have angered the sons; the newspaper was bought by suspected gang members once it was delivered to the newsstand.
The second mistake was that after another newspaper reporting the same story was confiscated, Valdés was not forced to leave Mexico for his own safety.
Valdis is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death has significant implications for Mexico's violence against journalists.
His spirit is alive, and his friends and colleagues believe that he has always been with us.
In 2003, he was a senior journalist at the Noroeste Group, where he and five colleagues founded the Riodoce Group, selling $50 of the company.
In the state of Sinaloa, the journalism industry cannot be left without dealing with the drug problem, Bohoquay said.
Over time, the newspaper has gained a good reputation for its bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising have increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish investigative reports that are harmful without worrying about censorship, and readers like to publish stories that others dare not report.
Riodoce won the Maria Moscow Prize for Journalism in the United States five years after its founding.
In the same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded Valdis the International Press Freedom Award in recognition of his courage in pursuit of the most authentic Mexican drug reporting.
He admitted that he was scared too.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the prize, he said, "Oh, I want to live".
Later in late October, he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
You must take the task on your shoulders as a journalist, either that or you must be deaf.
I don't want to be asked what you did... why don't you speak up about what's happening?
The entire staff of Riodoce Misses Valdis, misses him as a harbor worker, misses a friend who never hesitated to embrace and advise, misses a teacher who knew how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The bar El Guayabo, which is across the street from the office, is always sitting at the same table.
Now they will ask: "Was it his habit that caused him to fall?"
His death also forced them to think about how to work and live well.
Pookway said they don't like you bothering their women and children, and they don't like you affecting their legal companies and secret airports for transporting drugs.
And they're all over their bottom line.
The result is that even when it is safest, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-protection.
Believe in your gut.
If you smell a dangerous breath, get away from it.
Andres Virale, editor of Riodoce, said the problem was that the smell of the lime was a feeling of being deceived... and then something like that happened to Havilland.
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply to the Sinaloa state, just as they no longer apply to Tamalpais, Veracruz, Greer and other states, where smuggling routes are profitable, and where institutions are thin, government officials are corrupt, and smoking hot air.
The situation is changing all the time.
In the security training room of Riodoce, the employees of the Riodoce were suddenly banned from using their phones; a few days ago, spyware allegedly sold only to the government had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers are in the cold under the trees, avoiding the high temperature of 104 degrees Celsius (40 degrees Celsius).
They were the state government's offices to protect the Riodoce River, located in a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Curiacan.
Some journalists jokingly said they didn't know if the police would be more than 50% of the letters the governor himself had written.
Journalists have been in the mountains for months, where drug trafficking groups are under the control of a real presence.
This week's Riodoce series mainly covered three major events.
The murder of the brother of the great former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloa was one of the most significant events in the history of the country.
The governor's home state also disclosed government funding.
The case was also reported in the case of the kidnapping of a restaurant in the expensive Culiacan, which is just one block from the prosecutor's office.
The authorities have not released information about the abducted objects and the abduction process, so it is necessary to be cautious when writing about what the city knows: that is where the restaurant is a favorite destination for drug dealers and officials alike.
A journalist learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the ruling party, the Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political classes throughout the last century.
Recently, several Revolutionary Party governors have been accused of corruption in several high-profile cases.
Viral asked reporters to write a story about what happened at the scene, including the incident in which a son of Mexican drug lord Tang Guzman fled a military attack.
If readers looked at the column of Valdis months ago, they would find the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
Viraire, 46, known as the skinny-looking, thin-skinned, said that we already knew what was happening before.
Now all our communication channels are being monopolized.
Valdis's office is now used to store signs and stickers of protesters who kill journalists because the employees become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The following morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took a sign out of the room and went to the local prosecutor's office to participate in a march associated with another journalist.
Salvador Adamey disappeared in the western state of Michoacán, three days after his murder in Valdés.
The official said that the body was found in a burnt-out state and that it was his body, according to DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal, organizing protests and putting words to save media silence on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, Director Bohoquay was not in Washington, D.C., and he was working to bring justice to the Valdis case and to gain international support.
The day after Valdis was killed, during a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez sued the official journalists for the information of the assassination and killed them for their allegedly exposing the facts.
Given that her anger had already affected her objectivity, she also asked to resign from her position as a government affairs reporter.
Valdes has repeatedly reiterated that Mexican journalists are surrounded by organized crime, corrupt government officials and indifferent social media.
In his previous book, The Drug Journalism Challenge, he wrote that journalists are not only harassed by drug trafficking groups, but also on the list of politicians and security forces who have been involved in organized crime and corruption.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 blamed police and public officials for more than half of the attacks on journalists last year.
Ramirez said that in Mexico, they let you die just to keep you quiet.
The murder is obviously not a cold shocker.
No one has forgotten that six years ago, the goddess Maria Elizabeth Marcia died on the northern border of Tamulipas.
She was found with a note next to her body, allegedly signed by Zetaskarel: "Hold me up for my report".
She was cut off from her head and placed a computer keyboard and headphones next to her.
After the assassination of Miroslava Brezhnev in March, some newspapers opted to close, such as El Norte, the newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others are still going on, but they are still going on, as the director of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo was killed in 2014.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez made a headline news story that publicly discussed the drug cartel under the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their homelands or even left the country.
It was a difficult decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find work, and they still have to be careful, careful and alert to the dangers on the streets.
They are sometimes arrested, and it is said that in 2015, photographer Ruben Espinosa was killed in a Mexican city with four women after fleeing Veracruz for three months.
For those who continue to work behind the scenes, this is a daily step in making high-risk decisions.
Iwara, who wanted to be a poet, admitted that he was afraid of reporting on the drug trade.
He said that Mexico is becoming hell, so I became a journalist.
On a recent Friday at midnight, the latest edition of the newspaper was printed, and the editors of Riodoce's magazine were sitting in the hallway outside the office drinking beer, and suddenly their phones rang.
A series of gunfire attacks against hostile forces and security forces near the beach resort town of Masatlan have confirmed 19 deaths.
The war is still escalating, as a series of cartel information found in the area predicts.
They were on the road, uploading the news to the Riodoce website via their mobile phones.
The next day, the title had to be changed.
The sound of the whistle was heard nearby, and a deadly gun battle ensued in the area.
The police were standing there guarding the police, and Bohoquiao looked to see if they were awake.
If they were a little scared, they didn't show up.
The founder of the paper has died, and in his large portrait, his middle pointing to the whole of Sinaloa, where the entire staff of the Riodoce Museum is following his pace.
The same day that Havel was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the streets to report.
China's self-driving tourism market reaches trillion yuan in 2020
[Abstract] In the context of consumer upgrades and free movement, self-driving cars are encouraged by national policies and increasingly popular among consumers.
But at the same time, the market for self-driving cars, which is expected to surpass trillion-dollar, faces a double challenge.
In the context of consumer upgrades and free movement, self-driving cars are encouraged by national policies and increasingly popular among consumers.
At the same time, the market for self-driving tours, which is expected to break trillions of dollars, faces dual challenges: on the one hand, the development of the self-driving touring industry is out of proportion to market demand, and self-driving tour operators such as self-driving clubs and travel agencies are in a poorly profitable situation; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services faced by self-driving tours are still in their infancy.
The market is expected to reach trillion dollars, accounting for 60% of the total domestic tourism.
In 2016, 4.44 billion people visited the country, accounting for about 60% of total domestic tourism, and the market is expected to reach trillion by 2020.
According to statistics from the China Traveling Boat Association, the number of people travelling by self-driving car has been growing steadily for the past five years, with the number of people travelling by car accounting for more than half of the number of domestic tourists.
At the same time, the emerging field of self-driving cars has received greater attention and support from the regions and countries, with a strong focus on policy regulations related to self-driving cars, RVs and camping tourism from 2016 to 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourism Administration, the National Sports Directorate, jointly released the development plan for the development of the Autonomous Sports Camps of Jaya; in the same month, the Jaya was highlighted in the promotion of rural tourism development and upgrading action plan of 14 departments, including the Ministry of Finance and the Development Commission.
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of self-driving cars in the country.
Self-driving clubs are not profitable, and the entire industry chain is key
While the potential for the domestic self-driving market is enormous and the national policies are actively guided, the self-driving tourism industry is still in its early stages.
According to the annual development report of the Chinese Autonomous Travel Association 2016-2017, the number of autonomous travel clubs, auto clubs, car clubs and car clubs in China is in the thousands, but the proportion of self-organized travellers is the largest, with only about 15% of visitors attending the various organizations such as the Autonomous Travel Association and the Autonomous Travel Club.
At the same time, online travel companies and traditional travel agencies that develop autonomous self-driving products are also a number, with many online travel platforms selling only self-driving products provided by some suppliers, and some self-driving clubs are also important suppliers.
The self-driving tour is organized in a variety of ways, including cooking, living, walking, traveling, shopping, entertainment, high fragmentation, heavy upstream supply chains, and random consumption by tourists.
Li Chang-jeong, founder and CEO of Beijing Tianjin Automobile Club, believes that self-driving clubs are essentially similar to travel agencies, with early main profitable models being mainly online activities, with the focus on self-driving route products and frontline services.
However, today, the line products in the autonomous driving sector are seriously homogenous, the level of service in the front line is disparate, and autonomous driving clubs face the need for a new transformation.
It can be seen that self-driving is not an independent industry in itself, but rather a cross-regional ecosystem of industries with its self-driving metaphorical characteristics, which is crucial for the formation of a complete industrial chain.
Experts note that experience is a more important consumption element than basic tourism consumption.
Therefore, the development of the self-driving tourism industry should enhance the experience features, develop the self-driving tourism + theme and the IP of self-driving tourism products.
The scenic paths are not just roads, the car camps should not be just for dining.
In the face of the rise of self-driving, the development of the basic support for self-driving is also relatively minor.
Li Chunjie pointed out that the tourist landscape path is not just a road, but it needs to integrate elements of transport and tourism, but the road repair and tourism itself are two sectors responsible, the transport sector adds tourism elements, but also stays in the construction of toilets, consultation centers, propaganda sheds and other facilities, and the combination with tourism is not high.
The construction experience is worthwhile, as opposed to the well-known self-driving routes that cross the US 66 highway.
Landscape design is no longer the quickest route from start to finish, but follows the concept of driving experience fun to provide the best possible enjoyment of the scenic views along the road for self-driving tourists; it connects pointed and facial tourist landscapes, preserving the historical and cultural value of ecotourism resources along the route, and hosting thematic activities to increase tourist participation and leisure experiences, creating economic benefits for local tourism.
Apart from the scenic trails, the campground is also an important support facility for self-driving.
But few consumers choose to stay in the campsite among self-driving tourists, as the New York Times knows.
They believe that many camps are oriented towards infrastructure, which can only be satisfied with food, not high quality, single products, and cannot meet the needs of self-driving cars that contain many elements.
Some industry insiders who did not want to reveal their name said that many of the companies that have been camping in the past few years were to land, land, and afterwards, the infrastructure construction and services of the latter stages of support were not followed, many operating conditions were at a loss, and without the latter stage of investment, it was difficult to make any corresponding support products.
Consumer groups
According to data released by the China Cruise Ship Association in 2017, the age-specific self-driving tourism population is 21-40 years old, with a predominantly 31-40 year-old population, with a certain economic base, a higher demand for personalized tourism and more for child-friendly tourists.
According to the housing survey, the self-driving population is relatively more likely to prefer non-standard accommodation.
In terms of self-driving, surrounding self-driving is the most common type of self-driving, accounting for 84.32% of all drivers.
The number of people who have been out of the country for a long time is very small.
At the same time, as consumer demand has increased, tourists who used to enjoy self-driving tours have started to shift their minds to not just taking photos and sleeping in their cars while driving, but to focus more on the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs used disguise to hide from enemies
At first glance, it is terrifying, but it looks like a statue.
Researchers have published the first results of a study of a biological fossil as large as a rhino discovered by Canadian miners, which suggests that the fossil is well preserved and is therefore known as the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world.
The fossil is so well preserved that it can even be said to have a reddish-brown skin color. This suggests that it has had some troubling experiences.
The related reports in the journal Biology of Contemporary Chemistry describe Chemistry as the best preserved specimen of the Beetle dinosaur ever discovered and one of the best known in the world.
The fossil is a newly discovered species of clawed dragon that lived in the Late Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
The state of preservation is so perfect that researchers were shocked to discover that the shark is truly stunning.
According to the National Geographic magazine, the herbivorous Philaeal dinosaur fossil is the best preserved dinosaur fossil ever found.
On March 21, 2011, the fossil was discovered by Shawn Funk while mining at the Sencore Mill Mine near McMurry Fort in northern Alberta, Canada.
He came across something that seemed like a small rock around him, and he decided to look at it carefully.
The fossils he discovered were then sent to the Royal Canadian Museum of Archaeology in Terre Haute.
It took researchers six years to uncover the beast inside a 2,500-pound (1,100-kilogram) piece of soil in Tibet.
After so much hard work, the final results are now to be announced.
If you look at it, you'll almost believe it's a sleeping cat, says Royal Terrier Museum scientist and first author Caleb Brown.
The monkey will be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science - the Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world.
Researchers have found that the herbivore, although armored, is similar to a walking tank, but is potentially threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The dinosaurs, which were heavily armored, used red and white disguises to hide from predators and used a cloaking technique known as the "paddle-backed-paddle" technique, which is also used by many modern animals.
Experts say that this way it is better integrated with its surroundings, avoiding enemies, suggesting it was preyed upon by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature, a member of the cetacean family, made headlines in May and is currently on display at the Royal Thirill Archaeological Museum.
After 7,000 hours of careful uncovering the facial features of the giant, Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was a member of the team, is now studying it and naming it the Borealopelta markmitchelli spider.
The samples were preserved in such a perfect manner that Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to record the patterns and shapes of the plates and plates on them.
They discovered the spider vein, a common form of defense in the animal kingdom, which means the back of the species is darker than the color of its sides.
Although the use of the technique is common, the results were surprising, as the dinosaur's body size is far greater than that of the existing animals.
The dinosaur is under pressure from predators to evolve in a favorable direction, allowing it to hide in the shed as a means of survival.
However, most animals that use feedback, such as deer, zebras or seals, are as small and vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the organism is facing real survival stress.
The massive, heavy-duty dinosaurs that were subjected to wild prey showed how dangerous the White-tailed dinosaur was, Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in its larvae also showed that the dinosaur's skin color was red-brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the life traces of the organism, including the stomach contents it retains, to find the final food to eat.
They believe that the dinosaurs fell into the river at death, were then rushed into the sea, and finally sank to the bottom of the sea in a backward manner.
The climate in Alberta was as warm then as it is in southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans may have been deeper inland than they are now.
Brown said: "This knot is truly amazing because it is completely covered by the preserved shell skin and is still preserved in the dimension space, which preserves its original shape".
The species is therefore almost identical in shape to the Paleocene.
You don't have to rebuild it with much imagination; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's asleep.
The Paleocene was a period of large bipedal dinosaurs that roamed the Earth.
Although the dragon was the king of the dinosaurs, it appeared only millions of years after the Beetle. The Beetle may have been killed by some of the Beetle's ancestors.
They include the tall thorny dragon, a giant that weighs up to 6 tons and is 38 feet (11.5 meters) long.
The latest study, published in the journal Biology of Contemporary Cobra, found that scientists believe that the dragon was washed into the sea after his death and then formed mummies in the soil.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink discovered the creature at the Millstone mine near McMurry Fort, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved pelvic dinosaur, complete with skin and armor from the nose to the neck.
The average length of this organism is about 18 feet (5 meters) and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It has two 20-inch-long, pointed horns that protrude from the shoulder.
Researchers believe that the herbivorous Beetle dinosaur was active in what is now western Canada after flooding rivers flooded into the ocean.
However, the dinosaur's burial at the bottom of the sea has allowed its scales to be fully preserved.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remaining skin is still covered with unobstructed aortic plates on the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko writes in the National Geographic Magazine, this conservation is as rare as the middle color.
The more I look at it, the more I find it incredible.
The remaining skin fossils are still covered above the armor that is spotted on the dinosaur skull.
And his right forearm was on his side, and his right hand was upon his side, and his right hand was upon his side, and his right hand was upon his side, and his right hand upon his right hand.
I can figure out the number of metric plates.
The reporter learned that adding natural or plant-based hydrochloric acid, corrosive acid and amino acid additive carriers to the urethane production process can modify the performance of traditional uricans, and the utilization of hydrochloric acid uricans, hydrochloric acid uricans, and wheat grains uricans increased by 5 to 10 percentage points over ordinary uricans.
Environmentally friendly, crop-growing potential is evident, especially large-particle urine-added, which is a quality raw material for BB fertilizers.
The total number of security personnel is twice as many as the number of security personnel at the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest ever UN Security Initiative.
Previously, the Brazilian government said that a total of 85,000 soldiers and police would be in the joint fight, including 20,000 soldiers and 65,000 police officers.
Most of the troops will be responsible for the defence of the Olympic venues, while the new 3,000 troops will be responsible for security at international airports, metro stations and streets.
Police patrolled other parts of the city, including the subway, buses and streets.
It is reported that 6,000 soldiers have arrived in Rio for the Olympic security services.
In addition to being responsible for the four Olympic venues in Rio, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport and the main roads connecting the airport and the Olympic Stadium.
The introduction of the assessment mechanism in the service sector is not new, and it is important to make the assessment mechanism more effective and effective.
How do radicals learn to answer the question: Whose streets are they blocking?
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Farrell was left in a state of shock and anxiety.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis native sat on a bed that Peter had rented and browsed Facebook on his cell phone.
She accidentally found a post from a high school student.
The above text reads: "The police just killed an 18-year-old boy who was lying in the street".
She was confused to discover that no one else posted the message on the messaging.
A user of @TheePharoah kept pushing her for the Dynamic Times.
A live Twitter feed of the death of rapper Michael Brown from the St. Louis area. Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black man, was shot and killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying in the street, his body lying in the street for four hours.
I'm crazy, you know.
But death is not new to her and to the community she lives in.
She dropped her phone and didn't open her Twitter again until later that night, reading about the crowd gathering on Camfield Avenue.
There was a police video and a photo of people screaming, and there was a photo of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, and it said: "The Dufferson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a message message being sent on the scene, where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
She said in another video that another policeman held up his rifle and shouted: "Oh, I'm going to kill you all... cattle".
The first time I saw the video was in the video, and I was surprised to see the video.
I'm not sure if this is a typical murder.
I was so shocked that I was not able to get out of the house.
I was angry and crying.
She made a flight back and returned home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's home and decided to leave for Ferguson the next morning.
Over the next three years, what happened between Farrell and Ferguson was the subject of a new documentary released in theaters on August 11th, titled Whose Streets Are the Streets?
It's a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the perspective of people living in the community, crowded with streets and demanding answers.
While Farrell and her daughter (who were riding to Ferguson with flowers and crown jewels) re-discussed the many topics they had discussed before that morning - the myths about black experiences and the condition of black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you that black people had to fight for their faith?" she recalled.
We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is wrong.
I had to take her, Bo Ferrell later said.
What happened today is the climax of everything in the past.
She wants to know, see and get out of it.
She needs to develop not only well in terms of extremism and organization, but also to understand the different levels of black experience and the condition of black people, and to understand what we must do to gain freedom and liberation.
Even though I was fortunate enough to give her a racist experience she hadn't experienced in person, she was no different from any other black girl.
If I protect her in this case, I feel like I'm hurting her.
They arrived at Ferguson's first station, which was located across the street from the South Florida Police Station. The militants waited until the result of the final indictment of Officer Darren Wilson, and the site became their camp.
Ferrell and her daughter contacted a local business owner who made bag-like lunches.
They prepared bags and were responsible for delivering the bags to the protesters.
Slowly, Farrell began to form a new kind of activism.
She said that her radicalism changed dramatically after August 9. While she was an undergraduate at St. Louis State University, Missouri, she was president of the National Association of Minority Nursing Students, which focused on the issues of food justice and health disparities in the black community.
I have no organizational experience.
It's all coming together.
A few weeks later, Farrell met the film's co-director, Sabah Foleyann, during a night parade.
Foleyann said she and her director Lucas Alvarado Faledo were just trying to document what happened to her.
And the question that comes to Farrell's mind is: "Do you want to record or find a story that you can use?"
This suspicion comes from many of these cases: people - usually white - come into a community to benefit from its suffering and hardship.
As Foleyyan explained in a recent interview, well, we hear that people who grow up in Ferguson don't focus their voices, and we want to do it in a different way.
Foleyyan has been in contact with co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism against death row inmates.
His involvement led Ferrell and six other locals to join the Who's Who of the Street? gang, which has been on the move for years after Brown was shot.
The documentary is not about anyone speaking for us or talking to us, it's about us.
I'm focused on how these characters are presented, because that's how I'm presented.
Although the goal was not to focus on Farrell's experience with the film, but to show that the campaign was not about the Savior's leader, but about the community's cohesion, Foleyann said that the film proved to be the most open-minded of the participants.
The result is the street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who? The street of who?
I felt naked, and when I first saw the finished product, I laughed.
But I understand that doing this job and making black people human requires a certain degree of vulnerability.
In addition, Farrell's story reaffirms and re-locates the role of Black Quool women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the shooting of black teenager Trevor Martin in 2012 - have been labeled cool.
The Black Quool women in the leadership of the Yankees generally supported the movement, and Yankees are fighting on multiple fronts, according to Ferrell.
Black cool women have to put up with all this.
Foleyyan agrees and mentions that the campaign was actually supported by black women and many black cool women.
Because of her identity, Farrell was chosen as the center of the film. However, she insisted that it was not a positive action for the matter.
She is the one who inspires this energy, she said.
And while she's on the front lines, it's no coincidence. Because in the intersection of these lives, as a black cooler, you have a lot to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy.
Meanwhile, news cameras have long since disappeared in Ferguson, but tense racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell was sentenced to more than two and a half years in prison for trying to block the highway during a march.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in what she calls her home: a mess.
Despite this, she has been holding on to the sacred songs she has been trying to memorize since walking down Ferguson Street three years ago.
We have a responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing left to lose except the lock on our body.
In fact, online translation services were available on the Internet a decade ago, and long ago, there was talk about the possibility of machine translation replacing humans.
Similarities: The artist uses DNA portraits of Chelsea Manning to create a portrait of her.
In the center of the exhibition at the Freedman Museum in New York, there are several faces: white, black and brown, with almost imperceptible similarities between each, linked by lines that descend from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea Manning to send her cheek cotton and hairbrushes.
Manning sent haircuts from Livinworth Prison after leaking classified diplomatic cables via the WikiLeaks website, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
The exhibition opened on August 2 and was titled "The Similarities of the Potatoes".
This was the result of two years of communication between Duffy Huggard and Manning, who combined her subject with herself in technology, computer science and art, while Manning was a prominent dissident who had been jailed and had sex reassignment surgery in prison.
By algorithmically analyzing Manning's DNA, and creating 30 portraits of the most likely outward appearance of the mole, Heather Duway Habogg makes a sharp and somewhat ruthless comment. His comments are both multi-sensitive about DNA and about the concept of identity itself.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, admitted to being a woman in his teens. He was convicted in 2013 of 20 counts of espionage, 6 counts of fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photo, a black and white particle-sensitive selfie, she looked obviously restless, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a fake pink gold hair.
In 2015, Heather Duway Habogg had a huge success in her 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In that work, she used court evidence from cigarettes and candy to create a 3D portrait of a person that might look similar to that of a person from DNA extracted from a shroud.
She was just about to receive an email from Paper magazine.
They wanted to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and need a portrait, Heather Duway Habogg told the media at the opening ceremony of the exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea Manning could not visit or take pictures, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned boyfriend, Jones, became unlikely friends, exchanging many letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book titled The Suppression of the Head by Shoili Kanungo. The comic book anticipates the president granting Manning privileges to see the exhibition in prison.
Obama asked for her release days after the book was published. This may have been a coincidence, as Manning was in his seventh year at a Kansas military prison.
The exhibition also has a deeper dimension, as the Trump administration in the United States continues to wage war on government leakers and transgender military personnel while also finding new ways to play it cool on Twitter to openly incite division, and the exhibition is about to bridge that divide.
When asked about all this special time, Heather Duway Habogg said that everything happens for a reason.
In a statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's signature, the supernumerary, below (painted with a heart in his name), calls for an end to the clashes between the parties based on gender, sexual orientation and culture.
On the wall opposite is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, with the symbols Cs,Gs and As written in a twisted pencil.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleic acids, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heather Duway Habogg hoped to express that humans are at least physically that way by drawing these strikingly similar portraits.
I hope people get out of this mess, that our genomes don't care who we are, how publicly available genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is.
The DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so here are 30 of them.
The last work in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page in the novel in the illustration above.
The film shows a Kim Jong-un-shaped Manning floating under the American soldiers' amplifiers.
Oh, when they stop your speech, they win, oh, they write on the wall.
So, please, don't shut up.
The content comes directly from a letter she wrote to me.
I'm scared again, and I still have to say it.
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person, as predicted in the comic, but when she does, she will be cheered by her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters in the center of the exhibition.
This was also purposeful, as all items in the exhibition reached the height of her genetic monopoly information written in pencil (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
I've hung them on walls in the past, but I hope they feel like a bunch of people, DuVernay Hagueburg says when he talks about portraits.
But I wanted them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just like they were protesting for her release.
Northwestern University professors and Oxford staff wanted for murder
Police say a man was found stabbed to death in a Chicago luxury apartment, a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were later searched, and a nationwide search for suspects is underway.
Cook County court records show that Wyndham LaSalle, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were sentenced to life in prison without parole for first-degree murder in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Durandrow on Monday.
According to documentary records, 26-year-old Corneille Durand Loine died from multiple stab wounds.
According to a community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department, the bodies were found on July 27.
Police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment after receiving a call and found multiple cracks on the victim.
Police said that Cornell Durandello was killed on the spot, and detectives were investigating his murder, while police were actively looking for two suspects.
LeChem has been an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cowbec, vice president of campus relations, said in an email statement that Leshem had been dismissed and banned from the campus of Northwestern University.
Mr. Kovic said that the case is now a criminal one, and the authorities are investigating it, and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for Somerville College, Oxford University, said in an email statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are always ready to assist the US investigative services when needed.
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped he would be able to file a complaint himself.
Anthony Guerrelli, chief liaison officer of the Chicago Police Department, said he strongly encouraged the suspects to surrender to authorities.
Guerrelli said the police had a rough idea of where they were going and we were working to locate possible locations.
Gürelmi said that local, regional and national authorities are doing their best to help search the suspects.
Guerrilla said police received a call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager, who had just received a secret tip that something was happening in apartment 1008.
The police said the situation was appalling.
Gürelmi said it was not clear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He said that security cameras confirmed that Lesem and Warren were in the building at the time.
"We believe Professor Lacem has a connection with the victims", said Mr. Tangerelli.
The Grand Plaza management team issued a statement to residents saying: "The Yang police are currently investigating the timeline and background of the victims' cases, investigating various motives, including possible domestic incidents".
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said that we will soon complete the roadmap of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it would not be long before the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) would restore the remaining standards for the right to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
The implementation of the roadmap standard has reached a certain stage, and RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).
WADA's roadmap has been updated in this regard, Mr. Mutuko said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko made the above statement in his commentary on the World Anti-Doping Agency's Roadmap for compliance with the Regulation in Part II. This section sets out the criteria for restoring RUSADA's rights and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the standard does not contain anything that could cause Russian concern.
He added that everything had already been announced and everything would be implemented.
The results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian anti-doping agency must publicly accept the findings of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into the use of doping in its sport by the Russian state.
Speaking about the incident, Mutko said: "Well, we are investigating and our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed".
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind it, and we will not admit something that does not exist.
Mutko's words were in response to the words of Vitali Smirnov, head of the Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission of Russia.
Smirnov acknowledged the problems that the Russian anti-doping agency had in the past, but added: "We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and provisions".
No one is planning to accept the report unconditionally, says Pons Milnov.
Following the November 2015 doping scandal, WADA suspended RUSADA's right to conduct doping testing within Russia.
However, in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate the inspections under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director-General Olivia Nigri, during a visit to the organization's Moscow headquarters in July, said that RUSADA was moving in the right direction and working to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it's chess or national chess, defeating humans was out of the question decades ago.
In an interview, Croatian Football Association President Davou-Suk said that the China Cup is important for Croatian football, and the prize money for the China Cup is very large.
The price of the product is now over 8,000, and there are no tariffs on it.
During a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, the Ministry of Commerce press spokesman, Shikman, said that as of now, 15 free trade agreements have been implemented in China, involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 products with zero tariffs on imports.
At the same time, the imported cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean red wine, tropical fruits from ASEAN... you need to buy these products without spending a lot of money.
Currently, China has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, 15 of which have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 products with zero tariffs on imports.
For example, with the implementation of the Free Trade Agreement, consumers can taste agricultural products of different origins and quality in four quarters of the year.
For example, tropical fruits such as durian, pomegranate, and oranges in ASEAN, import duties were reduced from 15% to 30% to zero.
The import tariff on salmon from Iceland has been reduced from 10% to 12% to zero;
Red wine in Georgia and Chile, import duties reduced from 14% to 30% to zero;
New Zealand also has significantly lower taxes on agricultural products such as beef and dairy.
For example, the import tariff on some cosmetics in Switzerland has been reduced to zero for industrial products.
The import duties on some watches have been reduced by 50% and will be reduced to zero in a few years;
South Korea has reduced tariffs on imports of products such as electric refrigerators, electric cookers, massagers, beauty products by 40% and will reduce them to zero in a few years;
The government has also cut taxes on consumer electronics and other consumer products.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the FTA also include intermediate products and raw materials needed to manufacture many domestic terminal consumer products, which also contributed to some structural upgrades in domestic consumer products.
The Ministry of Commerce's press spokesman, Kunjung, said that almost a third of China's total imports could benefit from the preferential tariff treatment of the Free Trade Agreement, most of which are terminal consumer goods, which bring real benefits to consumers.
Further reduction of tariffs on imports of consumer goods
Since 1 December 2017, China has adjusted tariffs on imports of certain consumer goods, further lowering tariffs on imports of consumer goods, covering all types of consumer goods, including food, healthcare products, medicines, everyday products, clothing, shoes, household appliances, cultural entertainment, daily grocery, and a total of 187 8-digit tariffs.
The average tax rate on these consumer goods will drop from 17.3% to 7.7%, almost frozen!
On 1 January 2018, China also made some adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
Import duties on some cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shadow, perfume were reduced from 10% to 5%;
The reduction of tariffs means that consumers will no longer have to buy foreign products they like, and no longer have to run far to buy them abroad.
The 2018 Yiwu Import Shopping Festival: Red wine, snacks, fruits and vegetables are all cheap!
Foreign News: US retail regulations differ at the end of the year: shopping and returns must be cautious
China's new network
According to the US daily The World, Christmas is just around the corner and the return of the goods is on the way.
According to ABC, more than half of the merchandise sold at Christmas last year was returned.
In addition, readers have repeatedly reported that online purchases have been deceived, and consumers need to be more careful when shopping on informal sites.
In general, large shopping companies have a formal and reasonable return procedure, but it is necessary to be careful if you buy gifts or e-commerce purchases from some small shops.
Ms. Hou of Rolongon bought a jacket at an online store that sells printed coats on December 1st, and has not yet been delivered.
She sent an email to the client and did not receive a reply.
Another netizen, who went on a US tour last year to buy a mobile phone from a third-party seller, found a box of leather mud inside.
The first is that the website is a good place to get a refund.
However, some customers believe that the website's refund service is not 100% perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident of Northern California, said he had purchased an emergency delivery service from a website twice, with an emergency service of four yuan, but both times it was not delivered on time.
The government has also requested a refund and no response.
The government has a better return policy in large shopping malls and shopping malls.
Most of the merchandise is fully refunded within 180 days.
However, goods must be kept in the original silk shape and must have a purchase certificate such as receipt or bank purchase record.
If the customer does not have a certificate, they can also get points from the store, which can be used to buy other goods.
Target has a 90-day return period for general merchandise, and electronic merchandise typically has a 15-day return period.
However, the return period for electronic and entertainment goods purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017 has been extended to 30 days.
It is worth noting that the 30-day refund period is from December 25, i.e. it must be returned before January 25, 2018.
Extreme shopping experience, new era of shopping in the business world
More than a decade ago, our country was still in the seller's market in general, with limited choice and limited demand.
But after a decade of development, the market has already achieved a shift from the seller's market to the buyer's market, and today's consumers have become more tasteless, no longer satisfied with the simple act of handing money to hand delivering the bucket.
The next challenge for real estate developers is how to get consumers a shopper experience that is extremely competitive.
Among the many factors that affect the consumer shopping experience, the impact of shopping centers in the business world is the most significant.
See how city builders around the world are focusing on shopping experiences.
There are no two perfectly identical leaves in the world, nor are there two perfectly identical shopping malls, and a famous shopping mall must have its own characteristics.
The unique wave-shaped architectural design inspired by the Grand Canyon, which is named after the canyon, is a classic example of a 200-meter walk through the canyon's central pedestrian zone.
In addition to the canyon-style design, the mall also features a large, elliptical performance space facing the cabinet, which is unique in appearance and often hosts special performances.
The open platform design allows visitors to walk on each floor to view the activities taking place in the canyon's gorge and has the effect of changing the landscape.
In China, the first forest-style walking shopping mall is located in Nanjing Forest Mall, a shopping and eco-friendly, fairy tale-friendly street.
The project consists of 9 single-storey buildings, with aerial corridors connecting the buildings, a total submerged courtyard design, French oak trees on the ground, rooftop water platforms, creating a forest feel.
Walking into Forest Moor, like a slump in Alice's wandering adventure, is like walking into a cave, with trees along the rocks surrounding the building, the grasslands, the springs, and bringing people into a forest full of life and energy.
The company also plans to launch more than 50 international flagship specialty stores, 100 international top brands and more than 500 domestic and foreign brands, which will become a business center for the service industry.
Not only this, but the Lijiang Aquarium business community is also integrating the ecosystem into the building, guided by TOD public transport, bringing together fashion shopping, lifestyle services, catering, entertainment, education, sports, while bringing consumers a very intense shopping experience, leading them to enjoy the unique culture of water in Chongqing, perfectly blending shopping with water entertainment and leisure.
Overall, it is clear that some housing companies are already aware of the trajectory of this new urban commercial discovery, and industry experts say that this consumer-centric model of how to combine shopping with experience will also be a mainstream trend in future urban development.
Today's business world is not only a place of merchandise but also a place of artistic culture and creative themes, and people are responsible for urban living.
Thus, while meeting the demands of consumers to eat, drink and play and buy one-stop-shop materials, maximizing the spiritual demands of cultural art at multiple levels, to fulfil the demands of living in a livable environment, is bound to be a high point in the future development of the business world.
In Chongqing, Jiangsan, on the northern shore of the Qinghai, the land is located in Jiangsu, near the Beijing Bridge, the world's commercial elite, international giants around the circle, first-class brands unite, and close to international fashion.
The people of the land are prosperous and have the luxury of the world.
East China Jinjiang, which has a better shopping environment, is close to the South China Sea business district, and has a unique four-level, even nationally-leading, triple-deck transportation system, which improves shopping comfort.
The landscape of the two walkways of Hwa Road and Wanda Square has been upgraded, with about 300 sho-ji cultivated, 40,000 square meters of landscaped landscaping and a new business district.
The Long Lake Aquarium, near Chongqing's first low-density aquarium, is surrounded by nine parks, low density commercial blocks, high opening, making people more willing to stop, stay, and enjoy shopping, rather than being caught up in the rush of people behind them, and really making walking shopping a reality.
Today, the competition is only getting fiercer, and how to kill a bloodline in a highly homogenous market to win the reputation of a shopping sanctuary in the hearts of future consumers is worth thinking seriously about.
It is far from enough to have a differentiated strategy alone, and only developers who really care about consumers, who are in a hurry, who want what consumers think, who offer consumers a very intense and concise shopping experience can laugh in a stormy market.
Of course, I would like to say that the people of Chongqing, who have such a great shopping experience and business circle, have been so happy that no one could have imagined the prosperity of today 10 years ago.
Consumerism's rampage covers up real environmental prices
The total amount of consumption by the users of the company was 16.82 billion yuan, which was on November 11, 2017, within 24 hours of the global celebration of the Gala of the Tomb Raider Twelve.
Specifically, in just three minutes after the launch of the T211 game, the T211's turnover exceeded 10 billion yuan, and in 6 minutes and 05 seconds it exceeded 20 billion yuan, and in 9 hours it hit 100 billion yuan.
On this day, the total number of payments made by consumers worldwide reached 1.48 billion, up 41% from last year.
These consumption will lead to 812 million logistics orders.
The company is owned by Maun's Ali Group, and the company is a subsidiary of Maun's Alibaba Group.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that the single youths' self-mockingly created "Pink Hockey Festival" would be organized by the e-commerce industry and become the current "Pink Hockey 11" shopping festival.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used its first promotional campaign for the Hockey Day: No one talks to you about love, so go online and buy it.
The result was surprising: the transaction amount of the Taobao Commercial Bank (formerly the TNT) surpassed 52 million yuan, which was 10 times the daily amount of transactions at the time.
Since then, Tomb Raider 11 has become Alibaba's shopping festival, from the beginning of domestic buyers and sellers entertainment to the arrival of global merchants, nine years later, Tomb Raider 11 billion transactions have been more than 3,200 times that year, making Black Friday look like a bustling night.
The company is also the largest e-commerce company in the world, with the largest number of e-commerce companies selling the same products as the Windy Tattles.
The company has its own shopping savings of 6.18 tonnes, but no significant impact on the 11 tonnes, and this year, from November 1 to 11, the total sales of the company reached 12.71 billion yuan.
The first two episodes of the series were released in the United States on December 11, and the second season followed by a similar episode of the same name, the Christmas shopping season.
The Chinese consumer is waiting for the New Year, the year before the Spring Festival, the Valentine's Day shopping period, the consumption, not the vacation.
The environmental problems caused by the sudden consumption of bulk have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua Daily Telegraph, according to a standard conservative estimate of 0.2 kg per packaging container in the industry, at least 300,000 tons of garbage was generated during the year.
Liu Hua, director of the Green and East Asia Division's Pollution Control Project, told China Foreign Dialogue that orders for TNT alone this year will produce 160,000 tons of packaging garbage.
The National Postal Service released a report in 2016 that noted that the number of fast pieces in the 2015 T-shirt 11-11 (November 11-16) was about 780 million, using more than 3 billion weaving bags, 99.22 million packaging containers, 16.985 million cubic meters of ribbon, and the length of the ribbon could be around the Earth's equator by 425 rounds.
This year, the National Postal Service expects the fast-moving business of the Dual 11 tonne to exceed 1.5 billion units.
Wang, a manager at a Beijing waste incineration center, told Xinhua that the daily amount of garbage entering the city after the 11 tons of Zhuangdu is more than 2,000 tons, which is more than the capacity of the incineration station.
The company has already realized that the environmental pollution caused by the courier industry is not neglected.
Some e-commerce logistics companies, including Suning, have introduced recyclable plastic courier boxes for reuse, reusable as shopping bags and recycled packaging bags for garbage bags, but the acceptance rate among troubled consumers is not high.
Ma Yun also called on the global food industry to support the green packaging and logistics industries of the country.
The tweet received over 68,000 praise and appreciation.
What kind of mobile payments do Germans want?
Zhang Winter: The mobile payments campaign in Germany is not promising.
WeChat's payments and payments are just moving the battlefield to Europe, the competition is not changing, the takeover of positions is not changing the Chinese, is it globalization?
Where there is a payment, there must be a WeChat payment.
In accordance with an agreement with German e-payment provider Wirecard, WeChat Payment officially launched in Germany in November this year and is being rolled out to merchants across Europe.
The two countries have been at odds for a long time, and this is a strange thing happening in Europe.
Paypal and WeChat have always been on the road to globalization.
For the globalization of mobile payments in China, AIR Consulting Group's China Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Research Report 2017 summarizes two aspects: one is through strategic investment, experience outputs, investments and support for domestic mobile payments businesses abroad.
The second is the promotion of mobile payment services to foreign merchants through the consumption behaviour of Chinese tourists abroad, which changes the perception and acceptance of Chinese mobile payments in foreign countries.
The Chinese are really good at it.
China's economic growth is rapid, and in addition to its large population base, Chinese tourists spend a tempting number in Europe.
But this is also bound to be the unlikely outcome of the Chinese mobile payments campaign that has been launched in Germany.
Is it just a matter of moving the battlefield to Europe, the competitors unchanged, the stakes unchanged, or the Chinese, which is globalization?
The more pioneering question is whether China's mobile payments can be used in mainland Europe.
The German government is a very powerful force.
The new retail bottle is being cast with magic
Chen Zhen, Chen Zhen: Amazon is entering the top 10 retailers in the world when it announces its entry into bookstores and grocery stores, and it's worth playing with, whether it's the time or the motivation.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two in Portland and San Diego.
Amazon opened a store in New York in early 2017 and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
At about the same time, Amazon announced that its Amazon Go will be running, with customers not having to queue, check in, or scan the door, and the purchase amount will be automatically deducted from their Amazon account as soon as they get the goods they want.
For Amazon, the frequency of sudden activity in physical stores in recent years has been a very unexpected thing.
As CEO Jeff Bezos stressed in a 2007 open letter to shareholders, Amazon will not open a physical store without meeting the following four conditions:
1. We must be sure that this new opportunity will yield a return on shareholder investment;
2. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of significant significance to the whole company;
3. We must ensure that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
4. We must ensure that we have sufficient resources in this market to make customer-oriented differentiation.
The bookstore and grocery store are the most volatile of the two retail entities and the first to fall behind Amazon after its rise.
Amazon is announcing its entry into the two physical markets as it squeezes into the top 10 retailers in the world, and it's worth playing with, whether the timing is right or the motivation.
Is Amazon's practice contrary to the assurances in the letter to the shareholders?
Similar sounds were heard from the other side of the world. On the morning of October 13, 2016, Ma Yun, chairman of Alibaba's board, delivered a keynote address at the 2016 Hangzhou Yunnan Conference.
He said: "From next year onwards, Alibaba will no longer mention the e-commerce boom".
The era of pure e-commerce is coming to an end, and in the next 10 or 20 years, there will be no e-commerce, replaced by new retail stores.
The combination of offline and logistics will create new retail.
For a time, the new retail label was like magic, and was frequently hung on the mouths of industry people.
But what does it mean to have a new retail bottle?
The concept is not new if only the index line is combined with the subline.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked 180 of the largest e-commerce companies, estimating total e-commerce sales at around $200 billion, with the largest 25 of them accounting for more than $159 billion.
Of the 25 retailers, 18 have only started online in the last five years - traditional retailers like Macy's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.
The Alibaba Group has also invested 28.3 billion yuan in Suning Yun business.
Globally, retailers and e-commerce are moving from a single channel to a full-channel retail system covering physical stores, e-commerce, mobile devices and social media.
Is Ma'an suggesting a new retail bubble, more of a summary than a vision for the future?
If not, what difference does the whole-channel concept have between the new retail box and the new one?
Perhaps the key to the problem is not whether online and offline will merge, but how.
Looking back at the last 20 years of retail, the rise of e-commerce, as well as the rise of discount retailers in the early years, has focused on prices and convenience.
Depending on these two points, e-commerce has moved products with very high standards, such as books and CDs, from offline to online.
With the adoption of online consumer habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, e-commerce has expanded its reach to other brands and started to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, Liu used the ideas and technologies of the Internet to comprehensively reform and upgrade the total of the existing 30 trillion social retailers, to effectively meet the increasing consumption needs of Chinese consumers, and to make the entire process of production, distribution and service more efficient due to the widespread use of the Internet and big data.
The road to e-commerce is therefore a road to light assets, which are actually heavy assets.
The burden of loading is not as great as traditional retail, as the burden of fixed assets, personnel deployment, management processes, etc. Loading is a huge investment in logistics, storage, etc.
The changes in the way logistics are done have ensured the high efficiency of e-commerce.
According to Chinese government website, Premier Li Keqiang, who presided over the State Council's regular meeting on April 28, said that expanding domestic consumption demand was an important step in steady growth and restructuring.
The meeting determined that the relevant departments should work on the development of specific programmes based on scientific evaluation.
The country has launched a pilot of reducing import tariffs on some of the goods used in the country and abroad, which are in high demand for domestic consumers, and has gradually expanded the range of goods that are subject to the reduction of tariffs by the end of June this year.
Combining tax reforms, improving consumption tax policies on consumer goods such as clothing, cosmetics, and collecting, and harmonizing the scope, rates and charges;

Sony has often launched various black tech products, such as the flagship 4K reflective supershort-focused first-person shooter launched earlier this year.
Of course, the price of such high-end products in the atmosphere is also unfortunate, with 5 million yen equivalent to 250,000 yuan, which is enough to buy a car.
Large-size luxury TVs have been representative of the technological strength of the major manufacturers, and the award-winning 77 inch curved 4K OLED TVs with soft-core LGs are typical of this type of product.

Triumph (安芬) has accurately grasped the key to this problem and developed a new Magic Wire underwear.

On January 18, Alibaba held an e-commerce poverty alleviation summit in Chongqing, announcing that it will promote precision de-poverty and rural revitalization by exploring a new model of internet+ poverty alleviation.
This is after the development of rural strategy, the launch of rural Taobao projects, the online platform for rural poverty alleviation, the establishment of the Alibaba poverty alleviation fund, Ali once again has been a vocal critic of the fight against poverty.
The fight against poverty is one of China's most important national strategies today.
The total elimination of poverty in China has not been achieved in the last few millennia.
The e-commerce poverty alleviation is an innovative initiative in the new phase of poverty alleviation development, and is an important catalyst for achieving precise poverty alleviation and eradication.
The Centre attaches great importance and points out that the Internet can play a role in helping to eradicate poverty, pushing for precise poverty alleviation, precise eradication of poverty, and getting agricultural products out of the countryside through the Internet.
As a result, Ali has already put forward a rural strategy in 2014, which combines big data cloud computing and globalization as the three core strategies for Ali's next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Taobao Project, recruiting small-scale taobao in rural areas to lead farmers out of poverty through e-commerce.
In 2017, Ali worked with the business sector to create the Xinjiang Farmers Poverty Alleviation Channel, which now connects 13 provinces and 120 national poverty-stricken counties across the country.
The Taobao village, which was born in Ali platform, has 2,118 villages.
Of these, nearly 400 are in provincial poverty counties and 33 are in poverty counties in 13 countries.
In 2017, sales of Taobao Village across the country reached 120 billion yuan on Alibaba China retail platform.
Zhang Yong said that in the face of the national strategy to fight poverty, Ali has been thinking about how to use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovation capabilities of the wealthy Ali economy to find a new way to break poverty.
Among them, Murat Tao is the main platform for Aly e-commerce poverty alleviation and is leading a new direct-to-direct Internet poverty alleviation link.
In the field of agriculture, villages and villages are jointly supporting agricultural equipment and small loans.
In 2017, among the 832 poorest counties in the country, the company served 795 people, providing them with convenient payments, credit and other services.
Bird is responsible for storage and logistics, the cat cat is responsible for sales, and Aliyu's big data feed guides agricultural production, further improving the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of e-commerce out of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
Ali has launched an e-commerce program through Taobao University to teach farmers standardized, qualitative and scale-up farming methods, which combine poverty alleviation and mental health promotion to achieve sustainable poverty eradication.
These courses have already covered about 92% of the poorest counties at the national level.
The idea of a better public-interest mindset and a better business approach to poverty eradication will also ensure Ali's real goal of poverty alleviation.
Alibaba's chairman Ma Yun said that poverty eradication should be divided into three phases: poverty alleviation, de-poverty and enrichment.
Poverty alleviation is giving people fish, poverty alleviation is giving people fish, wealth is building a fish pond for farmers to feed them.
The e-commerce industry is driven by the production of fish bait.
In the field of industrial poverty alleviation, the Locawa Apple industrial poverty alleviation model, developed by Ali in collaboration with Penceilo, has been replicated and promoted nationwide by relevant departments as a model.
The work of Ali E-Commerce to alleviate poverty has also been recognized by the decision-making body.
E-commerce companies representing Alibaba have been parodied via online channels to ensure that farmers increase their production and revenue.
Some of the people in the village of Koto and the people in the gold dress were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experiences of e-commerce poverty alleviation.
The UN World Food Programme's China office has worked with Muro Tao to help alleviate poverty in the e-commerce industry in Anhui and other places.
The third edition of the New Economic Think tank conference, organized by the Ali Institute, China Visionary Think tank, was held on January 16, with Zhang Li, Director of the Institute of E-Commerce, Ministry of Commerce, attending and speaking.
She believes that we have overlooked the most important issues of globalization, the body and use of globalization and the stages of globalization.
This is why many people think that globalization is stagnant, and that many developed countries and developing countries are changing their attitudes to globalization in the new phase, changing their patterns.
The second concept is the problem of the mid-stage of globalization, and what constraints are there on the mid-stage of globalization?
The economic environment is constrained because the economic environment is changing and globalization is constraining.
Zhang Li believes that global economic adjustment will basically end at the end of 2017 and that the next phase of growth will be product pull after 2018.
The first freshly grown supermarket in Jindong, 7FRESH, is set to open in the near future, with plans to open more than 1,000 stores nationwide over the next three to five years.
Along with Ali's box of fresh meat, the super-species of the evergreen, the fresh meat of the sun, the fresh meat of the mermaid, the new retail store bubbles began to pile up and start to yell at each other for innovation and even prices.
The fight for the upgrades in the fresh supermarket has become a topical topic in the new retail sector.
In 2018, we will be entering the country quickly, and a lot of shops will be opened in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou before Spring Festival.
Box Ma Ma'an-Jin CEO Huang 10 revealed the new strategy for 2018 at the second New Retail Summit.
Since 2018, Box Horse has been a live-in e-commerce business that provides instant service to consumers.
The core model is the flow of experience, and the real sales are online.
Unlike traditional supermarkets, box stalls are a fun and delicious snack bar in the eyes of many consumers, and some intermediaries have even developed the concept of a box bar.
Online e-commerce platforms and offline retailers have their advantages and disadvantages, while consumers are present in multiple channels, so both are trying a full-channel model.
The industry believes that in the context of the large upgrades in consumption, there will be an increase in the number of stores selling boxed horses in 2018.
The box horse has been exploring more consumer spheres from its initial freshness, and this is a sign that the retail market will be more innovative in the new year.
The company's business model, which is integrated with online and offline, has attracted the attention of consumers and has been a popular choice for live shops.
But these relationships say more and more and more and they don't work, and I finally realize that you've brought a great experience to consumers, and I'm willing to pay for it.
In the wake of the recent change in retail, the CEO of Big Bang, who is also the CEO of Fly Bull Net, said that consumer habits and demand have changed.
It was a pure line, a broken line, a line to beat, a line to counter, and now it's a gamble, because consumers don't have a line anymore.
The capitalist conflict has been a source of new retail fireworks, which are currently being sold in fresh produce stores.
The analysis suggests that the current competition for new retail in first-tier cities is far from the Red Sea pattern, and there are still large second-tier cities to be explored, with a lot of opportunities and space available.
The development of new retail will lead to a diversified state of development for different types of industries in the new retail layout.
The Central Bank of China (CBI) has released a report on the annual development of Chinese e-commerce in the country.
What is the Chinese e-commerce scoreboard for the year?
What are the trends in global e-commerce?
We're going to come out one by one and let everyone know.
Total sales again broke record speed and accelerated track
Since 2006, China's online retail has been growing at an incredibly fast pace, and it is estimated that it is cool that online shopping is so fresh and you can buy something without going out.
But since 2013, the growth rate of online retail has started to fall below 50%, from below 40% for the first time in 2015 to 26.2% in 2016.
However, this year's situation is different, with online retail resurgent, and in September this year, the growth rate rose to 34.2%.
The growth rate is much higher than in 2015 and 2016.
Maybe you're going to go around the world and find that buying and buying is more fun.
The company's online retail sales of physical goods are nearly US$5.08 trillion, while services are US$1.49 trillion.
The total retail sales of social goods accounted for 13.6%, an increase of almost 3 percentage points.
The first is that the Internet is a great tool for retailers, and the second is that it is a great tool for the online retailers.
The second most popular online shoppers in France are the fashion-loving country, with per capita purchases of $1,925 per person, and the most online purchases of clothing.
Do you think young people are the favorite people to shop online?
How to help you avoid becoming the next Uber startup
Amy Errett tried to investigate the happiness of her employees at her e-commerce startup, but the investigation was not successful.
The answers are often vague, helpless, or even misleading.
Even though she promised to remain anonymous, some employees still don't trust the process.
Eret, who manages Madison Reed, a San Francisco-based e-commerce retailer of 75 people, said the response to the complaint was inconsistent and unobjective.
So she called outside for help.
A number of new HR startups have emerged, such as the Rainbow and Spring, to help companies understand how employees feel.
They build and authorize software specifically designed to measure employee engagement, allowing companies to rapidly conduct opinion polls for specific teams and demographics, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass executives and report directly to the board.
Now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit? said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint.
Eret said that within three years she had gained more insight into employees' thoughts and feelings with Glint.
In addition to the quick investigation and polls of specific teams, Glint also provided a company hotshot of which units complained the most, which managers approved the lowest, and it was obvious that this allowed her to understand why.
Companies began to realize that they had to master the workplace culture of the company to become the next Uber.
For startups like Glint, the desire to oversee the company is a huge business opportunity.
According to Let's Talk Payments, a financial technology analytics website, the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a Denver, Colorado-based startup dedicated to helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw increased interest and activity in this area during a period of disruption to Uber's reputation earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Apple, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed on as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized diagnostics of urine, collect confidential responses in real time, and view hotspots of their problem areas.
Convercent also offers anonymous text hotlines for employees to report bad behavior.
If the chairman is caught, the complaint will go directly to the board.
Convercent founder and CEO Patrick Kunlan said that the courts of opinion have seized the authority of the regulatory authority.
If a company is found to be unfair to its employees or behaving immorally towards them, even without regulatory intervention, it could face high consequences of consumer objection, employee loss and involvement in lawsuits, Kunlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees in over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure employees understand the working rules and procedures and provide easy ways to contact their headquarters.
Before that, if employees want to report a problem, they must find the company's headquarters phone number or email and make a formal complaint, and hope that the headquarters will take this seriously.
This is often a frightening and disturbing experience, as Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, James Vitrano, says, as he believes there is no good way to track employee complaints.
But now, with Convercent, the company can more quickly identify and address issues previously unknown to executives in distant offices, cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices.
I can get a 360 degree view of the work experience from a closer angle, says Vitrano, who is in charge of the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
We are protecting our shareholders from employment lawsuits.
Kunlan said that after the Andor accounting firm went bankrupt following the Annen scandal, companies have been putting more emphasis on ethics, values and employee engagement since 2002.
But it wasn't until the social media boom came to its own, that companies realized they couldn't stop their outbreak from spreading online.
He said that before the use of technology to monitor ethics, people considered hope as a strategy.
Glint and Convercent both offer their software as a service and charge companies a regular fee for using their products.
This business model and business opportunity is supported by venture capitalists who have already supported the two startups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million in funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness between companies, cultures and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
More and more studies show that today's employees have higher expectations of the workplace than ever before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high-paying and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued, and spent time in a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join a company, feel their voices are heard, and their work is rewarding, they are more committed to making it work", said Nina McCartney, LinkedIn's vice president of global welfare and employee experience.
Investors earn returns when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well when they are employee-loyal and committed.
It is no wonder that third-party analytics tools are committed to increasing employee loyalty and commitment, and they seek financial support.
Workplace culture experts say it is important to have a good grasp of employee engagement data.
However, the data is useless unless the company's administrators take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can be expected that the company is changing.
If the change does not go fast enough or if there is no progress, it can lead to disappointment and lead to employees leaving the company.
Russell Lath, consulting director at Cote International, a business management firm, said: "Well, if you want to get 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations.
Because if we don't follow through, the staff will think, "Hey, do you really hear me?"
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I?
Eret said Madison Reed is now conducting a monthly employee survey and has been able to act on the same day as the Glint reporting issue.
After collecting feedback from employees about how frustrated they were with the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve problems by reorganizing the internal team of the company and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights from its employees who, in the long run, want to make a change in the industry, which is known for its high talent loss rate, and better retain employees.
The first is that the people of the country are not able to make a living from their work, and that they are not able to make a living from their work.
If you lose talent, you lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose the company.

NCAA cancels two training days to extend the daytime training of the Bears
It was nearly 11 p.m. when the UCLA football team was chatting next to the team's new campus practice ground.
Some players have taken off their sports shirts and exposed their bodies to sweating and back pain after their first day of training camp.
For a large part of the team, the few minutes of the empty space are a rest period.
Players who participate in the summer course will return to the dorm after three hours of practice for the final exam, and then return to Wasserman Football Centre for the meeting at 6:30 a.m. the following morning.
The next three days were a grind for the guys, Bears coach Jim Mora said on Monday as he was about to enter Tuesday.
The NCAA canceled two practice sessions per day (intended to ease the burden on players), but actually extended their daytime training - at least until Friday's end.
That's why the first three rounds of training at UCLA are set to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the already crowded schedule.
From cancelling two training sessions a day to more training sessions a day, the Bears began training almost a week before last season, and Mora trained at the summer school for the first time in six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to start 18 games of training on August 20 before preparing for the official game for the first Texas farm workers in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule adjustment, although this would add another program to the player's busy journey.
In the next three or four days, we will give them a huge amount of training, which is very challenging", said Pamora.
They're just passing. They're being trained, they're all great kids.
I thought we'd have more time by Saturday, which is great.
After training camp, UCLA will stop training. Given the clear views of the nearby parking lot and the Luskin Center, this is no easy task. The Luskin Center Senior Hotel has been hit by a football pitch from the defensive net after crossing the goal posts.
The Bears will be staying at the hotel starting this weekend. However, Mora admitted that there could be problems if the rooms are empty during the season.
The government has also announced that the country will take steps to protect the security of the people of the country.
The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in the room and record a training scene is not strong.
If you have a training video tape, it's pretty good.
But we will take security measures there, and we will also take security measures in the parking lot number 8.
We will make the best of our resources.
I'm not worried about that.
We have a plan.
Statistics Australia (ABS) data shows that in the second quarter of this year, the average value of Australian homes increased by 1.5% to 2%, an increase of 3.5% year on year, the lowest annual growth rate since March 2013.
While real estate agents expect to sell more properties during the holiday season, the increase in Australian house prices is at its lowest level since 2013.
The Wall Street Journal reported this morning that AT&T has cancelled plans to sell Huawei's new flagship smartphone in the United States.
Huawei originally planned to announce the partnership this week on CES, but AT&T cancelled it at the last minute.
In response to this, Huawei responded to the news by saying that on January 9, local time in the United States, Huawei will release new products and specific marketing information to the US market.
Huawei said that over the past five years, Huawei has proven its strength by launching high-end products in global and US markets.
According to previous reports from IT House, Huawei will be releasing a smartphone you've never heard of at CES in Las Vegas on the afternoon of January 9th, and the phone's durability will support two days of use.
The industry generally believes that the flagship phone that Huawei is about to release is the Huawei Mate 10 Pro with Android Oreo.
The film, starring Wang Li, a reporter for the Sheep Town Evening News, and Wang Ice-Clan, Guo-Yun, Da-Yun, Zhang Kai-liang and others, "I'm Not a Pan-Lenin" will be released nationwide on September 30.
Yesterday, the film was presented at a symposium on the theme of grief-stricken comedy in Beijing, where three guests, Liu Xiaoping, Ning Xiaoping, and Daeng Xiaoping, attended.
The film is about the creation of a circle, the director is the director, and I am not the Pan-Palin-Mania's special thing, the creation of a circle is a new feeling, especially the round images taken with the shadows of the lens.
The film is about the same subject as the film's director, who is also a director of the film, and it's easy to think of a way to shoot it.
The film was shot in the form of a virtual virtual virtual camera, and the film was shot in a virtual virtual camera.
Facebook will launch fact-checking to combat fake news
Facebook announced Thursday that it would send more potentially malicious articles to third-party detectives and show the results below the original post. Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to crack down on so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, Facebook said it would start using updated machines to learn how to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, and may display the fact check results below the post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main sources of so-called fake news, and many believe Facebook influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, with voters experiencing a flood of fake stories ahead of the French presidential election in May, and Germany having first approved a supporting penalty plan ahead of the September election, which would be punishable if social media networks failed to remove hate posts in time.
Facebook said in a separate statement Thursday that it was launching a new fact-checking feature test in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Sarah Sue, Facebook News Feed's product manager, said in a blog post: "Besides seeing which stories are questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people want more background to help them make informed decisions about what they read and share".
She added that Facebook will continue to test its content-related content-related functionality and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The story of the castle in England
Recently, the small Scotchney Castle has been the main character in a compilation music video and once served as a refuge for Margaret Thatcher's husband during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history in the comfortable location of the Belle River Gorge in Kent, and it is now the inspiration for a graphic novel written by Jamie Rhodes (a Yorkshire man with a special fondness for historical documents).
I can see the writing of 300 years ago, and I find it very beautiful, and I think he always said it with his eyes full.
I'm not sure what kind of human destiny it is to have this letter in my hands.
From the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period, a castle in England reads books on the lives of families living in Scotland, each with stories by different British artists of the future, including Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book to be archived: he also wrote The Tooth of the Dead, 2014 and other stories, a book inspired by British library literature, a work he completed with an uncontrollable creative passion.
He said: "I can't help but feel the urge to write the letter, written by a double agent working for the Jacobites in the 18th century.
That's his fingerprint!
And the letters always smelled like smoke, because you need a fire to have a light.
For us 300 years from now, this smell makes us feel like they are there too.
Oh, I like the archival literature!
For those who are affected by the old paper, it seems amazing to have the support of the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and to have lived in the castle for almost four months (to be honest, I stayed a little longer) and I just can't believe it is true.
Rhodes spent several days visiting Victoria's Neoclassical Castle, browsing the archives, exploring the many treasures and artifacts of the estate, such as the dog's head hanging from the wall, and the centuries-old bottles he spent in the river guarding the castle.
He walked through the land and ruins of the old castle, chatting with vagrants, gardeners, and sometimes with illustrators who painted for him in his books.
Then at night, he would drink some whiskey and write.
Scotney's secret history is not clear, as the National Trust was not fully established until after the death of the last heiress, Elizabeth Hesse, in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rodz arrived, the staff began processing the files, which he described as being the stuff of the nobles hundreds of years ago: "Hey, put it in the attic".
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, map the borders of each country: "Oh, you'd think land disputes would be boring".
Let it go, guys!
Some of the stories in the work, which use the castle as a starting point, lead to a wider study of English history, including The Labourer, which is a clue to a man who left the new castle to participate in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.
The story of the Knights of Kent and Sussex, in the Book of Common Pleas, records a riot in the castle in 1380, Rose said.
The Peasants' Uprising started in that area, and I think it's a good place to start the uprising.
Maybe there's a connection between the two?
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darreels hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the English Reformation.
The story is narrated by the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darryl, who is believed to have given himself a funeral by filling a coffin with stones (his coffin was discovered years later).
The Darrells were the favourite of the Rothes family at Scotch Castle: the Darrells seemed to be a very naive gentleman who always borrowed money and spent money on things they couldn't afford.
Generations of Darryl men have been solving their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I think they should be a group of handsome guys who know how to pursue women.
As his assignment at the castle ended, Rodez began to look for other strange writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness completing a sketch novel about El?m?nm?ki?n, an early 20th-century nursing home that was slowly abandoned.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
I was sad to leave, he said.
It's like, 'Oh, I have to go face the real world with the pitcher.'
According to ZTE News, ZTE's Intelligent Car Team is headquartered in Zhuhai and is operated by ZTE Executive Vice President, Tan Wen-go.
If every major energy company has a huge amount of money, which of the many energy companies in the world is the most profitable?
Yesterday, the renowned PFC Energy Company announced the top 50 energy companies listed in 2011, after U.S. oil and gas producer ExxonMobil won the joint venture with a market capitalization of $40.63 billion, followed by China Oil and the Royal Dutch Shell.
In this list, China Oil has twice been ranked by PFC in 2007 and 2009, with ExxonMobil taking the top spot in the rest of the year.
In the top 50 list in 2011, three companies from mainland China were included, including China Oil, which ranked second, China Petroleum, which ranked ninth, and China Ocean Oil, which ranked 15th.
According to PFC, although oil prices are much higher than they were four years ago, the CEO of PFC Energy noted that there were many reasons for the low total market value, mainly due to falling gas prices in North America and low global stock market activity.
According to Xinhua, the severe polluted weather in Jingxiang and surrounding areas increased from 16 to 19 with the AQI in Hebei, Shijiazhuang, Zhengshan, and Yangtze 3 being the most severe.
U.S. Green Card Amendments
The media quoted President Donald Trump as saying that the United States will launch a new immigration program that will amend green card regulations.
The plan aims to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 per year, and temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications will be limited by stricter regulations.
The new rules were proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in both Houses.
The US media quoted Trump as saying that the bill would reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars by changing the way the US issues green cards to citizens in other countries.
The law will replace the current program to reduce chain migration.
The new application process is conducive to English speakers, who have financial support and who have the skills that are beneficial for economic development.
On May 29, the first China Fireworks Blasting Safety and Environmental Protection Expo will be held in Browyang.
The event, which will be held over two days, will focus on the theme of fireworks technology, safety and environmental protection. The event will bring together the most advanced fireworks machinery in the national fireworks bombing industry, the safest environmental protection fireworks raw materials and new products.
The exhibition will invite a large number of experts and entrepreneurs to exchange academic information about the fireworks industry and share the latest technological achievements in fireworks safety and environmental protection.
Among them, the exhibition of tobacco blasting machinery production equipment and safety environmental protection products will be held in the town of Grand Junction, with the main exhibition projects including technological maturity, the production of tobacco blasting with relevant scientific identification and safety arguments involving pharmaceutical machinery, safe type of fire-fighting agents such as low temperature, low explosive energy, and safe type of personal combustion products such as sulphur-free, micro-smoke.
The fireworks display, organized by the 16 flower cannon companies of Broongyang, will be divided into two phases: product selection and product burning. The exhibition will be held on May 29 at the Flower Armoury and the Golden Cement Fireplace.
Speaking of the upcoming 2017 season, Murray said: "I want to clean up after the tour next year and then get a little more serious and write more new works".
To optimize the landscape environment, to build beautiful Nanyangyu, recently, the Nanyangyu District Tobacco Special Agency (Nanyangyu) branch of the 636 TZ Volunteer Service Brigade has launched an environmental protection campaign to protect the forest and protect the home.
The event was supported by all the staff of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also attracted retired senior staff, working families to join forces in environmental practices, the three generations of young people working together, climbing forests, cleaning up garbage, and dedicating their strength to the construction of the beautiful South Yue Dam.
The volunteer service campaign aims to protect the landscape resources of the Southern Hemisphere, promote the idea of volunteering for others, society and nature, and to give the next generation the gift of volunteering.
It is reported that the 636th Volunteer Service Brigade has grown to 16 members since its inception in early April, and has since launched a series of volunteer activities to help disabled retail customers, help tobacco farmers care for tobacco leaves, and make a generous donation to the Yan earthquake, becoming a volunteer life force with a passion for delivering positive energy.

Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful
Just when you thought 2017 would be no stranger, a new report on technology development in the field of sex robots was released.
Yes, I did.
But now sex robots are a big deal.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robots (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an honorary retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of its nipples and the type of nails.
Sharkey said in the release of the new report: "People are laughing behind the scenes, but the big companies have actually launched a lot of sex robots, and we're going to see more of them".
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots, with a skin that is cozy, touching warmly, and specifically using AI to set up human-like sexual responses.
Users can also customize their robots to suit their preferences, from eye color, breast shape to nail type or color.
But what's even more disturbing is that many robots with a personality trait that makes them look advanced make them look like a replica of a human.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with a thick skin.
For example, RealBotix robots can be defined based on what users find attractive, such as being shy.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, which can pre-set characteristics, including the somewhat shy, frozen-fried-up French fries and the adventurous wild-goose Wintien.
The Roxyxxy Gold robot has a personality that is as similar to you as possible, and the True Companion website is a great way to get around it.
So she loves you, and you love her bad.
She was just as emotional as a normal person in those days!
She can cook, she can talk, and she can be sexy and sexy!
The rise of sex robots has brought a lot of unrest not only to the fact that it replaces the real humanity of the female character and the submissive nature of the female character, but also to the fact that the rape implications of the cold-blooded (read as: resistance) rape of Farah are the most worrying.
True Companion compares Roxxxy to a man's shaker on its website.
The site says that if women have vibrating rods, why can't men have Roxxxy?
However, these sex robots are not a mere romance, nor are they just sex toys.
Their emergence and maturation point to a darker, deeper part of our culture: fleeing perfect gender equality and moving towards submission to sex as an additional option.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while FRR notes that sex robots are becoming increasingly popular, they are still on the fringe of consumer culture.
But something that penetrates from the edge gives us a glimpse into the process of the times we are in.
Many people would not be cunning or aggressive until the free market gave them the opportunity to become so.
These sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are under threat globally, and the White House has a president who boasts of sexual violence against women, which is no coincidence.
The most chilling part of the story of a woman who is the most frightening part of the TV series is not in the realistic picture, not in the hanging corpse, not in the eyes of the couple being dug out, but in the overly realistic imagination.
The Republic of Kiribati was a leap forward, but it doesn't look that far now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to use the best technology to create the body that looks the most like a real woman, even if it's proportionate to a porn star.
The creators of these robots want them to have a human touch and mimic real human movements.
But frankly, their shiny personality is not representative of real women.
They can't separate, they can't leave.
They have no appeal institutions, no follow-up stories, no independence at all, and no fantasy of slavery that could be completely broken.
In other words, they are passion slaves.
The first is that the women are not allowed to be married.

What is the great achievement of Trump?
The film is about a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is not a man who is a man who is a man who is not a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is not a man who is a man who is not a man who is a man who is a man who is not a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is is is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is is is is is a man who is a man who is a man who
Political differences have led to the polarisation of the American electorate, and from a microscopic perspective, they have undermined the harmony of American families.
After Christmas and Thanksgiving, major newspapers in the United States filled their comment columns with fears about how to deal with the Trump relatives who voted.
It is commonly thought that we are doing our best to break through our filter bubbles.
Less commented on was the strength of Trump's family uniting.
I mentioned this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, who has long been at odds with the Republicans in our house, is coming to visit me in New York this week.
She reminded me that united against a common enemy can have powerful effects.
Because of her White House work with Trump, everyone she knew, including her Republican relatives, who had been in political strife for decades, was now suddenly and oddly on the same front line.
If all were at the table, that would certainly be a good thing. But what shocked me was that, from a broader perspective, it would pose a significant risk.
While the left has always been under Trump's spell, the twisting effect of his presidency has driven us all to the right.
When we talk about normal makeup and Trump, we are talking about the possibility that his strange behavior might one day stop.
However, there is a more worrying long-term scenario where Trump's attempt to normalize his makeup is to deal with right-wing Republicans who have previously opposed Mr. President's standards and now suddenly seem to be a rational symbol.
I recently found myself with a bit of a suspicion about the crazy thing about Mitt Romney: putting dogs in cars, 14 percent of income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), and it seems that these two actions are actually too minor a crime compared to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate will need only to reasonably qualify for invaluable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town, we took the kids to the New York Park Spinning Tomi, the largest spinning Tomi operated by the New York Central Park Authority, and if you don't need coffee, this $3 ticket is the most valuable thing you can buy in the city.
The sound of the horse was as great as thunder, and the central cylinder was designed with fiberglass, and all clowns and animals twisted their heads, looking in horror and malice at their shoulders, while the music of the rattlesnake sounded strange.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: the landscape overlooking the towers of the towers is getting old, the skyline is getting too familiar and can no longer provide much excitement, while the reality of the city does not support the dream.
35 years later, I still remember the day when I discovered that this old Swiss cottage was not actually a Swiss cottage, but was an old Swiss cottage, located in the theme bar, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, which I can't remember, but near a crossroads in north London.
However, the Central Park spin-tome is still a magical experience, and everyone enjoys the event, which is open to two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two 40-year-old girls.
If I could evaluate a spinning horse, I would give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a department store, before I was able to clear my credit card, I was asked to rate my trading experience with a one to five star rating.
In addition, the coffee shop on the corner of my street is also a 15% discounted rate for purchasing items at the counter.
This has not only slowed down the pace of what should have been a neutral transaction, but also put pressure on the server to add personal factors to the unnecessary situation.
The poor woman in the store smiled sorry, and I was tired, and her credit card trading experience gave her a five-star rating.
Oscar Pistolis was transferred from prison to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time Pistoles has been released from prison and taken to hospital.
Last year, he was taken to hospital for a wrist injury, which prison officials said was caused by a fall in his cell.
After the prosecutor appealed the initial mistrial, Pistoles was convicted of murder.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he shot Stingcamp multiple times through the bathroom door in his Pretoria home, until his death.
Pistolis claims to have mistaken his girlfriend for a nightly intruder.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time for the six-year sentence against Pistoles, which they consider too generous.
The State Prosecutor's Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, which is due to hear the appeal this year.
If the prosecutor wins, Pistoles faces a sentence of up to 15 years in prison.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

Two Bulgarians detained in Greece for camping illegally
According to the Foreign Ministry, two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for camping illegally.
On the morning of August 1, the police of Thessaloniki detained a group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians.
The detainees were released on the same day and the investigation is ongoing.
The Foreign Ministry told bTV that two Bulgarians were subsequently released.
The Greek authorities have stepped up their control of the campsite and will impose a large fine on any group of people who rest in unmarked campsites.
The tour will last one season.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the courts could fine any campers who choose to camp.
On May 18, the Ministry of Finance announced the special grant funding management measures to adjust the structure of the coal industry enterprises, which will arrange special grant funding to promote the decomposition of excess capacity in the coal and steel industries, totaling 100 billion yuan.
In recent years, several local governments in Shanghai, Shaanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, and the state of Hlong Kong have repeatedly proposed reforms to dissolve excess capacity.
Many provinces have even proposed to actively seek central financial support for their provinces' depletion of energy.
One proof is that only eight provinces have announced coal-to-energy targets that meet 90% of the national coal reduction plans.
Linberg, director of the Institute of Energy Policy of the University of Xiamen, said in an interview with reporters that the decarbonisation of the steel and coal industries by the 100 billion yuan of the central government alone is far from enough.
In the recently published coal decommissioning implementation details, Shaanxi Province proposed to restructure Shaanxi Joke Coal Group into a state-owned capital investment company, restructure the assets and operations of the enterprises and reintegrate them into a new business model.
The actual funding gap may be three times that of previous subsidies, and the Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, Liu Min, said that the initial statistics show that the coal system of the personnel who are deployed to distribute the capacity for the deployment of the capacity are 1.3 million and the steel system is 500,000.
The report was published today by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of Guangdong Province, which announced the results of the 2012 Environmental Protection Credit Rating for Key Pollutants in Guangdong Province.
After the assessment, 134 of the 1251 companies included in the Environmental Protection Credit Management List were not rated for reasons such as shutdown, non-approval, shutdown.
The list includes the most polluting companies in the Red Label, which are mainly powered by electrical filters, ink, and other pollution control technologies, and some sewage treatment plants.
The provincial Environmental Protection Agency said that it accepted public oversight and accepted the principles of openness, fairness and impartiality and that the results of the rating were now published on the Environmental Protection Agency's website.
During the publicity, the Environmental Protection Agency receives public calls, letters, visits and other forms of reflection, and the Environmental Protection Agency will investigate, verify and process the reflected issues.
Climate change could irreversibly destroy a large number of species, including the resources and food on which humans depend.

But a new study shows the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate the associated symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The condition affects the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 Britons, leading to diarrhea and diarrhea, frequent or bleeding diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington often recommend that patients avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers found that the key amino acid-serine in proteins helps promote the growth of immune cells, which can increase the resistance of the gut.
Dr. Marco Colonna, lead researcher, explains that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not enter the body.
The cells that cause inflammation are balanced with those that have improved tolerance, protecting the body from damaging sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
Inflammatory bowel disease can occur when the equilibrium state is too inflammatory.
In the experiment, a cell that promotes immunity was found in mice carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need serine (one of the components of proteins) to form the appearance of cells.
Professor Kolonna says: "We have established a link between a bacterial population (Roy's leukaemia, which is a normal part of the gut microbiome) and a cell population that promotes the development of resistant cells".
The more serine the rats ingest in their diet, the more immune cells they have.
He suggested that a more resistant, less inflammatory gut environment could be created if humans used the same method, combining lucerin-lactate bacteria and a rich, lactin-rich diet.
Postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studied an immune cell with an enhanced resistance, and when she found that one group of mice had such cells, another group of the same strain did not have them when they were separated from the feeding.
She suspects that the difference is related to the small mouse's gut microbiome (i.e. bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gut).
DNA sequencing of the cholesterol in the mice found that there were six bacterial populations present in mice with immune cells, but none in mice without immune cells.
The mice feed in a sterile environment, so they lack gut microbes and cannot produce these immune cells, while the presence of Luteobacterium produces immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers cultivated LBC in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of non-bacterial fluid to immature immune cells that had been isolated from the mice.
The immune cells develop into resistant cells.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be shown that the active ingredient is a byproduct of the metabolism of serine, called calcium-3-lactate.
When researchers doubled the amount of serine in the feed of the rat, the number of cells increased by about 50%, but when the level of serine was halved, the number was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same growth resistance cells as mice, and most of us have Lymphocyte in our stomachs.
Whether humans can induce cell development by cell derivatives of serine from luteinizing leukaemia, like the small rats in the experiment, is not known, but a gene defect associated with serine was found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said that the development of these cells could be the result we want, because they control inflammatory responses on the surface of the intestines.
It is not certain whether the high levels of serine in LBC may have led to an increase in the number of LBCs.
Jose Mourinho believes United signed the talented Manimania Mattić
On Wednesday night, after making his debut against Sampdoria, Nemanja Mattić confirmed that Mourinho had signed a talented midfielder for Manchester United.
Mattiche, who signed for Chelsea for £40 million, scored 2-1 in the league's final pre-season game on Tuesday against Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup, winning the favour of Paul Bogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, on the Pre-Season Asia Tour in Bruce, Mattichi's playing condition was severely understated, with only 45 minutes to complete, and Mourinho acknowledged that improvements were needed before the start of the Premier League season.
"I think he needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and a genius way of thinking that makes him think about football", said Mourinho.
We'll help him get ready as soon as possible.
Mourinho began to arrange his debut squad at the start of the season. Like Mattiche, newly signed players Viktor Lindlov and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Ingevra Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still wanted to bring in three more players, but he insisted that the club had done a great job, and that he had four first-choice players in mind, three of whom had already been brought in.
The club has introduced three of the players to the club, and I am very grateful.
I would be happier if the club could bring all four players, but they have already put a lot of effort into it for me.
The world is at the peak of the boom in cruise ships, and if China doesn't build such a warship, will it fall behind?
With the recent announcement of plans for the construction of new ships by the world's major naval powers, as if they had been the focus of attention of the major navies overnight, Japan decided to purchase two new ships in the 2018 defence budget, which finally gave Japan a substantial breakthrough in the DEX ships program, and the US Lockheed Martin recently announced the latest plans for the US FGG ships program, where did the Chinese new ships go from here?
With the sinking of the latest 054A frigate at the end of 2017, which marks the completion of 29 ships, the 054A has approached the sum of the 053H series, and the construction of the 054A has been 12 years since the first 054A sinking in 2006, and even worldwide, only the US-built Permian frigate built in the 1970s and 1980s can be compared to the number of high-performance general-purpose frigates built in China.
The reason why so many of the 054As are being built is simple: it's affordable, useful, and it's a supplement to years of Navy debt.
The 054A has been favored by the Chinese Navy for years with its high performance and excellent combat capability, with a discharge of around 4000 tons, a 76 mm main gun, a 32 unit Sea-Flag-16 and Fish-8 anti-submarine missile rack-launched vertical system, 8 fighter 83s and a straight-9 helicopter. Although it was built in 2006, the design time was much earlier than a ship, but its combat capability is still not too bad, and it can reach a mid-level among the ships in the world.
But it was a ship designed in the early 21st century with weapons on its side, and its power systems and electronic radar equipment were already vastly different from the world's mainstream ships, and it was time to develop new models, such as the European ships of the same type, which were already equipped with full-electric propulsion, small multi-purpose radar arrays, and large helicopter decks.
So how the new ships of the Chinese navy should develop is directly related to their future position and the strategic direction of our Chinese Navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy will be to become a blue-water navy completely, and the future will be to move to the ocean, with rapid deployment in areas of Chinese interest, demonstration of the presence of force, and the ability to have strong combat power when necessary to ensure that China's interests in the region are not damaged, so it looks like the new Huajiang will move towards the expansion and oceanisation.
Considering the positioning of the new ships in the future Chinese naval sequence, the future Chinese Navy should be similar to the US Navy, with the exception of the necessary near-sea defense ships, other main-line ships will be formed as carrier battle groups or attack attack groups depending on the situation.
The role of the new ships in future carrier combat groups should be to serve as counter-submarine and mid-range airspace positions, and in two attack groups as a class of ships, and according to such needs, the new ships must have strong anti-submarine and good mid-range area airspace capabilities.
Based on the above position, it is possible to imagine the future of the national patrol vessel.
First, the discharge will be significantly increased compared to the current 054A frigates, with an estimated discharge of around 5000-6000 tons for the new frigates; the propulsion system will be based on a combined power drive system consisting of an improved QC280 gas turbine and two diesel engines, with a maximum speed of around 30 knots and a significant increase in durability; the weapon configuration of 76 mm main guns and 1130 short-range guns should be maintained, but the Red 10 launch system should be increased; the rear of the main gun should have a 32-48 single-engine Red 16 improved and a vertical vertical vertical system with a fish-8 rig, and the rear of the main gun should be fitted with an 8-16 single-engine vertical launch system similar to the launch pads for the new R18 and patrol control; the radar platform and the radar platform should be equipped with a fixed-range system based on the four-engine, high-range, and high-range electronically mounted A346 platforms; and the rear of the main gun should be equipped with a fixed-range system based on the four-range array.
The overall level of the new frigates will thus reach the world's best level at present, even if it is not much lower than the US FPG.
Of course, the concept above is just my guess about the new domestic ships, and let's look at how we can wait until the new ships come down and see if we can do it together.
I'm not sure.

In recent years, the city has encouraged enterprises to actively participate in the construction of national, industry and regional group standards, to give RMB 300,000 to enterprises that own or participate in the development of standards for the Zhejiang Manufacturing Group, and to award RMB 500,000 to enterprises that have been certified by the Zhejiang Manufacturing Brand, the highest amount of the award in the entire province, which has stimulated enthusiasm for the participation of enterprises in the brand.
The day before, Wangli Group production workshop, which is headed by the group system, Kogen and his employees were packing a security security security case to be used as a sample of the standard work of the Zhejiang manufacturing group to meet the standards, ready to be sent to the Shaoxing Quality Testing Center.
In the past two days, Wangqi has passed a field audit of the Zhejiang Certified Aluminum Manufacturing Expert Group.
The team of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations praised the group's achievements in core areas of quality excellence, autonomous innovation and agreed that the product will be one of the first to pass the standard once it is tested.
The KG is just a shorthand for the standard rolling stock transformation upgrade.
The city is also working with the Dongyang Group, which is also working with the Zhejiang Manufacturing Group on standards and standards.
Since the Zhejiang Manufacturing Team standards were developed by the security gate industry in our city last year, companies like Star Moon, Ningdong and others have been actively applying for matching standards.
In recent years, a large amount of capital has flowed into the film market, and the popularity of the star actors is high with the film's payroll.

What's worse than not being able to afford a home?
In recent times, we have been discussing what changes have been made to real estate policy recently, whether it is to loosen up real estate policy, whether the diversification of land policy supplies will cause house prices to fall.
But when we are worried about real estate prices, macroeconomic regulation, and the future trends in the real estate market, the Yang People's Daily has written again, the last time we have written about the adjustment of the regulation of real estate, and now the Yang People's Daily is writing about a more serious topic than not being able to afford a home, which is whether you can afford a home, even if you can afford it, you can still get a debt.
Today we will talk about a more serious issue than buying a house: repayment.
China's growing housing debt crisis
The People's Daily of Xi Jinping published a commentary in the January 17 edition of the Chinese Foreign Journal on the positive and negative impacts of the Chinese economy on the economy and the economy, which shows that the Chinese government's leverage ratio continues to rise, rising from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter of 2017, up 1.3 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The debt of the residential sector in the entire physical economy is increasing and the leverage rate is rising faster.
Related studies show that Chinese households' liabilities in financial institutions are mainly based on consumer loans, accounting for about 2/3 of the residents' liabilities, about twice the amount of business loans.
Among these, medium-term loans, mainly home loans, account for about 80% of consumer loans, but in terms of growth, short-term consumer loans are growing faster than medium-term loans.
In addition, the Chinese household debt ratio is only a statistic of the total amount of credit the household sector receives from financial institutions, while Chinese households have a large amount of hidden debt, including private loans to relatives and friends.
According to the SUNY Financial Institute, the Chinese population's leverage rate was only 3% in 1996 and 18% in 2008, but the population's leverage rate has been growing rapidly since 2008, doubling in just six years to 36.4%. By the third quarter of 2017, the population's leverage rate had reached 48.6%.
In May, HSBC released a survey report of nearly 10,000 respondents across nine countries, compared with one data.
The report visited millennial youths from nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
The report notes that in China, the proportion of young people living in the 80s and 90s reached 70%, far ahead of Mexico, which is the second largest country in the world (46%), and twice the level of the United States (35%).
The data suggests a very likely problem that the largest potential rhinoceros population in China is estimated to be debt-free compared to the homeless population.
Second, why is the mortgage crisis the most serious problem?
As we have analyzed before, while we have been saying that China's housing prices are higher, but the Chinese home ownership rate is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world, instead of saying that it is not possible to buy a house at a high price, I'm afraid the question that many friends are asking is, can you still get a loan?
We look at the real estate market around the world, and the real estate market in China has not yet experienced a major real estate crisis, except for the one we mentioned earlier in Hainan, because of the late start-up, but the origins of the global financial crisis in 2008 were the real estate crisis in the United States, which happened a decade ago.
The real estate crisis in the United States is blamed on two houses: the Housing Authority and the Real Estate Authority.
In the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold homes to low-income people at very low prices in order to expand sales. The real estate market was booming at a time when the U.S. economy was booming, but the prospects were not good.
However, at the time, the financial assets and real estate were a component of the assets of American households, and almost all of the household assets in the lower income groups were real estate, while most of the assets in the top 20% of high income groups were financial assets, which caused the higher the debt to the property of the poorest households in the United States.
A serious fact is that these people bought houses when the economy was better, so the money to pay for the mortgage was also calculated on their better income, and when income dropped, the pressure on the mortgage was not only not reduced, but also increased because some subprime plans became floating, and so the real estate problems of these American families under this austerity were so gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
Some people have been unable to pay their mortgages because of their low income, so banks start collecting their property, and when banks collect from borrowers who borrowed their property, they sell it at extremely low prices, which leads to a gradual decline in the price of the house in the area, which also leads to a further decline in the house price, forming a vicious cycle, where more and more buyers find that after the house price has fallen to a certain extent, the value of their house is even lower than their loan, so more people stop lending and cause more bad bills.
The first is that the world is not a country, and that is why it is a country.
The economy is in decline, the income is falling, some people are not paying the mortgage, some people are selling the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some people are paying the house, some are paying the house, some are paying the house, some are paying the house, some are paying the house, some are paying the house, and some are paying the house, some are the people are paying the people are the people are the people are the people are the people are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the who are the who are the who are the who are the who are the who are the who are who are who are the who are the who are the who are who are the who are who are who are the who are the who are who are the who are who are the who are who are the who are the who are who are the who are who are the who are who are who are the who are the who are who are who are the who are who are who are who are the who are the who are who are who are who are who are the who are who are who are who are the who are who are the who are who are who are who are the who are who are who are who are who
And the problem is that because the house prices continue to fall, and people stop lending houses to banks and you don't have any debt anymore, and if the money that the bank gets from the house auction is not enough to pay you back, then you still need to pay back, simply say, if you bought a house worth three million dollars with a loan of $600,000, $2.4 million, and when the house fell to $2 million, you no longer lend the house to the bank, and after the bank auctioned the house, you not only lost your first $600,000, but you also owe the bank $400,000, you still have to pay back the money.
So, under this vicious cycle, the U.S. economy collapsed, eventually leading to the 2008 financial crisis.
So, the high level of domestic debt at the current stage of 46.8% is a very cautious issue, which is still below the level of developed countries, but the problem has begun to emerge, and the country has repeatedly stressed leverage since last year, which is a very predictable judgment that if the domestic debt rate is allowed to continue to rise, it will inevitably cause huge risks, so it is necessary to strictly guard against the emergence of financial risks.
So, with the houses being positioned for living, not for baking, the country is moving faster to create multiple measures such as multi-subject supply, multi-channel safeguards, leases and takeovers, to further mitigate the potential risks.
For our individual families, it is imperative to abandon the speculative thinking of real estate, to make a big effort to buy a house, to avoid putting our own families under a huge burden, and only a reasonable assessment of our income and debt levels is a healthy way to develop family wealth.

The White House equipment costs thousands
According to military records published in the Time Magazine, the White House last month decided to ship a Marine helicopter to South Strait to show the great glory of American manufacturing at a cost of up to $24,000.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as Marine Corps No. 1 during the presidential ride) was a major exhibit at the White House on July 17 highlighting U.S. construction projects.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibit features a Connecticut-built helicopter, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi fork.
According to the records of the Marine Corps Helicopter First Flight Squadron (HMX-1), the White House Military Office required the helicopter to be present by daily order (FRAGO) just 36 hours before the helicopter landed at South Lawndale for the special reconnaissance mission.
The day before the event, the commander of HMX-1 in an email sent to the Deputy Commander of the Marine Corps Flying Forces of the Upper Line said, "I just want to confirm that you know, because this event is highly regarded".
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn about 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and will leave after the lawn is cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The message also said that the departure time from the White House was delayed and the return flight was delayed due to shift time restrictions requiring second team personnel.
The original crew members were stationed at the side of the helicopter during the operation, while the security forces were stationed nearby when the aircraft was on the ground.
The records obtained by the Time magazine do not indicate whether a second crew is needed in the end.
The Penal Code prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record shows that HMX-1 asked if the activity violated the Act.
The commander wrote that one of the questions we asked was whether this violated the Penal Code and was told that there was no violation.
The report said that the government had been trying to stop the attack.
The White House defines the US-made marijuana campaign as official, and is therefore not governed by the marijuana bill.
But even official activities are political in color.
During the event, the President launched the Senate's theme of healthcare reform and boasted about the regulation of government regulations.
It is no longer a new phenomenon to use the Marine Corps' 1st or Air Force 1st aircraft for political propaganda purposes.
The president was asked to travel on these planes.
However, it is not uncommon to use it for photography purposes alone.
Trump was the subject of a public outcry in Melbourne, Florida, in February when his presidential plane was slowly sliding, eventually ending up in the background of his first campaign rally, and his Twitter account was full of complaints about the former president using presidential planes.
White House deputy press spokesman Lindsay Walters said the White House was not excited about the second U.S. Manufacturing Aluminum Exhibition, which showcased products from all 50 states, all made by American workers using American materials.
HMX-1 crews frequently fly training near Washington and South Lawn, practicing the precise location of the President of the United States at the White House.
During the G20 summit in Germany in early July, Mr. Trump exercised 58 landings at the White House.
One official said the US-made flight was included in the crew training requirements for this month.
The helicopter force also flew an additional 11 hours on the day of the non-presidential support mission.
The White House said that the taxpayers did not bear any other expenses for the event.
Sikorsky's spokesman said the company was not involved in the planning of the Nant Prawn helicopter show.
HMX-1 does not maintain a budget record of presidential flights, so it is very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Department of Defense's Hours of the Year 2017 record, the Department of Defense can charge the VH-3D $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit recorded a flight time of 30 minutes each from the base at the Naval Air Station in Ponteco, Virginia.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower than the cost.
Walters said that it was very misleading to estimate the cost of taxpayers based on recoverable fees.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many others, including the cost of sinking in the annual allocation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the Department of Defense's reimbursable costs do not include personnel costs, but do include fuel costs, maintenance costs and contract costs.
At the time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spike defended the helicopter's use for the event, saying:
The idea of the brand is to showcase what America has made this week.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, that they're both a force for our national security, and I guess even if it's not thousands or hundreds of people's jobs that depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of countless hard work by Americans.
So it is not unnecessary to emphasize this.
It is not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while visiting South Lawn during the campaign, but he did sit in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump speaks on behalf of Sikorsky and makes fun of the media with his own aircraft.
He said, "Oh, I know Sikorsky aircraft very well. I have three.

This made the family of my aunt, who lives in the dormitory of the Democratic Road Mechanics Hall in Nanning, happy.
The neighbors also said that it was rare to see the trees bloom. The villagers thought it was a blessing and were very excited to see it.
The genus is a tropical plant native to Mexico, warm and humid, and can only bloom under suitable conditions such as sunlight, moisture, and nutrients.
Even in tropical wilds, the flowering of rich trees is rare, with a reported growth rate of only one in a thousand bushes.
Yesterday morning, the journalist came to the dormitory of the Democratic Road Mechanics Hall in Nanning City, where, under the guidance of Aunt Kaohsiung, the reporter saw the tree of wealth.
The richest trees are planted in the gardens of the village, about 5 meters high, the thickest branches are about 30 cm long, and the leaves are lush green.
The flowers bloom on the top of the higher branches, blooming flowers more than 10 cm wide, with pale yellow fine silk scattered, green flowers twisted on both sides, with silk-thin, silk-headed points of Venus.

The two government officials said that Apple had written to the Indian government last month explaining its plans to produce iPhones and other products in India and hoped the Indian government would introduce a fiscal incentive policy.
According to Market Star, from 2005 to 2011, I province's GDP rose from the middle to the second tier.
But the province's economic growth is still in trouble, such as low investment efficiency, lack of core competitiveness of the industrial economy.
The provincial economy was represented by a number of indicators for 2005 and 2011, and compared with the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic benefits, in 2011, the province's high-energy industries such as industrial energy, raw materials, high-energy industries, which were affected by market volatility and overcapacity, and the lack of innovation in the dominant industries such as home appliances and automobiles, led to weak profits.
The large amount of investment has not brought the corresponding economic benefits, which is a major reason why the quality and efficiency of our province's economic growth is not high.
In this regard, experts suggest that effective measures to encourage enterprise innovation and the transfer of technological achievements from universities and research institutes to enterprises should be taken in a timely manner.
Experts say that the economic benefits of industrial production are not high, but that it is also important to actively promote industrial integration, restructuring, optimizing industrial layout and extending industrial chains.

The British General Union (GMB) is focusing on investments in the Glasgow plant of McVitie
The union wants the management of the biscuit maker, Mevita, to ensure a long-term commitment to the production of the biscuit at its Las Vegas plant.
The Scottish branch of the British General Union said the company had remained silent about the future of its investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory has more than 500 employees and produces products such as Hobnobs, Rich tea and more.
Mevita's owner Pladis said the company has invested more than £5 million in the plant over the past few years.
He added that if the factory operates, employees and union representatives will be the first to know about the changes.
In a letter to the head of the factory, the Scottish branch of the British General Union called on the company to resolve the issue of unbundled funds for the modernization of the production line.
Dr. Duffy, senior organizer of the British General Union, said: "We are deeply concerned that we cannot get a clear understanding of the future business needs and investment plans of Tollcross from the General Manager of the plant.
Generations of families work here, and the high concentration of labour in the local community and Greater Glasgow area is an important pillar of decent employment in areas of high unemployment and severe social exclusion.
In terms of employment, wages and economic prosperity, the growing cost of living and the long-term recession in manufacturing, the growing demand for Mavitas' production network in the east of Glasgow is therefore pressing.
A spokesman for Pradesh said: "The head of Tollcross just received a letter yesterday from the Scottish branch of the British General Union, which will respond immediately as we attach great importance to maintaining continuous contact with employees and union representatives".
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting at Tollcross with employees and representatives of the British General Union, where we discussed some issues openly.
We discussed with our employees and then, like all other companies operating in highly competitive and economically unclear environments, we reviewed our continued operating patterns for enterprises and factories to maintain competitiveness.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in improving production lines and operations.
We fully recognize the historic status of Tollcross as a production base, and if there is any change in our operations at the plant, employees and union representatives will be the first to know.
The deputy director of the Sports Office of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Nima Saksenin, 10 said in the North Pole headquarters at Mount Everest that the future of the North Pole life garbage disposal will move from past public-benefit actions to normalized behavior dominated by the Chinese government and international participation.
On May 10, environmental volunteers will sort the garbage into trucks.
In recent decades, the environmental issues at the summit have become increasingly prominent as explorers and tourists have increased dramatically.
In the spring of 1997, the Tibetan Autonomous Region Climbing Association launched its first clean-up campaign on the north slope of Mount Everest to clean up a bunch of life-saving oxygen bottles left over from the 1960s and 1970s. The video was also shown at the Tokyo World Climate Congress that year, attracting worldwide attention.
According to Nima, after 1997, the public service team continued to clean up the north slope of Mount Everest, but the participants were mostly non-professionals.
Paris Saint-Germain had warned Barcelona three years ago that they would sign Neymar.
The Spanish Premier League may regret throwing an olive branch at Marco Vilat
After offering £189 million to try to get them to exercise the exemption clause, Paris Saint-Germain will not give up signing Neymar, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago that they would attack the world record-breaking attacker?
This notorious approach has opened the summer transfer window, with the FA club preparing to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous transfer record.
Once the transfer is complete, Neymar will jump to become the world's highest paid player and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, with Paris Saint-Germain providing more than £500,000 a week in post-tax pay.
Barcelona are angry at Neymar's offensive style and his lack of progress, and sources on the board of directors of the Catalans insist that the club has been doing everything it can to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the president of Paris Saint-Germain make such predictions about the world of football three years ago?
When Manchester City announced their interest in signing Matty in 2014, Nasser Al-Halefi issued a stark warning to any club that wanted to sign the best player from Paris Saint-Germain.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we'll have to do the same thing to them, and we'll contact their players", Al-Khalifi said.
We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign our players, they will eat the bad ones themselves.
Earlier this summer, the Spanish club seemed to cross the line, with Barcelona throwing an olive branch at Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verlati.
The Paris Saint-Germain have made it clear that they will not allow the Italian footballer to leave anyway, and Barcelona is likely to suffer a double blow from losing midfield talent Neymar.

The economic subsidy strength of the new energy vehicle boom in Sichuan has weakened, the penetration of charging facilities has decreased, the use of 3-Y-ion batteries has been suspended in new energy buses, facing the current upward pressure on the domestic new energy vehicle market.
On November 3, 6, at the first phase of the 16th China Western International Exhibition (hereinafter referred to as the Shenzhen Expo), six cities, including Guangdong, Guangdong, and Yangon, showcased the development of advanced manufacturing, where new energy vehicles are unveiled, new products are introduced, and attract widespread attention from the industry.
Currently, with the weakening of the fiscal subsidy for new energy vehicles, low penetration of charging facilities, and the suspension of the use of three-yuan batteries in new energy buses, the domestic new energy vehicle market is under temporary upward pressure.
However, the Chinese manufacturer of new energy vehicles has been on the rise, entering the segmentation of passenger and commercial vehicles, and what is the bottom line?
The current situation of the newspaper's reporter, Zhengzhou: concentrated forces are cultivating the booming trend of the recent years, and the new energy automotive industry is constantly being updated in Sichuan.

Britain's hopes for gold rested primarily with two men, one last year's world short track speed skating champion Alice Christie and the other with the previous women's steel skating champion Liz Arnold.
At the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, the British delegation won 1 gold, 1 silver and 2 bronze, their best result since their first Winter Olympics in 1924.
Wales AM is worried about the chicken like the chicken.
Some have suggested that the AM should change its title to MWP (Welsh MP), which has shocked many AMs.
The proposal was made because of plans to change the name of the parliament to the Welsh Assembly.
The AM in the political community is worried that this will make people laugh.
One Labour MP said Labour members were concerned that the name was being used in conjunction with Twp and Pwp.
(Non-Welsh readers note: in Welsh, twp means "dumb-assed" and pwp means "dumb-assed".
One National Party AM member said that the entire National Party staff was not satisfied with the results and suggested changing the name.
A Welsh Conservative said the Conservatives were open about the change, but noted that it was easy to make the MWP sound Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission is currently drafting legislation on the name change, and he said: "It's their own business that the members of the committee ultimately decide what name to choose".
The Welsh Government Act 2017 provides that the Welsh Parliament has the power to rename the Welsh Government.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposed names, which generally supported the use of the Welsh Parliamentary name of Dumbledore.
The Committee voted favourably on the issue of the title of AM, but the highest support was for the MWP in the public consultation.
Apparently, the AM suggested other names, but the conference chairman, Elin Jones, was worried about the delay in reaching a consensus as he was due to submit a draft legislation to change the name within weeks.
Legislation on reform will also include other changes to the way Parliament operates, including rules to abolish AM qualifications and the design of the committee system.
AM will vote on the final name during the legislative debate.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
Direct voting is a way to resolve the decades-long dispute between Macedonia and neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has insisted that the name of its northern neighbour meant that Greece had a legitimate claim to its territory and has repeatedly refused Macedonia's accession to the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the renamed referendum, said he would not participate in the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is only the inevitable cost of joining the EU and NATO.
The church in Harlem is in danger, and the bells of St. Martin's are silent
In the history of the game, the old people I've talked to say that there will be a bar and a church in every corner, Adams said.
The city is now a bar and a church.
He said the disappearance of the bar was part of the reason.
But now people are starting to engage in social chat in different ways, Adams said.
The beer bar is no longer a regularly visited neighborhood living room.
As for the church, he was concerned that the funds for selling the assets would not be supported as long as the leaders expected, and that the money would eventually go to zero.
He added that the church will be replaced by an apartment building, which will house people who will not help maintain the rest of the block's shelters.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, he said, and that would accelerate the complete closure of the church as most people who move into these apartments are unlikely to become members of the church.
Both churches were built by white congregations ten years after St. Martin's, before Harlem became a black city (the city of the company in 1870).
The first white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A black congregation in the vicinity of the church acquired ownership of the building.
Under the leadership of Rev. John Howard Johnson, St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation, which had led a campaign against retailers on 125th Street (125th Street), 125th Street was a major shopping street in Harlem but refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused severe damage to the building, but the parish residents of Johnson's parish planned to rebuild the church, so they commissioned the bell to be made.
The son of the Rev. Johnson, the heir to St. Martin's, the Rev. David Johnson arrogantly calls the bell the bell of the poor.
The professional who played the horn in July called it: the "Historical Symphony of the Cultures" and the "Insubstitutable Symphony of the Cultures".
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, a professional, also noted that this was the world's first bell to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago to play a larger bell.
Merriweather said St. Martin's had not found a replacement for him.
What happened at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complex story about architects and contractors, some of whom were brought in by the secular leaders of the church, others by the bishops.
The parish's governing body, the parish council, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the parish in July expressing concern that the parish was trying to transfer capital to the parish council, although the parish councillors would not be involved in hiring the architects and contractors who had been sent by the parish.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency in parish affairs.
A 13-year-old boy in California was bitten by a shark while diving to catch a lobster
Officials said a 13-year-old boy was attacked and bitten by a shark while diving for a salmon on Saturday, the opening day of the California salmon fishing season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Encinitas Beacon.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he and his friends were diving on Saturday morning, and about half an hour later, a boy shouted for help and a man pulled him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought the boy was too excited to catch the dragon, but then he realized the boy was screaming and the boy was bitten!
I was bitten!
His entire ankle was torn open, and Hammer said he noticed it when he was around the boy.
And I called out to him, and they brought him out of the water: and there was a whale in the waters.
The boy was airlifted to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where the condition is critical.
The species of whales involved in the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles, a rescue worker, told a news conference that a shark was found in the area weeks ago but was determined not to pose a threat to humans.
The victim's upper half was injured, Jales added.
For investigative and security reasons, the authorities have closed Casablad's Ponto Beach to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Jars, there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but most of them are not a threat to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is to adopt the style of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams to open a beauty corridor equipped with professional assistants.
With a large number of department stores entering the £2.8 billion beauty market in the UK and the market still growing during a decline in fashion and home goods sales, beauty corridor testing will be conducted in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
After the TVs, microwave ovens and shelves for household items were sued, the supermarket decided to invest in beauty products and use these shelves.
Sennesbury Retail has said it will double its beauty product range to more than 3,000 brands, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as Loreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space, with brand areas similar to those of shops like Boots.
The supermarket has also re-launched its own line of premium cosmetics to make the majority of products pure vegetable products, a requirement that is increasingly being met by young shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will be franchising its two stores in Sainsbury's. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the other will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
The current dominant trend is online shopping and fewer food items are bought daily in local convenience stores, which means that supermarkets must take more steps to attract visitors.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's department store, said the chain would offer more services and non-food to counter discount retailers Aldi and Lidl, who would increasingly be like department stores.
Since acquiring the chain two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened Argos stores in hundreds of stores and introduced some Habitat. The company says the acquisition boosted grocery sales and brought profits.
The supermarket has previously tried to transform beauty and pharmacies, but it has failed.
In the early 21st century, Sainsbury and Boogie tried to run a joint venture, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to split revenues from Boogie's pharmacies.
Three years ago, Sainsbury proposed a new strategy to sell its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
Lloyds Pharmacy will add a range of luxury skin care brands to its four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, and will therefore play a key role in the plan, the company said.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director at Sainsbury's department store, said: "We've changed the look and feel of the beauty corridor to better serve our customers.
We also invest in introducing specially trained colleagues who will provide advice on the ground.
Our range of brands designed to meet every need, with attractive environments and convenient geography, means that we are now an attractive beauty destination that will be a challenge to traditional shopping.
Peter Jones grew furious after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the £11 million deal.
TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11 million lifestyle brand business deal to focus on a new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV, which has left Dragon Den star Peter Jones shocked.
Willoughby has no time to devote to their home-made clothing and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the couple is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of the This Morning show announced her decision to retire from Instagram.
Holly Willoughby withdrew from the lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to sign a new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which angered the star of the long-running series Peter Jones.
The source said that TV Gold Girl admitted to a tense meeting at the Mallory Business Empire headquarters in Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that she had just reached a deal worth up to £1.5 million, and was shocked to learn that it meant she would not have enough time to invest in the household clothing brand Truly, with which they worked.
The business is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, which was expected to double Willow's estimated £11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was on a plane from England to a holiday home he was staying at.
One source said: "Truly was Holly's top priority at the time.
This will be her long-term future plan for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw from the event shocked all participants.
No one believed what happened on Tuesday because the market was about to be thrown out.
The Mallo headquarters has a whole warehouse of goods waiting to be sold.
Experts believe that the departure of the UK's most lucrative This Morning anchor could cost the company millions of dollars, as the company has invested heavily in products such as anchor, anchor, clothing and household goods, and could further delay market placement.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Now a mother of three, Willow and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp founded Truly in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the company as a director in March.
The couple were always on vacation together, and Jones owned 40% of the TV production company in Bolvin.
Willoughby will serve as the brand spokesperson for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that we were not commenting on his business side of things.
After a long conversation, Mom and I fell in love.
He joked about the criticism of the media. Some people think that this is a disgrace to the president and that the North Korean leader is overrated.
Why is President Trump sacrificing so much?
Trump imitated the voice of the news anchor, saying:
I didn't sacrifice anything.
He noted that the first meeting of the leaders of the two countries in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as an important step towards denuclearization of North Korea, was now planned by Kim Jong-un to be held again.
The UN has already declared a state of emergency in the country.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean top diplomat Lee Yong-yeon addressed world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, saying that North Korea had not seen the United States respond to the early disarmament campaign.
He pointed out that the United States has continued to press and impose sanctions.
Trump expressed optimism in his rally speech.
He said, "Oh, we're getting along well with North Korea".
I'm not sure if we're going to war with North Korea.
I fear that millions of people have already died.
Now, this is a good relationship.
He said that the work to improve relations with Kim Jong-un has been successful, with rocket tests terminated, hostages successfully rescued, and the remains of US soldiers falling to the ground.
In addition, he defended his special approach when he spoke about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, saying that he was "not a man".
It's easy to be president, but instead of letting 10,000 people out there crowd into this crowded place, we'd rather have 200 people standing here, Trump pointed to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroy an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Long Island, foreign NGOs and other organizations were told they did not need their help.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of the population has been displaced, the government has not declared a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
Unfortunately, in many cases, they are clear that they will not ask for international assistance, so this will be a huge challenge for them, Ms. Sumbung said.
Save the Children has organized a group to visit Baru, but it is not yet clear whether foreign workers will be able to enter the workplace.
The National Disaster Agency spokesman, Sutopo, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Baru to determine whether international agencies needed to participate in the relief effort.
It is clear that Indonesia is not fully prepared for the continuing earthquake and the rage of nature.
Although Aai has built a shelter for beaches, other coastlines have not followed suit.
Although the tsunami warning has been in effect, Baru's apparent lack of a tsunami warning may have been responsible for the deaths of people.
Even in the most favorable conditions, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
A medical ship that was originally stationed in Long Island to rescue the earthquake victims is heading to Baru, but it will take at least three days to reach the new rescue site.
President Joko Widodo will be at the heart of his campaign to improve Indonesia's decaying infrastructure and spend significant money on road and rail repairs.
However, as the government faces re-election next year, the lack of funds has been a problem for the government.
Zoko also faces the pressure of the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslim members are more conservative.
Christian and Muslim gangs have used knives, bows and other simple weapons in street fighting, killing more than 1,000 people and displacing tens of thousands.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge level the score against Chelsea
On Saturday, at London's Stanford Bridge, Daniel Sturridge's goal in the 89th minute saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri 30 yards from the Chelsea goalkeeper, when his team was 1-0 down.
He passed the ball lightly to the left side and then shot the goal at the far pole.
The ball flew high above the restricted zone when it moved to the upper right corner of the goal.
The last of the group was Kepa Arrizabalaga, who finally jumped over the net.
In an interview with Liverpool FC.com, Sturridge said, "Well, I just want to get in that position and control the ball, and then players like Shaq will try to move forward as much as possible, and I just want to create as much potential for myself as possible".
I saw Kant come over and touch the ball, and I didn't want to shoot too much.
In the 25th minute, Chelsea took a 1-0 lead after being scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In that match, the Blue Force forward passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic with his foot and then missed half of the defence against Liverpool near the midfield.
Kovacic scored a quick passing touchdown in the middle.
The first was the fact that the government had to take the Azhar into the restricted zone with a nice direct message.
Azar was more than defensive, with his left foot shooting past Liverpool's Alisson Becker, shooting into the back of the net.
Liverpool will play their opponent in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday afternoon at 3pm.
Chelsea will play Vidyutton on Thursday afternoon at 3pm in the UEFA Europa League in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
The National Disaster Management Agency said early on Sunday that the death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia had risen to 832 people.
Administration spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday was reported to have triggered a massive wave of up to six metres (20 ft) and caused buildings to collapse, with many people trapped in the rubble.
The city of Pallu, with a population of over 380,000, is a ruined city, full of ruins and ruins.
A 32-year-old man arrested for allegedly murdering a woman who led to his death
The police have opened an investigation into the murder of a woman whose body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The dead woman, 44, was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, with stab wounds, and the man, 32, was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on the local population to step up and provide clues.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation into the shooting is still in its early stages, and I call on the crowd near John Street in Berkshire to contact us if they have any leads".
At the same time, I call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if any clue is caught in the traffic logger, because the information you have is vital to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the victim was a local resident of Burknham, where the bodies were found in a house.
A friend of the woman's acquaintance arrived this afternoon and asked where she was found this morning.
The police have said that they are notifying the relatives of the victims, as the investigation is ongoing.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews was trying to get back to his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed to leave the building.
He was silent after finding out what had happened.
The residents have been notified and will have to wait several hours before entering.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was designated as a crime scene.
A woman on the scene cried.
I kept saying, "You're too sad".
At 2 p.m., two police cars stopped inside the alert line and one van stopped outside the alert line.
Several police officers were on alert to monitor the situation in the apartment building.
Anyone with information can send a DM to @MerPolCC by calling 101 or anonymously contacting Crimestoppers (phone number 0800 555 111), citing the record of September 30th, 247.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament is the last monument to be the subject of a historic rewrite controversy
The Cromwell fanatical Puritan followers carried out Taliban-style destruction of British culture and religious relics, driving out what they said was a deserved punishment.
But the Crumwell Society called Crick's suggestion extremely foolish and unwise to try to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would undoubtedly be the target of an attack in the current debate over the removal of the statue.
The British Civil War was not a Cromwell-led or Cromwell-led campaign of idolatry.
Perhaps Cromwell's biggest mistake was being the victim of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's praise of Cromwell's high status is a good proof of the 19th century claim and a part of Cromwell's history that many consider to be still commendable.
Kim Smith told the Sunday Telegraph that Buck Cranwell was seen by many as a champion of congressional resistance to external pressure - for him, monarchy - and that there may be fewer people today than in the late 19th century.
The question of whether this statement is entirely accurate has been the subject of historical debate.
But it is certain that the conflicts of the mid-17th century affected the later development of our country, and Cromwell was a person who was recognized as a part of the division.
His achievements as a patron saint are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
The pigs are killed by the pigs, and the Chinese farmers are killed by the pigs
According to local media, a farmer was killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
According to the Xinhua Morning Post, a man named Chen was found dead near a pig ring in a market in the city of Six Places in Guangzhou province, with his artery severed and full of blood.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai, China, was preparing to vaccinate pigs.
The pig farmer and his cousin reportedly rushed to the local market from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning his cousin found the pigs' owner dead and the door was opened near the pigsty.
He said that there was a large pig in the pigsty, full of blood in his mouth.
According to reports, forensic evidence confirmed that the 550-pound fat pig attacked the farmer and killed him.
In the evening news, the blood of my cousin's legs became blurred, and he couldn't stand the news, his cousin said.
The surveillance video shows a man named Han entered the market at 4:40 am on Thursday.
His body was found about an hour later.
But the fat pigs that killed him were neither of the male of his family name nor of his cousin.
Market administrators told the Tonight News Channel that the fat pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others again, while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
The family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death of the man.
Although rare, there have been reports of pig attacks on humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts, causing them to be seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound fat pig pushed a Welsh farmer on a tractor until his wife ran after him to scare the cattle away.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his own pig, and a farmer in Lake Manitoba told Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC News) that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can play a role in the action of the catalyst catalyst.
They just like to play games.
They're like children, curious... they don't want to hurt you.
He said that all you need to do is give them the proper respect and respect.
Hurricane Remains of Hurricane Rosa will continue to bring heavy rainfall to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa continued to move towards the northern coast of Mexico, and as predicted, the winds weakened after reaching this cool part of the sea.
However, in the coming days, Rosa is expected to bring heavy rainfall and flash floods to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, the center of the Tropic of Capricorn was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, with winds of 85 mph and a Category 1 hurricane.
The Rosetta Grande is expected to continue northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific begins to form a low valley, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. Tropical Storm Lorosa will form near the lower California peninsula on Monday, when deep tropical moisture will move northward into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, the Tropic of Cancer will bring 10 inches of rainfall to parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, tropical moisture will interact with the coming wave valley, which will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Local reports say that 1 to 4 inches of rainfall can cause flooding, mudflow, and even desertification.
The effects of deep tropical humidity will result in 2 to 3 inches of rainfall per hour, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to reach 2 to 4 inches in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Due to the dispersion of tropical rainfall and the rapid deterioration of conditions, flooding may occur.
Desert adventure will be very dangerous due to the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain may cause the canyon to form a fast-flowing river, with thunderstorms bringing local winds and dust.
The coming wave of rainfall will bring local heavy rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
The total rainfall could exceed half an inch, which could lead to slight mudslides and road slides.
This will be the first rainfall in the region since the rainy season.
Arizona will experience a decentralized tropical rainfall on Sunday evening and Monday morning, followed by an increase in rainfall on Monday night and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
The North Pole is cooling and the tropics are still quite warm, and temperatures across the United States will fluctuate dramatically in October.
This can sometimes lead to extreme temperature changes within short distances.
The United States is expected to experience a significant temperature drop in the central part of the country on Sunday.
Temperature differences between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, will reach nearly 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the unrelenting heat will be back and the range will expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a hot summer in October, with temperatures ranging from the southern plains to parts of the northeast reaching 80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 27 degrees Celsius).
The temperature in New York City on Tuesday could reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 27 degrees Celsius), which would be about 10 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the average.
Long-term climate forecasts show that temperatures in the eastern United States are above average as of the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, a hearing on Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and his alleged sexual assault of Christine Blasey Ford in the 1980s was broadcast on six television networks, attracting over 20 million viewers.
Meanwhile, political stalemate continued, with the BBC disrupting regular programming for Friday's final turn: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake promised to ask the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure Kavanaugh touched her body after being drunk at a high school party and wanted to take off her clothes.
Kavanaugh responded with a generous and furious response, saying he was 100% certain that this had never happened.
Nielsen reported last Friday that more than 20.4 million people may have watched the hearing.
The company is calculating average viewership for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks that broadcast the case at the same time have not yet received viewing data, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
The number of people watching shows in the statistical office is often a problem for Nielsen.
Obviously, this figure is much larger than the audience for a playoff game or an Academy Award.
Nielsen said that Fox News had 569,000 viewers during the day of the hearing, pressuring other online media outlets.
ABC is second with a total of 3,260,000 viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS has 3.1 million viewers, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million, and CNN has a circulation of 2.52 million.
The public was still very concerned after the hearing.
Flake is the central character of the Friday show.
Earlier, the moderate Republican made a statement in his office that he would vote for Kavanaugh. On Friday morning, he climbed the elevator to attend a Judiciary Committee hearing, and was caught on CNN and CBS cameras, with protesters chanting his opening remarks.
CNN live shows that he stood silently for several minutes while being condemned.
One woman said, "Oh, I'm standing right in front of you".
Oh, you think what he's saying to the people is true?
You have a lot of power, and so many women are powerless.
Prior to the elevator closure, Flake said his office had issued a statement that he would make more comments at the committee hearing.
In the case of live broadcasting on both cable and radio networks, the Judiciary Committee will vote on Kavanaugh's nomination and send it to the Senate for a full vote.
But Flake said he would only vote if the FBI did more research next week into allegations of sexual assault involving the candidate. A minority of Democrats have been urging further investigation into the matter.
After a conversation with fellow Democratic Senator Chris Coons, Frank had some degree of doubt about this.
After a conversation with Kuhn and several senators, Frank made the decision.
Flake was very selective because it was obvious that Republicans would not have voted to approve Kavanaugh without a poll.
Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate Judge Kavanaugh further.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses Brexit critics of playing a political game
British Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Times on Sunday, accused critics of her Brexit plans of playing a political game against the UK's future and damaging national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived in Birmingham on 29 September 2018 to attend a Conservative Party meeting.
In another interview with the paper, former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson sharply criticized its so-called Brexit check and said that the proposal that Britain and the EU should impose tariffs on each other was absurd.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of shooting a Louisiana State University player
Police have arrested Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University, who was shot and killed.
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
Police released a video of Sims and Simpson fighting, which said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police found the pair of glasses on the scene, and said Simpson's DNA was found on it, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After Simpson was questioned, police said Simpson had confessed to shooting Wayde.
The Advocate reported that the cost of the body was $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office (East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office) released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.
The Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and citizens of the region, thanked the police for their assistance in the investigation and the eventual arrest of the fugitives.
Joe Alleva, athletic director at Louisiana State University, thanked the district law enforcement and praised the department for its hard work and relentless justice.
Sims is 20 years old.
Sims, a 6-foot-6, 1.98-meter guard, grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father Wayne was a member of the Louisiana State University basketball team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball head coach Will Wade said the team was not satisfied with Wayde's passing and that it was difficult to accept him.
Wade said, "Oh, that's the end we don't want to see".
Mexico City eruption
The eruption of the volcano Popocatpet has spread ash to neighborhoods in the southern part of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Control Center of Mexico on Saturday recorded 183 smoke outbreaks in 24 hours, and then issued a warning to the Mexican people to stay away from the volcano after the activity at the volcano.
The disaster prevention center monitors multiple rumblings and minor earthquakes.
Images on social media show a layer of ash covered in a car windshield near Mexico City, in the town of Ho Chi Minh City.
Earth physicists note that volcanic activity has increased 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as the Cuckoo's Nest, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with separatists on the eve of the anniversary of Catalonia's independence referendum
On Saturday, thousands of people joined the anti-demonstration march to mark the one-year anniversary of the Catalan polarization referendum, and six people were arrested in Barcelona after clashes between independent protesters and riot police.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and powder coatings at riot police, causing dust to cover the streets that were often crowded with tourists, and were subsequently stopped by riot police.
Later that day, a clash broke out and the police used police rods to quell the riot.
The protesters, who have been united in their claims to the independence of Spain for hours, will never forget and will never forgive the independenceists who supported the movement.
According to local media, 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
The referendum held in Madrid on October 1 was considered illegal and a year later, the situation in the region, which is still heavily divided, was still tense, but Catalan separatists were celebrating.
The vast majority of voters chose independence, but the vote was still low, as most people opposed to the split refused to vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, last year police attempted to block successive voting in the region, sparking violent clashes that injured nearly 1,000 people.
On Friday night, support for the separatist collective camp, stop the demonstration and support the actions of the national police.
The demonstration continues but has to take other routes.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who joined his wife in the separatist protests, said he had no hope for Catalonia's independence.
I'm glad that you're not going to be able to get away with it.
My parents were happy to be able to vote and they cried, but now we are in a mess, he said.
Despite the crucial victory in the regional elections in December last year, this year Catalonia's pro-independence faction is still trying to maintain its lead, with several of its most prominent leaders either self-exiled or detained pending trial for their public appearances during the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protests on his cell phone, believing the police were supporting them, said the conflict was instigated by politicians on both sides.
The situation is becoming more tense, he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he will contest next year's European Parliament elections.
As a candidate for the European Parliament elections, Mr. Liu publicly condemned the Spanish government's backsliding in terms of democracy and repression, which would be the most favorable way to curb, he said.
London, Delhi: Three men arrested for driving into a house
Three men (ages 33, 34, and 39) who were driving a car that hit a house in London's Derbyshire several times were arrested by police after the incident.
The incident took place at about 19:30 on Thursday at Ballynagard Crescent.
Senior police officer Bob Blemmings said the impact on the gate and the building itself caused damage.
In some cases, the car's brakes may have been intercepted.
Monga's goal helped Levinson win 1-0 over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal came in a win for Livingston.
Livingston's promotion shocked the Rangers, with Steven Gerrard losing the game for the second time in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal was the key to the game, and Gary Holt's team beat Hibernian in the second half.
Gerard's team is still undefeated this season and will take the lead next Sunday against their eight-point Red Heart team.
The Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday. The Rangers will play their home games in the Europa League on Thursday against Rapid Vienna.
Meanwhile, Livingston will continue their sixth consecutive undefeated season in the region, with Holt not tasting a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
The Levensons missed the opportunity to face the toughest hosts in the league.
Holt's team had already shown signs of leading before scoring, and their offense brought a variety of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson, who broke through the defense, threw the ball to the other side of the goal, and Alan Lithgow was pulled to the sidelines after catching the head of Craig Halkett.
The hosts were very keen to play the struggling team because they knew they could cause trouble for the guests when they were positioning the ball.
The key is how the key is generated.
The Rangers threw an arbitrary ball, Levinson opened a gap, and DeKalballagher and Robinson formed the Monka, who took a score from the center of the block. The Rangers threw an arbitrary ball, Levinson broke the door, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined the blockade.
The Rangers, who had the ball in their hands, found the home team's defense difficult to break, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was basically nothing to worry about.
This pattern continued into the second half, despite Alfredo Morelos scoring a goal from Kelly's feet.
Scott Pittman was kicked out of the gate by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, while Lithgow deflected another position ball from Levinson.
Crosses was constantly in the restricted area of Livingston and was constantly rounded off, while two goalkeepers offered to replace Glenn Middleton in Halcott and one handball after the goalkeeper was kicked back.
The team's performance was unprecedented.
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont reports at the Tony Macaroni Arena
The team has been amazing and amazing.
The players were all very good, once again exceeding people's expectations.
The team's style of play and personnel configuration have changed little since Holt returned to the top flight, but the honour Holt has brought to the team is truly commendable.
He brought out a lot of heroic players.
Captain Harcourt was unable to do so, deploying an organized super-strong defensive line, while Monka kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall from dropping the defense throughout the process.
The team of the nomads, however, was not brave enough.
They performed well under Gerald, occasionally, but far from the norm.
The last ball they scored was not a penalty, but a single penalty, which was a warning for the midfield team.
Erdogan is happy in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), the last day of the Turkish president's state visit to Germany, a thousand miles clear, the leaders of the two countries held a friendly breakfast meeting in Berlin.
President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany is intended to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
They are caught up in issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan went to a newly built mosque in Cologne.
Cologne is the most populous city in Turkey outside of Turkey.
Police stopped 25,000 spectators from attending the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters were still in the vicinity welcoming the president's arrival.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of whom were Kurds) also voiced their opposition, condemning Erdogan's policies and condemning the German government's failure to welcome Erdogan to Germany.
The protests on both sides reflected differences over Erdogan's visit: some German Turks called him a hero and others condemned him as a dictator.
Dartford road traffic accident: death of cyclist after collision with car
A cyclist dies in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred at around 10:15 a.m. local time in the summer of the United Kingdom, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy stretch of Deptford in the south-east of the city.
The driver of the car parked and medical personnel were able to help, but the owner of the bike died on the spot.
Just months before the accident, another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the man was being identified and would notify his immediate family.
The road has been closed and bus routes have been repaired, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison guards injured in riots
The prison office said that a high-security male prison was rioted, and six prison guards were injured in the riots.
At 9:30 am on Sunday morning in the summer, riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire, and the riots are still ongoing.
The authorities sent a special squadron of the Hurricane Raiders to the scene to deal with the riots involving eight prisoners, and all the perpetrators are now in control of a single building.
The prison guard received treatment on the spot after receiving minor injuries to his face.
A prison administration spokesman said that Liu has deployed specialised staff to deal with the ongoing riots in HMP Long Lartin.
Six wounded prison guards have been treated.
We will not tolerate any violence in prisons and will hand over the perpetrators to the police, who may face longer sentences.
HMP Long Lartin Prison has over 500 inmates, including some of the UK's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison's warden was reportedly attacked by prisoners and sent to hospital for treatment.
In October last year, anti-riot police were deployed to the prison to deal with major riots and were attacked by Taiwanese.
Hurricane Rosa is a flood threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, and the drought areas may benefit from it.
Tropical low pressure events in Arizona are rare, but are likely to occur early next week as the remnant force of Hurricane Rosa will hit the desert southwest, causing flood hazards.
The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings for areas from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah (including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City) on Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa is expected to arrive with rain later on Monday, crossing over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix wrote on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained a tropical storm or low pressure state since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that made landfall within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
According to the latest National Hurricane Cente model, rainfall is projected to be 2 to 4 inches and local rainfall to 6 inches on the edge of Morgallon, Arizona.
Other southwestern desert areas, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, with local total rainfall likely to reach 4 inches.
The rainfall from Rosa may be a blessing for areas that are not at risk of flooding due to severe drought conditions.
While flooding is a high priority, moderate rainfall may also be beneficial as the southwestern region is currently experiencing drought.
According to weather.com, the U.S. Drought Monitor reports that more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought conditions (second severe category).
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will lead it to land on the lower California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa was still in the storm's intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, 385 miles south of the Gulf of Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm made contact with the cool waters of the Pacific Ocean, and the winds weakened.
The storm is expected to make landfall from Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall is likely and there is a risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, total rainfall from the lower peninsula of California to northwestern Sonora is expected to reach 3 to 6 inches, or possibly even 10 inches.
Rosa will then travel north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border in the form of a tropical low pressure on Tuesday morning, and through the entire state of Arizona late on Tuesday, entering southern Utah.
The National Hurricane Center said the main threat to the storm or its remnants is expected to be heavy rainfall in the lower California peninsula, northwestern Sonora and southwestern desert regions of the United States.
The rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening flooding and mudslides in the desert and cause landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four suspects arrested for murder
A 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset, and subsequently arrested for murder. The suspects were three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man.
The victim, a teenage boy, was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4am on Saturday, and was pronounced dead at the scene.
He was later taken to hospital, where his injuries remain stable.
The Avon and Somerset Police said the suspects - a 17-year-old man and two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man - had been arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police called on witnesses to dance to provide clues to the video footage captured on mobile phones.
Trump called Kavanaugh the recipient of the Democratic-led outrage".
Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, that a vote by Judge Kavanaugh was a vote against the Democratic ruthless and shameless tactics.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the demeanor and anger of the Democrats throughout his nomination.
Kavanaugh, who was interrogated by Congress on Thursday, emotionally strongly denied the allegations made against him by Christine Blasey Ford, saying that he had not sexually assaulted Ford as a minor decades ago.
Ford also testified against the charges against him at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that the American people were shocked to see Kavanaugh's overwhelming humanity and courage.
The president told supporters in West Virginia that Mr. Liu voted for Judge Kavanaugh, the most accomplished legal scholar of our time, a public service jurist who was a prominent figure in the legal profession.
The president indirectly shots Kavanaugh's candidacy when he talks about the importance of the Republican primary in the midterm elections.
The most important election of our lives is five weeks away.
I'm not running, I'm running around like this.
He said that the only way to get the best candidates is to get them to vote.
Trump said the Democratic Party's mission is to fight back and block the election.
A senior Republican assistant to the leadership told CNN that the first crucial procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be held in the Senate on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia are still rising
Indonesian authorities said on Saturday that a major earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Indonesia, killing at least 384 people, many of whom were swept away by the tsunami.
On Friday evening, hundreds of people were gathering at a beach in the city of Baru for a party when a 6 m (18 ft) high wave hit the coast, killing many people, leaving the beach in complete disarray.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In a press conference in Jakarta, the spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB, Sudopo Purwo Nugroho, said: "Unfortunately, people were on the beach when the tsunami hit yesterday and they were unable to escape in time.
The tsunami, which was rife with cars, timber, houses, and all the land, struck the coastline, Ngorongoro said, adding that it was crossing the high seas at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the sea, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24 evacuation centres in Baru.
The rescue agency's air photos show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted, collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by sea water.
The city was hit by a devastating earthquake on Saturday.
The region of 2.4 million people was hit by a powerful earthquake.
The Indonesian Institute of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the force released by the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement also noted that the city is located at the end of a narrow bay, so the geographical location may have amplified the strength of the beach.
Nugroho described the damage as massive volcanic eruptions and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
Some of the dead were crushed under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the damage and casualties could be more severe along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Baru, in the region of Tangara, which is closer to the quake.
The message booth in the city is completely shut down, with no news, Ngoroho said.
The Red Cross said that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that Red Cross staff and volunteers were travelling to the affected area.
The Red Cross has said that while it is already a tragedy, it could be worse.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing the public about the tsunami that hit Baru, although officials said the tsunami occurred after the alert was issued.
In a video shared on social media by amateurs, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard screaming madly at the crowd down the street, warning them of an impending beach.
Minutes later, the water walls hit the coast, rolling over buildings and vehicles.
Reuters cannot immediately identify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused massive power outages, cutting off communications around Baru, and preventing government authorities from coordinating rescue efforts.
Indonesian authorities said the military had started sending rescue transport aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuation personnel were still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city of Baru is currently only reopened for rescue and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centre in Baru on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800 people.
It's really bad.
While the staff of the Bangla World Declaration Society have arrived safely in Baru and the employees of Baru have been temporarily placed in the temporary oil tank shelters built in the company's courtyard, the scenes they saw on the way were unbearable, Doseba said.
He said that the people of the city were not able to see the buildings being destroyed.
It's really bad.
As the rescue group began the brutal campaign and started the disaster equipment, some complained that foreign rescue workers with deep expertise were banned from traveling to Baro.
According to Indonesian law, the movement of funds, goods and personnel overseas is only allowed when a disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
But it has not been announced.
The situation is still a provincial disaster, said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says that the tsunami is a national disaster, we can go to international relief, but the current situation does not allow it.
On the evening after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, in Baro, the relatives of the missing people still hold a line of hope that their loved ones can create a miracle that will add color to this tragic natural disaster.
On Saturday, rescuers rescued a boy from the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been crushed for two days under the rubble, with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national figure skating team, trained two missing figure skater athletes in preparation for the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month.
He was also a student of the other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
As a senior athlete in the field of sliding, I bear the emotional burden of personal weight, he said.
Gendon said that hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread in the skiing community, he was desperate to send a WhatsApp message to his Barrow competitor at a beach party.
However, his message always showed only a grey pair instead of a blue pair.
I think that means that the message didn't send a success story, he said.
A thief stole $26,750 from the ATM at Newport on the Levee
A news report from the Newport Police Department reported that a Brink employee was stolen $26,750 on Friday morning when he was putting a cash note in the ATM at Newport on the Levee.
Dennis McCarthy of the police department reported that the driver of the car had cleared the ATM of the entertainment restaurant and was preparing to go inside.
While he was busy, a man ran out of the Brink employee's backyard and stole a bag of banknotes that should have been in the ATM.
Witnesses reportedly found several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the case.
Anyone who can provide information about the theft should call 859-292-3680 and contact the Newport Police.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to "Ye"
The song was written by rapper Kanye West, who changed the name to "Ye".
He announced his name change on Twitter on Saturday, specifically: "Kane West, as we all know him before".
West, 41, has been known as "Ye" for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, released in June 2018.
The name change was announced ahead of his participation in the Saturday Night Live show, and he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi Yandhi.
The show's producers said he took over from singer Ariana Grande, who had cancelled the show due to emotional issues.
In addition to being an abbreviation of West's current professional name, he has said before that the word has religious meaning to him.
In a talk show with radio host Big Boy earlier this year, West said: "I believe Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye is the most common word in the Bible, meaning "to make you laugh".
Oh, so I am you, and we are you.
I used to use the name "Kanye" which means "the only monkey", but now it's "Ye", which reflects our good, bad, lost, everything.
This album is more about who we are.
Many famous rappers have changed their names.
Sean Combs has used many names, most commonly Puff Daddy (P. Diddy) and Diddy (Duddy), but this year he announced that he prefers both names to Mom Love (Love) and Mom Brother Love (Brother Love).
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has also changed its name, using either unrelated or unrelated characters and capitalization.
AMLO Mexico has declared that it will not use force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has reiterated that no use of force against civilians will be used in the country on the 50th anniversary of the upcoming student persecution.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador pledged in Tlatelolco Plaza that the Mexican people will never use force to suppress the Mexican people's democracy.
On October 2, 1968, as the leftist student movement was taking root throughout Latin America, Mexican forces opened fire on the square during a peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador pledged to provide scholarships and open more free public universities to support the development of Mexico's younger generation.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead to teenagers going down a criminal path.
US should double its A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in research into AI, the United States should double its research spending in the field, said investor and AI entrepreneur Kai-Fu Lee. Lee has served at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were directed at AI announcements made by various departments of the US government, which in general lack a formal AI strategy.
China has launched a plan last year: to become a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
So, in this area, all other countries are far behind the United States, and we're looking for new breakthroughs in AI, so doubling the AI research budget would be a good starting point, Lee said.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling funding could double the chances of the United States becoming the AI breakthrough again.
Lee's book The Superpower of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published last month by Hackett Publishers. Lee is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in Face++, one of China's most well-known AI companies.
In the 1980s, he created an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University, defeating top-ranked American Athlete Othello, and became the executive director of the Microsoft Research Institute and president of Google China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and then asked what competitions would be launched to help the next group of dreamers achieve their goals.
Researchers in the United States often have to pay a high fee to get government funding, Lee said.
The Chinese are not taking our academic leaders, but corporate ones, Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired some of the most prominent people in the university to work on AI.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its work on AI.
I think that we should give Dr. AI green cards, he said.
The State Council of China released a new generation AI development plan in July 2017.
Lee said that in the United States, American researchers can get funding from the National Science Foundation and other government organizations, and in China, the National Science Foundation provides funding for researchers in academic institutions, but the quality of academic work in China is relatively poor.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to attract partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced that it will invest $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
Currently, the National Science Foundation has more than $100 million in annual funding for AI research.
In contrast, the US legislature has been in the dark for months about the creation of a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonia to hold a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people held a referendum on Sunday to decide whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute between Macedonia and Greece, which has prevented it from joining the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
A province in Greece, also called Macedonia, retains the name of its northern neighbour, meaning that Greece has legal rights to its territory and has refused to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU).
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would jeopardize the ethnic identity of the majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum and that the boycott was questionable as to whether the vote would meet the minimum voting rate of 50% that would have allowed the referendum to take place.
The question about the referendum vote is: Do you accept the agreement with Greece for membership in NATO and the European Union?
More prominent supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia is one of the countries that derived from the breakup of Yugoslavia and that it is worth paying a price to seek membership in institutions such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
I am voting for the future of the country, for the young generation of Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the protection of the EU, because that means we can all live a safer life, says 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska of Skopje.
While not bound by law, enough MPs have said they will resolutely abide by the results.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said that as of 1 p.m., no wrongdoing reports had been received.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters participated.
I voted for my children, we live in the European capital of Skopje, says Gjose Tanevski, 62.
On 30 September 2018, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, along with his wife Zorica and son Dushko, cast their respective votes in a referendum on the name change in Macedonia, which will pave the way for Macedonia's accession to NATO and the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage in front of the entrance to the Skopje Parliament and moved his chair to the tent built by those who opposed the referendum.
While the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) are committed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, we want to join with the courage to stand up and not walk the back door, Kavardarkov said.
The country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don't consider us Macedonians, we can turn to other countries like China or Russia to help us become members of the AEOC.
General Zaev said that Macedonia's membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would bring the much-needed investment to its unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
I am sure most people will support the referendum, because more than 80% of our people support NATO and the EU, Zhaev said after the vote.
He said the vote for the Yankees would determine our future.
Polls released by the Macedonian Institute of Policy on Monday showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - a figure below the required turnout.
Another poll by Macedonian Telma TV found that 57% of respondents said they planned to participate in Sunday's vote.
Of course, 70% of the population said they would vote in favor.
The referendum is a success, with a turnout of 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum means that pro-Western government policies will be hit hard for the first time since taking office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City side Sergio Aguero breaks through Brighton's tight defence to score
On Saturday, at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, Manchester City's Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through the defence of Brighton, eventually winning 2-0.
The goal of Aguero in the 65th minute looked easy.
The Argentine forward took the pass in the middle of the field at the start of the match.
He quickly ran over the three defence members of the Brighton team and rushed to the open zone.
After the match, Aguero found himself surrounded by four other players.
He launched a defence squad and overtook several on the edge of the Brighton blockade.
Then he pushed the ball to the left and passed it to Stirling.
The England striker used his first touch in the restricted zone to pass the ball back to Aquino, who shot the ball to the right side of the goal with his right foot, knocking off Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
The foot injury to the left side of the neck was felt by the Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who was also the manager of the club.
We talked about getting him to play for 55 or 60 minutes.
He did it.
Fortunately, he scored the goal in that moment.
However, it was Stirling who established the initial advantage for the Sky Blues in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that match, Aguero received the ball from behind Brighton.
He passed the ball along the left wing to Leroy Sane with a beautiful straight pass.
After several touches, Sane led Stirling to the far pole.
The Sky Blues forward easily put the ball into the net before slipping out of the lineup.
Manchester City will play against their Champions League group opponent, Hoffenheim, at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday afternoon at 12:55 p.m.
Scherzer wants to play against the Los Angeles Angels.
The National Team was eliminated in the playoffs, so there is no reason to force them to start again.
Seeger, who was eager to win, hoped to make his debut against the Colorado Angels on Sunday, but assumed the Los Angeles Dodgers were still immersed in the playoff effects, the Los Angeles Dodgers led the National League West (NL) by one point.
The Los Angeles Angels won 5-2 on Friday night against the Nationals, locking at least one outcard number, but they still want to take the division title.
And if it wasn't for that, at least we could play at the Denver Super Bowl, and other teams would be playing at the highest level I'd be facing this year.
How can I not want to participate in the contest?
The national team has not announced the starting line-up for Sunday, but it is reported that in this case they will likely allow Schizer to pitch.
This will be the 34th start for Schesser, who started training at the cowshed on Thursday and will pitch on a normal Sunday.
The right-hander from Washington has a record of 18 wins and 7 losses in 222 2/3 innings this season, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of the Republican primary in the midterm elections, the president indirectly reflected the situation facing Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court elector he was elected to.
And I think that's why we're doing everything we can to help the country in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
This is important, I am not running, I am running around so that you can choose the best candidate, he said.
Trump continued, "Oh, you see how terrible the Democrats are, and you can see it now".
They will use whatever means necessary to take their power back, and you will see their filthiness.
They don't care who they hurt, to take power, to get control, to put who under their feet, it doesn't matter to them, they only have power and control in their eyes, and we won't give it to them.
The Democratic Party's mission is to fight back and block the election.
"You've seen this in the last four days", he said, "and he called the Democrats angry, shameful, mean, hypocritical".
He mentioned the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which caused a stir.
Do you remember her answer?
Is this the document you leaked?
Oh, oh, what.
No, oh, no, no, someone gave me this kind of body language that was so bad, it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a bigot.
The people here are not allowed to speak up.
I was not surprised when activists from the local Momentum party voted against me.
After all, I was a Labour MP who finally found out that I was not a popular MP, but that we were not popular because we expressed our opinions.
My colleague Joan Ryan in Parliament was treated similarly for her strong opposition to anti-Semitism.
The criticism of my motion was because I was against Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, similar issues have emerged in the areas of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, in which Jeremy and his predecessors have opposed each other.
The notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that we hope the meeting will be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, this is what the GC meeting on Friday night looked like.
Unfortunately, today, this is no longer the tone of many conferences, and people have long forgotten the political promises of kindness, gentler, and seem to have never even started to practice them.
Labour cannot tolerate the left-wing view, and all views are based on whether the Labour leader accepts them.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the Labour Party, and I had thought that my colleagues and I had the same political views, but they began to expect me to change my views and take a position that I would never agree with, whether it be on national security or the single market of the EU.
Whenever I speak publicly, what I say is not important, and it is followed by accusations on social media that I have been asked to cancel elections, condemned Chinese politics, or told that I am not worthy of joining the Labour Party.
I am not alone in this experience.
In fact, I know that I am lucky for some of my colleagues, because my comments are often political.
Many of my colleagues face the same criminal charges every day, either using offensive language that discriminates against gender or speaking in a racist tone. But they never shy away from it, and I admire their professionalism and determination.
The most disappointing thing about this political era is that insulting language has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant cultural atmosphere.
The fact is that we are no longer a large church with multiple voices, and that, with each one of the rallies of mistrust and rallies, the changes in the selection rules, the Labour Party becomes more narrow.
I have received many advice over the past two years, encouraging me to stay calm and not speak so outspoken so that I can be more self-sufficient.
But that's not my original intention in politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was a student in school. When our comprehensive school curriculum was largely in shambles due to the neglect of the Thatcher government, I have since done my best, either as a Member of Parliament or as a government minister, to seek better public services for those who need public services most.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
It is no surprise to anyone in Nottingham East that there are differences in my policy stance and areas where I am with my current leadership.
To those who proposed on Friday, I would say that I don't understand that you are still wasting time and energy to decry my loyalty to the Labour leader as our country struggles to achieve Brexit, at the expense of our families, businesses and public services.
In fact, I would like to say a word to my constituents -- whether they are members of the Labour Party or not -- rather than to the Nottingham Momentum: I have the honour of serving you, and I guarantee that no threat to the election or political interests that will prevent me from acting in the way that I think is best in the interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie, the current MP for Nottingham East
The United States is the only country in the world to have won the World Cup.
The last two attempts may have influenced the final result to some extent, but there is no doubt that the win in this intriguing game is deserved.
They are now the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, their excellent defense and unusual opportunities were a great addition to the team and to coach Peter Murchie.
"We've been through the toughest of times, but so far we've been unbeaten, and I'm happy about that", Mercy said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The honour of playing for the Allies is that they have taken advantage of the opportunity better than we have.
Grant Anderson temporarily took the lead in the 14th minute, before being replaced by Frazier Climo, but the golden medal against the Braves by Scottish forward Rory Hughes gave Melrose the lead in numbers, while Jason Baggot seized the opportunity to remain unchanged.
Before the half-time break, Crimmo extended the lead of the AL with a single point, and after scoring, he got extra points alone to make the score 17-5 at half-time.
But Melrose's second half started well, and Patrick Anderson's one-point shot shortened the score gap to five points.
Following a prolonged delay due to serious injury and a carry-off, Ruaridh Knott was again forced to retire after the game resumed, with the club once again winning the match by a shot by Crimmopolitan Stafford McDowall.
Following the Yellow Card warning of ACL's vice-captain Blair Macpherson, Melrose regained the lead in numbers, breaking the huge pressure spell with the unreplaced Bruce Colvine's shot.
However, after the team regained momentum, when Struan Hutchinson was warned by a yellow medal after a goalless run against Crimson, McPherson scored a touchdown from behind the Albion offensive line.
As with the restart, Crimmo was replaced again, with Kyle Rowe taking the lead for the fifth time after the first attempt by the home team, sending off sideman Gregor Henry.
Still Game stars in the lead roles as they prepare to enter the catering industry
Still Game stars Ford Kieran as a man who appears to be preparing to enter the hotel industry after being discovered as a director of a registered catering company.
The 56-year-old actor played Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, which he wrote and co-starred in with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the show's final season, and Keelan also appears to be planning to follow Craig's life.
According to official records, Keelan is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a reporter for the Sun newspaper suggested that Kiran wanted to join Craigslist's Red Fire catering business.
The Pacific Ocean is our land: neighboring country Bolivia wants a ruling to restore the Pacific route
The seamen searched the well-equipped naval headquarters in Rabas.
The flags of the blue sea are flown in public buildings.
The words from the sea of Kauka to the Amazon naval base are: "The Yangtze Sea is our legal property".
We are committed to taking back the sea.
In Bolivia, surrounded by land, the memory of the coastline falling into Chile's hands is still alive in the midst of a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century.
This decades-long hope has reached its peak as Bolivia finally awaits the International Court of Justice's ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said: "Bolivia has the energy, the people are focused, and unity is the key to a positive ending".
The International Court of Justice will broadcast the entire ruling process live on major screens across the country, with Bolivians watching it in full view. The Hague court hopes that after decades of intermittent negotiations, the Hague courts will be able to support Bolivia's claim.
Evo Morales, the country's most charming president, is a native of the country and will also be interested in the decision on Monday.
He had announced in late August that the Japanese were about to return to the Pacific Ocean.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and that if it does, it will not change anything.
The Netherlands-based United Nations agency has no right to grant territory to Chile and has issued a rule that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
Paz Zárate, an international law expert in Chile, said that the final debate was just six months after the International Court of Justice had decided, suggesting that the case was not complicated.
The country has not been able to achieve this goal in the past four years, and it may be backwards.
The current Bolivian government has blocked access to the Pacific Ocean, Zarate said.
She said that Morales' provocative remarks had exhausted the goodwill of the Chilean people.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to engage in dialogue sooner or later, but after that, it will be difficult to continue the dialogue.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, denied the claim that the court's decision was unusually swift.
The results of Monday will open a new era of relations with Chile and will bring an opportunity for the Bolivian government to end 139 years of dispute and mutual benefit, he said.
For Morales (still one of Latin America's most popular presidents) to have sought to use the maritime issue as a political crutch, Kaldira also denied the claim.
The president of Bolivia will never give up the right to use the Pacific, he added.
The verdict will create an opportunity for us to overcome the past.
North Korea says it will not disarm if it does not trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Lee Yong-hoon said that if the United States is not trusted, North Korea will never disarm.
The UN General Assembly on Saturday was met by a speech by Lee Yong-hoon.
He called on the United States to fulfill the commitments made between the leaders of the two countries during the Singapore summit.
Lee Jong-un's remarks were made more than three months ago when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore to try to restart a deadlocked nuclear diplomacy.
Li Yong-yeon said that trying to force North Korea to kneel down through continued sanctions, even against the declaration of an end to the war, was a day-and-a-day dream.
If Pyongyang cannot take a major disarmament action first, Washington will be cautious about agreeing to the declaration.
Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump both hope to hold the summit again.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether North Korea will actually abandon its nuclear arsenal, after all, it is highly likely that North Korea will see it as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit North Korea next month to discuss the possibility of another summit of South Korean-American leaders.
Paris Fashion Show brings a lot of new headlines
If you are hesitant to buy a hat or a sunscreen, do not hesitate.
Designers Valentino and Tom Browne unveiled the bizarre super-large SS19 series at the Paris Fashion Week, which surprised everyone.
This summer, Instagram was so overwhelmed with unpractical hats that the designers brought their own eye-catching hats to T-Series.
The most notable example of Warren's work is a metallic-colored top hat, with a wide feathered edge that completely covers the heads of the models.
Other oversized items include jewelled pumpkin hats, witch hats, and even a hat, but the designs were not intended for heating.
In the run-up to Halloween, Tom Browne introduced a series of bizarre masks.
The many-colored masks, with two lips, are more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
Some have similar lung diving equipment, with breathing tubes and goggles, and some have melted ice cream cans.
The first is that the world is not a perfect place to live, but a place to live.
Fashion observers predict that the giant hat may soon be on the fashion street near you.
Rihanna, Emily Ratajkowski, La Bomba, the straw hat on top of her head, is a very eye-catching, oversized hat, and is 2 feet wide, which is a popular decoration for the dummy.
The cult label behind the very unrealistic hat that emerged on social media sent another important creation to the T-Stage - a strawberry sandbag almost as big as the model in a swimsuit. The no-thing-utility hat was widely publicized on social media, and the fashion label behind it gave another big idea to the T-Stage, a strawberry sandbag almost as big as the model in a swimsuit.
This orange-colored raffie straw, edged in a wine-colored orange, with white leather handles, is a nod to the Paris Fashion Week Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 series.
Famous fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I estimate that next summer, fashion streets will have a variety of big hats and sandbags, because designers have made a huge impact on the demand for super-sized accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland have maintained excellent academic performance, and in 2018 they have achieved a number of positive test scores, with individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community work added to the list.
The private schools, which have more than 30,000 students from across Scotland, work to provide the highest quality services to students and parents under the guidance of the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS).
The purpose of the private school is to provide a good foundation for students' continued education and higher education, career choices and social status as global citizens.
As an educational institution capable of designing and implementing customized school curricula, we are fortunate to witness that modern languages have always been a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: "If you talk to each other in a language that others can understand, your words will enter the minds of others".
If you talk to them in their mother tongue, your words will enter their hearts.
This phrase reminds us that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with foreign friends.
According to the latest results of this year's examinations, the language of private schools has been consistently ranked in the top 10 in terms of passing.
68% of students studying foreign languages have achieved A grade.
Data from 74 member schools of the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS) shows that 72% of students have achieved A-levels in Chinese, while 72% of students studying German, 69% of students studying French and 63% of students studying Spanish also achieved A-levels.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign language as an important skill that children and adolescents will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, as a subject, language is considered synonymous with STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of the reasons employees are working hard to fill vacancies is due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly essential to laying a good foundation for a young person's future career.
As more jobs will require language in the future, this skill is becoming essential in today's globalised world.
Whatever career you choose, if you learn a second language and master the skills that will benefit you for life, you will have a real advantage in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with foreign friends will definitely put those who speak multiple languages first in the competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adult citizens showed that 75% of people were able to use a foreign language well for conversations, with French being the only language used by hundreds of people, compared to two-digit (15%) speakers.
Therefore, it is necessary to invest more in language education for children today.
The knowledge of multiple languages, especially in developing countries, will provide better opportunities for children to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, the languages taught in each school are different.
Many schools focus on teaching more classical modern languages, while others teach languages they believe will be of great importance to the UK in 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest in what language, private schools offer a variety of language options and are equipped with professional teachers in the field.
Regardless of the future of the child, private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a good learning environment where children can build a solid foundation and develop the skills they need to succeed.
There is no denying that in today's global business environment, language remains vital to the future of a country and must therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be seen as a tool for international communication skills.
Private schools in Scotland will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence for young people.
It has to be done.

LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans are waiting for LeBron James' debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers head coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it is not yet known when James will appear.
Watton said on the Lakers' official website that the clock will be between 1 minute and 48 minutes.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James' playing time may be limited.
After training ended earlier this week, James was asked to plan for the Lakers' six preseason schedule.
He said that at this stage of his career, I no longer need to be in the pre-season to warm up.
Trump's time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is scheduled to open a series of campaign rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
This is the first of five rallies Trump plans to hold next week, including stays in places he likes, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
The move, which was intended to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections as the Republican Party faces the risk of losing control of Congress during the November vote, was postponed due to the election's choice to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.
What is the time of Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. eastern time.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via his YouTube channel.
Trump is likely to address the issue of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh at a hearing this week, which has strained the allegations of sexual misconduct during an FBI investigation due to the expected one-week suspension of the Senate vote.
However, the main purpose of these rallies was to help the Republicans win support in the November elections.
According to Reuters, President Trump's campaign said the five rallies next week were intended to inspire volunteers and supporters as the Republicans seek to protect and expand their seats in the Senate and House.
A spokesman for the Trump campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters that the control of the Senate was critical to its agenda, so the president will travel to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season comes.
According to the West Virginia-based The Wall Street Journal, the rally planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena will bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and will attract a large number of Pittsburgh media outlets to cover the event.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month on Saturday, with a victory in 2016 over the state by more than 40% of the vote.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey in West Virginia, who is lagging behind in the polls.
According to Reuters, political scientist Simon Haeder of West Virginia University said that President Trump had to push the tide in the polls to help him, which was not a good sign for Morrissey.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA showcases a strong and unyielding spirit of competition in singles on Sunday
After the first three singles matches, Saturday afternoon's four-man match may be exactly what the Ryder Cup needs.
The concept of the swing is a completely new concept invented by the sports community, and sports players have no doubt about it, especially in such games.
Now, where is the momentum?
"We've got six points ahead of them, and now we're four points ahead, so I think we've got some momentum now", Jordan Spieth said.
Of course, the European team has a certain advantage, currently leading by 4 points and 12 points in the next match.
As Spitzer said, the Americans were not doing well, but there were many things that were encouraging, especially the performances of Spitzer and Justin Thomas, who played an entire day, scoring three points out of four.
Speith was extremely lethal from the pitch to the stump, scoring a benchmark.
As the game progressed, shouts of applause rose, and in the event of a 2-2 draw with Thomas, he scored a key kick to tie the fourth game.
His kick was a victory for the U.S. team, and the field was once again filled with cheers and applause, which showed us that they believed the U.S. team was not out of the game.
Spears: "Oh, you really need to get into your inner, inner game.
This is the current state of all players.
18 holes to hit the ball.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more than Spitz and Thomas, which is the undisputed record for the Ryder Cup.
The pair, who have won four games without losing a game, will not make mistakes.
Mollywood were the only team not to play a game of parka on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided parka on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning after nine innings.
The energy flowing to the crowd and the way they came out of it made it clear that they were the only ones to beat on Sunday and that there would be no more popular players to steer their European victories.
It's best to be in different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about European team victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon set up a morning match with Alex Noren, the four-ball hero Sergio Garcia.
A pair of pinballs and two top nine doubles put the Spaniard and the Swedish player in a hole they could never climb out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of the hole.
The four-man four-ball and four-man one-ball tournaments are particularly attractive and suitable for close-up viewing, as partners' cooperation, mutual suggestions, reminders and strategies can change in an instant.
So far, the European team has performed better and has gained a clear lead on the final day, but this four-man match also shows that people, especially people in the United States, are not suspicious of the desire to fight.
European teams lead 10-6 to the final of the Ryder Cup
After a 10-6 win over the USA in Saturday's four-man and four-man doubleheader, Europe will advance to the final of the Ryder Cup with an absolute advantage.
The intuitive duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead in the match against Tiger Woods, with two wins, up four points from Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to recover the trophy they lost two years ago at the Blazers, beat the mistaken American team 3-1 in the morning's four-man match.
The U.S. team fought hard in the four-man doubleheader, winning two games, but was never able to make up for the backlog.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to defend the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to score four points, and he and Mourinho, known as the Pom Morewoods after a shocking weekend, were the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in the opening four games.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-man four-man event, they teamed up to win the game 5-4 to defeat the discouraged Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau.
Woods, who scarcely completed two games on Saturday, has occasionally had flashbacks, but he has now lost 19 of 29 four-man and four-man events, including seven straight.
Justin Rose, who did not play in the four-man event this morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the four-man event, where the pair beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who were ranked world No. 1 and world No. 3, 2-1.
Despite having a nice, easy day in the southwest of Paris, the European team did not do what they wanted.
Three-time Grand Slam champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a good foundation for the U.S. team on Saturday with two points.
They took the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2-1 in the four-man event, and then came back to beat the Spanish team 4-3 in the two-man event, despite losing the opening two holes.
Only two teams in the history of the Ryder Cup have been relegated to the quarter-finals, although as hosts the Fuhrerk team can only win the trophy by drawing.
However, as the second-place finish in the previous two days of competition, it seems to be going to be overtaken in Sunday's counterattack.
North Korea says it is impossible to unilaterally disarm without enough confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepened North Korea's distrust of the United States, in which case it would be impossible for North Korea to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the World Organization's annual United Nations General Assembly, said that North Korea had taken a number of friendly steps over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, demolishing nuclear test sites, and ensuring that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology would not surge.
However, we have not seen any response from the US, Li said.
As long as we lack confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in national security, and in this case we will not be the unilateral disarmed bird of prey anyway".
While Lee reiterated his consistent complaint about the North's efforts to resist Washington's phase-out of nuclear weapons (in which case North Korea will be rewarded by gradual measures), the focus of his statement seems to be that North Korea has not refused to give up unilateral denuclearization like Pyongyang in the past.
Li mentioned a joint statement by the current US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at their first meeting in Singapore on June 12, during which Kim Jong-un promised to work towards the achievement of a nuclear-free Kim Jong-un peninsula, while Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls for the easing of tough international sanctions against North Korea.
Li said the U.S. has been stepping up its nuclear-de-nuclear advance and has been pushing for its goal through sanctions and enforcement, even opposing the U.S. declaring an end to the war.
The idea that sanctions can make us surrender is nothing more than a daydream about people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our distrust of the United States.
Lee did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim Jong-un and Trump, which the U.S. leaders stressed earlier this week.
The Foreign Minister insisted that Kim Jong-un had three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding that if South Korea were on the side of the denuclearization issue rather than the United States, the North Korean peninsula would not be in such a state of chaos.
Even so, after the evil President Trump called Kim Jong-un a suicide bomber, Lee told the UN General Assembly that North Korean artillery would inevitably target the US mainland, but Lee's speech was different from last year's.
Trump, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea completely, was highly appreciated by the UN for his courage in taking disarmament measures against Kim this year, but he said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must continue until North Korea achieves denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying it didn't matter if it took two, three or five years or months.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward measures taken against Pyongyang.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday that it is imperative that the United States continue to vigorously implement the sanctions until we achieve a final and fully verifiable nuclear-freeze.
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously agreed to strengthen sanctions against North Korea to cut funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile projects.
Pompeo met with Li Yong-yeon on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, saying he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said that if North Korea had not condemned him for the same demands within hours, the move would have made some progress.
In a meeting with the North Korean leader in Shenzhen this month, North Korea promised that if the United States took appropriate measures, it would demolish the missile launch site and the nuclear complex.
Li said Kim told him that the corresponding measures he was seeking were Trump's pledge to ensure security in Singapore and the progress of normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take classes to learn how to get enough rest
This year, Harvard University launched a new program to give all undergraduates more sleep to combat the increasingly prevalent male culture of caffeine-abusing nights.
One scholar found that the world's top universities often have no students when it comes to how to take care of their basic problems.
The program was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who believes it is the first program of its kind in the United States.
After publishing a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning, he was inspired to start studying the course.
After the speech, a girl came up to me and asked me: "Mom, why am I all grown up to know this?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me, and he told The Telegraph about it.
The first-ever launch of the program this year is focused on explaining to students how good sleep habits can help them achieve academic and physical performance and improve their overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry and executive director of the University's Department of Health Services at Harvard Medical School, said that after students were found to have severe sleep deprivation, Harvard decided to launch the program this week.
The hour-long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section of the classroom, a picture of a dormitory was shown, with students knocking on coffee cups, curtains, training textbooks and books, listening to the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of sleep deprivation on exercise performance, and the importance of activities before bed.
In another session, students learned how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
In the classroom, a map of the campus with interactive icons was hung, encouraging students to think about their daily activities.
And we know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know that smoking is harmful to health", Professor Ceisler added.
He said there is a growing trend of people taking pride in their efforts to go to yoga, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation will become an increasingly serious problem.
He said ensuring adequate sleep and good sleep quality should be a secret weapon for students to deal with stress, fatigue and anxiety, even to avoid gaining weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a hunger mode that causes people to feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who specializes in chemistry and physical biology, took a class with Professor Czeisler last year, his first year at Harvard University, and helped design the course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to work hard to create a campus curriculum.
He hopes that all graduates will complete similar courses before joining the competing institutions.
Professor Czeisler advises students to consider setting bedtime and waking bells, paying attention to the harmful effects of the ultraviolet light emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting devices, as this can cause a person to lose control of their day and night rhythms, leading to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers: Mong's goal forced Gerard to fall behind
The Rangers were defeated by Livenstein 1-0 after Dolly Menga's goal left Steven Gerrard's broken team at the bottom of the table.
Eberoks was attempting to record his first home win since a 4-1 win over St. John's Stone in February, but Gary Holt's team suffered his second loss in 18 games since Gerald coached, leaving his team eight points behind the Super League's top seed, the Liverpool Hotspur.
The first half ended with Monka scoring a goal seven minutes into the game, and the Rangers' lineup lacked momentum, which seemed to be difficult to beat.
The Rangers are now down to sixth place, while Livingston is up to third, with the net winning percentage only behind the Hebbenian.
The object thrown at the end of the guest match caused a head injury to the line referee Calum Spence, which could cause further trouble for the nomad.
Geraud made eight substitute appearances, helping Eyling to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, also picked 11 Levenston players who took the Hatts last week, and would be happy if these trained teams could hold their opponents in every round.
The Rangers may have taken the lead, but Levinson has been exceptionally outstanding in controlling the ball.
They should have scored in two minutes, and Monga first passed the ball to Scott Pittman, who passed it to Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a great opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs's one deep passing ball then passed to captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow took the lead in the back row.
The Rangers did manage the situation, but for the quarter-finals, they seemed to have more faith in their own hopes than they believed in themselves.
The game was one minute before Alfredo Morelos and Steven Lawless collided, Morelos was happy to get a point, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the request of the Colombian player.
The Rangers scored just two goals in the first half, but former Ebrooks goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by the headball of Lassana Coulibaly and the in-game shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Levenston's 34th minute opening battle may have been unfavorable to the pace of the game, no one denies their hardship to achieve this result.
The nomads are once again deep in the defensive tactics Jacobs has devised.
When Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield did not respond, and Affleck calmly judged that Monka would complete a simple shot.
Geraud replaced Ryan Kent with Curly Bailey at half-time, which worked almost immediately, leaving the position of the quarterback Morelos blank, but impressively Kelly blocked him from his own defensive line.
However, Livingston continued to attract the attention of fans in the way they enjoyed it, with Lithgow and Halcott playing one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the final stage, but McGregor was good enough to overcome Jacobs' offense before Leithgo broke the corner.
After a dispute with Jacobs, Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton again applied for a shot, but Thomson was blinded again.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger counter
The following is the contents of the early Sunday diary of the Julian calendar: September 30, 1882, or 136 years ago today, is calculated... it is the day that the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the development of a device called the Geiger meter tube.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become a mainstay of popular culture, as in the 1950 film The Colorado Bell Tower, playing the roles of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who seem unlikely to be a scientist:
Man: Wow, what's the point of this?
Rogers: The nickel is a Geiger meter used to locate radioactive minerals such as nickel.
The effect of the atomic radiation released by the minerals can even be heard after the headphones are put on.
Evans: I have to shrink, it's going to be very popular!
"Hans Geiger died in 1945 just short of his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name will live on forever.
New cancer vaccines can train the immune system to detect non-cancerous cells
New cancer vaccines can train the immune system to detect and kill the cells that are not immune to cancer
Vaccines train the immune system to recognize non-nuclear cells and thus be used to treat
This method requires removing immune cells from the patient's body and then modifying them in the laboratory.
This allows the liver to detect a protein common to many cancers and then re-inject it into the body.
One trial vaccine has been successful in a variety of cancer patients.
After using this immune system-trained non-steroidal vaccine to treat a woman whose ovarian cancer had disappeared for 18 months.
This method requires removing immune cells from the patient's body and then modifying them in the laboratory to detect a protein called HER2, a common form of cancer, and then re-inject it into the body.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results of our trials show that we are about to launch a very promising vaccine.
Professor Berzofsky explains that HER2 carcinoma is a contributing factor to several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers.
Immunocytes are extracted from the patient's body and trained to locate cancer cells using a similar method, which has been shown to be effective in treating leukemia.
Kanye West, who previously wore the MAGA hat for SNL, has faced outrage for supporting Trump.
The results were not good.
In a Saturday Night Live broadcast, Kanye West was booed during a public speech praising US President Donald Trump and saying he should be part of the 2020 election.
After performing the third song of the night in Ghost Town, wearing a hat that made America Great, he began to speak out against the Republicans and reiterated his support for Trump.
I've had a lot of conversations with white people and they've said, "Oh, how would you like Trump, his racist attitude?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I wouldn't have moved out of the United States long ago, West said.
SNL opens with a comedy-drama starring Matt Damon, in which Hollywood stars mock Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee over testimony given by Christine Blasey Ford on sexual assault charges.
Despite the fact that the show was not broadcast, Weston's footage was shared on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is difficult to determine whether Lock posted the video to mock West.
Meanwhile, West complained to the audience that he had a difficult time in the background wearing a hat.
According to the Washington Observer, he said that they were bullying me in the background.
They said, "Go out with that hat".
They were wronging me!
Then they said I was in trouble.
"Hey, you want to know what the problem is?" said West, "that's going to put on my superhuman cloak, because that means you won't be able to tell me how to do it".
Try to make love.
According to Variety, his comments have caused audiences to boo at least twice, and the cast of SNL appeared to be embarrassed, one of whom told the news reporter: "The whole studio is in a deadly silence".
West was invited to perform as the newest replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who had died a few days before her ex-boyfriend and rapper Mac Miller.
West, dressed as Perrier Bottle, sang the song I love It, which confused many.
West received the support of TPUSA's head, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To the most fearless of people: Thank you for your courageous resistance to the mob".
But talk show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just being brave enough to be himself, which is just a bunch of crap.
But I won't reward those who buy his music, dress or support his martial arts kit, who I think are embracing and spreading ideologies that are harmful to our community.
He's free.
We are also a motherfucker, Hunter added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and announced that his mother was now officially Kanye West.
He was not the first artist to change his name, and diddy (also known as puff daddy, puffy or p diddy) has changed his name before.
Snoop Dogg, who used the name Snoop Lion for the rapper, and of course the late musical genius Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, before the artist was known as Prince.
A Belfast restaurant is the scene of a murder with a knife
A 45-year-old man was charged with premeditated murder in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday in connection with a knife wound.
Police say the scene was discovered at the Ballyhackamore restaurant.
The accused is expected to appear in court on Monday for questioning in Belfast District Court.
The prosecutor's office will review the allegations.
The game is based on the popular game of thrones, which stars Kit Harington as a man who attacks the toxic masculinity of a monkey.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO series The Power of Swords, a medieval drama series.
Kit, 31, has been vocal about the stereotypical hard-core heroism of his character, saying that the role on screen means that young people always feel they have to be cool to be respected.
In a Sunday Times column on the culture of the monkey, Kit said he believed the monkey had been a problem and asked how to solve the #MeToo problem, which is a toxic monkey in the age of personality.
Kit recently married Rose Leslie, the star of the game show Power of Two, who is also the star of the series. Kit admits that he has a very strong sense of urgency and needs to address the issue.
"I'm not sure what the hell happened to the man who was in the room, but I'm sure he was in the room".
What do we teach our children as they grow up, from what we see in this question?
Kit believes that television may be responsible for the prevalence of the toxic stereotypes of teenage boys, as the personality portrayed on television is highly masculine.
He continued: "Who are the parents who are born and who are the ones who learn after the day?"
What is on TV and on the streets that makes these young people feel they should not be like this and be considered men?
I think this is indeed one of the most serious problems of our time, and how can we change that?
The problem is that young people are clearly facing problems.
In an interview, he also admitted that the game of power-hungry will be blown up next summer, after which he will no longer be appearing in any prequels or sequels, saying that he was tired of the battlefield and the horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in the remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother who is a bandit.
Kit recently revealed that he feels he is playing the role of a power-playing game, and the happiest thing is meeting his wife Rose.
He said that the family that came after me and the family that lives now, I met my wife in this TV series.
In the game of thrones, Rose plays the role of Ygritte, the lover of Jon Snow's character Kit. The game of thrones won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV: China's new HIV cases increase by 14%
China announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV.
The Chinese National Health Commission reports that China has more than 820,000 people infected with HIV.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, there were about 40,000 new cases reported.
The vast majority of new infections are sexually transmitted, a historic change.
In the past, the main way to spread HIV rapidly in parts of China was through the transmission of blood.
The National Health Commission of China said at a meeting in Yunnan province that the number of people infected with HIV in this way will be almost zero.
But at the same time, the number of people living with HIV in China has increased by 100,000 people compared to last year.
Sexual transmission of HIV has become a serious problem for LGBT people in China.
In 1997, China legalized homosexuality, but discrimination against LGBT people remains prevalent.
China's values are relatively conservative, with studies estimating that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are women, and the ultimate target of marriage.
Many diseases are spread due to a lack of neutral protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to the spread of AIDS medicine to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking information to Republican senators, sparking dangerous lies and conspiracy theories
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters condemned the publication of personal information about three Republican U.S. Senators by members of the House of Representatives on the House's Wikipedia page.
Maxine Waters (Democrat from Los Angeles) said the statement drew criticism from far-right lobbying experts and the website.
Waters said in a Twitter statement that lying, lying, is all ugly lies.
The information reportedly released includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday from the Capitol Hill, where the publisher accused Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, of sexual misconduct, while an unknown attendee of a Senate panel hearing was held.
The information was leaked some time after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
According to Hill, reports from conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have confirmed that the IP address of the information-sharing device is associated with Waters' office and that information about a Waters employee has been released.
Waters continued: "The claim of the mother is simply nonsense, a complete lie, an absolute lie.
The fact that the staff under my command were not the ones who leaked the information is a lie, but it is a lie that damages their identity, personal information and security.
The statement is simply nonsense, a complete lie, an absolute lie.
Waters's statement quickly drew criticism from netizens, including former White House press spokesman Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer writes: "Her mother's denial was filled with anger.
She is also a former member of the National Assembly of Myanmar, and she is a former member of the National Assembly of Myanmar.
For when someone accuses you of wrongdoing, you are more than likely to be angry.
No one is in the picture.
The accused's motives cannot be questioned.
It's time to calm down.
Fleischer appears to be comparing Waters's reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who appeared to be overly angry at his performance at Thursday's hearing, accused by critics.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also posted his views on Twitter.
He tweeted that if it were true, it would not be so exaggerated.
Waters said in a statement that her office had alerted Ms. Liu to the allegations of fraudulent intent by the authorities and law enforcement agencies.
She continued, "We want to make sure that the culprits are found and that they are held accountable for their actions, which have had a devastating impact on me and my employees".
The film is about the life of a spy, and the story of his life.
The current film reflects some of the British Brexit implications, with a British-oriented stance. The English action comedy-comedy-drama film The Peanut Agents of the World is similar. The first Peanut Agents of the World was released in 2003 and the second in 2011.
This is a joke about the lack of new export opportunities, and ironically, how unworthy we are of the message.
In any case, Johnny English, who stared at the big guy, without any ability to express himself, was again given permission to make a mess of things. His name is more expressive, and it is precisely the character that created this well-known comedy, aimed at non-English viewers.
Despite his uncanny desire to dress up as a gentleman, his charm and his uncanny secret agent image, he has shown off the clowns, the beans, and the guy who played the opening theme song of the 2012 London Olympics, Chariots of Fire.
Originally he was a tourist and international mystery man in a Barclays TV commercial, always making a mess of it, even though the ads have been forgotten in the back of the mind.
The British were out of the house with two bright spots in the potato agent's kitchen.
I like Johnny English, who was wearing medieval armor and was approaching a helicopter, and he was turning a leaf on his helmet, making a ton of noise.
Eckinson's talent for action comedy is evident, but his sense of humor is rather inadequate, odd, and strong, especially for serious film brands like 007 and Zheng Zheng, which are now confidently integrated into the comedy.
This sense of humor is more about children than adults. I personally feel that Johnny English lacks creativity and concentration in all the strange outdoor events compared to the peacock jokes that Eakinson plays in silent films.
The theme is now a major tune in the UK in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrates a super-secret spy network in the UK, exposing all British agents, which makes a minor character played by Kevin Eldon's gangster's boss think he's a little bit of a loser.
The Prime Minister's role in the film is exaggerated, problematic, and politically unpopular: Emma Thompson tries her best to portray the character of Theresa May from the outside, but there is no word in the film.
Her intelligence advisor told her that all active spies had been exposed and that only one person from a retired agent could be identified to take responsibility.
The only choice was Johnny English, a handsome, hard-working man who has now moved on and is a principal at a luxury institution but who teaches privately how to become a undercover agent: the baggage is new here because England has opened a rock-campus-style spy academy.
English was quickly taken back to the White House, attended an emergency conference, and reunited with his longtime friend, Bough (Ben Miller), who was also a bit of a pain.
The husband is now a household name and a bit of a waste to Vicki Pepperdine. The husband is now a married man and his wife is a submarine commander, a role that is somewhat popular and somewhat submissive to Vicki Pepperdine.
In this way, Batman and Robin, who made a big mistake in the Queen's Secret Service, returned and then they again played Olga Kurylenko, the serpentine beauty Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the British Prime Minister is alarmed by the intrigue of the intriguing Jason Volta, played by the charming tech billionaire Jake Lacy.
The English and cowards embark on their hilarious revelry: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a gold-plated French restaurant; create a chaotic suicide on a luxury yacht in Volta; and create a pure anarchy when they use virtual reality headsets to familiarize themselves with the interior of the Volta house.
All the suspense is finally unleashed, so harmonious, so hot, but overall, it remains only at the level of the low-key children's play.
The overall assessment is not quite the same.
Like the other two "Peanut Agents" films, I couldn't help but wonder: Can the British film industry give Rowan Aykinson a role that suits him?
Labour denies that there is no UK pay cut on the four-hour payroll
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider implementing a radical plan to make the British work four days a week without any pay cut.
Labour is reportedly hoping that companies will use the savings from AI to provide more than one day's rest for workers.
The new system allows employees to enjoy three days a week on weekends while keeping the salary they bring home unchanged.
The sources said the idea was in line with the Labour's economic agenda and that the plan would be geared towards British workers.
The four-day workday programme is supported by the British Trade Union Union (TUC) to help workers benefit from the economic transition.
A senior Labour source wanted to inform the Sunday Times that Liu is expected to publish the results of the policy review before the end of the year.
The move is not likely to be taken at once, but the work done in this way is in line with the aims of the Labour Party to favour workers and the overall industrial strategy of the Labour Party.
Labour is not the first party to support this idea, and the Green Party has pledged to introduce a four-hour working system during the 2017 general election.
However, the plan has not yet been supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour Party discoverer said that the working system for the four-hour strike was not a party policy and that the Labour Party had not yet considered it.
Shadow Minister John McDonnell, at a Labour Party meeting last week, specifically presented his views on the socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the public utility companies from the unseen hands of the executive and the crooked hands of the con artists.
McDonnell's plan also meant that existing shareholders of the water company might not be able to recover all of their shares, as the Labour government could be liable for the decrease in their shares for immoral conduct.
He also confirmed that the plan to support workers on the company's board of directors and create inclusive ownership funds, "is to give 10% of the private company's shares to employees so that employees can draw an annual dividend of up to £500".
Lynsey Graham and John Kennedy openly commented on whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh would affect their decision.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh forced the final vote on the nomination of the U.S. Supreme Court to be postponed by at least a week, while raising the question of whether the FBI's findings would shake Republican senators' support for Brett Kavanaugh.
In a 60-minute interview broadcast on Sunday, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican MPs John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI's findings would affect their decisions.
The idea of Kennedy Biggresham (from South Carolina) is more open.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
I said I was going to the hearing, and I said I've already talked to Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were filed and asked him if he had done anything.
He was determined, firm, clear.
However, Graham's vote seems to have been pinned down.
I've got my idea for the vote for Brett Kavanaugh, and I won't change my mind about the fireworks, even if it's a crime.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what the truth is, but what I know is that Brett insists he didn't do the filtering, Graham added.
The first time she was asked to speak, she said that she was not a woman.
It's been 36 years.
I'm not going to change anything.
What is the Global Citizen Music Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Music Festival, an annual music festival with a very impressive star cast and an equally impressive mission: to end world poverty.
This year, the 17th Global Citizen Music Festival will draw thousands of people to the grassroots of Central Park to celebrate performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, and raise awareness of the true purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Music Festival, established in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy organization that aims to eliminate poverty by actively increasing the number of people who are fighting poverty.
To get free tickets to events (unless you want to pay for VIP tickets), viewers must complete a series of tasks or a series of actions, such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness of their goal of poverty alleviation.
But is Global Citizen going to succeed with only 12 years to go?
Is it a way to convince people to take action with a free concert as a reward, or just another way of saying that people actually do something by signing online petitions or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that it has recorded more than 19 million actions from supporters to help achieve a wide range of goals.
Global Citizen says these actions have helped to promote the release of commitments and policies by world leaders worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the organization recognized 390 commitments and announcements in its operations, of which at least $10 billion had been paid or raised.
The organization expects the funds raised to date to have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between UK investors and implementors dedicated to helping children reach their full potential, and a pledge to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world.
At a concert in London in April 2018, Ambassador Tacey Ullman, speaking at The Power of Nutrition, told the audience that with the support of the UK government, donors, governments and many global citizens like you, the malnutrition social injustice is about to become a historic landmark.
The organisation also said that after more than 5,000 calls for action by the UK government to improve the nutritional status of mothers and children, the government announced the launch of The Power of Nutrition, a project that will provide nutritional intervention to 5 million women and children.
In response to a common question on the website, what do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen responded: "Well, it's going to be a long and difficult road - sometimes we even fall and fail".
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that we face, we will certainly succeed because we will be stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will be the guest performers at the festival, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Interior Minister says the US will move the Navy to blockade the pipeline to block Russian energy exports
According to the Washington Observer, Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of State for Internal Affairs, has revealed that Washington could mobilize its navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy shocks on markets, including the Middle East.
Zinckey claimed that Russia's activities in Syria - especially at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian government - were merely a prelude to exploring new energy markets.
Zincke reportedly said: "I think Russia is meddling in the Middle East because they want to repeat the way they have done in Eastern Europe, acting as an energy agent in the southern European hinterland".
The government has said that there are many ways and means to solve this problem.
He said the United States has the ability to work with our Navy to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, blockade to ensure that Russian energy does not enter the market.
Zinckey was speaking at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that claims to be a spokesperson for U.S. fossil fuel consumers.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that the two are actually the same.
He said that Iran and Russia had more or less the economic option of using and replacing fossil fuels, and that Russia was a black horse that relied on fossil fuels economically.
The above statement is due to the Trump administration's commitment to promoting LNG exports to Europe in exchange for Russia's cheaper status for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the timeless Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin a monopoly market for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline is a purely economic project aimed at doubling the existing pipeline capacity to 11 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's strong opposition to the project was entirely economic and unfair competition.
In September, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow that "I believe we all agree that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and consumers should have the right to choose their suppliers".
The US position was strongly opposed by Germany, which has reiterated its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organization, the German Industrial Confederation (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, chairman of the German Industrial Confederation (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, said that if third countries interfere with our energy supply, we will face serious problems.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would take the presidential election after the midterm elections seriously.
During her tenure at the City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
According to the Congressional Hillcrest, Warren said it was time for women to move into Washington politics, which requires an upper-level female head of government.
After November 6, I will seriously consider the presidential election.
Warren, referring to President Donald Trump during his term in office, said he was steering our country in the wrong direction.
I am deeply concerned about Donald Trump's actions on democracy, Warren said.
Warren was outspoken in his accusations against Trump and his nominated Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said of course we need the FBI to investigate the matter before the vote.
However, the results of the poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believe she should not participate in the 2020 election.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58 percent of likely Massachusetts voters said Senators should not run.
The vote was approved by 32% of voters.
Polls show that the majority of voters support the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% voting in favor of him and 48% voting against him.
Other high-profile Democrats who may be running for president in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would formally decide whether to run in January.
Sarah Palin shouts out at a presidential rally for Track Palin, who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder
Track Palin, 26, enlisted in the Army in September and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested on Monday night on charges of domestic violence.
She told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that she was feeling the same way her son felt, the feelings he felt after returning, believing that other soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder or other wounded soldiers' families could feel the same way.
Palin called his arrest an elephant in the room (a fact that was obviously overlooked) and said that people changed after her son and other veterans returned, wondering if they were being treated equally as soldiers, pilots and all other members of the military, as they were, and as they respected their homeland.
According to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and possession of weapons against a woman after being drunk.
US challenges new asylum policy, 18 states and the District of Columbia support
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have supported a legal challenge to a new policy that refuses to provide shelter to victims of gang or domestic violence fleeing the country.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia submitted a court-friendly briefing to Washington on Friday in support of a person seeking asylum challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been disclosed in the August lawsuit against federal policy filed by the American Civil Liberties Union - Grace v. Sessions.
Grace said she was abused by her partner, Mum, and her son, a member of the violent gang, but on July 20, U.S. officials denied her asylum application.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace said that countries like El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala face widespread gang and domestic violence, which has resulted in a large number of people seeking U.S. asylum.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturns the decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals in 2014 to allow illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement Friday, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy ignores the decades-old state, federal and international legal challenges.
The federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, which violates the above principles, court friends briefed.
In the brief, lawyers further argued that the policy of refusing immigration damages the U.S. economy, making people more likely to become entrepreneurs and providing the necessary labor force.
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop providing shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
When Sessions announced the policy on June 11, he said that asylum could be granted to people who are persecuted or fearful of leaving their country because of their race, religion, nationality or political views.
Asylum has never been about alleviating all the problems facing people around the world every day, even all the serious ones.
With the death toll doubling, desperate rescue workers in Baru are fighting for seconds to find survivors.
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
The mother, Risa Kusuma, 35, said she was relieving her son's fever in a severely damaged evacuation center in the city of Baru.
The ambulance is bringing the bodies every minute.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Residents returned to their destroyed homes, searching for items that were submerged in the water, trying to save anything they could find.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake injured hundreds of people and destroyed and flooded hospitals.
Some of the injured, including the back and shoulder wounded Twi Haris, were resting outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the ongoing tremors.
Harris's tears are filled with tears as she remembers the tremors of the earthquake in the fifth floor of the hotel where she lived with her wife and daughter.
We don't have time to save ourselves.
I think I was stuck in the ruins of the wall, Harris told The Associated Press, adding that the whole family was in town for a wedding.
And I heard my wife cry for help; but there was no voice afterwards.
I don't know what my wife and kids are going through.
I hope they are safe.
US ambassador to China accuses China of bullying in political propaganda ads
A week ago, a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper boasting of the reciprocal benefits of China-US trade, accusing the US ambassador in China of Beijing's use of the US media for political propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday mentioned that the Chinese Daily Mail published a paid increase in the Purdue Times, Iowa's largest selling newspaper, accusing China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, which China later denied.
Trump accused Beijing of trying to interfere in the US election, marking a new stage in the situation, as US officials told Reuters, as Washington's pressure on China escalates.
Although it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a escalating trade war, with several rounds of tariffs on each other's imported products.
Chinese-American experts say that at the beginning of the trade war, China's retaliatory tariffs were aimed at targeting Republican exporters who supported Trump in states like Iowa.
US Ambassador to China, former longtime Governor of Iowa, and major exporter of Chinese agricultural products, Terry Branstad, said Beijing's move hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
In a commentary in Sunday's Sunday edition of the Daily Mail, Branstad wrote that the Chinese government is increasing its bullying by publishing political propaganda ads in our own free media.
In political propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and press freedom to publish paid advertising in the front page of the Maine Chronicle, Blanchard wrote.
In contrast, you rarely see the voice of opposition on the streets of Beijing, nor the real reflection of the Chinese people's disagreements about China's worrying economic development trajectory, as the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that the most famous Chinese newspapers even refused to publish his articles, but he did not specify which ones.
Analysts warn that Republican women voters who leave before midterm will lead to Kavanaugh's defeat
For Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, several Republican leaders have steadfastly supported and defended, with analysts warning that they will face strong opposition, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment that this incident has sparked is so high that most Republicans on record have already indicated that they want to get the vote to go away.
In an article published on Saturday, Professor Grant Reeher of the University of Syracuse's Masseville School told the Congressional Hill that there was no way around this.
Ryle said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (Republican from Arizona)'s efforts to press the FBI in the emergency room will be enough to calm voter anger.
According to the Washington, D.C. newspaper, Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for MoveOn, said on Friday that women will never forget what happened in the past - tomorrow will not forget, and the entire month of November will not forget.
Despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee still choose to continue supporting Kavanaugh's nomination, led to a march on Friday morning alongside a parade in the Senate corridor, with protesters chanting "Hello, November is here!"
Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news website that the enthusiasm and motivation for democracy is about to be reinforced.
The people of the country say that the enthusiasm is already high; that is true.
But enthusiasm can be even higher, especially among women and young voters in suburban areas (aged 18-29) who don't vote often when they don't like the president.
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had warned that strong opposition would be sparked if the Republican continued to hold the vote.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said that the move would create chaos for the GOP.
Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, an organization that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel that it was not just about the vote or final vote of the committee, or whether Kavanaugh would be placed in a replacement seat, but also about how the Republicans handled the issue and how they treated the victims.
However, as the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh has emerged, there seems to be some disagreement among the American public about who should be believed, with a slight bias toward the latter.
The latest YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents clearly or likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they clearly or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents said they believe Kavanaugh's testimony may or may not have been false, while only 30% of respondents said they believe Ford's testimony may or may not have been false.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is currently investigating charges brought against Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, under the direction of Freck.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in an oath to prove that Kavanaugh raped her after she was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court candidate of exposing her genitals at a party in the 1980s while they were attending Yale University.
The inventors of the World Wide Web plan to pioneer a new Internet that is comparable to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, recently launched a startup that is trying to match Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project in the tech industry, Inrupt, is a company built on the open source platform of Solid by Bernas-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which information to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was for the company to rule the world.
Speaking about the startup, he said that we must act immediately.
The moment is historic.
The application uses Solid technology to allow users to create their own personal online data storage pads or PODs.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, it can be used on the same browser at the same time.
The unique feature of personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to users to decide which people can access what information.
The company calls this feature the "data empowerment" feature.
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the intention of Inrupt is to help the company bring in resources, processes and appropriate skills so that everyone can use Solid.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a number of contracts for dedicated developers and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will use the tools available on the Inrupt website to create their own decentralized apps.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether to make a radical change in all their business models overnight.
We are not asking for their permission.
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the quality and integrity of new networks based on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Alliance at MIT, which transformed the Internet.
In recent months, Bernas-Lee has become a central force in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee was still the founder and director of the World Wide Web Alliance, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I'm very much looking forward to the next generation of networking, Bernas-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemoration of the first Victorian Cross recipients
During World War I, the only clergyman in the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross for his actions, a ceremony was held in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Bernard Vann was awarded the Medal of Honor at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
Unfortunately, four days later he was killed by a sniper, so no one knew he had won Britain's highest military honor.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren unveiled the memorial at a parade in a row in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
His grandson Michael Vann said the monument was a symbol of the monarchy, commemorating the 100th anniversary of his grandfather's medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led the army, in a foggy fog, across the Canal de Saint-Quentin in the rain of cannon and machine guns.
He then rushed to the front line, bravely leading the front line fighters into the trenches, and then fired a single shot with a field gun, defeating three small battalions.
On 4 October 1918, more than a month before the end of the war, Colt Vann was shot by a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were, "I know that my grandfather's bravery will never be compared to mine, but it will keep me humble".
The march was led by the Brentwood Empire Youth Band. After the march, Michael Vann and his brother Dr. James Vann donated the wreaths.
Michael Vann said he was honored to be part of the parade, adding that the true heroes of the parade can be seen in the support of the crowd.
The show Bellator 206 was watched by MMA fans all night and turned into a piggyback page.
Imagine you're up all night waiting for Bellator 206 and you're told you can't watch the main event.
San Jose has played 13 matches, including six main ones. UK Channel 5 broadcasts the match live overnight.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, the channel changed its content to feed Piglet Page, which shocked British viewers.
Some people stayed up all night, waiting until morning, especially to watch the boxing match, but they fell to their glasses.
On Twitter, a fan said that turning the show into an animated film was a joke that would make people feel bad.
When asked about the program's broadcast, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said that the government had banned the 6 a.m. broadcast of such programs, so the TV station was forced to switch to children's programming.
The little piggy, the little piggy, the little piggy, the little piggy, the little piggy.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that the UK audience would be included as much as possible in future arrangements.
I think we can solve this problem when we consider rebroadcasting, Coker said.
The music was at six o'clock in the morning on Sunday in England, but we could only wait until Sunday when we were here to play again, which was Monday in England.
But we're still trying to figure out how.
I believe that after the program was changed, I received a lot of information and it was all unfriendly.
We were trying to figure out a way to do it, and we thought it was a technical failure.
But it's not, it's a matter of government regulation.
I can assure you that this will not happen next time.
We controlled five games instead of six, and we usually all played five, and we wanted to make the fans enjoy more, but it was too long.
It's a bit embarrassing.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley is a self-absorbed sexist
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt humiliated as a child because of his sexual orientation, but that was also the motivation for his success.
The 24-year-old said that after high school he realized that not everyone was as smart as I was.
In a talk show hosted by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others hope.
He also explained that after having children, he was less concerned with the issue of winning the Olympic title.
The regular host of the show, Kirsty Young, has been on hiatus for months due to illness.
As Laverne's first host, Daley said that as he grew up, he felt inferior to others because the gay community did not accept gay-to-girl interactions.
He said: "Until today, I still feel really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really
He said he wanted to prove that his mother was a mother, so that people would not be disappointed when they knew their sexual orientation.
Daley, a two-time Olympic bronze medalist, is now a prominent LGBT activist and has appeared at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, calling for more countries to legalize homosexuality.
He said that he dared to speak up because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any consequences and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that he met American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black in 2013 and was shocked to discover that he was in love with the man.
Last year, Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner, who said age gap was never an issue.
Daley first competed in the Olympics at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer. He said: "At such a young age, Daley has gone through so much that it is difficult to find people of his age who have similar ups and downs".
The couple had their son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, in June. After that, Dale's overall viewpoint changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would have said 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
But you know, there's something more important than an Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
He took a name for his son, Robert, in memory of his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 (aged 40).
Daley said his father did not believe he was going to die, and his last question was whether he would get tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't say to him, 'Dad, you can't sit in the front row,'" Mom said.
I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing, and I was actually confessing that he would never stop breathing until he had stopped breathing, and he was dead, and he never stopped breathing", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was my life's dream, and I've never felt better than this, swimming in front of a home crowd during the Olympics", he said.
It was because of this that Proud by Heather Small became his favorite song, which he fell in love with during the preparation for the Olympics, and now, hearing it, he will also be one of the vibrators.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on Sundays at 11:15 (BST) on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson, who was not feeling well, was sent off in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American player Phil Mickelson will set a record in his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he must adjust to his condition to avoid negative milestones.
Mickelson, who was entering his 12th appearance at the biennial event, was replaced by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-man and four-man doubles.
The five-time Grand Slam champion not only did not become a strong midfielder as he was in the United States, but spent a day at Larra and on the training ground, hoping to correct his problems as soon as possible.
Even at the peak of his career, the French National Golf Course (Le Golf National) with the steepest golf clubs and the tense atmosphere was not suitable for the 48-year-old, where high and low unstable routes made it harder to shoot off course.
If the course itself is not prestigious enough, Mickelson will take the full victory of their fourth game with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, who has already won the match against the defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday.
If the U.S. team starts 12 singles games with a quarter-final loss, Mickelson's game will be crucial for a good start.
Forrick has expressed confidence in his team, but has nothing else to say.
He understood the role he was playing today, grabbed my back, and hugged me with his arm, saying he would be ready to play tomorrow, Furick said.
He is very confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Famer, and has made a huge contribution to the team in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I wanted him to play more games, but the result was this, and I had to accept it.
He wanted to make a big impact on the pitch, like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break the record set by Nick Faldo for the most Ryder Cup appearances.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, but his personal record has never been this high.
Mickelson finished with a record of 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, although Furrick said his appearance brought some invisible strength to the team.
He was funny, sour, sour, and he liked to laugh at others, and he was a good guy in the team, he explained.
I think young players like to play with him, and this week it will be fun.
He also brought us a lot of money besides the games.
European captain Thomas Bjorn realizes that the big-leading position is about to be broken
In the experience of European captain Thomas Bjorn, it is easy to see that a single-elimination lead in the Ryder Cup could lead to a disadvantage.
Dean made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama, when a side led by Seven Ballesteros led the American team by five points, but ended up with only 141⁄2-131⁄2 in a very weak victory.
After watching the 2018 games at Le Golf National on Friday and yesterday (which were won 5-3 and ended up leading 10-6 respectively), Beyoncé described how you should always remind yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama and Brooklyn; although we lost at Brooklyn, we got a win at Valderrama.
History will tell me and every member of the team that it's not over.
You must do your best before tomorrow comes.
I'm going to go out and do the right thing.
It was not until the score was on the scoreboard that everything ended.
We are focused on trying to win the trophy and that is our focus.
I've been saying that I'm focused on the 12 players on our team, but we are very clear about what we are about to face - the strongest player in the world.
Beyonce was pleased with the players' tough competition on the golf course, adding: "Oh, in this respect, I can never beat myself".
Tomorrow is another evil war.
Tomorrow is a self-deprecating personal performance, somewhat different from the usual.
It would be great if the game went well and you fought alongside your teammates, but if you fought alone as a golfer, your overall ability will be tested.
This is the message you need to make clear to the team members that tomorrow they will be able to achieve their full potential.
Now, you have to leave your partner, and your partner has to leave you, each to the fullest of his or her ability.
Unlike Beyoncé, Jim Furyk expected the team's individual performance to surpass that of their teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points in the quarter.
As the European team struggled to achieve the Miracle at Medinah, which ended in defeat as part of the Brooklyn winning team, Furick was already on both ends of the final turning point, with a chance of victory.
When asked how Ben Crenshaw (then captain in 1999) encouraged his teammates to take the final, he replied, "Oh, I remember every damn tear".
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you can imagine the same pre-season as Valderrama and Brooklyn.
If everyone is going in the same direction, it will put a lot of pressure on the midfield.
So our lineup has been adjusted to show up in a way that is favorable to us, and everyone knows that we are working hard to create a miracle tomorrow.
Thomas will lead the team in the back-to-back, and will play against Rory McIlroy in the final, and European players like Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the semi-finals.
Speaking of singles, Beyoncé said that the order in which I deployed players was a decision made after considering all aspects.
German new battleship postponed for the first time
According to local media, the German Navy's latest battleship was supposed to be moderated in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era battleship, but due to system failures and cost-rolling snowball growth, we will not see the launch of the battleship until next year.
According to Die Zeit newspaper, a military spokesman said that the task of debriefing the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate, the Lilleland-Pfalz, has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The frigate was supposed to enter service with the Navy in 2014, but headache-prone post-production issues have been a constant threat to the fate of the minework.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class frigates recalled by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Baden-Württemberg-class frigates.
The frigate is expected to have powerful firepower, a large number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include a longer maintenance cycle - deployment of the latest patrol vessels for up to two years away from the port of origin.
However, the continuing extension means that the most advanced warships - which are said to enable Germany to deploy forces overseas - will be outdated by the time they enter service.
The fateful F125 was already in the news when the German Navy refused to de-modulate the frigate and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the withdrawal, but German media cited some key hardware and software flaws that would render the warship useless in carrying out operational missions.
The software defects would be particularly fatal as the Baden-Württemberg class battleships would be manned by 120 crew members and would require only half the manpower of the old Baden-Württemberg class battleships.
The submarine was also revealed to be heavily overweight, which would reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tonne Lilleland-Pufaltz was said to weigh twice as much as the equivalent class of battleships used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the entire project - including training of the crew - has also become a headache issue.
The cost is said to have reached a staggering 3.13 billion euros ($3.6 billion) against an initial budget of just 2.2 billion euros.
The problems facing the newest battleship have become more serious given recent warnings about the shrinking German naval strength.
Earlier this year, the chairman of the German parliament's Defence Committee, Hans-Peter Bartels, admitted that the German Navy had no actual ships to deploy.
The official said the problem was getting more serious over time, with old ships being phased out and no new ships being replaced.
He lamented that no Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could serve the Navy.
National Trust to listen to the secret lives of bats
A new study is underway at a Scottish Highlands estate to reveal how bats use the land to feed.
The research hopes that this discovery will uncover the behavior of this unique flying mammal and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will track the common wing and high-pitched wing, as well as the brown long-eared bat and Daubenton bat, at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
They will install special recorders in some key locations around the garden to track the bat's activities for four seasons.
NHS staff and volunteers will use handheld detectors to conduct a flow survey.
Professional sound analysis of all the recordings is then performed to determine the frequency of bat calls and what activity the bat is performing.
The habitat maps and reports are then produced to generate detailed landscape images of bat behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation adviser at the NHS, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are vital to bats and how each bat uses them.
This information will help to determine the interests of habitat management, such as lawns and how to best maintain the forests for the survival of bats and other related species.
However, the number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the past century.
Construction and development work has posed a huge threat to bats, affecting their habitats and even causing them to lose their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting, the chemical processing of paper and some building materials, and the attacks of pet cats pose a risk to bats.
The bat is actually visible.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting at night.
They are able to use sophisticated echo-location technology to pinpoint pests and obstacles in flight paths.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in Scotland, is very serious about the issue of bats.
The NTS has ten experienced experts who regularly conduct surveys, check-ups of the habitat and sometimes rescue.
The group even established the first and only dedicated bat reserve in Scotland at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight species of Scottish bats (a total of 10).
The mansion's manager, David Thompson, said the mansion was the ideal bat nursery.
The monkey at Threave Estate, we built a regional monkey for bats, Thompson said.
The city is home to old buildings, old trees and all the wonderful habitats.
But there is still a lot of unknown about bats, so what we are doing here and at other estates will help us to understand more about how bats thrive.
Thompson emphasized that bat status must be checked before the maintenance of the estate, as if an unintentional destruction of a female bat habitat could result in the death of up to 400 female bats and bat larvae, leading to the complete extinction of the local population.
Bat protection is illegal, and hunting, attacking, harassing or destroying bats or their habitat is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to contribute their strength.
She said: "We still have a lot of knowledge to learn about bats and many other species that we don't know the specifics of their populations".
Ronaldo denies rape charges, lawyers ready to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo, who was nicknamed the "Fake News" after facing rape charges, said people wanted to use him to fake their own identity.
His lawyer is preparing to sue the German news magazine Mirror Weekly for the alleged publication of the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, a US woman, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the weekly Sunshine Weekly, Ronaldo was accused of paying the woman $375,000 to silence her about the incident.
Hours after the allegations were exposed, Ronaldo, 33, posted a live video to 142 million followers on Instagram, accusing the reports of being fake news.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
The five-time Golden Globe winner said in front of the camera that what they said today was fake news.
They are just trying to use my name to deceive themselves.
It's normal.
They want to use me to be famous, but that's part of their job.
I am a happy man, and I am very good at everything", Ronaldo added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the defendant against the allegations against the Mirror Weekly, saying that his uncle's unauthorized reports were alleged to violate his personal privacy.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would seek compensation for mental health damage in proportion to the severity of the offences, which could be the worst human rights violation in recent years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents from the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorca reportedly returned to the player's room after meeting at a nightclub where the rape took place.
According to Mayorca, Ronaldo knelt down after the incident and told her that he was a gentleman when he was drinking 99% of his juice, but now he is dragged down by that 1% of his juice.
The document notes that Ronaldo admitted to having sex with the two, but both sides voluntarily.
Mayorka also said she went to the police station and took pictures of herself in the hospital, but later agreed to settle out of court for fear of reprisal and public humiliation.
According to Mayorga, 34, she is currently seeking an out-of-court settlement as she continues to suffer from mental trauma due to allegations of the incident.
The allegations are that Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the case occurred, and that he had joined Italian luxury club Juventus for a €100 million signing fee this summer.
Brexit: UK's loss of car makers is a permanent regret
British Commerce Secretary Greg Clark said the loss of the UK's position as a global leader in the automotive industry will be a permanent regret for the UK after Brexit.
He added that British Toyota had told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, Toyota would temporarily stop production at its Bernaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that Brexit without a consensus could lead to job losses.
The Bernstein plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
My point is that if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March, our plants will stop producing potatoes, Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota's Bernaston Plant, said.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar, have also expressed concern about what could happen if no agreement is reached on cross-border trade operations in the UK after Brexit.
For example, BMW said it would close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of carmakers are that there may be a risk of a supply chain exit without an agreement.
The Toyota production line is based on a targeted timing pump, which receives orders from UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, the UK's border could be disrupted, industry officials say, which could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
The company said that Toyota's factory in Derbyshire could not hold more than a day's supply and production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the chequers plan proposed by Theresa May for the future of relations with the EU could avoid border checks if it is properly verified.
We want to reach the most successful agreement that can both achieve the current success and allow us to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today show.
Evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers suggests that we need absolute capacity to continue to drive a series of significant supply chains.
Toyota did not say how long production would be halted, but in the long run, the cost increase would weaken the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately affect job opportunities.
Peter Bouvallaris, who has been working at the Bernstein plant for 24 years and is now a joint convener of the plant, said his members were increasingly concerned that, in my experience, the monkey would never return once it was lost.
A government spokesman said: "We have developed a precise and reliable plan for the future of our relations with the EU.
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
The White House said Sunday that as the tide of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh has not yet calmed, a high-level meeting between Donald Trump and Justice Deputy Secretary Rod Rosenstein could be delayed by a week.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, while the Robert Mueller Trump campaign team is accused of private Russian infiltration and of the president's possible obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Justice Department's deputy secretary, which would jeopardize Mueller's independence, has been debated in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of impeachment of the president by the 25th Amendment, including the use of wiretaps to record conversations with Trump.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, in a report by the Guardian that he was about to resign, he went to the White House.
On Thursday, it was reported that he had met with Trump at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he was reluctant to fire Rosenstein, but later postponed the meeting to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christina Blassy Ford, a woman accused of sexual misconduct, would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Kavanaugh and postponed the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders is on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "The Supreme Court may postpone the meeting by a week, given all the other things that are going on, and the exact date is not yet set, I think it may be this week".
But we will see this day, and I will keep the media informed about the progress.
Some journalists will counter this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why this was.
Sanders said the lack of a press conference was not because she hated the publicity of TV reporters, although she said: "Oh, I will not object to their publicity".
She then said that this would increase direct contact between Trump and the media.
She said: "President Trump has more questions than any other president in history. But she did not cite any evidence.
Sanders said there would still be a press conference, but it would be much better if the media had the opportunity to ask the president directly than to talk to me.
We've done as many of these questions as we can, and we've done so many times in the past few weeks, that when people can talk directly to the President of the United States, press conferences are cancelled.
Trump often sets up a Q&A section when he leaves the White House or attends a public meeting or press conference with a visiting politician.
The press conference is held separately.
In New York this week, the president may have explained to us why this is happening, and he has appeared before a gathering of journalists without hesitation, sometimes even acting strangely.
Minister of Health addresses EU staff at the NHS in Scotland with concerns about the UK's exit from the EU
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff of the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland expressing their gratitude and their hope that they will continue to stay in Scotland after the UK leaves the EU.
Jeane Freeman of the MSP wrote a letter to the UK within six months of leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has committed to paying the fees for the application for residence for EU citizens working in the public service sector it has transferred.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "The Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU have been ongoing throughout the summer and a decision is expected this fall".
However, the UK government is also intensifying its preparations for the possible non-deal situation.
I know that this time must have been very uncomfortable for you.
So I want to reiterate how much I value the contributions of each and every member of staff, regardless of your nationality.
The valuable experience and skills provided by colleagues within and outside the EU will strengthen and improve our healthcare work to the benefit of patients and communities we serve.
Scotland will always be your home, and we really hope you can stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defeated Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27 on Saturday, and Raptors quarterback Christion Abercrombie suffered a head injury that was followed by emergency surgery, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State Raptors head coach Rod Reed told reporters that Abercrombie was injured shortly before the end of the half.
The man ran to the edge of the line and suddenly fell down, Reed said.
The trainer and medical personnel lost oxygen to Abeclon B on the edge of the line, then carried him back to the rack for further evaluation.
Chris Harris, an official with the Tennessee State Tigers, told the WSMV newspaper in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that the type/degree of the injury has not yet been determined, and the Tennessee State University Raptors are working to determine the exact time of the injury.
Abercrombie is a second-year college redshirt student who is coming here from Illinois after his first season at Tennessee State University.
In Saturday's game, he completed five shots before retiring, increasing his total shots of the season to 18 times.
Higher stamp duty on foreign buyers buying homes in the UK
Under the newly launched Conservative Party plan, the UK will increase the stamp duty on foreign buyers of property purchased in the UK, and the tax collected will be used to help tackle the issue of homelessness.
The move would offset Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the printing tax is aimed at the non-taxed population in the UK
The Ministry of Finance is expected to raise £120 million a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, and the income tax fee will be used to help the homeless.
The move also promised to provide more affordable housing and lock in high-income people. It was seen as a counterbalance to Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The additional tax credits are intended for individuals and companies who are not subject to UK taxation and the additional funds will be used to improve government solutions to accommodation problems.
In addition to the current stamp duty, including the second set of housing and rental taxes introduced two years ago, the additional fee could be up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to raise £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new London property buyers are non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first time home buyers to find their way home.
Many of the richest parts of the UK, particularly London, have become ghost towns, as a large number of foreign home buyers spend most of their time outside the UK.
Just before the new policy was introduced, Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp duty to allow more young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of buying land instead of using it to maintain high house prices and urged Ms. Mei to give up quotas on affordable housing to address the stigma of slum housing in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of housing reform proposals that attracted a lot of attention, including rental controls and ending the impeccable move.
He also hopes to give parliament more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would restore the British dream of making life better for every newborn generation while I was Prime Minister".
This means that the housing market is being repaired after a breakdown.
The UK will always welcome those who want to live, work and raise a family here.
However, it is not right for individuals who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to be unlike hardworking British residents in their difficulty in buying a house.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is far from being realized, and the insult of lodging is still very real.
Jack Ross: Well, my ultimate goal is to be a coach in Scotland.
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said that his ultimate goal was to one day become Scotland's head coach.
The 42-year-old Scottish, who is trying to revitalize the Northeast, is currently third in the league, three points behind the first place.
After leading St Mirren back to the Scottish League last season, he was transferred to the Stadium of Light this summer.
I want to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-hat, and that's how I got it. Ross wanted to introduce the BBC's Sportssound.
I grew up watching the Scottish team play, and as a child I often watched games with my dad at Hampton, and I will always remember that time.
But only if I bring the team to a successful start, will I have the chance to do so.
Prior to Ross, Sunderland's head coaches included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former owner of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid of the club, which had so many famous people, and had previously rejected the invitation from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get the team back to the Premier League.
He said that the team would definitely be able to play in the Premier League due to the structure and facilities of the team.
It's not easy to do this, but I can only lead the team back to the Premier League and I think I'm going to be successful.
His career as a bishop began just three years ago. Ross spent time as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and spent 15 months on the Red Heart coaching staff.
He then led Arrow from relegation to the third tier, and the following season, he led the San Miro from the edge of relegation to the overall championship.
Ross said he was more comfortable than his previous spells at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Recalling his experience with the Arrows, he said: "Oh, this could be a real crossroads.
I really feel I'm better suited to coaching than playing football.
It sounds strange because I'm doing well, I'm fine with this life and I'm having a lot of fun.
But playing can be difficult sometimes.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I'm still feeling the pressure of playing, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to be a coach, and now I do, and this is the most comfortable day I've felt in years.
You can listen to the full interview on the Voice of Sport on Radio Scotland from 12pm to 1pm on Sunday 30 September during the UK summer.
The survey found that Saturdays at 5:30 p.m. is the best time to drink a glass of fresh wine.
The hot summer, the bar's harsh harvests in Britain, and the pressure on the chain of restaurants are heavy.
According to the data, bar sales increased by 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenue fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of business consultancy CGA said the hot weather of the day, plus England's World Cup time to play was more than expected, and the bar's revenue grew 2.8% in June, with the restaurant hit even harder.
In June, restaurant sales fell 1.8%, while in July, the decline was even greater.
The bar, which is mainly made up of liquor and water, is performing best, while the restaurant's turnover continues to decline.
The mainly dining bar was also affected by the heat, although the impact was relatively small compared to restaurant operators.
People seem to be just thinking about getting something to drink outside.
The entire bar industry saw sales of wine water increase by 6.6 percent this month and food sales decline by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, a leisure and hotel industry analyst, said that the trend has been continuing since the end of April.
The main factors affecting sales in the outbound consumer market are weather and important social events or sports events.
The continuing hardship of the catering industry is not surprising, as sales fell by 4.8% compared to the same period, and the headache is further exacerbated by the continuing increased cost pressure.
For food-driven operators, the effects of a long hot summer can be called a blizzard, and time will tell us whether the weather in August is moderate and can provide the necessary breathing time.
The overall sales of the entire bar and restaurant industry (including newly opened bars and restaurants) grew by 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand promotion.
The UK's bar and restaurant industry monitoring body, Coffer Peach Tracker, collected and analyzed performance data from 47 business groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, setting a benchmark for the industry.
One in five minors is staring at their parents and using social media in secret
The survey found that one in five minors (aged 11 to 18) used social media to keep their parents and teachers in a secret.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students showed an increase in the use of fake Insta pages.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of pornography.
Twenty percent of students reported having a parent-managed parent-managed primary parent account.
One in five minors (aged 11 to under) is staring at adults using social media.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that fake Insta accounts (referring to photo sharing site Instagram) are growing rapidly.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of pornographic content.
Twenty percent of students reported having a primary account for their parents, which was used to handle the cleaning of their urine, along with other secret accounts.
A mother accidentally discovered the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, and discovered that a teenager encouraged others to rape her mother.
The survey, launched by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), found that 40% of 11-18 year olds had two accounts simultaneously, with half of the minors admitting to having a secret account.
Mike Buchanan, HMC's director, said: "It's disturbing to see so many teenagers create and hide in cyberspace that neither parents nor teachers know about it.
Elidh Doyle will join the Scottish Athletic Commission as a spokesperson for the Athletes' Association of Scotland
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletic Commission at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
The most decorated athlete in Scotland is Dall, who was named by the committee's chairman Ian Beattie as a great opportunity for coaches to learn from the rich experience at the international level.
The Scottish athlete is well known in Scotland, the UK and the world of sports, and we believe that if he joins the committee, Scotland's athletics will benefit immensely, Betty said.
He said: "I am very eager to be a spokesperson for the athletes and I want to be able to make a real contribution to Scotland's sporting career and help provide guidance.
The four-time Olympic gold medalist, who won the 200m and 400m medals at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, who is currently a longtime commentator for the BBC, has been unable to walk after suffering a brief cerebral hemorrhage.
He tweeted: "A month ago today, I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said that if I recover, how much I can recover, it depends entirely on the time.
It was a difficult task to fully recover, to relearn to walk again, but now I can complete agility training!
Thank you for your encouragement!
The mother is compared to a cow in a suckler ad that has attracted controversy among netizens
In an ad by a dairy company, which will compare lactating cows to milk-stuffed cows, the ad sparked controversy among netizens.
At the launch of the world's first silent wearable vacuum cleaner, consumer technology company Elvie released a music video-inspired commercial that showed the freedom this new vacuum cleaner brings to mothers.
Four real mothers dancing to music in a crowded haystack, with lyrics like: "Oh yeah, I personally raised it, but you can't see the tail, it's not my grandmother, it's my breasts".
The next song is: "Pull out, pull out, cuddle my baby, pull out, pull out, grandma my little princess".
However, the ad was controversial online after being posted on the company's Facebook page.
The video has been viewed over 77,000 times, received hundreds of comments, and received mixed reactions, many of which have been seen as a sign of a lack of respect for the dairy industry's horrors.
The decision to use cows to promote the product was too wrong.
Cows, like us, need milk to get pregnant and give birth, but the difference is that the babies of cows are stolen from their mother within days of giving birth, a netizen wrote.
Elvie suction is suitable for breastfeeding in Elvie/Mother.
Another blogger commented: "It is undoubtedly a trauma for the mother and the baby.
Why would you want to make a cowboy in a milkman ad and make a cowboy in a city where you don't want your kids to leave?
Another netizen added: "Oh, this ad is too much of a fake.
The other people thought the ad was good, and one woman admitted that she found the song funny.
I think this idea is particularly new.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
The process of sucking milk makes me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit of a dead end, but I think it's good.
The product is new. A netizen wrote:
Another netizen commented: "This ridiculous ad is aimed at people who need to drink milk - usually in the company or in the bathroom - and feel like they're cooking cows".
It is not about praising or judging the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of girls show themselves dancing while wearing a breast feeding tube.
The idea for the ad came from many women who called themselves cows when they were breastfeeding.
However, the Elvie suction tube is completely silent, without wires or tubes, and can be placed perfectly inside the breast, freeing the woman's hands, holding the baby, and even continuing to suck when outdoors.
Mother's partner and creative director (ECD) Ana Balarin commented: "Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product worth a bold attempt".
By contrasting mammals and cows, we want to bring the process of milk sucking and its problems into focus, while showing the unparalleled sense of freedom that this new type of sucker can bring to people in an interesting and related way.
This is not the first time Elvie's milkshake has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children, who was wearing a dress designed by designer Marta Jakubowski, climbed to the T-Stage, where she wore the product.
Hundreds of children are being evacuated to a camp on the Texas border
Although the policy at the border port remains relatively unchanged, the number of children in detention is still rising, in part due to the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies that have made it more difficult for sponsors to accommodate children.
Legend has it that most of the sponsors themselves are illegal immigrants, who fear that coming out to adopt children will endanger their ability to stay in the United States.
In June, federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult family members would be required to submit fingerprints and that they would share their fingerprint information with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, which would significantly increase the risk.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confirmed before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80% of individuals who entered the country illegally as sponsors or family members of sponsors, most of whom are transnational criminals.
"We're going after these people all the time", Albert said.
According to the asylum staff, in order to resolve the issue of these children as quickly as possible, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of the children to appear before the court within one month of detention (rather than 60 days after the previously stipulated date).
Many children will not appear in person, but will instead appear in the form of a video conference call to defend their legal identity to immigration judges.
Children who are deemed not eligible for relief will be deported promptly.
According to the staff of the shelter and reports from the system in recent months, the longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, leading to violent behavior or attempted escape.
The defense lawyers said that the concern was even more serious in large facilities like Tornillo because of the size of the place and the fact that it is easy to ignore signs of child rebellion.
They added that moving children to tent cities without enough time to prepare emotionally and to say goodbye to friends could add to the trauma many children have already suffered.
Syrian authorities order the U.S., French and Turkish troops to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their countries as soon as possible, despite the eight-year war in Syria.
Mu'alim, who was also the Deputy Prime Minister of Syria, said that foreign troops will be treated accordingly if they enter Syrian territory illegally as a pretext to fight terrorism.
The UN General Assembly has called on the Palestinians to evacuate the city immediately, Muallem said.
Mu'alim insists that Syria's ongoing war on terror is coming to an end, and that since 2011, the war has killed more than 360,000 people and displaced millions.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight the war against the sacrifice until we clear all terrorist organizations on the Syrian territory and destroy all illegal foreign forces.
The United States has more than 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, primarily responsible for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops stationed in the country during the war.
On the issue of refugees, Mu'alim expressed the conditions for their return and condemned the spread of irrational fear by some Western countries that forced them to flee their countries.
He said that the international community and humanitarian organizations have been called upon to help bring refugees back to their homes.
The people of the country are trying to make a political disguise of the issue of pure humanism.
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until Assad reaches a political agreement with the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations (UN) diplomats said that Russia and Turkey had recently reached an agreement to establish a buffer zone at the last major rebel base in Idlib, which provides an opportunity for further political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented the Russian-backed Syrian army from launching a massive offensive against the province of three million inhabitants.
However, Mu'alim stressed that the agreement had a clear deadline and expressed hope that military operations would target jihadists, including militants from the Nusra Front linked to al Qaeda who have been eradicated.
The United Nations Special Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes that a new committee, composed of members of the government and opposition, will convene its first meeting as soon as possible to draft the post-war constitution of Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mu'alim listed the conditions for the Syrian government's membership of the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited to the scrutiny of the provisions of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Re-election
According to this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless impeachment and scandal terminate his presidency early, as many free-market audiences have wished.
There is no doubt that this will be the most dramatic presidential end of all time!
But so far, there seems to be no sign of aesthetic fatigue.
Since 2014, the US cable news network (CNN) has more than doubled its Golden Age viewership to 1.55 million, while Microsoft's MSNBC has more than tripled to 1.6 million.
Nielsen data shows that the average viewership of Fox News during its golden age has risen from 1.7 million to 2.4 million four years ago, while MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has steadily climbed to the top of the cable television viewership chart with up to 3.5 million viewers, thanks to the main nightly news.
For Cabinet Minister Neil Baer, producer of ABC's Designated Survivor, who became president after the attack on the US Capitol, Neal Baer said that people are attracted to the monkey because we don't understand it.
Senior comedy writer, Neil Scovell, author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys, and the author of The Hollywood Boys Club, holds another theory.
Skorville told me that she still remembers the scene of a taxi ride in Boston on the eve of the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
He said, "Oh, because he makes me laugh".
The chaos is a lot of fun.
Of course, unlike other shows on television, whether this immigrant family will eventually reunite or whether the global economy will develop healthyly, this story line in Washington could determine the future of the case.
The show is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, when you find yourself spending six hours watching a panel of experts discuss the implications of the deep-rooted backdrop of the monkey used by Bob Woodward in his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 birdhaired jacket (which the Washington Post calls an arrogant thick-clothed monkey) and the famous description of the Trump-like monkey named Storm Daniels (which is called "the monkey, the bony") you will find that this is far beyond the reach of your average citizen.
As for me, I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
About the cast rotations and the daily twists and turns of Trump's show: "Looking for the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un", "The Chairman of Wheelhouse Entertainment", "The Legendary Star", "Brent Montgomery", "The creator of Pawn Stars", "Brent Montgomery" said that some of the things he's doing make it feel like a show, and he's actually pouring something on you every night".
You can't miss an episode or you won't be able to keep up.
This week I met with Fleiss, who was living in an 80°C outdoor apartment on the north coast of Coahuila, but he was hiding in his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN's program.
Without Brett Kavanaugh, who faced the Senate Judiciary Committee with him, and the Supreme Court's future, he felt he could not get away with it.
Flake told me, "Oh, I remember when we were planning those crazy shows behind the scenes during the day, people said, 'Oh, this is the end of Western civilization.'"
I thought this sounded a bit like a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Big cash for the most intense congressional midterm elections to fight for House seats
It is no wonder that the redistricting of congressional districts, which has resulted in two incumbent MPs running for the same seat in the 17th Assembly District of Penn State, has resulted in a steady flow of large amounts of cash.
The recently redesigned suburb of Pittsburgh became the target of Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb's race, who won another seat in a special election last spring.
Ram's opponent is incumbent Republican MP Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the original Penn State's 12th Congressional District, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old congressional district map was unconstitutional and favoured the Republicans, and thus redistributed the constituencies.
The contest for new seats in the 17th District has sparked a campaign finance issue between the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) in the major party finance sector.
In the highly publicized March special election for the 18th Pennsylvania District, Ram won with a feeble margin of victory, and later became a household name in Pennsylvania.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the seat with 20 percent of the vote.
The political experts have created a little advantage for the Democrats.
The United States considered sanctioning El Salvador for supporting China but ultimately chose to abandon it.
The diplomatic officials noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had recognized Beijing and were barely blocked by Washington.
Trump met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and remained in Panama until the partners expelled the administration's management team.
State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials had decided to call back the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in Inselva, the Dominican Republic and Panama over Xi's recent decision not to recognize Taiwan.
But consider sanctions against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017 for narcotics control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in economic aid and targeted visa restrictions, will be a heavy blow to the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings continued, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar gathering held last year, which was seen as a major step forward in preventing immigrants from entering the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior government officials had made it clear that they wanted the meeting to continue, effectively ending the idea of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to address a meeting in mid-October, diplomats said, which was a signal that government authorities were raising the profile of the meeting.
Three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without being blocked or punished by the latest harsh information from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate by the three U.S. officials (including two diplomats who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity).
The statement was confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the government and who declined to disclose his name.
Studying the History
The next thing that may need to be addressed is the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's potential obstruction of justice, which is well documented in the public record.
Miller is reportedly turning his investigation to whether Trump has conspired to attack our election by Russia in the campaign.
If Congress wins, Trump will face congressional accountability, and when he is ready to run again, perhaps only a jury of his colleagues will eventually be left.
There are many assumptions here, and I don't mean that Trump's failure is a inevitable result - nor does it mean that his failure in Europe is a inevitable result.
All people on both sides of the Atlantic have a choice, and that choice will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers prepared to launch a coup against Hitler, provided that the Western world opposed Hitler in Munich and supported Czechoslovakia.
We have failed and missed the best opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The historical process has always been centered on these turning points, and the unstoppable progress of democracy has either been accelerated or slowed down.
The United States is facing several such turning points today.
What if Trump had been looking at Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was in charge of Miller's investigation, and what if we were to be looking at him?
Since the paper reported last year that Rosenstein had suggested that the president be recorded in secret and that he suspected Trump was unfit to serve, Rosenstein has been a hotbed of hype.
Rosenstein said the Times's claims were inaccurate.
Q. What if the FBI's just requested investigation of Brett Kavanaug was not comprehensive or unfair - or if the Supreme Court did not recognize credible sexual assault allegations and evidence of fraud - and we would respond?
First, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If the attempt fails, the Democrats will enter a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail, because I have learned from Bragg.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime who had occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived and later immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, my mother sent me to light a Sabbath lamp on a table with Nazi labels.
With this inheritance, how can I be unoptimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Ranger team is optimistic about the Vienna Rapids.
On Thursday, the Rovers played their home games against Vienna Rapids, who had already won the European League G, after beating Spain's Villarreal earlier this month, and they knew the victory was coming to the Austrians.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season before the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can take this as a leap and get a better result.
"It's a good opportunity for us because the Virale are a strong team", Graham Dorrans, 31, said.
Before the game started, we were convinced that we would not come back and eventually we won a point.
Perhaps we should not have stopped there, but in the end, we have drawn a draw.
They played better in the first half, and we did better in the second half.
Thursday will be another important night in Europe.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough game because they did well in the last game, but with so many people supporting us, I am sure we can go on and get good results.
Last year was definitely a very difficult year, a lot happened after my injury, and the club itself had some setbacks, but now we feel good.
The team was good, the players enjoyed the game and the training was good.
I hope we can move forward and get ahead of last season and succeed.
Women fall asleep because of concerns about retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey knew what kind of care they wanted to receive, few people had ever discussed this with their families.
In the Nationwide study, about half of respondents said they had talked to their spouses about their long-term care costs.
Only 10% of respondents said they had discussed the topic with their children.
People want families to take care of themselves, but they don't try to communicate with them, says Holly Snyder, vice president of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
The first is the "From the Heart" (From the Heart)
Communication with spouses and children: If you do not tell your family what you want, they will not be able to prepare themselves to take care of you.
Discuss with your counsellor and family the details of where to get care and how to get it, as these are important factors in determining costs.
Get financial advisors involved: Your advisors can help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your options for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, a cash-value mixed life insurance that can be used to pay for these expenses or to self-insure your wealth (as long as you have money).
The government has also been trying to prevent legal disputes at the gates.
Hire a healthcare agent so that you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care situation and ensure that professional caregivers can follow your wishes when you are unable to communicate with them.
In addition, prepare a financial authorization.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that you are compensated in the event of your loss of ability.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine an elderly parent with an emergency medical problem on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
In the written plan, list these details in detail so that you can be prepared.
"I'm not just talking about the financial issues, who is the doctor?" asked Martin.
What medicines do you take?
Who is taking care of patients?
I'm not sure what the plan is.
A man was shot multiple times with a gas rifle in Ilvercom
A man was shot multiple times by a gas rifle on his way home from work in the evening.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was attacked in the Oxford Grove area of Irfreckham, Devon, with multiple gunshots in his chest, abdomen and hands.
The shooting occurred around 02:30 in the summer of the UK, and police said it was a deliberate murder.
The victim did not see the face of the assailant.
The man's injuries are currently not life-threatening, and police have called on witnesses to provide clues.
The beaches and earthquakes in Indonesia
Indonesian officials said that the severe earthquake and tsunami in the city of Niibalu on Friday have killed at least 384 people and the death toll is still rising.
Rescue officials were unable to get any information from the district of Bangalore, which is located in northern Baro, close to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In the aftermath of the disaster in Baru, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some key facts about Baru and Bangalore in Sulawesi:
Baru is the capital of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, and had an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
The province of Cungala is a coastal region stretching for over 300 kilometres (180 miles) along the northwestern coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The county is an administrative region below the provincial level and had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic pillars of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Angola.
The coal mining industry is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in the Morowali County, on the other side of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, in the last 100 years, Balu and Tanggala have been hit by several tsunami attacks.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Bangalore.
In 1996, another tsunami struck western Angola, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the earthquake-prone volcanic zone of the Pacific Ocean, and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and beaches that have occurred in recent years:
On 26 December 2004, a major earthquake off the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, caused waves and tsunami in 14 countries/regions, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom were residents of Aceh province.
2005: Several strong earthquakes occurred on the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern coast of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Banton, the capital of Western Sumatra.
The death toll was over 1,100 people.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mingthai Islands near Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Bidjiaya County, Azi, causing severe damage, reminding people of the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami, which also caused extreme panic among the population.
The quake did not cause a tsunami, but the collapse of buildings also killed more than 100 people.
2018: A major earthquake struck Long Island, a tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, with most of the deaths occurring on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake damaged thousands of buildings, causing thousands of tourists to temporarily stay stranded.
Sarah Palin, the eldest daughter, was arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assaulting others.
According to a report on domestic violence and denial of arrest released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Perlin, 29, of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence.
According to police reports, a woman who had known her tried to report her suspected crime to the police, and Perrin took her cell phone from her hand.
According to KTUU, Perin is currently being held in Mat-Su Pre-Trial Facility and holds unsecured bonds worth $500.
According to Web reports, the court asked him to defend himself when he appeared on Saturday, and he claimed his innocence.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with one count of felony misdemeanor, a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
However, this is not the first time that Perrin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of beating his father, Todd Palin.
Sarah Palin, the mother of two children, reported her alleged assault to the police.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, a report on domestic violence alleged that Perrin was suspected of domestic violence and that he had a gun after being drunk.
The girlfriend of Perrin claimed to have hit her face with a fist.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was condemned by the Veterans Organization for alleging that her son's violence was related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) he suffered during his Iraqi campaign.
Seismic tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have been killed in the earthquake that struck Sulawesi, Indonesia, on Friday.
The quake, which was 7.5 magnitude, triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The number of deaths is expected to continue to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck in the central Sulawesi island, northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia.
The video of the disaster on social media has been a huge hit.
Hundreds of people were celebrating a holiday on a beach in the city of Palou when the tsunami struck.
Federal prosecutors seek a rare death sentence for suspected terrorists in New York
The federal prosecutor in New York wants to sentence New York suspect Sayfullo Saipov to death. The death toll from the terrorist attack, which killed eight people, is the rare case in New York City since 1953 to be handled on such a charge.
The charges claim that in October, a 30-year-old Saipov was driving a rented truck at the Home Depot on the West Side of Lower Manhattan Highway, entering the bike lane, crushing pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
According to the Notice of Intent for the Seeking of Death, filed in the Southern District of New York, in order to prove the justification for the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Seppov was the victim of eight people who were deliberately stabbed and that they were deliberately stabbed to injure others.
According to the court documents, both charges are punishable by death.
A federal grand jury announced that Sypheni was indicted on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, supporting extortion, and violent destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required a lot of planning and preparation, and described the way Saipov was attacked as outrageous, cruel and despicable.
The intention was to inform the victim that the family and friends of the victims, Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, were seriously injured and lost.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
The last death penalty case in the Southern District of New York was filed 10 years ago.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York's federal court was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of murder. The couple were executed for espionage by the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair.
According to court documents, Saifov was a Uzbek and showed no self-respect in the days or even months following the attack.
Police said he told investigators he was happy with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saypov told authorities that he was inspired to launch the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his cell phone.
Police said he also asked for the ISIS flag to be hung in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, a federal public defender representing Seaborne, said they were particularly disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty without life imprisonment, which is not possible without parole, will only prolong the trauma of all those involved", said Barton.
Seppov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
During a protest at a Conservative Party meeting, Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize the current people's armed forces.
The former Independent Party chief said politicians must be careful of the heat of the calls for skepticism of the European Union, as a member of parliament, Theresa May, has said, and he should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said during a Birmingham rally that if Mr Farage were Brexit Secretary, the British would have left the EU long ago.
However, the ruling MEPs joining a separate protest against Brexit underscores the challenges Ms May faces in reconciling deeply divided ranks.
Under the backlash of the Brexit, left-wing and EU, the Prime Minister is working to adjust the Chequers plan to get it right.
Allies insisted that despite strong opposition, she would continue to work for a deal with Brussels and force the skeptical Europeans and Labour to choose between her plans and the chaotic chaos she was facing.
Mr Bone told Solihull's Leave Means Leave rally that he wanted to abandon the Cheeks plan.
He said Mr Farage should be left with his colleagues to negotiate with Brussels.
He said: "If it was his fault, we would have left the EU by now".
The member of Parliament from Wellingburg added: "I will support Brexit, but we need to abandon the Checks plan".
In his opposition to the EU, he said: "Well, we don't need a world war to make it subservient".
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
There are suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote, and Mr Bone rejected the suggestion: "It is not true at all that the British think they have changed their minds and want to leave behind their ideas".
Conservative Brexit activist Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, telling reporters: "Oh, I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people".
The Cheeks are not welcome, the opposition is not going to vote for them, we are not welcome, our activists are not welcome, and remember, these are the people who cheer for us on the streets, who were the first to elect us to the presidency.
Please give up the Cheeks and listen to the voices of the people.
In a message to Ms May, she added that the PM can only keep his position if he fulfills his commitments.
Mr Farage told the rallying politicians that if they intend to betray the decision in the 2016 referendum, they must be warmed by the heat of the shout.
He said, "Well, now this is about trust between us - the people and the political class".
And they want to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them, 'We will not let you do this.'
In his address to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I hope you can make the political class who intend to betray Brexit feel the warmth of the call".
We must mobilize the British people's great army that contributed to our Brexit victory and we will never rest until we achieve British independence and autonomy.
Meanwhile, the REU members marched in Birmingham, and held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the formation of the team this weekend, several activists waved the Conservative Party's flag against Brexit.
At the opening of the meeting, Labour colleague Lord Adonis mocked the Conservative Party's party app for having security issues.
He added: "It's the people who tell us that they can have the IT system and all the technology to achieve Canada++, frictionless borders, Irish borderless free trade".
The first is that the film is a complete and complete satire.
There is nothing quite as good as Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democratic senator spoke about his plans for the future in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, who is currently running in the November election, and is running for Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who served as co-chairman of President Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign team.
She has been the focus of speculation that Trump will replace the administration in 2020.
The event, held in Holy York City on Saturday afternoon, was the 36th meeting she held in the form of a town hall rally since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she intended to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for the mother to let women into Washington and repair a broken government with a woman at the top.
Suspect of shooting down Sims at Louisiana State University (LSU) arrested
Louisiana Baton Rouge Police announced Saturday that the suspect in the shooting death of Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference at 11 a.m. eastern time that the 20-year-old suspect, Dayton Simpson, had been arrested.
The police department released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking the public to help identify the man who appeared in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the University of the South on Friday morning.
According to 247sports, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday that Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death.
The film was directed by David H. White, who was shot and killed by Simpson.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being on the scene and to having weapons, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
It was no surprise that Simpson was arrested and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6-inch boy who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins Sebastian Vettel with the help of the team's instructions
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified against Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the Mercedes-Benz instructions would play a big role in the game.
Starting from pole position, Potas led the way, almost crushing Hamilton in the first two rounds of defence, and also luring Vettel's teammates to attack.
Vettel entered the repair station first, Hamilton ran to the end of the car, which should have decided the end.
After a lap, Mercedes entered the stand, and back on track was behind Vettel, who unwillingly gave up the course, and Hamilton regained the lead after a second-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-half-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-hal-
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old when he started, was in the back row of the track and finished 7th after the first lap.
For most of the race, he advanced full speed, and struggled to finish the race fast, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen, who finished in fourth place.
He finally entered the repair station on lap 44, failing to raise his speed in the remaining eight laps, and finally, Leconine finished fourth.
Hamilton said: "It was hard to get up today because Watley was pretty good all weekend and he kindly gave me the position.
The team finished first and second, which was great.
What's wrong with body language?
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting that she had not disclosed a letter about Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In a speech at a gathering in West Virginia, President Trump did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate is a good indication of how vile, dirty, and hypocritical people are.
Trump said, "Well, when you see anger, when you see angry, mean, dirty, hypocritical people, something can happen, and the good things have been happening in the Senate for the past few days".
And when you hear about the news and the leak, and then they say, "Oh, this is not my doing".
This is not my fault.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the news?
Remember her answer... the files were leaked by you?
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't leak the rum.
So, please wait a minute.
Is it our leak... No, not our fault, he added, the senator recalled.
In July, Van Steen received a letter from Ford describing the details of the allegations against Kavanaugh that had been leaked in early September - but Van Steen denied that her office had caused the leak.
According to the Huang Kong Mountain Times, Van Steen revealed to the committee that she had not concealed Dr. Ford's allegations or leaked her experience.
She asked me to keep the letters secret, and I did so.
But her denial seems not to have been accepted by the president, who commented at a rally on Saturday night: "Listen, body language is really bad".
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual misconduct by three women, saying the Democrats were using the accusation to their own ends.
According to the media, the president said that the president would take back power by any means necessary.
Look at the filthy, filthy ways of the world. They do not care who they harm, nor who they overthrow to gain power and authority.
The Dundee Stars won the Elite League 5-3 against the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer won the match for the Giants by two goals against Dundee.
On Saturday, the Dundee Stars won the game 5-3 in the second round to make up for the loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday.
Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier scored the game-winning goal to give the Giants a two-goal lead in the game.
Before Dwyer regained the lead for the Giants, Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie played home games.
Francois Bouchard tied the score for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals to win the match.
This was Adam Keefe's third Premier League defeat of the season, as they beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth time the two teams have met this season, and the Giants have won all three of their previous games.
Dwyer started the opening fight with an assist from Kendall McFaull at 3:35 of the fourth minute, while Beauvillier doubled the lead with an assist from David Rutherford at 4 minutes.
In a tense opening battle, Sullivan took home the lead at 13:10 and Matt Marquardt tied the score for Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first half, giving the Giants a lead in the first half.
The team re-arranged the flagpole, and Bouchard launched a strong offense at 27 minutes 37 seconds, again leveling the score.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the second half of the second half and score the team's fifth goal in the final half to secure the game's victory.
The Giants have lost four of their last five games and will play Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers use their lives to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller who lost his life in a plane that carried hundreds of people was hailed as a hero.
On Friday, a major earthquake in Sulawesi caused a tsunami that killed more than 800 people and left many missing.
The strong aftershocks continued to engulf the region, and many people were trapped in the ruins in the city of Baru.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues were fleeing, the 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung remained in his seat and remained in the shaky control tower of Mutíara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He insisted on staying on the ground to ensure that Flight 6321 was safe to take off from the runway.
He jumped from the tower when he realized that the control tower was beginning to collapse.
He died in hospital.
According to Australian broadcaster ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirait said that Argon's decision saved hundreds of lives.
We have prepared a helicopter to fly from Kalimantan Bali to take Argon to major hospitals in other cities for treatment.
However, it is unfortunate that the helicopter left this morning before arriving in Baro.
The news of the incident is deeply saddening to us", Syraite added.
Meanwhile, the Indonesian national disaster relief agency said roads to towns like Bangalore, Siji and Boutong were blocked, and government officials feared the death toll could reach thousands.
The agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said that "we believe the death toll is still rising because many bodies are still buried under the rubble and many people have not been found".
A six-meter-high wave destroyed the barrow, which was to host a mass funeral on Saturday.
Military and commercial aircraft are continuing to send relief supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News that ambulances were bringing bodies every minute.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
The small market nearby was looted.
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything it can to help the survivors, but we don't know what the search and rescue team will find".
The situation is already a tragedy, but it could be worse.
According to CNN, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Baru on Sunday and addressed the Indonesian military: "I order you to complete all the evacuation tasks in no time but day and night".
Are you ready?
The Indonesian island of Namur was hit by an earthquake earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini reports a man missing after his plane crashed into an atoll lake
A New Guinea Airlines flight crashed into an atoll lake in Pacific Micronesia, and the airline previously said that 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that sank to the bottom of the lake, and that one man was missing.
New Guinea Airlines said at a press conference Saturday afternoon that it could not explain the disappearance of the male passengers.
The airline said it was working with local governments, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man's whereabouts.
The airline did not immediately disclose the identity of the passenger, such as his age, nationality and other information.
The plane crashed into the lake as it landed at Chuuk Island Airport, and local boats were involved in the rescue, rescuing other passengers and crew.
On Friday, seven people were admitted to hospital, officials said.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still being treated in hospital, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the order of events are not clear.
The airline and the US Navy both said the plane had fallen off the runway into an atoll lake.
Some witnesses believe the plane crashed out of the runway.
According to Bill Jaynes, a US passenger, the plane was flying very low.
Jaynes says that the flying is better than the flying.
Jaynes said that after the plane sank, the water was already deep inside the plane, and everyone was pouring water to the emergency exits.
He reported that the crew were all frightened and shouted, and their heads were lightly wounded.
The US Navy said sailors who were converting the nearby dock were involved in the rescue, driving a gas-filled boat, and bringing the landed personnel to shore, while the rear aircraft sank in water about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
According to Air Safety Network, 111 people have died in crashes on board a flight registered with Papua New Guinea National Airlines over the past two decades, but there is no record of passenger deaths on New Guinea Airlines.
Analysts list the timeline of women burned alive at night
Prosecutors on Saturday re-tried the woman accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, a judge in the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used his cell phone records to tie up the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis with 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers in the events of the night.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett reported that he received several cell phone location data that showed that Thrice was with him the night of Chambord's death, which contradicted previous claims by Thrice.
Tris said he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, and the data showed that Tris's phone was in the same location as Chambers's at the time, so police went to Sanford to find out about the situation.
Sanford testified in court on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
The prosecutor asked whether the incident was true, and Trice said he was in a truck in Sanford that night.
Another paradox is that, according to Thrice, they had known each other for about two weeks when Chambers died.
The phone records show that they had only met for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tris deleted Chambers's text messages, phone calls and contact information from her phone.
Hale said that the mother had wiped her from her life, wiping her clean, clean, clean.
The defendant is scheduled to begin his final trial on Sunday.
The judge said he hopes to send the trial to the jury later that day.
High Breed Hip Hop: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wanted to inject positive messages into their songs and change people's negative views of hip hop music.
High Breed hip hop collective comes from Bristol. They claim that hip hop music originally rapped political content in songs to address social issues, but has now broken away from that form.
They want to trace their roots and make consciousness of hip-hop popular again.
The hip hop collective The Fugees and Common have recently seen a resurgence in the UK with acts such as Akala and Lowkey.
Or a black man?
A New York nanny sues her employer and the couple after receiving a racist text message that she was fired from
A New York nanny was beaten up after a mother of her child was wrongly sent a text message complaining that her mother was a black mother, and the couple filed a lawsuit alleging that their family was discriminated against.
The couple refused to admit racial discrimination, calling the case blackmail.
In 2016, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she discovered that the other was black before she went to work for childcare provider Giselle Maurice.
And the black lady wrote in a letter to her husband, Flakesman.
However, the text message was sent to Morris twice by mistake.
According to the New York Post, Ms. Morris was fired by Mrs. Dunfreaksman, who felt embarrassed after realizing she had lost her job, on the grounds that the soon-to-be-departing African-American nanny was not doing well while she was waiting for a Filipino.
Mrs. Flakesman paid Morris a day's salary and then ordered a Uber to take her home.
The couple was suing Morris the day before, demanding that they pledge to live with their employer's parents for up to six months in temporary work for their initial employment and pay up to $350 per day in compensation, despite not having a contract.
On Friday, Morris told the New York Post's The Young Journalist, "I want to tell them, look, you're not going to do that kind of thing", and added, "I know this is racial discrimination".
The couple countered the lawsuit, saying they had no racial discrimination, saying it was entirely reasonable to terminate Morris' employment, and that they feared they would not be able to trust her after being offended.
My wife didn't want to send her any messages.
She is not racially discriminated against.
We all have no racial bias, her husband Joel Plasco told The New York Post.
But would you be sure to hand the child over to someone who has offended you, even if it was unintentional?
You just had a baby?
Please, probably no one will.
Plasco called the case a blackmail scam, saying that his wife gave birth to a child two months ago and that the situation is very difficult.
Oh, you'd hire someone like that?
The investment banker added that this was not a wise move.
While the case is still pending, the opinion courts have quickly begun to condemn the couple's behavior and logic on social media.
The latest letter reveals that the publisher of Paddington Bears fears readers will not accept a talking bear
The book was accepted by readers shortly after Bond's birth, and Karen Jankel revealed in the letter that it was difficult to imagine the feelings of a first-time reader before the book was published.
The Paddington Bears are a huge success now, and it's really funny.
Speaking of her father, she said that he was a photographer for the BBC who was inspired to write the children's book by a toy bear, who was always hopeful about his mother's rejection of the work, adding that his father died last year, the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book is said to be a "tribulation".
Speaking of the Paddington bear, she said it was a very important part of the family and that her father was proud of the success he had achieved.
"My dad was a quiet man who never bragged about himself", she said.
But because the Paddington Bear is too real to him, it's like your children have accomplished something: you're proud of them, even though it's not yours.
I think that's how he sees the success of the Paddington Bears.
Although this was a crystal of his creativity and imagination, he always attributed his success to the Paddington Bear himself.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were unable to save her life.
Nad called as usual to say that it was bad, that she had never thought of it being so bad, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
And then I got a call from Nad, saying that my daughter had only a few minutes left and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
I did that.
I said, "Dear Daisy, I love you".
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctor's medication for maintaining her heart rate was failing.
She died early, and it was over.
I know that this has happened, and I can only sit there and wait.
I can't scream or cry because my family and friends are all around me.
I have to stay calm.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was finally in the throes of the pain of her death, boarded the plane with the other passengers, seemingly forgetting the hardships she was going through.
She said that no one could see her.
I have fallen down with my head, my eyes flowing downward.
I know it's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt a lot of sympathy for Nad.
He needs my understanding and care.
I know how much he loves his daughter.
Sad woman posted card to persuade those with lighthearted thoughts to change their minds
Two women who lost loved ones tried to stop others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on Wales Bridge, with words of encouragement and phone numbers, to help those in need find support.
Davis's son Tyler, who was 13 years old, suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any other parents to experience the pain I'm going through every day", she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, lives in Lydney, where her son is a promising cook with an infectious smile on his face.
He is a man who loves to laugh.
It is always said that his smile makes the whole house happy.
But he gave up his work and died, and went to a place of darkness where he hid himself.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was just 11 years old, discovered that Tyler had taken his own life.
Davis said: "I've always been worried that his suicide would have a strained reaction.
So Davis made a card, and I wanted people to know that someone would be willing to help you, willing to listen to your advice, even if we were friends.
Don't keep silent, you need to speak up.
Mrs Humphreys was a longtime friend of Mrs Davies, who died shortly after her mother and her husband left her, and now has a 15-year-old scene.
She explained that her mother never told us what she felt was depressed or depressed about.
Just days before Christmas, we noticed that his emotions were not very right.
On Christmas Day, the children opened their presents and he had no eye contact, and his mood had fallen into the lowest valley.
She said that her husband's death brought her great trauma, but she still had to live: after her husband died, the roof of her house collapsed.
We all want to die in grief.
But we still have to live and fight.

The FBI is investigating Brett Kavanaugh's future.
I thought that if we could really get what he wanted - a time- and scope-limited investigation - we might be able to recover a thread of unity, Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was worried the committee would take this opportunity to begin to break up the deep-rooted party craze.
Why do Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
The reason for their reluctance is because of the timing.
With only five weeks left before the November 6 midterm elections, the Republicans' efforts to push the U.S. Supreme Court candidate will be severely impacted if they do not perform as well as we expect.
George W. Bush has been calling the Senators on a regular basis to lobby for Kavanaugh, who worked for the Bush administration in the White House and through Bush met his wife, Bush's private secretary Ashley.
What will happen after the FBI releases the report?
The Senate will vote, with 51 Republican and 49 Democratic seats in the Senate.
It is unclear whether Kavanaugh will win at least 50 votes in the Senate to break the tie with Vice President Mike Pence and confirm the nomination of the Supreme Court nominee.
The number of North Korean defectors under Kim Jong-un's rule has dropped sharply
A South Korean lawmaker said the number of North Koreans who have defected to South Korea has declined since Kim took office seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the United Kingdom of Korea as saying that a total of 1,127 North Koreans defected to South Korea last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key reasons for the decline in the number of deserters were the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increased costs charged by human trafficking groups.
North Korea has no public comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans who defected to South Korea eventually obtained South Korean citizenship.
South Korea says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border into South Korea illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the defectors fled to North Korea through China, as the border line with China is longer and easier to cross than the heavily defended demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China often forcibly returns refugees because it considers them illegal immigrants, not refugees.
In recent months, relations between North Korea and South Korea have improved significantly, although they are still technically at war.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries held talks in Pyongyang to open talks on the deadlocked denuclearization talks.
The improvement in relations between the two countries was the result of a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, during which the two sides largely agreed on efforts towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Lee Yong-yeon accused that no progress had been made since the meeting ended because the United States was still imposing sanctions.
If the United States is not trustworthy, we cannot ensure that our security is guaranteed, and therefore it is absolutely impossible to unilaterally lift the nuclear arms embargo, Lee Yong-hook said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve as a Supreme Court justice
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was hysterical and unfit to serve as a Supreme Court justice.
Pelosi said in an interview with the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
I can't help but think that if a woman had this behavior, they would describe it as 'hysteria,' Pelosi said, referring to the testimony Kavanaugh made Thursday in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh's mood was uncontrolled, and he was accused of having sex with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed that he had not been sexually abused as a child.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was emotionally uncontrollable, and several times he almost shouted or even spoke out while discussing his family and high school life.
He also explicitly condemned the Democratic party's participation, saying the allegations were the result of a bizarre united-person assault by the Liberal Party, which was angered by the Liberal Party's defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unfit to run for the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased against Democrats.
She said: "I think his testimony and his attitude towards Clinton and the Democrats shows that he is not qualified enough".
Asked if he would impeach Kavanaugh if the charges were finally confirmed, if the Democrats won a majority of seats in the House, Pelosi objected.
Pelosi said: "If what he told Congress or the FBI is not true, then he is not only unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, but also unfit to serve on the court that he is currently serving".
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned that Kavanaugh might rule against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade ruling because he was a conservative justice.
Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court rulings while confirming the hearing.
Now, it's not appropriate to have a hysterical, prejudiced person serve on the court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that good, huh?'
Women need to exercise their power.
It was a slander of justice, and the anger that has been spreading for months, even years, that she would not be able to escape without crying out.
Steinem told me 45 years later that we cry when we're angry.
I think that's normal, don't you?
She continued, "A lady who was a big help to me, she was a company manager, and she said she would cry when she was angry, but she found a problem, which is that when she got angry and started crying, she would say hello to the people she was talking to, and you'd know I was sad because I was crying".
I'm mad at you.
Then she continued.
I think it's just great.
We use tears to express anger, partly because we have fundamentally misunderstood tears.
One of the things that really impressed me was that one of my early years at a male-dominated company, when I was crying out of an indescribable rage, and then I was caught by an old woman -- a manager I had always been a little afraid of -- who dragged me down the stairs.
She warned me that you should never let them see you cry.
Oh, they don't know you're angry.
They will think you are sad and happy because they beat you.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, ran for president with Gary Hart.
In 1987, Hart withdrew from the campaign after being involved in an extramarital affair on a merchant dinner ship named the Monkey Monkey, and Schroder was frustrated with the idea that he should personally practice running for president.
That wasn't a thoughtful decision, and 30 years later she smiled at me.
The other seven candidates were already running, and they didn't need another candidate.
Some call it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
As she was in the late stages of her campaign, Schroder was lagging behind in raising funds, so she vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
This is a battle that will be won.
She found that some supporters donated $1,000 to male candidates, but only gave her $250.
Oh, they think I need a discount?
When she announced that she would not run for office, she was plagued by a variety of complex emotions - gratitude to supporters; disappointment with the institutions that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target non-representative voters; and anger at sexism - she began to cry.
Schroder recalled the media's reaction to her saying, "Oh, you should think I'm mentally broken, Mom".
You may think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
Mom, she's crying.
What benefits will China-US trade war bring to Beijing
Experts say the US-China trade war is on the rise, but in the long run, the differences between the two countries may be more favorable for Beijing, despite the war being just beginning.
Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump warned for the first time that he was about to impose tariffs on China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The trade war escalated this week, with new tariffs imposing tariffs on half of Chinese imports to the United States, affecting the wave of goods worth $200 billion ($150 billion).
Beijing has repeatedly retaliated in the same way, with the most recent increase in tariffs of 5% to 10% on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to fight back against the United States, the world's second largest economy, and never to retreat in the near future.
Giving Washington concessions meant meeting their demands, but publicly giving in to the US was too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can play a good hand, the pressure of the US trade war could reduce the degree of interdependence between the two economies and bring China long-term positive support.
Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher in Asia at the Center for New American Security, said that if Washington or Beijing were to make political decisions quickly, it could lead to economic chaos between the two countries, which is actually more dangerous than the situation that has been recognized before.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready to welcome refugees back
Syria said it was ready to allow refugees to return to their homes voluntarily and called on all parties to help rebuild their homes after more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem told the UN General Assembly that conditions in Syria were improving.
He said that the country is now more stable and secure on the ground due to progress in the fight against terrorism.
The Syrian government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists and restore them to normal.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees are now in place. Refugees who have fled their homes are forced to leave their homes because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures against their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their homelands since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people in Syria still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime welcomes other countries' assistance in rebuilding its tarnished homes.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or support from the state for insurgent activities.
European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
In the 2018 Ryder Cup, held at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France, Europe defeated the United States by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5.
The United States has now lost six straight European lands and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, took the lead with 14.5 points to beat the United States, and regained the European title.
American star Phil Mickelson struggled for most of the game, losing to Francesco Molinari after he hit the 16th hole, the third pole, and was knocked out.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5-4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson, 2-1 behind Ian Poulter of England, is expected to play in his final Ryder Cup match.
Sergio Garcia, a Spanish professional who has won eight Ryder Cups, is the most successful European in history with 25.5 points.
I used to cry, but now I can't stand it anymore.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I am happy and happy to have the trophy back.
It is a great honor for our whole team and I am happy to be able to do my part, Garcia said with excitement after winning the European competition.
He passed the torch to his fellow golfer John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, a golf legend, 2-1 in a single match on Sunday.
"I've watched Tiger Woods play from a young age to a grown-up, and I'm very proud of him", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost four games to France, and set the record for the lowest Ryder Cup in the history of the competition with a record of 13-21-3.
This is a strange statistic for the greatest player of all time, as he is said to have won 14 major tournaments after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was not very optimistic all week except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who all played high quality balls throughout the game.
After the disappointing performance of his team, US captain Jim Furyk said, "I am proud of you all, and you are all fighting hard".
We have put a lot of pressure on Europe this morning.
We're through.
I'm going to pay homage to Thomas.
He is quite good as a captain.
The 12 players were all very good.
We'll regroup, I'll join the PGA and the Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 people and I am honored to be their captain.
The people of the country are the most important people in the world.
We were defeated.
Red tide updates: Red tide density decreases in Pinellas County, Manatee County and Sarasota County
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) has reported a general decline in red tide density in parts of Tampa Bay.

According to British media, U.S. Navy Deputy Secretary of War, General William Moran, said that even as the U.S. Navy is rebuilding its strength to respond to increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the U.S. continues to focus on the Asia-Pacific region - the Pentagon's expansion to include the Indian Ocean, Asia-Pacific - as its naval focus.
According to the British Defense Weekly, the website of the Defense Weekly of Pyongyang, reported on September 24, the United States listed China as a strategic competitor in the new defense strategy announced earlier this year.
The US Navy then resumed the Second Fleet to take a more direct action against Russia.
The move has raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts who fear the U.S. Navy may move away from the Obama administration's strategy of rebalancing the Asia-Pacific.
But Major Moran said the U.S. Navy's focus remains on the Western Pacific.
On January 24, 2018, at the Roundtable on the Challenge of the Sea of Azov in Washington, D.C., hosted by the National Bureau of Asian Studies, he said: "For us, there has been no significant change".
Moran says: "Well, the focus is still on rebalancing, shifting the focus or whatever you want to describe it to".
He also said that the United States has a close relationship with Europe.
He said: "We will continue to monitor the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do".
While Moran pointed out that the overall policy on Russia falls within the purview of the US Secretary of Defense, he warned: "The Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has proven that if we conflict with them, they will be very tough".
General Moran said that as part of the U.S. resumption of operations against Russia, China and other competitors, the U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying troops in a new mode of operation, which will help keep the enemy out of reach of the U.S. carrier battlefield or other assets at any given time and place.
He said: "Well, our Navy and Marines support it - the concept of unpredictability, not being in the same place over and over again, almost like a rash - that's what we do".
The first attempt to this new approach was reportedly made by the Dalai Lama's aircraft carrier group, the Dalai Lama, whose early deployments included working visits to the port and patrols in areas normally only passed through.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is working to ensure that Allies know that these warships will continue to patrol in traditional areas and is also working to address logistics and home connectivity issues for new deployment procedures.
The Royal Australian Navy Commander Michael Nunn will also address the event, saying that the Australian military can work with the US carrier fighter group without any problems.
He said that this would continue with the Royal Australian Navy planning to purchase nine more ships equipped with the Aegean Shield Combat System.
Many airlines have raised or restored fuel surcharges since October 5th, and they are looking to raise money for their flights next Friday.

Japanese businessman Ito Tsun on Friday acknowledged a $1.3 billion loss in investments in China's Shenzhen shares, which were cut short by its largest corporate investment transaction due to the impact of trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, a man walked through the headquarters of the company in Tokyo, Japan.
The US grain sector has been hit hard by the trade war, and its financial transactions in agriculture have been suspended.
Some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies, and others have warned of the impact of China-US trade friction on their latest results, and now they are also on the list.
The United States and China are imposing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods, and US President Trump has threatened to extend the tariff to all Chinese exports of US goods worth more than $50 billion if the dispute is not resolved.
The Minister of Commerce and Finance, Isuzu Tsuyoshi Hachimura, said that the trade dispute could have a greater impact on China's economy next year.
Itotsuo Business with the Thai Crop Bees Group invested $10 billion in China in 2015 to acquire 20% of its shares.
Hachimura said that the business of Ito Tsui had posted losses of $1.3 billion for this segment, which it believes will not recover in the near future.

The United States has entered a countdown to the midterm elections.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic opponents actively waved tears at their core voters.
Both parties pointed out that voter turnout will be key to the left-wing election situation.
Reportedly, 48 hours before the US referendum, Trump was busy attending the Republican candidate's rally, while former President Obama went to Indiana to stand for the Democratic candidate for the federal Senate, Joe Donnelly, and shout out to the crowd for his final appeal before the election.
On November 4, Trump came to the Georgia state ballot box for Republican candidate Brian Kemp, and he said: "Hey, Tuesday you have to go to the polls, you have to vote".
The opposition to the election could not be more clear.
The political enthusiasm of the electorate has risen to a rare peak, with early voting in some states far out of the ordinary.
The first-round election of a sitting US president often results in fewer seats for the members of his political party.
According to a new poll released by The Washington Post and ABC News on Thursday, while the Democratic Party's lead in the federal House of Representatives remains dominant, Republicans can benefit from economic assessment and Trump's strong focus on border security.
Polls showed registered voters preferred Democratic House candidates to Republicans, at 50 percent to 43 percent, but the 14 percent lead in August was still down.
Another poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal also showed that Democrats still lead Republicans by 7 percentage points.
It is reported that Obama told the crowd at the inauguration of Senator Donnelly: "When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, there are consequences".
Democracy cannot work when people can only lie and self-abandoningly.
The only way to stop these Republicans is for you and your vote.
The Democratic Party faces its toughest election in decades in the Senate, with the Republican Party currently holding more than half of the 51 seats.
The Democratic Party needs to win 23 more seats to take control of the 435-seat House.
According to analysts at the polling site FiveThirtyEight.com, the Democrats have a 85 percent chance of winning the House.

People's Net Beijing 5 November (Wong Xiaoping) Under the current wave of Chinese entrepreneurship and Chinese innovation, more and more tech companies are starting to pay attention to patent research and development and related protection work, deepen the potential value of patents, and take over the market dominance.
Similarly, many tech companies have encountered a wave of infringements in terms of patent licensing and use of patent technology.
In late 2017, three people from Guangdong Province, including Zhaowei, Hohtō, and Raiyang, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the development company Beijing Xiaoxing Technologies Limited (later known as Xiaoxing Technologies Limited), which developed the ZhaoAPP, and the distributor, ZhaoDiti Technologies Limited (later known as ZhaoDiti Technologies Limited), which filed a complaint with the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested a court order that the three defendants immediately cease the manufacture, sale, promise, and use of the plaintiff's patent practices.
On October 30, 2018, the Chinese Arbitral Documentation Network published a civil judgment in a civil dispute over patent rights disputes with China's China-based company Changwon, Hongchang-Yun and others, including Beijing-based China-Chongqing Technology Limited, which disclosed details of some of the cases involving Diti's patent infringement actions against the App.
The three complainants argue that the patented and inventors of the pump based on the mobile terminal's piston service system and methodology, while the entire operation of the pump application in the pump application in the pump app is in line with the technical program involved in patent protection, constitutes patent infringement.
However, during the court's periodic hearing, Chuangtech argued that Guangdong Pacific was not a qualified defendant, that it only provided free downloads of the APP app on the Internet, that it did not implement the patented method involved, that there were no direct or indirect infringements, and that it should not be listed as a defendant in this case.
Second, the alleged violations were not committed in Guangdong.
In accordance with the law, infringement of the patent in question should be carried out in full in the place where the patent procedure in question is being applied, and therefore the court's jurisdiction was challenged and the case was referred to the court of the defendant's domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant in Guangdong Pacific provided the alleged infringement of Didi's APP products on its web platform, and that the plaintiff was not wrong to list the defendant in Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
The defendant is located in Guangzhou Pacific City, within the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant claimed that the case was transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for consideration, based on insufficient evidence, rejected the objections raised by the defendant against the jurisdiction of the case and assumed the costs of receiving the case of the jurisdiction objection.
The other details of the case are not yet known, and journalists will be closely watching the details of the patent infringement case.
Interview with the CEO of the Australian Federal Organisation for Scientific and Industrial Research: Significant results in China-Australia collaboration in science and technology
China's scientific and technological development has been rapid in recent decades, and Australia and China have worked together in the field of science to achieve rich results.
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Australian Federal Organisation for Scientific and Industrial Research, said in an interview with China News Agency in Beijing that Australia's cooperation in the field of technology is alive and well, from climate change to the Tetragroup project.
As the largest national research institution in the Australian Federation, CSIRO has achieved a number of world-renowned innovative research achievements in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials, astronomy and others.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The friendship is a lasting one, and it is a tradition of trust and long-term cooperation between partners.
In May, China's 500-meter globular radiation telescope - the Chinese telescope Tianjin-Zhou - installed the first international 19-wave L-band receiver.
The most advanced 19 wave-beam ionic-source receiver in the world today, developed jointly by scientists from China and Australia.
Marshall said the successful development of the receiver was based on years of CSIRO's accumulation of technology, which will increase FAST's orbit speed by 5-6 times and expand the scientific observation goals.
The first is that the new technology is being developed in the future.
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO is also working closely with Chinese scientific institutions in the construction of array radiation telescopes in square kilometers, research and development of new fuel technologies, energy saving and emission reduction.
The scientific research of the past has often focused on the problems of a century later, and now more research is needed to solve the problems that lie ahead.
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a number of challenges in development.
Extreme weather, for example, is frequent worldwide, drought and flooding have led to reduced food production, and food shortages have severely affected human development.
At the same time, the problems of population explosion, ageing, chronic diseases are also the major challenges facing the country today.
The recent cooperation between the two countries has been focused on solving these current problems.
Marshall said CSIRO is working with the National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology in Aquarius, a collaborative effort with the International Centre for South Hemisphere Marine Research, which focuses on observing the El Niño and Ladina phenomena, studying the relationship between the two with extreme weather and establishing extreme weather forecasting facilities; CSIRO and the Faculty of Medicine have developed new varieties of grains that overcome extreme weather and can also mitigate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
In the current environment, technological innovation is difficult to do alone, requires extremely high costs and has many problems to solve, so cooperation is especially important today.
Marshall said that the closer cooperation, the more likely it is to make breakthrough progress, which is also the meaning of the strengthening of cooperation between the two sides in the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative.
The two countries have been working together to strengthen bilateral cooperation, which is mainly in the field of technology for us.
For example, Marshall said that CSIRO has recently developed a method of gold purification that does not use chlorinated gold, and that because the traditional chlorinated gold purification method is so harmful to the environment, many countries are hoping to find a method of purifying gold that is less polluting to the environment.
We are willing to bring this technology to China, which is one of the results of our cooperation with China.
On 29th, 2018, the Baboon Silk Road Tourism Promotion Baboon Project Cooperation Talks were held in the city of Urumqi, Xinjiang, where guests could appreciate the development of Baboon while also appreciating the local cuisine and feel the rich history of the local culture.

Chen Maong, Chairman of the Baoding City Tourism and Development Commission for the Promotion of the Market, said: "In the United States, some tourist resources complement the Baoding, and we went all the way to promote tourism in Baoding, mainly to introduce human treasures, food treasures, natural scenery, etc., and selected more than 500 photos to let customers feel the beauty of Baoding.
The event, which focuses on tourism resources, tourism projects, tourist lines, and other activities, through the broadcast of tourism promotional films, cultural tourism resources and projects, the organization of tourism photography exhibitions, the production of promotional exhibitions, the distribution of promotional materials, the linking of tourism cooperation exchanges, and the comprehensive promotion of the overall image of tourism, quality tourism products and the fine tourism industry, consolidation of the Xinjiang customer market, the comprehensive promotion of the brands of the Chinese brand, the promotion of the influence and popularity of the market in the Northwest region, and attracting more tourists to the Xinjiang tourism experience.
The Deputy Director of the Office of Public Procurement in Baoding said: "At this event, all departments, all counties, all development areas of Baoding actively engaged in dialogue and coordinated the implementation of a large number of good projects.
As of now, 41 signed projects have been implemented, involving a total amount of 260.43 billion yuan.
In recent years, the company has focused on building international cities along the Belt and Road Initiative, the world's leading cities in the equipment manufacturing industry, the world's leading cities in the history of culture and the world's most livable cities, and the goal of continuously improving the industrial cluster, logistics hubs, integrated services, open high ground, and human resource concentration, accelerating the pursuit of transcendent and high-quality development.
In 2017, the region's total output reached 218 billion yuan, an increase of 8.7%.
The award has been presented to more than 20 national-level honors, including the National Civilized Cities, National Ecological Garden Cities and Chinese Residential Environment Awards.
The Standing Committee of the Urumqi Municipal Commission, Deputy Mayor Namami Min explained that Urumqi, as a major town on the Silk Road, has special geographical advantages, since ancient times it has been connecting Tian Shan North, Xinjiang and mainland, and important passage through China to Central Asia, Western and Europe, and is an important window for China's opening to the West and cultural exchanges with foreign economies, and has a good investment environment.
The event, which focuses on equipment manufacturing, logistics trade, tourism, and the opportunity for collaborative development and co-operation, is a huge success in Urumqi.
During the talks, local customers in Xinjiang signed six projects with Baoding County Districts, involving RMB32.5 billion.
On the same day, foreign guests from Kyrgyzstan's representative of the Visa Board in Urumqi, Russian New Siberian Law Limited, Tajik Chamber of Commerce in Urumqi, and the representative of the Russian Chamber of Commerce in Tashkent attended the talks.

The Northeast is a major development area.
The Northeast region's industrial enterprises are more important than the foundation, and for the Northeast, innovation is development, and innovation is the future.
The question of whether the old industrial base can be re-energized and released, touching the heart of the Secretary-General.
North Korean Foreign Minister Lee Yong-hoon told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen North Korea's distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for North Korea to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Li Yong-yeon told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken very friendly steps over the past year, including halting missile and nuclear tests, demolishing nuclear test sites, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
But we haven't seen any corresponding response from the United States, he said.
If you don't trust the United States, you don't trust our national security, and in that case, we can't just give up our weapons.
While Lee Yong-ho was a repeated complaint about North Korea's opposition to the United States' nuclear phase-out, his speech was significant because it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization as North Korea had before.
Li Yong-yeon mentioned a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Trump on June 12, when Kim Jong-un agreed to the Korean Peninsula's nuclear weapons efforts, and Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said North Korea must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
The United States also refused to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States has insisted on nuclear weapons and increased sanctions pressure to achieve its goal in a high-pressure manner, even refusing to issue the Declaration of the End of the War of the Ring, Liu Li Yong-yeon said.
The idea that sanctions can make us kneel down and ask for forgiveness is that those who don't understand us are dreaming about it.
But the problem is that these continued sanctions are deepening our distrust.
Lee Yong-ho did not mention the plans for the second delegation meeting the US president mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he stressed that Kim Jong-un and President Moon Moon have met in Seoul three times in the past five months, saying: "If the other side of nuclear de-nuclearization is South Korea and not North Korea, then the North Korean peninsula would not be so de-nuclearized".
China announced that it has reduced import tariffs for 1585 tariffs since November 1, 2018.
Since this year, China has been actively reducing import tariffs.
On May 1, the total tariff reduction on drugs will be reduced to zero for 28 import duties, including all common drugs and biocides with anticancer effects, including those with actual imports of Chinese derivatives.
At the same time, the value added tax burden on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs has been significantly reduced.
Tax cuts on 218 tax-related vehicles and parts on July 1.
After the tax cuts, the Chinese car repair tax rate is lower than the average in developing countries, in line with the Chinese automotive industry's practice.
The tax cuts will promote structural adjustment and resource optimisation, accelerate the win-win situation, help improve the quality of products and services, and hopefully drive some price adjustment for cars, giving consumers more benefits.
Tax cuts on daily consumer goods for 1449 tax purposes on July 1.
The tax cuts on everyday consumer goods are closely related to the good life of the people.
The tax cuts were not only large but also powerful, with an average tax cut of 56%.
The tax cuts on everyday consumer goods directly benefit the wider consumer base and promote domestic industry's competitiveness.
On 1 November, the tax cuts will be implemented on 1585 taxable industrial goods such as mechanical and electrical equipment, parts and raw materials.
The appropriate reduction of import tariffs on some domestically demanding industrial products would attract more foreign investment, increase domestic supply efficiently, assist in the upgrading of industry, help enterprises allocate resources globally, reduce production costs and reduce the pressure on the domestic environment.
The State Council's Customs Tax Office, the relevant officials of the Commission, said the four autonomous tax cuts and the third step of the tax cuts implemented on July 1 following the outcome of the scope-expanding negotiations under the IT Agreement will bring the total level of tariffs in China down to 7.5% from 9.8% last year.
The adjusted overall level of tariffs is slightly higher than the EU, lower than most developing countries, at a moderate to low level, and is fundamentally in line with the status and developmental stage of developing countries in China.
The official explained that the total level of tariffs, as one of the important indicators of the degree of openness in the Chinese goods trade, should be adapted to the stage of economic development in China and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China's trade in goods, which is the world's first in scale, has an open economic base for further expansion, but the quality and benefits of trade development are still at a disadvantage compared to developed economies, and therefore the overall level of tariffs should be reduced appropriately.
Tariffs are a means of protecting compliance, and the level of tariffs should be in line with the competitiveness of industry, to encourage good competition, to protect excessively against industrial development and to improve quality.
The adjustment of the tariff rate is to match the needs of production and consumption.
The focus is on reducing the large domestic demand, on the increase of the commodity tax rate that helps to upgrade the industrial transformation, on efforts to increase the demand of the people, on the import of products with a focused characteristic advantage, on increasing the awareness of businesses and the public, and on meeting the needs of upgrading industrial structures and consumption structures.
The tax cuts should be accompanied by financial revenues and the affordability of industrial development.
In the specific choice of goods and the amount of taxation to be reduced, the two markets at home and abroad, the up and down sides, the two relations of production and consumption, should be coordinated and coordinated to maintain the steady and good development momentum of China's economy.
The official stressed that this year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, and that China's initiative to lower the total level of import tariffs is a major initiative taken in line with China's own needs for high-quality development, in favor of the unification of the use of both international and foreign resources, promoting the improvement of the quality of the domestic supply system and meeting the needs of the people's consumption upgrades.
This action and initiative demonstrates China's commitment to a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of openness, strong support for economic globalization, strong support for the principles of free trade and the multilateral trade system at the heart of the WTO, and to continue to draw on the development momentum of openness to the world and to make China's development more beneficial to the world.
Serbia declared its highest state of war and the President of Serbia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
According to the Serbian President's Office, in light of the fact that Kosovo forces have taken over the water storage lake of the Gazprom Hydropower Station, which is controlled by Belgrade in northern Kosovo, President Vucic ordered the country's armed forces to enter the highest state of war.
On September 29, Serbian Defense Minister Wourin announced that the Serbian army had entered a state of complete combat readiness.
Woulin stressed that Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as the order issued by Vucic remains in force, and Serbs will respond in whatever direction the situation develops.
According to Russian news agency TASS, on September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he had informed the current situation with the U.S. and Russia and Europe and would travel to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Putin to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When asked whether Serbia needed Russian military support like Syria, Vucic replied: "Oh, I don't want any major military conflict on our territory".
Vucic also said that Serbs entered a state of full military readiness only to form a deterrent to the conflict, but it was also a clear warning: there would be absolutely no tolerance for any violence in Kosovo.
The Serbian military's increased readiness was linked to two major moves in Kosovo.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, the Albanian people have been making mass arrests of Serbs living in the northern region of Kosovo, and the Serbs arrested have not violated any laws.
Vucic said that the situation in the region has been escalating since the Serbian government's head of Kosovo and Metohija, Marco Yuric, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo army on March 26 this year, and that Serbs have been subjected to inhuman arrests and deportations.
More than 100 people, including the RSU special forces, armed police and snipers, of the Republic of Kosovo's Home Affairs Ministry, which was announced earlier, occupied positions near the lake of the Gazivoda hydroelectric power station, entered the ecological and sports centres near the northern embankments of the region of Kosovo and blocked all nearby roads, which were originally controlled by Serbia.
Vucic noted that this military adventure in Kosovo, carried out under the auspices of Western powers, and the actions of the Kosovo army without prior notification to Serbia, violated Article 9 (1) of the Brussels Convention and the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military technical agreement between the Secos.
Wouchiech has already addressed NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg, criticizing Western countries for their false statements on Kosovo.
The root of the conflict today is still centuries of historical grievances between the two Sa'a tribes in Kosovo.
There are various claims about Kosovo's belonging, Serbs and Arabs.
Serbia and Kosovo are the birthplace and cultural cradle of the nation, as Serbia established its most powerful state here in the 12th century, while the Arabs migrated in large numbers only after the Ottoman invasion and defeat of the Serbs in the north.
The Arian people maintain that the original Illyrian tribe that lived in Kosovo in the 4th-5th centuries BC was the ancestor of the Arian people, and therefore Kosovo has been the territory of the Arian people since ancient times.
Subjective political divisions have led to intense clashes between ethnic, religious and cultural groups, and to a fierce opposition between Serbs and Arabs in Kosovo.
In 1912, the first Kosovo people declared independence from Albania.
After World War I, large numbers of the Aryan population living in the Balkan Peninsula migrated to Turkey, and the proportion of Serbs increased relatively, and the Serbs saw the practice of taking back their own land as a means of looting the Serbian landscape, which was seen by the Aryan people as a major pillaging of Serbian lands, and the two-tribal contradictions intensified.
Kosovo has become a barrel of Balkan crack cocaine.
In 1999, Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army clashed with Serbian troops and police, which led to NATO forces bombing the Southern Alliance of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Kosovo War.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.
Although there have been reports that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, it has not been able to sign due to historical ethnic grievances and geopolitical backlash, subject to multilateral forces such as the United States and Russia.
A month earlier, Vucic first made clear his support for the separation of Serbs and Ars within Kosovo, and again to open up the contradictions between the two ethnic groups.
Power transmission still cut off, tsunami relief efforts in Indonesia are heavy
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency on the morning of 30 March, a strong earthquake and tsunami in the province of Cingapura, Sulawesi province, have killed 420 people on 28 March.
Wilem Rampangilei, head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, said the figures were only preliminary statistics for the city of Palou, the capital of Central Sulawesi province, about 80 kilometers from the quake, which has not yet been rescued due to the lack of large search engines and the city's many hotels, shops, warehouses and other buildings that were damaged by the quake.
Local time: Indonesia's Balu Road, a bridge destroyed by an earthquake and tsunami, collapsed several times on September 29, 2018.
The earthquake caused significant damage to power and communication facilities, and the surrounding areas of Siji and Tanggala are still unconnected, with no statistical figures available.
According to media reports, the Indonesian vice president, Kara, said the death toll was in the thousands.
The country has been hit hard by power outages, communications outages, road blocks, airport damage, and the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami.
The power outages have caused some hospitals and rescue facilities in Palou to need fuel to generate electricity.
The city's roads are blocked by landslides, and large transport vehicles, including petrol vans, are unable to access the city, which has caused fuel supply to be strained.
Indonesian Social Minister Agus said that emergency relief supplies such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothing, food, household items, and other items that the ministry had transported from neighboring South Sulawesi and Kolkata provinces to the affected areas had not yet arrived due to road damage.
Rescue materials being transported from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster area via air transport.
Given the damage to the command tower and runway at Pallu Airport during the earthquake, all commercial flights have been suspended to ensure safety and to ensure rescue, and military aircraft only carrying rescue supplies and personnel have been disembarked.
Minister of Political, Legal and Security Affairs of Indonesia, who is in charge of rescue in the earthquake zone, Viranto, has called for the resumption of electricity supply and commercial flight services at the airport as soon as possible to ensure that rescue facilities such as hospitals are operational and that more rescue personnel and volunteers and aid supplies can be transported to the disaster area.
On 28th, a series of strong earthquakes occurred in the province of Congola, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, which triggered a magnitude 7.7 quake at 17:02 local time, causing major disasters in the city of Palou, Congola, and Sigi.
China News Agency Beijing October 1 (Reporter) Shine like a wash, sunshine like a thousand miles, colorful sun ... Recently, Beijing continues to open the most beautiful blue sky model, bringing thousands of people from the city of Beijing to show pictures on social platforms, constantly brushing the screen with happiness, calling the blue and white clouds, the blue and white sky, the blue and white, the blue and white, the American skyline, this is the best picture of Beijing.
Since August, Beijing has hosted the brightest blue sky.
In the city of Jinjiang, people can be seen anywhere, anytime, with their smartphones or with their reverse camera.
On social platforms like Weibo, Weibo, and Weibo, you can see the palaces, the Tian'an Gate, the bird's nest, the holes in the cameras of the netizens, and all kinds of buildings displaying their beauty under the blue sky.
Some netizens say that this kind of flashy film is the best city propaganda film in Beijing; others say that if such a blue sky is long-term brush screen, people with spinal cord disease can be cured; and others hope that the blue paint will make the winter and spring and summer more likely to make the roofs of Beijing blue for the fourth season.
Why do people in Beijing love the blue sky so much?
The people who lived in the city in the past were suffering from fog and therefore especially longed for blue skies, while the sound of the Blue Sky Defence War in Beijing, the continuous improvement of air quality, the fog is less, the blue sky is more, the people look in the eyes and the happiness gained is also a great part.
The weather in Beijing is nice on the day of National Day.
By 8 a.m., the vast majority of the 35 air quality monitoring stations across the city were showing green as a grade of lime.
The contest on the theme of the most blue sky anime on social platforms, which was created by the public, is still ongoing.
Why is the sky in Beijing so blue recently?
According to the official of the Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, the average concentration of PM2.5 particles in Beijing in August was 35 micrograms per cubic meter, the best record in almost five years.
PM2.5 real-time concentrations in September were higher than the current rate.
One of the major factors that led to the emergence of the most blue sky was the overall favorable weather conditions over recent times, and more importantly, Beijing's steady implementation of air pollution governance, the strong push for clean air action plans over the past five years, the continued release of environmental benefits, and the reduction of total pollutant emissions in the region, all of which laid the foundation for continuous improvement of air quality.
Beijing officially launched and implemented the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 in 2013.
According to the plan, the government continues to lead the evacuation of non-capital functions, promote energy cleanup alternatives and pollution reduction work, and eliminate a total of 4,923 coal-fired boilers.
Beijing has also become the first major city in mainland China to achieve full network natural gas conversion.
Data shows that the average annual PM2.5 concentration in Beijing decreased by 35.6% between 2013 and 2017; the number of days at the air quality benchmark increased by 50 days; the number of days at the first level increased by 25 days; the number of days of heavy pollution decreased by 35 days and the incidence of heavy pollution significantly decreased.
While the air quality continues to improve, Beijing's government, based on a new round of PM2.5 source analysis, released its Beijing City of Blue Sky Defense Triennial Action Plan in September this year. The plan focuses on the current governance phase and pollution characteristics, focusing on the areas of control such as diesel trucks, dust removal, volatile organic governance, optimizing transportation adjustment, industrial structure, energy structure and land use structure, strengthening regional interconnected defense control, focusing on enhancing urban fine-tuning management, promoting comprehensive green development, striving to make the most blue sky monkeys live in Beijing, no longer treating monkeys as rare and precious, and returning them to the background of people's photographs rather than the mainstream.
During the Golden Week of National Day of China, the city's Tourism Commission, the city's business, city administration, public security and other relevant departments will strengthen the enforcement of the enforcement of the day-night market of tourist lilies, focusing on tourist lilies and black lilies, and will impose severe penalties on violators according to the law.
The city government held a conference on the topic of illegal day trips yesterday morning to deploy special operations to further crack down on illegal day trips.
The meeting revealed that the city has launched a strictly illegal daytime gambling campaign since July 28, focusing on black tickets, black guides, black associations, black cars, black shops, and intertwined black net interest chains.
The special operation has been carried out so far, with 39 complaints of one-day-longer-travel in the city, a decrease of 63%; this year, 270 complaints of one-day-longer-travel in the city, a decrease of 62% have been received.
In the last two months, 248 black car seizures have been carried out in the city, 158 tourist traffic violations have been seized, 29 shopping malls and theaters have been closed, 13 black corporations have been seized, 27 black guides have been seized, 26,000 ads have been seized, 31 illegal daytime travel billboards have been removed, 3 bus passports have been removed, 1789 travel violations have been seized, 181 cases have been filed by various departments, from heavy fines of 448 thousand yuan to detention of 111 people involved in travel violations.
After the illegal day-trip disorder was cured, the market order for day-trip disorder has been steadily improving.
In recent years, the city has been increasing its efforts to curb illegal day trips.
In 2016 and 2017, the city's tourism commission received 1612 and 897 complaints of day trip tickets, which decreased by 79% and 44% respectively, but illegal day trip tickets remained steady and rebounded, creating intertwined interests such as black tickets, black guides, black associations, black cars, black stores, and the black net.
Specifically, illegal travelers on the streets are illegal travelers who cheat on black tickets, illegal websites that post fake tourist information, travel agencies or non-tourist agencies that operate a qualified travel agency or an individual who is employed by a travel agency, guides who are employed by a non-guided travel agent or illegal practitioners, vehicles that are used without qualified travelers or vehicles that provide travel services to illegal travelers.
In this special operation, the city continued to increase the fixed inspection and mechanical inspection of illegal day trips, targeting high frequency and impactful tourist route sites, and the relevant authorities sent daily escorted by ambush teams to find evidence of violations of the law.
The two main focuses of the special operations were the black car races and the black shop races.
It is reported that without black cars, illegal day trips cannot be made, and black cars are both easily detected, remembered and searched, and are fixed assets with a higher single value.
The relevant departments use road traffic monitoring detectors to increase the regulation of buses on the main routes, and use technology and smart means such as security, security and security to detect black cars in time.
The number of tourist shops in the area has also been a major focus of the tourist shopping industry due to the small number of seating areas.
To strengthen the tremor and the strength of the fight against illegal gambling, the special operations shall provide strict penalties for violations of the law in accordance with the law.
In August, the city also held a legal seminar on the issue of strictly illegal gambling, which discussed the measures to combine administrative punishment with criminal convictions.
The city's Tourism Commission said that in the future more formal travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out day trips to Beijing, increasing the supply of regular day trips to further clutter the living space of illegal day trips, specific plans are currently under consideration.
In addition, the City Tourism Commission is continuously improving the e-travel information system of the tourism team, ensuring that each team is integrated into the e-travel single platform regulation.
What has been the experience of the city of Ure over the years, from a tourism symbol to a digital economy symbol?
As the permanent home of the World Internet Congress, how the summit dividend was received is a matter of great interest.
In the five years since the first World Internet Congress, the city has seen changes.
In 2014, there were only 12 businesses in the city related to the digital economy and the internet, and by the third quarter of this year, there were more than 500.
This is a summary of the development of the digital economy in Ujjain.
The Internet Congress is being held to inspire local businesses to embrace the digital economy, digital waves, and the desire to transform and upgrade businesses is strong, with traditional manufacturing companies increasing their investments and R&D in machine switching, intelligent management, and more.
The party's secretary, Liu, said that the future of Wu Town will be to build a new economic empowerment center.
The development of the digital economy is inseparable from the support of infrastructure.
This year, Wu started 5G pilot work on the basis of 4G communication network and free WiFi full coverage.
At the same time, the city of Yangtze, where U Town is located, became the first county-level city in the country to build an international Internet data channel and also became a hotbed for Internet industry development.
Since the first World Internet Congress, Yangtze has introduced a total of 565 digital economy projects, with a total investment of 377.25 billion yuan, and the core manufacturing sector of the digital economy achieved a total output value of 8.730 million yuan in the third quarter of this year, an increase of 13% in value-to-peer ratio.
Before the war, the town was a tourist symbol, but later became a more dramatic and cultural symbol. Because of the Internet Congress, it has now become a symbol of the Internet and the digital economy.
The secretary of the Yangtze Municipal Commission, Sheng Yong-jun, believes that the dividend of the World Internet Congress accumulates over time, and therefore, it is necessary to build a platform to absorb the overlapping elements of talent, projects, and technology from all sides.
Shenzhen, a native of Yangon, has been working abroad for 20 years, and has returned to his home country to start his own business due to his association with the Internet Congress.
On December 2, he entered the fourth Internet Light Expo with high-capacity anti-fouling digital technology solutions, which were appreciated by many customers.
Shenzhen chose to start in U Town not only because of the family ties, but also because of the fact that in U Town, it is easier to recruit than I thought, and our application also lands quickly, and we have our application in the U Town Smart Parking Project.
A street in U Town, which has been the spillover effect of the Internet Congress.
The road runs through the town from north to south and connects not only tourist attractions but also an industrial avenue.
The city of Ueda, along the Avenida Coroa, is the birthplace of the creative assembly.
The reporter learned that in the future, U Town Avenue will be a major site for the development of the rural industry, leading the way in the application of smart healthcare, smart retirement, smart governance, and other results, bringing together 80% of the city's GDP and many high-level talents.
At least 410 people have been killed in a tsunami-related earthquake in Indonesia
According to the Directorate of Public Information of the Jakarta Police, on the evening of 29th, the earthquake in Central Sulawesi has killed 410 people, 97 of whom have been identified.
The report also highlights the importance of the country's economic and social development.
The airport is currently closed.
In China, the survival rate for premature babies 29 weeks and older is 98%, which is already at the level of developed countries.
China New Internet Shanghai September 30th (Chenqing) National Children's Medical Center, Purdue University affiliated pediatric hospital, 30th, disclosed that its advanced methodology in Canada was introduced in the program of pre-natal quality improvement in the NICU residential hospital in Guangzhou, China.
Results of the project show that with active treatment, survival rates in China for premature babies 29 weeks and older reached 98%, which is the level of developed countries, but there is still room for significant improvement in survival rates for very young fetuses and premature babies without complications.
For nearly 20 years, the Chinese government has been focusing on the treatment of newborns.
Currently, infant mortality in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71‰, significantly below the national average, reaching advanced levels in developed countries.
The NICU Pre-natal Quality Improvement Project in China has improved the quality of life of premature babies through four years of tireless efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, Director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the University of Padang, said to reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature babies, the focus on reducing the survival rate of premature babies, reducing complications, improving the prognosis of neurodevelopment, improving the overall outcome of the patient, is important for improving the overall survival quality of premature babies and the demographic quality of the population, which is an important issue of concern for the domestic and foreign pediatric community, and is also a key issue of the project.
The NICU Pre-natal Quality Improvement Project, which has been implemented in China for four years, has resulted in a one-third decrease in the mortality rate of premature babies of the age of 33 weeks and below, while significantly reducing the incidence of serious complications of premature birth, and significantly improving the quality of survival of premature babies.
The project will build a national network of collaborative improvements in the quality of newborns, introduce the concept of collaborative quality improvement, radiate 25 collaborative hospitals across China, establish a set of collaborative methods to improve early childhood prognosis, improve the level of newborn care, and improve the quality of collaborative care in a complete, systematic and effective manner, in line with national conditions.
The University of Patanch's affiliated pediatric hospital is joining forces with the national pediatric force to develop guidelines for the treatment of newborn infections based on the accumulated experience of the project, and to provide reference and guidance for the standard clinical treatment of newborn infections in China.
It is understood that in the framework of the China Premature Childbirth Pre-natal Quality Improvement Project, the pediatricians have introduced the EPIQ method in 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces across the country, working to address the problem of premature infant infection in China's newborn care facilities.
After more than a decade of continuous improvement, Canada's overall survival rate of premature babies without complications has increased by about one-third, and Canada is now ranked as one of the best countries in the world for premature birth.
The EPIQ method is now used in all NICUs across Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
The pediatric hospital revealed that the results showed a 35% decrease in infection in premature babies after two years of EPIQ intervention, while the use of antibiotics decreased by 20%.
In the future, the University of Patanch's affiliated pediatric clinics will continue to promote and implement this method nationwide, with a view to comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications in premature births and improving the quality of newborn care throughout the country.
Currently, there are differences in the level of treatment in different regions of China and the disparity is indisputable.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important building block of the National Children's Medical Center, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role in radiation, and the study covers several western provinces such as Xinjiang, Guangzhou, Gansu, and Hsinchu, in order to gradually promote homogenization and standardization of neonatal care nationwide.
It is understood that the University of Patanch's affiliated pediatric hospital is joining forces in the field of neonatology to develop guidelines for the treatment of neonatal infections in China based on the accumulated experience of the project.
In 2019, the Coordination Center, located in the China Newborn Collaborative Network of the University of Zhengzhou affiliated pediatric hospitals, will combine 63 hospitals nationwide to undertake the next phase of national quality improvement to promote the standardized development of the level of newborn care in China.
Shanghai's director of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Environmental Commission, Zhang Tran, said that Shanghai could be a central city in the center of Asia, reflecting not only the research, but also the construction of the entire service system, and the quality of services and service outcomes should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China's medical level.
The first is the memorial to the heroes of the war, which was erected on the fifth anniversary of the death of the martyr.
On September 30, the eve of the Republic's 69th birthday, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of the martyrs, and Xi's Equality Party and national leaders came to Tianmen Square to attend the wreath-laying ceremony to honour the people's heroes.
In this moment, wherever you are, please salute Ingrid.
The day of remembrance is a re-awakening, even more so.
The story behind each martyr's name is a living history.
They have a hot youth, a true love, and a family that hangs around.
Yet because they are firmly convinced of the righteousness of our faith and the truth of the universe, they will willingly sacrifice everything they have to offer in order to save the next generation from suffering.
I'm going to cry out to China for a day to live.
Through time and space, the warriors set up a spiritual road sign to guide them in the direction they were going.
Where did you come from, where did you go, what kind of person you were?
The memorial is so intense, and the most important thing is to build a monument to the heroes of the war.
According to incomplete statistics, about 20 million martyrs have died in the years of the Revolutionary War for national independence, people's liberation, and the country's strong heroism.
For various reasons, many of the initiates did not even leave their names.
Many people have been inspired by the ideals and the blood of the people, and they have lived by faith and faith, remembering their good names and their legacy of the spirit that is the root and soul of the nation.
The monument to the heroes of the war is a monument that will not be damaged or destroyed.
The history of the world is a long way from the history of nothingness and entertainment.
The history of the country is distorted, the practices of violence are violated, the right to justice is challenged, the values are misjudged, and the public anger and awareness of society is aroused.
The heroes cannot forget.
To the actions that touch the bottom, to the actions that cannot be obeyed, to the courage of the sword to defend the dignity of the strong in the justice of the law and justice.
On May 1, the Hero Martyrs Protection Act officially came into force.
In judicial practice, the verdict in some cases is very pleasing, both to maintain the image of the brilliant and the glorious heroic and the positive energy of the revered heroic.
A nation with aspirations cannot be without heroes, and a nation with ideals cannot be without a leader.
The memory of the heroes and the call to heroes has become a universal social consensus.
Currently, there are millions of memorials across the country, and over 100 million people visit the Shrine of the Martyrs every year.
The human heart is the strongest foundation.
To honor heroes, defend heroes, learn heroes, care for heroes, and to bring the spirit of heroism into the blood of the nation, a monument to the hero will stand between the heavens and the earth, deep in the hearts of people.
BRUSSELS, 28 September - The EU took a non-confrontational stance on Friday after Italy defied EU demands to surprise the market with a massive budget deficit plan, but the EU may take a more radical stance if Italy adheres to its bold goals.
The Italian government's ambitious target of a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP over the next three years, indicating that debt cuts are not yet possible if the deficit reduction is required.
The EU Executive Committee's Economic Affairs Commissioner, Mr Moscovici, said on Friday that Mr Moscovici was not interested in the crisis between the Executive Committee and Italy, and that he had taken a cautious response given the possibility that the EU's recommendations and sanctions would have no impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will convince Italy to adjust its budget plans before Italy formally submits it to the EU Executive Committee in October.
The government announced its plans for a two-week low on Friday, and Italian bond yields hit a three-week high.
If the deficit targets remain unchanged by the October deadline, the EU Executive Committee may reject Italy's draft budget, something the Executive Committee has never done for any country.
At a meeting in Riga, Latvia, on Friday, the vice-chairman of the European Commission, East Bławski, said that Italy's current fiscal plan appears to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Convention, referring to the EU's fiscal regulations.
But he did not say what the EU would react to.
The tenderer may submit an application for the tender by 26 October this year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Russia has previously ranked China as one of the top markets for Russian agricultural exports.

In the first game of the day, Zhuge, who played for Turkey's Wakif Bank, was limited in the first leg of the match against her former teammates, and she then proceeded to change and still play a strong offense.
The Chinese team played extremely well, and in the event of a draw, they were able to intercept and attack well.
The Chinese women's team will then go on a day of rest and exercise in physical and technical strength; on October 2, the third team from the group stage will be Canada.

The Office of Trade Promotion conducts a systematic short- to medium-term optimization work
The MAOC has submitted a short- to medium-term optimisation work report on the "Major Investment Immigrant" and the "Technical Immigrant" and has been continuously listening to social comment and continuously optimizing the content and related work in addition to the work currently being done in the enhanced promotion and implementation of the report.
The Office of Trade Promotion will present the relevant optimization work to the community as soon as possible.
Five of these measures were short-term measures implemented in the year; five were medium-term measures implemented in 2019; one was long-term measures.
In addition, the Office of Trade Promotion has also been conducting a comprehensive review of the internal management system, as directed by the Secretary of the Department of Economic and Financial Affairs, Liang Vit.
The five short-term measures implemented this year include:

Experts from the National Film-Free Field Mosquito Research and Exchange Activities came to the test field to hear the representatives of the Chinese Institute of Engineering's Yogya-Teng Xiaodong team present their findings.
Xinjiang Shaia (Chinese: 新网新疆沙亚, 30 September) is a test base for the cultivation of non-membered cotton in Xinjiang Shaia County, which is popular with non-membered cotton farmers, with no shortage of cotton compared to the ground cotton next to it.
The National Non-Membrane Field Mosquitoes Exchanges and Workshops were held in Shaanxi County from September 27 to 28.
The journalists learned at the observation that the main non-membrane cotton technology system, which is based on cotton cotton 619 and its supporting cultivation measures, has initially achieved the goal of non-membrane cultivation in cotton fields, reducing the contamination of the ecological environment and the residual cotton in Xinjiang, and that comprehensive research and demonstration of non-membrane cotton technology has made significant progress.
The Chinese Academy of Engineering, the renowned cotton genetic breeder, the chief scientist of the National Modern Agricultural Industrial Technology System (NIAC) and the chief scientist of the Cotton System, Dr. Zhang Xinhua, presented the story to Zhengzhou Mining University Party Committee Secretary Zhongguo-Meng about the growth of non-membered cotton.
The new technology, which we have developed, is a complete solution to the problem of residual contamination and green cotton.
The Chinese Academy of Engineering Professor Yue Liang has introduced the concept.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton producing region in China, with 35 million tons of cotton grown in Xinjiang in 2017, accounting for 61% of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of the earthenware in 1982, the area of the Xinjiang region has been covered by more than 50 million tons of crop production, with an annual use of about 300,000 tons.
Cotton coverage is 100% and cotton covers about 60% of Xinjiang's land use.
The production of cotton without film is tested, and the cotton production can reach 320 kg to 350 kg of cotton.
With the increasing amount of landfill in Xinjiang, low residual landfill recycling, gradual increase in soil residues, and a series of problems such as soil structural degradation caused by residues, which seriously affect agricultural sustainability.
The residual membrane not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a major impact on the quality of cotton fibres.
Currently, more than one third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have been mechanically harvested.
In 2017, Xinjiang machine cotton was produced in an area of about 14 million tons.
The machine harvesting cotton yields a large amount of surface area, the shrapnel on cotton stock, the noise in the raw cotton shrapnel is difficult to remove during the raw cotton processing process, and cannot be completely removed during subsequent textile processing, which seriously affects the quality of textile products.
On September 28, a national non-membrane field mould observation workshop and exchange event was held in Shaanxi County.
In an effort to address cotton field membrane pollution, simplify cotton planting techniques, and improve cotton field efficiency, he led his team through eight years to implement cotton 619 tonnes of non-membered cotton technology in the cotton industry, adding to the green development of agriculture in Xinjiang.
The new ideas for cultivating new cotton are being developed to produce 619 cotton in the new cotton subgroup of cotton, which is particularly early-ripening, salt-resistant, cold-resistant, and productive.
The 619-tonne-membered seedling has achieved a series of support measures such as seeding mechanisms, deep improvements, deep-seeding, deep-seeding, seeding density screening, and reasonable chemical control.
Currently, the production of 4800 kg of tonnes per kg of coating is being demonstrated in Aksoy, Kurle, Al-Aar and other countries.
The development of non-membered cotton has resulted in increased productivity, productivity, environmental protection and overall benefits.
Zhang Zhenhai, a farmer and craftsman at the Xinjiang Production Construction Troop Third Division Agricultural School, said that through nearly six years of research and demonstration of non-membrane cotton cultivation techniques, the production of non-membrane cotton can reach 320 kg to 350 kg of lime, or even higher.
The potential for the use of non-membered cotton cultivation technology is high.
Zhang Zhenhai believes that currently, non-membrane cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual contamination, but there is a gap in the current economic benefits of soil cultivation.
The support for the purchase price of cotton will be beneficial for future promotion.
Yogi Shinsun said that next step, he and his team will continue to do in-depth research and large-scale promotion of application of non-film coatings, to strengthen the industry and completely solve the soil pollution problem caused by the sublimation.

Previous foreign aid accuses of playing fake ball North control responds to the need for a shark - China New Network
In an official response to the news that the team was allegedly forging a fake ball, the Beijing Football Club (BKF) accused the team of allegedly forging a fake ball, and the North said in a statement that there was absolutely no such thing as a fake ball, which was entirely a lie that Anisheba himself fabricated in vain for his personal and unjustified financial purposes during the arbitration process to cover up the fact that he had publicly violated his contract.
At the same time, the Northern District Court said it would reserve the right to pursue the liability of the parties concerned by all means.
According to the British Daily Mail, Nigerian player Anichebe has accused FIFA of allegedly playing fake balls against Beijing North, for whom he played last year, including the Beijing Derby in the second round of the 2017 edition of the FA Cup.
The final match was a crucial stage in the Beijing-Man Super Bowl, in which North Korea took a 0-2 lead over Beijing-Man and Anisechebi.
The Nigerian player was officially released yesterday by the Northern Control club.
The statement said that after an internal investigation before the club, there was no case of a forgery in any of the matches the team had played.
Anishebe joined Beijing North in June 2017 and in December of the same year, he refused to return to the team for winter training without any justification, despite several club cries.
The two sides have already filed a dispute with FIFA, and an arbitration is underway.
The statement also stated that the highly-regarded false ball charges were false allegations made by Anisheba during the arbitration process to cover up his outright breach of contract and for his personal unjustified economic purposes.
The only purpose of the club's slander against Chinese football is to obtain unfair economic benefits.
The club does not accept any organization or individual who, for their economic interests and personal grievances, makes unfounded accusations, slanders, defamations or defamations against the club.
Therefore, the Northern Control side has stated that it will reserve the right to pursue the liability of the parties concerned by all means.

Chinese State Counsellor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a speech to the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee on Friday that China-U.S. relations are once again at a crossroads, and that better prospects can be opened if both sides can be positive about each other, expand positive cooperation and properly manage differences and contradictions.
The Chinese-American relationship is our common asset and we need to look after it together.
He said he hopes that the two countries will have the wisdom to maintain healthy and stable development of the relationship with the United States through practical actions and jointly promote the relationship with the United States to continue in the right direction.
Wang Xi stressed once again that China will definitely take a different path of development from the traditional great powers.
This Chinese-characteristic path determines that China will not and will not repeat the unwavering overthrow of the powerful nation, and that China will not become the United States, challenge the United States, or replace the United States.
In a speech entitled Opportunity or Challenge, Partner or Opposition, Wang said the deep implication of the current problem is that some American friends believe China will also be a strong country, even challenging and replacing the United States' leadership in the world.
The first is that the government is not going to be able to take any action.
But this self-imaginative speculation is spreading, he said, and has amplified existing contradictions, raised new doubts, and made it more difficult and more resistant to resolving specific issues between China and the US.
Wang Xi pointed out that China is on a path of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had a gene that extends beyond the Chinese.
The government has also expressed its hope that the countries will be able to live together in harmony and exchange knowledge.
China will neither move in the past, present or future, nor demand that other countries copy China's practices.
Earlier, Wang Yi, speaking at a meeting with former US Secretary of State Kissinger in New York, said that China-US cooperation would be a win-win, and the opposition would inevitably lose a win-win.
China has always been committed to developing a healthy and stable long-term relationship with the US, achieving conflict-free, mutual respect, cooperation and win-win.
The Chinese government held a press conference on Tuesday to present and explain the facts and positions of China regarding the Chinese-American economic and trade friction.

The nearby airport's high-speed line, the West Nantong station, which connects the country with air traffic, is also a popular destination for many passengers.
Miss Liu from Fujian preparing to travel to the Philippines with her honeymooners from Hong Kong for the Golden Week, she pushed her luggage out of the way, and said to reporters: "I was afraid I wouldn't be able to catch the plane, I didn't think I would be able to do it so quickly, I have time to spare!"
Under the trade agreement's annex, announced Monday, the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain President Trump's ability to implement a 25% tariff threat on imported cars while essentially exempting passenger cars, pickups and auto parts from Canadian and Mexican imports from tariffs.
If Trump imposed a so-called "Chapter 232 tariff" on cars for national security reasons, Mexico and Canada would have a quota of 2.6 million exempt passenger cars to be exported to the United States each year.
According to the accompanying arrangements, the picka produced in both countries will be completely exempt from tariffs.
If Trump imposed tariffs on cars, Mexico would receive a $108 billion annual exemption from auto parts tax quota, and Canada would receive a $32.4 billion quota.
Both quotas are well above the existing production levels of both countries, providing room for growth for exports to both countries.
Reuters Washington/Mexico, September 28 - Mexico said Friday that after days of debate, the administration of US President Trump and Canada are making real efforts to resolve trade policy differences that will lead the outside world to look forward to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a trilateral agreement.
While details are lacking, the above clear progress has been enough to prompt the Mexican and US governments to abruptly stop publishing the text of the bilateral trade agreement, giving Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the US government had made a new counter-proposal to the Canadian government and said he would continue to push all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said the time to submit the text of the bilateral trade agreement to Mexican and U.S. legislation was delayed because of the very serious attempts by the governments of Canada and the United States to reach an agreement.
Gualdo said that in the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a text of a trilateral agreement or whether we have to publish the text of a bilateral agreement.
Gualdo said that his U.S. and Canadian counterparts, Liu, specifically asked Liu to delay the publication of the text.
A spokesman for the USTR has not commented on the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement and the US-Canada consultations.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
According to foreign media, two young lions playing together in a nursing home outside the South African capital, Pretoria, are hard to spot, but they are not alone.
The University of Pretoria announced: "This is the first ever artificial insemination of a young lion - the world's first pair of lions".
Scientists at the university are working on the reproductive system of the African lion mother.
Ganswint, director of the University of Pretoria's Institute of Mammals, said the two young lions, born on August 25, were both healthy and normal.
His team finally achieved this breakthrough after 18 months of intensive testing.
Ganswint said in a press interview: "We're getting sperm from a healthy male lion.
The researchers then performed artificial insemination for the hormone, when the levels of the female lion were adequate.
Gunswitt says: "I'm glad the results were successful.
He said that the researchers had tried the pump several times, but surprisingly, it didn't take much effort.
He said the previous study broke the re-verifiability test and scientists hope to use this technology to save endangered large cat species.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature notes that lions have become extinct in 26 countries in Africa, with the total number of wild lions surviving declining by 43% over the past 20 years to around 20,000.
The African lion is listed as endangered by the organization.
Ganswint says: "Oh, if we don't do something about these animals, they're going to end up in the wild".
He said the new technology does not have to feed the lion, but only inject sperm into the body of a fertile female lion, as in the North American and European approaches to captive elephants.
South Korea's September export decline was the biggest in more than two years, but analysts blame the decline on fewer working days, and say global demand for South Korean goods remains strong despite rising trade tensions between China and the US.
Indeed, South Korea's exports have increased monthly.
In addition, earlier release of initial data showed a double-digit increase in exports in the first weeks of September before long holidays.
South Korea's September export comparative decline was the largest since July 2016, a decline greater than the 5.7% decline forecast by 11 analysts in the Reuters survey.
The initial figures released on Monday showed that US$50.6 billion of exports in September were below US$51.2 billion in August.
Despite concerns that the escalating U.S.-China trade dispute could also lead to other Chinese neighbors who depend on exports being hit, South Korea's exports to China grew by 7.8% in September, its 23rd consecutive month of expansion.
South Korean exports to the United States fell by 11.8 percent as oil sales fell.
Overseas sales of memory chip and petroleum products in South Korea grew 28.3% and 13.5% respectively, despite concerns that the so-called chip chip chip supercycle cycle may have already peaked.
However, the impact of the trade conflict will be difficult to avoid, as South Korea's exports are largely dependent on the US and Chinese markets.
Imports fell 2.1 percent to $40.8 billion, down from a growth of 3.1 percent predicted by Reuters.
The trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that the global manufacturing industry will continue to thrive, thanks to the US and EU countries, which is a positive factor for South Korean exports.
The statement noted that the increase in export prices caused by the rise in the price of crude oil will also benefit exports in the second half of this year.
The US-China trade conflict, coupled with the increased market volatility following the US rate hike, has been a negative pressure on exports.
The average weekday export in September increased to $2.6 billion, to $2.1 billion in August.
This year, the Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26, so there are only 19.5 working days in September, four fewer than the same period last year.
South Korean exports in September grew by 4.7% compared to the same period last year.
According to the Japan/Markit Procurement Managers Index, manufacturing activity in South Korea picked up in September, but was supported by domestic orders as orders from China and Japan fell, which may cloud the prospects for other exports.
North Korean media criticizes US failure to relax sanctions
North Korea's Workers' News reported a signed commentary on September 30 that criticized the United States for not relaxing sanctions on the country while seeking dialogue with the North, saying it was a self-contradictory practice.
The article said that US Secretary of State Pompeo on 14 said that the key to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the implementation of the sanctions clause against North Korea, stressing the United States' continued unchanged stance on the implementation of the UN sanctions resolution.
In a joint statement from the United States and the Republic of Korea in Singapore, the two sides pledged to establish a new North American relationship that would be in line with the aspirations of the people of the two countries to peaceful prosperity.
The US has increased pressure on sanctions and demands for dialogue, which is undoubtedly contradictory.
The article said that if new relations with the North and the United States are to be established, if a permanent peace settlement is to be established on the Korean Peninsula, and if the Korean Peninsula is to be completely denuclearized, then trust-building should come first, starting with what can be done, and resolved step by step.
The article also said that the US should understand that sanctions imposed on North Korea are not effective.
The article says that even the North Devensk, which preceded the tank landing, has made the U.S. Army applaud.
The National Interest magazine quoted the US Navy as saying: "We will encounter a powerful potential adversary. Just look at the North Devensk submarine".
The U.S. Navy's Commander-in-Chief in the European Union, Fogo, also praised the submarine North Devensk.
He said: "The submarine is impressive. Look at the development of the Russian Navy, how it uses resources, and the main effort it is doing in research and development is first and foremost to strengthen the submarine fleet".
But the National Interest Magazine still believes that the United States maintains its advantage over Russia in this area.
Fogo said: "I believe that the West still has an asymmetrical advantage".
Earlier, it was reported that the Russian Navy will be equipped with the tank tank tank tank tank in 2019.
The new Siberian submarine, the Krasnoyarsk submarine, the Alhangelsk submarine, the newly developed M-class, with a discharge of 13,800 tons, a depth of 520 meters, a crew of 64, a cruising speed of 31 knots, will carry torpedoes, torpedoes and torpedoes and a torpedo.

This is his first time at the forum.
Ignore the threat from the United States!
EU or Iran to reach an agreement on crude oil
The US government announced in November that it would resume a new round of sanctions against Iran and even urged other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
The US allies, however, seem to have not listened.
According to the New York Times, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed in an interview on 29 May that despite the threat of sanctions from the United States against any country doing business with Iran, Tehran is close to reaching an agreement with the EU on the sale of crude oil.
The central purpose of the agreement was to try to establish a new payment mechanism, which would replace dollar transactions in e-currency or in fiat currency.
The goal of this approach is to try to circumvent the United States and prevent the United States from obstructing financial transfers.
Meanwhile, while the EU is working to push for the deal, some French and British officials also fear that if it is achieved, it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the US against the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal.
According to the US media, Zarif's words in the hour-long interview sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
The deal is effective in disrupting the US' attempts to cut Iranian revenue, as it has the potential to strip away the traditional allies of the US.
The deal will ensure that we sell oil and profit from it. According to Zarif, countries have a legal right to trade with Iran under the 2015 agreement.
Federica Mogherini, EU foreign policy chief, said that no sovereign nation or organization can accept others to decide who it can trade with.
However, she also predicted that before the next round of sanctions was imposed by the US government in November, US leaders could take a series of financial measures aimed at banks, businessmen and countries that do business with Tehran.
In May, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds of the defect in the deal, saying that it could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US subsequently threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other commodities from operating in the US.
The threat has led some companies to evacuate Tehran and the Iranian currency has plunged.
Airlines and French oil giant Daimler have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said the US government could take over the wind.
However, according to a recent Turkish media report, the US sanctions do not appear to have had a significant impact on Iranian oil exports.
Iran's oil minister Zanganeh Jayev said that no country except South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani both believe that the US has committed a series of acts to seduce Iran into breaking the agreement.
Zarif was also dismayed by a series of verbal attacks by the US, and when asked whether the US would overthrow the current Iranian government under increasing financial pressure, he even laughed, saying that it was a regime change strategy, which was the real purpose of the US.
The opening of the Cultural Tourism Market at the Huri Mountain Artillery Station in Xiamen
The first broadcaster in Mandarin Chinese to broadcast on Fujian's front line radio station in that year, Chen Feifei, the old man, came to the artillery to recall the history of the artillery.

In order to further encourage foreign investors to invest in China, the four ministries, including the Ministry of Finance of China, issued a joint notification that, as of January 1, 2018, the scope of the pre-tax policy for domestic direct investment, which does not impose a temporary deduction on foreign investment, will be extended from foreign investment incentive projects to all projects and fields where foreign investment is not prohibited.
The Ministry of Finance website published a notice saying that foreign investors are exempted from the pre-tax on their earnings for a period of time and that several conditions must be met at the same time, including direct investment by foreign investors to distribute profits, including beneficial investments by foreign investors to distribute profits, such as new construction, acquisition of shares, but excluding new growth, conversion, acquisition of shares of public companies (except for eligible strategic investments).

The National Health and Safety Council (NHSC) reports that the incidence of malnutrition among teenagers and young children in China has decreased compared to decades ago, while the incidence of obesity has increased significantly.
Experts note that maintaining a healthy weight is the most important idea, and the most important is to cure diseases, promote scientific fitness, and promote healthy eating.
According to the National Health Commission's recent release of the Chinese Youth Health Education Core Information and Explanation (2018): The key to maintaining a healthy weight is a healthy diet and scientific exercise.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are all bad for health.
The health risks of obesity should not be overlooked.
Deng Xiaoping, director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Office of Nutrition and Health, said that being overweight is harmful to the normal growth and development of adolescents, adversely affecting their psychological, behavioral, cognitive and intellectual development, and even leads to high blood pressure, hyperglycemia, and high blood fat in children.
At the same time, teenagers who are overweight are prone to prolonging into adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes and other diseases in adolescents later in life.
Deng Xiaoping said that the 2010-2012 nutrition and health status of Chinese residents showed that China's children aged 6-17 years had a 9.6% overweight rate, and a 6.4% obesity rate, which is 16%.
At the same time, childhood adolescents are more obese than girls, and the prevalence of obesity in urban areas has increased significantly in recent decades.
How do teenagers cope with being overweight?
Zhang Zhang, deputy director of the National Sports Centre's Center for Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion Research, noted that the main cause of teenage obesity is excessive heat intake and lack of physical activity.
For this simple obesity, scientific exercise and reasonable dietary control should be the focus.
Zhang Yi pointed out that maintaining a healthy weight is the most important concept of curing untreated diarrhea, and that an important part of this is the comprehensive comprehensive education of schools, parents and students, the spread of the dangers of overweight and obesity, and the promotion of prevention awareness among adolescents.
Adolescents should have regular physical examinations, monitoring of growth and development indicators such as height and weight, and early detection of overweight and obesity in order to take timely interventions.
For adolescents who are already overweight, Deng Xiaoping recommends that, in addition to the active scientific planning of diet and exercise, adolescents in a special physiological stage should avoid using hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and reduce weight, and avoid taking weight loss medications blindly.
Reuters - Facebook (FB.O) said Friday that the hackers' theft of digital login codes that allowed them access to nearly 50 million user accounts, involving an unprecedented security breach, was its worst ever.
Facebook has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, saying it has not been determined whether the attackers abused any accounts or stole personal information.
The company has not found the location of the hackers, nor is it certain whether the hackers targeted specific victims.
The initial analysis showed that this was a large-scale attack.
In a press conference, CEO Zuckerberg said the scandal was serious.
A spokesman for the company said his account and that of Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg were also affected.
Facebook shares fell 2.6 percent on Friday, dragging down the main Wall Street index.
US lawmakers said Friday that the attack could increase the outcry about data privacy legislation.
This is another sad piece of evidence that Congress needs to take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users, Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, said in a statement.
Federal Trade Commission Commissioner Rohit Chopra tweeted that he hoped to get an answer on Reuters' reporting of the security breach.
The Chinese government has declared that the fifth martyrs' day in China is September 30.
On such a special day, members of the family of the Chinese Resistance Veterans, representatives of the MEK Party, representatives of the Hunan Veterans' Houses, and others from all walks of life came to the Yangtze Chinese Resistance Garden in Yangtze, Yangtze, to attend the 2018 Memorial Day mass burial ceremony, to send the 10 Resistance Veterans and their companions to four Resistance Veterans.
The Chinese resistance veterans were witnesses of the Chinese resistance, a real, vivid, vivid teaching material for patriotism.
Former Vice President of Hunan Provincial Political Council, Liu Xia said that the courage of the veterans of the resistance and the unflinching patriotism of my spirit are a precious spiritual treasure for the contemporary nation.
In a speech, Jiang Jun, Vice-President of the Yangtze Municipal Council, Chairman of the Yangtze Municipal Commission, noted that in recent years, the Yangtze Resistance Veterans Care Program, which provides care services to Resistance Veterans in the form of life support, free pensions, free burials, has become an excellent brand in the service of the people and society of Yangtze.

At 11 a.m., the crowd stood in the middle of a solemn and heavy music.
The Chinese ceremony team members, dressed in dresses, held in flowers, and at a neat pace, sent 10 resistance veterans and four resistance veterans' companions in a neat line.
The crowd was filled with children and people who were attending the event and paid tribute to the heroes of the war.
The first national war-themed mausoleum was built in 2014 by the Ming Chengsha Municipal Commission and the Hunan Chinese War-themed garden, created jointly by the Chinese War-themed garden in Guangzhou and the Chinese War-themed garden in Hunan.
The first phase of the project covers over 2000 square meters and consists of the monument to the Immortal Heroes of Liu, the Victory Square of Liu, the Lu and the Heroes of the Resistance.
The Mausoleum of the Heroes of the Resistance of the Song provided a free cemetery for the heroes of the Song Dynasty, and was hailed as the last military camp of the Song Dynasty.

Since 2015, the site has hosted seven mass burials of Resistance veterans, and 102 Resistance veterans and their companions have been laid to rest.
The newly revised Shiang-Tang-Gyeong-Liang Waterway Hub navigation schedule (shortly known as Shiang-Tang) officially began to be implemented on October 1, and the Shiang Liang aircraft was officially unified with Shiang after two years of flight testing.
On the first day of implementation of the new regulations, the waterways of the Three Gorges-Guzhou River are in good order.
The Changjiang Shandong Shipping Administration released its first safety inspection plan on September 30, 21 and carried out a safety inspection of 160 vessels, with a total of 124 vessels qualifying for safety inspection.
On October 1, 14 the aviation department arranged the first filtering program after the new regulations were implemented.
Once the new regulations are implemented, the safety inspection plan is published at 9 a.m. and 21 p.m. daily, and the filtering plan is published at 14 p.m. and 20 p.m. daily, making it easier for ships to flexibly arrange filtering plans.
The Regulation of the Ship's Filtering Scheme has added the principle of filtering of ships classifying the controlled Ship's filters, which clarifies the priority of the filtering of ships according to the positioning of the hull and lifting craft functions respectively, and adjusts the filtering of shortline passenger ships to the same priority grade as the demonstration ship and the integrity ship.
This is the second year of the lifting aircraft's operation, and the official alignment with the boat's hull.
The first time the large-length demonstration vessels and new energy-powered vessels in the Kauai and Three Gorges basin have been given priority status.
At the same time, the Zhongshan Shipping Schedule will adjust the water management of the Zhongshan Shipping Schedule from the previous 180 km near Zhongshan water to the 541.8 km water of the Yangtze River Bridge to the Chongshan River Bridge in Dongshan, and divide the Zhongshan Core Water, the Zhongshan Water, the Control Water, the Zhongshan Water Schedule.
The move is in favour of ships choosing the right water to dock and reducing the amount of storage in the dock area.
The Commission also proposed integrity-based measures such as cancellation of declarations of violations of the Code, delayed filtering 24 hours, and other measures based on existing characteristics of filtering and waiting for filtering.
After the water accumulation of the Three Gorges, the conditions of the Ku Zhong shipping were improved, which promoted the rapid development of the Yangtze shipping.
Data shows that the annual shipment of Trigonegro and Gyatso-Gyatso-Gyatso-Gyatso-Gyatso has increased from 34.3 million tonnes in 2004 to 138 million tonnes and 140 million tonnes in 2017, respectively.

In September, China's overall PMI ratio rose, while the PMI ratio in manufacturing fell.
The figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China on 30 September show that the overall output of the Chinese PMI in September was 54.1%, 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points higher than the previous month and yearly averages, indicating that the overall production and operations of Chinese enterprises remained stable.
The manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which comprise the Comprehensive PMI Output Index, were 53.0% and 54.9% respectively, down one litre from the previous month.
The Chinese manufacturing industry's PMI was 50.8%, down 0.5 percentage points.
The Chinese government has also announced that the manufacturing PMI for the month will be characterized by five main aspects:
The first is the general stability of the manufacturing industry.
Of the 21 industries surveyed, 14 have a PMI in the expansion zone, with manufacturing such as pharmaceuticals, specialty equipment, electrical machinery and equipment having a higher operating level and a faster growth rate of 53.5%.
The second is a small fluctuation in supply and demand.
Production and new orders were 53.0% and 52.0%, respectively, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, while supply and demand remained in a downward trend, but expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and import index were 48.0% and 48.5%, respectively, down 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points from the previous month, respectively, and both fell to year-on-year lows.
Four, increasing the cost of raw materials purchases for enterprises.
The price index for imported and exported raw materials was 59.8%, up 1.1 percentage points from the previous month, and 54.3% from the previous month.
Five: large enterprises are operating steadily and small businesses continue to improve their operating conditions.
The medium-sized enterprise PMI of 52.1% is flat with the previous month, which has been in the expansion range of 52.0% and above since this year, and the production index and the new order index ring ratio have both improved this month, which is the main driver of the manufacturing industry to keep expanding; the medium-sized enterprise PMI of 48.7% is below the previous month's 1.7 percentage points and is in the contraction range; the small enterprise PMI of 50.4% is above the previous month's 0.4% and has risen for two consecutive months.
The non-manufacturing business activity index in China was 54.9% in the same month, up 0.7 percentage points from the previous month, and rose for two consecutive months.
The Chinese government has also been critical of the development of the non-manufacturing sector.
The index of business activity in the sectors of road transport, securities, real estate and others remains below critical points, and the total number of businesses has decreased.
Reuters News Agency (REUTERS) - The president of the Central Bank of Japan, Heda Toriyama, said on Monday that the central bank was aware that the long-term implementation of excessive monetary easing could squeeze interest rates on financial institutions and could undermine the stability of the country's banking system.
But he said that given the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Japanese central bank needs to maintain its massive stimulus program while closely monitoring the benefits of its policies.
The central bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under the ongoing monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected, Hideyoshi Hideyoshi said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions took more risks to compensate for the effects of the decline in interest rates caused by years of low interest rates, the banking system could become unstable once there is a serious negative shock.
He said that while the risks are not significant at present, the central bank will be closely monitoring developments and encouraging financial institutions to take the necessary measures.
The minutes of the meeting of the Central Bank of Japan, which were released earlier on Monday, show that at the September meeting of the Central Bank of Japan Policy Committee, the cost of long-term easing policies was discussed.
The meeting records show that a member said that if the economy continues to expand, the Bank of Japan will have more room for policy flexibility in the future.
The meeting records show that another member said that given the limitations of the policy duration, the committee should discuss how long the central bank of Japan can sustain the policy of stimulus.
Heida Toriyama said the central bank would assess the financial risks of the easing policy, while also considering the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic outlook, which could affect global demand due to China-US trade friction and rising protectionism.
The impact of such issues on the Japanese economy is temporarily limited, said Hideyoshi.
The impact on the Japanese economy could be greater, he added.
The need for a strong monetary easing policy to be pursued continuously while considering the positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner, said Hideyuki Tan.
Despite the growing disadvantages of the radical stimulus program, such as the long-term low interest rate erosion of financial institutions' profits, low inflation forced the Japanese central bank to maintain the program.
The Japanese central bank last month maintained monetary policy; in the face of the risks posed by the end of the global trade war, Hideyoshi Toriyama ruled out the possibility of a recent rate hike.
On June 1, 2018, the company's logo was displayed on Cardiff, Tesla, and Tesla electric vehicles in the United States.
Under a settlement, Tesla and its executive chairman Musk agreed to pay a $20 million fine to the financial regulators, and Musk will resign as chairman of the company but remain as CEO.
The settlement will be the culmination of two months of unrest for Tesla.
The SEC's disclosure of the securities fraud allegations settlement agreement on Saturday will bring investors to their senses.
Investors feared the protracted legal battle would only further hurt the company, which is still losing electric vehicles.
The SEC on Thursday sued Musk for fraud, saying his tweet on August 7 misled investors.
The Twitter post said he was considering privatizing Tesla at $420 per share and had received funding.
The SEC said the tweets were baseless and that the market turmoil they triggered hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the deal could boost Tesla, which has been hit hard by Musk's recent actions.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common's asset management, said the settlement should have more oversight of Musk, while not taking any destructive measures to drive him out of Tesla's pipeline.
The asset management company owns shares in Panasonic, a battery manufacturer of Tesla.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to regulate Musk's communications with the outside world.
The matter was quickly resolved on the terms agreed to in accordance with our market and in the best interests of our investors, including Tesla shareholders", SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
The accusations on Thursday led to a $7 billion volatility in Tesla's market cap, which was $45.2 billion on Friday, down from $47.5 billion for General Motors.
The SEC withdrew the request in the settlement to remove Musk from the company's position as head of the company.
Many investors say the punishment will be catastrophic.
I think this is the best possible outcome for all involved, says Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a neutral rating and called the SEC's punishment for Musk a "light penalty".
He is still the CEO of Tesla, and it is important to him.
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement agreement, nor immediately responded to a request for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
Beijing Morning News (PK) Beijing Morning News reported that one of the core buildings of the Beijing World Parks and Recreation Park in 2019 - Beijing World Parks and Recreation Park - will be the first to use a multi-colored ETFE puzzle film structure, with a 5440 square meter film structure that will be presented in six colors: deep red, deep green, orange, blue, red, green, and a butterfly-winged pattern under the pull of the Lasso steel wire.
According to Zhang Bao, project manager of Beijing Construction Group, the construction area of the arena is 4,500 square meters, with a total installed steel capacity of 1,182 tons, and the steel roof is supported by a 26 ton suspension steel trellis, with a butterfly-shaped winged shaped under the drawing of the Lhasa steel wire.

According to figures released by the head of the country's disaster management department, Wilem Rampangilei, at midnight on 29th, the number of deaths from the powerful earthquake and tsunami in the province of Sulawesi, Indonesia, has risen to 420.
The official said that this was only statistics from the city of Palou, the capital of Central Sulawesi, not including the region of Sigi and the surrounding region of Tangara, where the earthquake struck, as the two regions are still disconnected and have not received reports of casualties.
Many roads in the city of Pallu were severely damaged, heavy machinery was difficult to access, and search and rescue efforts were very difficult.

Xi Jinping's speech at the conference on private enterprise was a keynote address that instilled strong confidence in the private sector's move towards a broader stage.
Xi Jinping stressed that the idea of letting entrepreneurs unpack their ideas and move forward with light weight has sparked a strong resentment among large entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
The dynamics of the market come from people, especially entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the 40 years of reform and opening up, tens of millions of entrepreneurs have created stories of innovation, the growth of entrepreneurship and the continuing growth of the Chinese economy.
For some time now, people in the community have been making negative, skeptical comments about the private economy.
The so-called 'private economy off the ground' theory, the 'new public-private partnership theory' theory, and other misconceptions have raised concerns and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private companies have encountered many difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment affect some exporting companies; rapid adjustment of demand structures leads to transformational upgrading pressures; some policies are not coordinated, the effects of policies overlap, or the way of working is simple, leading to some good policies having the opposite effect, etc.
The government has also been criticized for its lack of support for the government's efforts to reduce the number of people living in poverty.
In this context, correcting misconceptions about understanding, undoing the businessman's ideas, keeping businesses focused on development, government focused on promoting development, and addressing market confidence and development expectations are of particular practical significance.
The meeting again highlighted the three important conclusions that have not changed: the status and role of the non-public economy in our country's economic and social development has not changed!
From the deep promotion of the right to ease of doing business, the establishment of a list of powers to the creation of a rule of law environment that protects the legitimate interests of entrepreneurs, creating a fair competitive market environment, shaping an atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs throughout society, the importance of the Party's central and institutional guarantees to entrepreneurs has been unmatched in recent years.
The talks were also about strong policy initiatives to support the development of private enterprises in six areas, and about a series of practical actions aimed at easing the burden on private enterprises.
These are great encouragements to the entrepreneurial community and give more hope to the whole society.
The fog is off, the direction is set, the key is to implement.
To continuously create a better environment for the private economy, to help private enterprises solve development difficulties, to help achieve China's economic transformation and upgrade; to make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, secure in legitimate operations, respected in social life, and stimulate innovation vitality and creative potential.
The Chinese economy is entering a process of high-quality development that requires more entrepreneurs to show their ambition and provides greater space and stage for entrepreneurs to play creatively.
We have reason to believe that with further deepening of reforms and breaking down barriers, the private sector economy will open up better development prospects and opportunities for development and move towards a broader stage.

South Korea's exports to China last year amounted to US$10,033.99 million, weighing 218,59 million kg, up 2,094% and 3668.8% respectively from 2013.
The analysis suggests that the increase in sales of Korean soybeans in China is linked to the increase in the number of empty nesting youths driving convenience food heating and the increased attention of young people to nutritious meals.
As of this year, Chinese households have surpassed 200 million households, which is expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020, and local food companies have been targeting the introduction of various convenience foods by the Han Chinese.
In addition, the analysis also said that avian influenza is the biggest barrier to entry into the mainland Chinese market.
A bird flu outbreak in South Korea from November 2016 to April last year led to a total ban on imports of the species to China, which led to a sharp decline in exports.
In 2016, Chinese exports to China amounted to $840,000, and last year, due to avian influenza, exports plummeted to $100,000.

US warships once again approaching the South China Sea reef
US officials on Sunday (September 30, 2018) revealed that the US Navy destroyer USS Decatur was entering the waters near Beijing on the eve of the Chinese National Day of the Eleventh Republic, claiming sovereign South Sea islands.
According to the Central Intelligence Agency's Comprehensive Foreign Telegraph report on 30 May, U.S. officials, who were asked to remain anonymous, revealed that the U.S. destroyer USS Decatur had entered the southern shores of the Nassau Islands, Gaven Reef and Johnson Reef, within 12 nautical miles.

Reuters Washington, Nov 5 - The United States re-launched sanctions on Iran's oil and financial industry on Monday, increasing pressure on Iran to limit Iran's missile and nuclear programs and curb Iran's growing military and political influence in the Middle East.
The move will restore the sanctions lifted by the United States under the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and add 300 new sanctions to Iran's oil, shipping, insurance and banking industries.
The details of the sanctions will be announced at a press conference at 1330 GMT by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasurer Steven Mnuchin.
The United States said it would temporarily allow eight importing countries to continue to buy Iranian oil, including major buyers of Iranian oil such as China, India, South Korea, Japan and Turkey, to ensure that crude oil prices remain stable.
U.S. officials said the countries would put the money paid to Iran in a hosted account.

National Flag Raising Ceremony Celebrated on the Chinese River at the mouth of the Trans-Myanmar border
I can't imagine a flag-raising ceremony so spectacular on the border that it is more shocking than watching the flags being raised on the mainland.
On the morning of the 1st, Mr. Zhang, who came from Sichuan to visit the mouth of the Yunnan River on the Chinese border, and more than 500 troop officers, residents and foreign tourists from China watched the flag-raising ceremony to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The Riverside Port is the largest port in Yunnan, a province of Yunnan, located in the Red River province of Yunnan, facing the river from the Old Town of Vietnam.
As the construction of the National Belt and Road Bridge continues to deepen, the flow of imports and exports from the river to the port has steadily increased as one of the easiest ways to connect China to Southeast Asia.
At 7:30 a.m. that morning, the sun had just risen, and the border area near the river's mouth had gathered early to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 7:45 p.m., the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the guards of the National Guard at the mouth of the river checked the flag.
After the commander had reached the flag lifting command, the flag-raising arm pulled out an arc, and the bright five-star red flag, like the wings of the Yangtze, was generally stretched out on the flag, accompanied by the country's vibrant and powerful melody.
The Chinese celebration of the national flag at important times such as New Year's Day, Spring Festival, and National Day of China is not only a symbol of China but also a symbol of patriotism among the people of the border region.
The official of the ceremonial squad that participated in the flag-raising ceremony said:
The National Guard, which is responsible for the ceremonial flag-raising ceremony at the mouth of the river, is composed of more than 40 officers from various positions at the border control stations, ranging from a three-person flag-raising group to a large-scale military task force, which has had a history of more than 60 years and has carried out over 70 foreign military missions at the national level since its formation.
The revised Personal Income Tax Law changes the tax rate for taxpayers in China from one year to 183 days.
The relevant officials from the Ministry of Finance and the National Tax Administration of China said on 30 May that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing to provide preferential arrangements for people abroad, including those in Hong Kong.
The official said that the current regulations on the implementation of the personal income tax law provide special preferences for foreigners in the matter of taxation, and that individuals who have no residence in China but have lived for more than five years and whose income originates outside China can only pay personal income tax on part of the income paid by the Chinese unit or individuals.
The Chinese government has also announced that the Chinese government will pay no personal income tax on foreign payments.
The Ministry of Finance, the National Tax Administration, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Commerce also issued notices that extending the scope of the pre-tax policy to foreign investors to distribute profits to direct investment is temporarily excluded.
The profits distributed to foreign investors from resident enterprises in China for domestic direct investment are subject to the temporary exemption from the pre-taxation income tax policy, and the scope of the program extends from foreign investment encouragement to all non-prohibited projects and fields of foreign investment.
During the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, positive messages were released around the Korean Peninsula issue.
President Moon Jin-hee reiterated North Korea's irreversible nuclear-armed resolve and said that U.S. President Trump and North Korea's top leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of the year.
The State Department later said Secretary of State Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to push for the implementation of the Singapore summit pledge by the US leader.
From the beginning of this year to the present, the North has broken the ice to open the path of dialogue, the leaders of the North and the United States have held meetings, the great trend of calm in the peninsula continues, and the principle of dialogue to solve the peninsula issue must also be upheld.
First, the essence of the issue of the Peninsula is that the security issue is the same, and the key is to achieve peace on the peninsula, and the balance is to resolve the legitimate security concerns of the parties, rather than one side pressing the other side, one side stressing their demands.
Second, in the dialogue on the desertification of the peninsula, there was disagreement on the steps and ways to achieve the desertification of the peninsula, and the long-standing lack of political trust between the North and the United States has left the debate about who came first and who came after.
At the Security Council's public meeting on the Korean Peninsula in New York, the two sides' voices on the issue of sanctions against the DPRK were again emphasized that the two points on the peninsula remain unchanged.
US Secretary of State Pompeo insists that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula is completely denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov stressed the principle of action-based response to the nuclear crisis, noting that the weakening trend in the sanctions should be in line with the pace of North Korea's gradual abandonment of its nuclear path.
There is no doubt that all parties concerned should continue to fully, fully and accurately implement the Security Council resolutions, but pressure is not the goal, the imposition of sanctions and the promotion of political solutions are the requirements of the Security Council resolutions, and neither can be overridden nor elected.
As Chinese State Counsellor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, given the positive progress in North Korean-American relations, China believes it is necessary for the Security Council to consider the timely introduction of irreversible provisions to encourage North Korea and all parties involved to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
In retrospect, every step in the process of denuclearization and peace in the peninsula requires sufficient political courage from all sides.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community to promote political settlement of the peninsula, all parties concerned should show political resilience, make political decisions, implement commitments, solve problems, continue to move forward, and move forward with the process of denuclearization of the peninsula and the establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula, jointly for the establishment of permanent peace on the peninsula.
The People's Government of Ji County, Linchuan, Shaanxi, reported on 1 January that during the National Day of the People, the Yellow River Gorge Falls in the county will remain relatively high and will not be open to the public.
To ensure security, the attractions will be temporarily closed during National Day.
Yellow River Falls is the second largest waterfall in China and the largest in the world.
The Yellow River flows up to this place, and the stone walls are erected on both sides. The river mouth closes like a mouth, forming a thousand miles of Yellow River.
According to the reporter, every June-October is the Yellow River Pond season, starting on July 12, 2018, due to the high water level of the Yellow River, the Shaanxi Yellow River Pond area began to be closed continuously, so the closure of the Pond area has accumulated for almost a month.
Liu Feng, the chief engineer of the Yangtze Scenic Area Management Committee, told the media that this was the longest continuation of the Yellow River high water level in nearly 20 years, and the shutdown was not so long before the dam in 2017.
It is understood that the Shaanxi Huang River Gorge Falls Scenic Area was originally set to host the 11th Golden Week of the Yangtze River, and personnel arrangements have been increased in advance, as well as vehicle maintenance and even temporary staffing.
According to the official telegram of the Office of the General Command for the Prevention of Yellow River Flood and Drought, the announcement of the Yellow River Flood during the National Day of the Republic of China indicates that the Yellow River Flood work is required in Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Nam Mong, Shaanxi, Hsinchu, Henan, and Shandong Provinces during the National Day of China.
Currently, the flow of the Yellow River drainage is greater, upstream flow is maintained at 2000-3000 cubic meters per second, middle flow is maintained at 2500-3500 cubic meters per second, and downstream flow is maintained at 3000 cubic meters per second.
Health centers and health stations to provide flu vaccination services especially during the Holidays
The Health Department has ordered 150,000 doses of the 2018-2019 four-price flu vaccine, which is currently being given free vaccination to high-risk people, to facilitate the vaccination of residents during holidays, and the health department has provided vaccination services to health centers and health stations, especially on the National Day of the Year (October 1 and 2) from 9 am to 1 pm.
In addition to the above measures, the health authorities have extended the hours of the flu vaccination service from Monday to Friday to 8 p.m. since the launch of the plan, and as of September 30, at 4 p.m., 4,158 people have been vaccinated, up from 3,714 in the same period last year.
The free vaccination targeted include Macau residents: 6 months to 18 years of age, 50 years and older, pregnant women, all chronically ill patients, including obese people (i.e. body mass index (BMI) of 30 or older), and daycare, kindergartens, kindergartens, primary and secondary school staff, all health workers, and Macau residents working at casinos.
At the same time, the Health Service will actively contact other persons who are deemed to be vaccinated, including the public sector, after obtaining a list of relevant bodies and arranging vaccinations by the health center.
To facilitate vaccination and reduce the time it takes to vaccinate, the Department of Health will send healthcare workers to primary, secondary, kindergarten and kindergarten schools in Australia to collectively vaccinate infants, middle and high school students, teachers and staff, and will also arrange for collective vaccination in senior citizens' and disabled homes, public sector or other institutions, among others, between October and December this year.
Students and young children who have not received the vaccination can be vaccinated at the Inns of Court or at the health centre from 3 December 2018 with a resident ID card, Health Service user card, flu vaccination card (if any), student ID, employee ID or professional proof of employment.
The Health Service reminds residents that people who were vaccinated against influenza between September 2017 and August 2018 and who were vaccinated against influenza between September 2017 and 2018 will still need a new seasonal influenza vaccine in September 2018, as the influenza antigen composition of the 2018-2019 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine has been updated, targeting the Northern Hemisphere's 2018-2019 winter and 2019 summer seasonal influenza.
The peak flu season in Macau usually occurs between 1 and March each year, later than in temperate regions (such as northern China and Japan), and the Health Department urges people at high risk and those in frequent exposure to high risk to get vaccinated as early as possible after infection with influenza, such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese people and chronic patients.

Reuters TOKYO, Oct. 1 - A quarterly report on the short-term survey released by the Japanese central bank on Monday showed that confidence among Japanese large manufacturers in September reached a year-on-year low, as the rising cost of raw materials and a series of natural disasters affected production put pressure on enterprises.
The survey shows little evidence that escalating global trade friction has hurt the confidence of large manufacturers.
However, the risk of a full-scale trade war has hit the business outlook of the company, potentially threatening corporate capital spending.
Active capital spending is a highlight of the Japanese economy.
The survey raises questions about the ECB's view that robust economic expansion will help accelerate inflation to the 2% target, despite signs that businesses are gradually shifting costs to customers.
The confidence of manufacturers has been stagnating due to the slowdown in exports and weak factory production, which has sparked concerns in the global trade war, said Nan Wuji, chief researcher at the China Central Gold Institute in Yangon, China.
The confidence is still high. And as business profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to fall.
Short-term surveys show that the large manufacturing economy judgement index in September has deteriorated for the third consecutive quarter from positive 21 to positive 19 from three months ago.
The market's forecasted average value is positive 22.
The September large non-manufacturing economy assessment index dropped from a positive 24 to a positive 22 in June, deteriorating for the first time in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey is positive 22.
The survey showed that the average of the indicators for the decline of large manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries in December remained stable.
Investors are not interested in the decline in the short-term business economy index, which is the N225 index. The N225 rose to a high of 27 years on Monday, as the continued devaluation of the Japanese business helped improve the export earnings prospects of Japanese companies.
Capital expenditure is stable.
Despite the decline in business confidence, the latest short-term projections highlight the robustness of corporate capital spending plans, driven by capacity renewal and increased investment in robots and automation to address the labor shortages caused by ageing populations.
The Central Bank's short-term survey shows that large enterprises plan to increase capital spending by 13.4% in the current fiscal year ending March 2019.
The previous survey of short-sighted people was 13.6%.
Nan Wuji said that all corporate capital expenditure plans for the fiscal year grew by 8.5 percent, close to the pace of the Japanese bubble.
He said that given the increase in profit forecasts from small businesses, there is still room for further growth in capital expenditure, but this largely depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence.
Short-term surveys show that the ability of companies to shift costs has improved, with the output price index of large enterprises at a positive 7, a high point in a decade, which is an encouraging sign that Japan's efforts to combat deflation have made progress.
The employment rate for large enterprises reached negative 23, the lowest level since 1992, highlighting the employment market tightening.
The Japanese economy has bounced back since the contraction in January this year in the second quarter, benefitting from strong corporate spending.
However, the escalating summer trade friction and disruption of supply chains by natural disasters have clouded the prospects for Japan's export-dependent economy.
In the US, the growth rate of services imports and exports was 16.4%.
The Ministry of Commerce website quoted a head of the Department of Trade and Industry as saying that the total volume of emerging services imports and exports in August exceeded 1 trillion yuan, which is growing faster than the total.
Out of these, emerging services imports and exports totalled 11,383.9 billion yuan, an increase of 20.9%, which is 10.4 percentage points higher than the total growth of services imports and exports, and the emerging services attracted an increase of almost 3 percentage points.
In terms of service exports, service exports continued their rapid growth momentum since 1 August, with exports growing at a rate of 5.7 percentage points higher than imports.
The top three growth areas were telecom computer and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, and insurance services, with growth rates of 61.1% and 38.8% and 26.5% respectively.
The head of the Department of Food and Trade also noted that the share of emerging services imports in August also increased gradually.
From 1 to August, emerging services imports grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6% of service imports, up 1.6 percentage points from the same period last year.
The growth rate of imports of financial services, IPR, telecommunications computers and information services was more than 20%, at 47.1%, 23.3% and 23.2%, respectively.

They also sent their blessings to China, to the Chinese people.
I think China is one of the most fascinating cultures and civilizations in the world, and I wish for a longer and prosperous friendship between China and the UAE in the future.
Congratulations to all Chinese people, because you are great.
I have been working in China and you have helped me and I hope you are well.
Make the world a better place, just like you are doing now.
When I meet new Polish friends and tell them I'm learning Chinese, they'll say you must be working hard to get it right.
In fact, that's what happened, and China has been developing particularly well in recent years, which makes me happy.
Happy Chinese National Day!

The 69th International Space Congress opens in Germany - China New Network
The 69th International Space Conference was held in the Vienna International Space Expo Center in Germany on October 1, with more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and businesses, experts and young students from all over the world attending.
In a speech at the opening ceremony, the International Space Federation President, Jean-Yves Legali, said that global space affairs are no longer limited to a few countries and institutions, with a significant increase in attendance this year compared to the previous one, indicating that more and more institutions and people are joining them.
He called on all countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation and to promote the development of space.
Zhang Jun, Deputy Minister of Industry and Information at the Ministry of Industry and Information, Director of the National Space Agency, presented China's space program during the exchange, and said that China will expand international cooperation in space to contribute to human space affairs.
Representatives of China Space Technology Group, China Space Technology Group and other relevant organizations, as well as some private companies, presented the latest achievements in China's space, including launching rockets, satellites and space technology applications.
The International Space Congress, held annually since 1950, is the largest event in the world aviation community.
The five-day conference was jointly organized by the International Space Federation, the International Academy of Space Sciences, the Center for Applied Technology and Microgravity Research at the University of Bologna, and the International Space Law Society.
Reuters Beijing, Nov. 5 - A press release released by the China Foreign Trade Center on Sunday said that the GCC shows that China's foreign trade situation remains complex and dire, with 80.6% of enterprises expecting exports to be better or even better in 2018.
However, given the continuing rise in the cost of domestic raw materials, the cost of integrated elements such as labour, and the increased external environment affected by China-US trade friction, the exhibitors also felt that the export situation for next year was not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th GCC, the GCC Deputy Secretary-General, Press Spokesperson, and Vice Director of the China Foreign Trade Center Xu Xiao said that the number of foreign buyers to the GCC meeting and the export exchanges were relatively small.
The number of buyers attending the meeting was 189,812, representing 215 countries and regions, a decrease of 1.11%.
Exports were reported at RMB 206494 billion (US$29.860 million), down 1% from the previous year.
In terms of market share, the volume of exports to Japan, ASEAN, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, and other countries, and other countries, and the United States, and other countries increased by 74.4% and the same-three percent, and other countries, respectively, respectively, and 7.3% and 7.3% and 7.3% respectively, respectively, respectively.
In terms of industry, transportation tools, mechanical equipment, building and decoration materials, electronic consumer and information products, toilet equipment grew by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1% and 7.6%, respectively, while textile clothing and household appliances declined by 13.0% and 6.7%, respectively.
Xu Xiao said that as a sign of the weather and wind direction of China's foreign trade, the attitudes of the GCC's purchasers and exports showed that China's foreign trade development in the coming year is still facing many uncertain uncertain factors.
However, with the profound advancement of structural reforms on the supply side and the recent introduction of policies such as the introduction of the Zhengzhou Stainless Steel and other measures in countries and regions, the new dynamics of China's foreign trade development are building up, and the diversification of enterprise markets is making new advances, which are important foundations and strong conditions for foreign trade development.
The overall Chinese external trade imports and exports are expected to remain steady throughout the year, with further improvements in quality and efficiency.
China's General Customs Administration (GCC) announced that US-dollar exports grew 14.5% in September, imports grew 14.3% in September, and trade surpluses in September were $31.690 billion, the highest since February.
Despite the escalating China-US trade friction, China's export performance in September was still well above expectations, and the booming foreign demand, the overlapping of the yuan exchange rate devaluation or the main supporting factors before the US imposed tariffs, showed some degree of China's resilience in foreign trade, but the impact of the Chinese-American trade war on confidence, the impact on the industrial chain, and analysts believe that China's foreign trade challenges may manifest themselves in the fourth quarter or next year.
Reuters' investigation showed that the US fund manager suggested increasing cash holdings in September, and continued to maintain a cautious stance as the US and China began the latest round of import tariffs, and there were no signs of easing the dispute.
However, according to the recommendations of the 12 fund managers involved in the survey, the North American asset allocation rose to its highest level since June 2017, while holdings in the UK, the euro area and especially emerging markets declined.
The global share allocation averaged 56.6% and the bond allocation 35.5%, basically in line with last month's survey.
The most noticeable change is that the cash distribution rate has risen to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager at a large fund company said that while some economic data has given confidence to the market, the trade war remains the biggest concern, so it is best to be prepared to enter when the market recedes.
However, the fund managers still preferred stocks in September, especially U.S. stocks, even when U.S. stocks were considered to be price-high.
Today, the first major national import-themed exhibition in the world - the China International Import Expo - is officially opening in Shanghai, China's open landmark, to the great expectations of the public.
A fair is like a window sill that allows the world to get to know a city and a country better.
Through this entry-level window, people see China opening up to a higher level of China; and through this entry-level window, welcoming the world to China's mutual benefit and opening up and reforms.
The country is open to the idea of a butterfly, which will be born again, even if it is in pain.
General Secretary Xi Jinping summed up the Open Road and highlighted one of the key reasons why China is so successful.
Recalling 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which dares to enter the world market and the ocean, despite the filters and waves, always faces all the risks with an open attitude, continuously releases its internal vitality and continually improves its competitiveness.
It can be said that China has strongly interpreted the values and meaning of openness with its own concrete achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point, the import-themed exhibition, a major decision taken by the Party Central with comrade Xi Jinping at its core to promote a new round of high-level open outdoor activities, is a major initiative of China's initiative to open up the world market, is China's real action in support of economic globalization and trade liberalization, and shows the strong and clear will of China to open its doors not to close, but to open the door as it grows.
The most positive and best response to China's open economy in a broader, wider area and deeper development is a challenge for exhibitors to register.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has come to a crossroads.
Some countries are building high walls of trade protectionism, backing the old path of unilateralism, which has increased international concern about the prospects of free trade and added uncertainty to the warming global economy.
In such a context, the event in Huangpu Jiangxi reflects China's defense of free trade, the world's vision of open markets, and China's shared confidence and responsibility for the future.
The only way to get to the top is to walk fast and walk far.
China is open to embracing the world and not only has been a powerful driver of its own development, but it has also brought tremendous opportunities to China's countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the co-creation of a Belt and Road, launched the Asia Investment Bank, established the Silk Road Fund... China has provided a range of international public products, provided real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, and allowed companies to travel with China to develop the fast-moving, fast-moving, and leisure vehicles.
The Expo is also a public product, a major platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 companies from more than 130 countries and regions, with their high-quality products and services, are taking a new step in the Chinese market.
In addition to the companies in the country, domestic consumers are also the ones who really benefit.
By building this platform, the premium premium premium premium provides a multi-channel quality supply for consumer upgrades to meet the needs of the people's personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption.
The more the doors of China open, the more the goods flow, the more they are used, and the stepping stone towards a better life will be made stronger.
From a more macro perspective, the significance of the Expo has gone beyond the economic and trade spheres, but is looking to the future, conveying the concept of openness, inclusion, inclusiveness, balance, and win-win, and forming a consensus to meet today's challenges together.
The world is good, China is good; China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to the event bringing greatness and fulfillment to the world; we also aspire to a higher level of openness that will open up China's borders and work with the world to build a bright future for the future of the human community.
Foreign media: The United States has reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and the imposition of tariffs on cars that are not currently produced in Canada.
According to foreign media, a Canadian source revealed late on September 30th, local time, that the United States and Canada had reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement was reportedly to include Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and the imposition of tariffs on cars that the United States does not temporarily produce in Canada.
On 27 August, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary agreement on the renewal of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement on the extension of the deadline to 30 September, set by the United States on 31 August.
Earlier, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said Canada would sign only favorable agreements, focusing on substance rather than timing.
Over 90% of Brazilian women voters say that the presidential candidates do not consider the needs of women.
According to South American News Network, recent data released by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) shows that over 90% of Brazilian women do not consider the needs of women as presidential candidates.
The report said that the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million, and that if all of Brazil were to be combined into one country, the country would rank 13th in the world, more than twice the population of Spain.
In Brazil, women constitute 52% of the total voters, while men account for 48%, while women constitute only 10% of the Brazilian parliament, although the proportion is very high.
Out of 193 countries worldwide, Brazilian women are ranked 154th in political participation, higher than Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women are still unable to achieve their rights.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori points out that this phenomenon is the result of the co-operation of ancient patriarchal societies, racism and capitalist values.
The political system should be based on nationalist civil rights, identity, access to public goods and the formation of a single society by multiple social groups. But politics in Brazil belongs to a monopoly group, and the majority of the population is not represented.
A previous study by the Brazilian Institute of Motor Vehicles (Locomotiva) also found that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that politicians who are elected represent their rights, 90% of Brazilian women disagree with politicians' decisions, and 93 percent disagree with current government policies.
The problem of women's underrepresentation in parliament needs to be reversed, and the political system in Brazil remains affected by inequality. To date, there is still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the political sphere in Brazil.
Despite the lack of women's rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey shows that 76 percent of women believe they can play a role in democratic elections, and 72 percent of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to reduce discrimination against women.
On October 1, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn flag-raising ceremony to celebrate the 69th birthday of the new Chinese President.
The event was attended by representatives of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, representatives of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, news agencies, financial institutions, Chinese enterprises, the Warsaw University, the Confucius Institute and over 80 foreign students.
On October 1, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a flag-raising ceremony to celebrate the 69th birthday of the new Chinese president.
After the flag-raising ceremony, Chinese Ambassador Zhang Yi said that on the occasion of the 69th birthday of the great country, we held a flag-raising ceremony in foreign countries, a profound patriotic educational event.
We have been abroad for a long time, but we are always in the heart of a great country.
Zhang said that the Chinese people are closer than ever to achieving the great goal of national revival, closer than ever to the center of the world stage.
Our mission, our responsibility and our work is more honorable, difficult and burdensome than ever before.
Zhang Xi stressed that we must not forget the beginning, remember the mission, promote the development of the Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han Han
The T2 terminal at Guangxi Zhengjiang International Airport was officially opened on 30th.
The secretary of the Zhongqing Municipal Commission, Liu Liang, said that the new terminal will be able to meet the annual passenger throughput needs of 12 million passengers after its opening, building new advantages for Zhongqing air transport, and is of great importance for further improving Guangxi's maritime connectivity, high-speed rail connectivity, water and land connectivity, and modern triangular transportation patterns.
The forest is expected to receive 90 million visitors this year.
The project to expand the terminal and the terminal facilities of the T2 terminal at Zhejiang International Airport is a major public benefit project for the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Guangxi-Shong Autonomous Region and a landmark project for the construction of Zhejiang International Tourism Resort.
The project, which was commissioned in December 2015, covers an area of 100,000 square meters and has a total investment of 3258 million yuan. It will meet the needs of 12 million passengers per year, 1012 thousand passengers per year and 95 thousand tons of mail.
On that day, more than two hundred flights landed at the T2 terminal at Zhengjiang International Airport in Zhejiang.
The new terminal building is inspired by the water-filled jungle under the mountains, with a view of a mountainside waterfall, a close-up view of the slopes of the slopes of the Yangtze River and the overlapping roofs of the residential buildings in Yangtze, and a view of the waterfall of the mountains.
The new terminal at Jungle Airport will meet the peak traffic of almost 4,000 people per hour, use intelligent baggage sorting systems, security integration platforms, facial recognition, and smart airport technology, and plan a variety of business areas including catering, grocery stores, duty-free and leisure entertainment.
With growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets largely uninspiring, the United States is increasingly the main driver of global economic growth.
On September 23, 2018, a container freighter was docked in a port in New Jersey, USA.
However, as the current growth in the United States is driven by the time it has taken to get this fiscal stimulus to reduce taxes, the country's economy is also under intense scrutiny from the outside world.
As the United States is recovering full employment, economic downturn is inevitable.
He said the only question was when it would happen, and he thought it might only happen before it happens.
While Barclays is optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook for the year-end, the bank acknowledges that it is more difficult to make predictions for the longer term.
The current fiscal policy-driven growth will be difficult to sustain in the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost economic growth potential, economist Ian Barclay said in a study report.
The risk of a hard landing in 2020 will increase as investment growth is lacking, they said.
A series of business surveys will show that the major economies are in the economic cycle at the end of the third quarter.
The Eurozone and US manufacturing surveys, which are due to be released next Monday, will be the focus of attention, and the services survey will be released on Wednesday.
But next week's data will inevitably focus on the non-agricultural employment data in the United States, which will be released next Friday, which will provide clues as to whether tight job markets are driving a substantial wage increase.
Its importance is not only important for corporate profitability and consumer purchasing power, but also for rising wages or triggering overall inflation, which may be a source of concern for Federal Reserve/FED officials.
The salary of the young will be of great concern as it may rise again significantly from the previous month.
The increase in September may not exceed 3% from the same period last year, but we can expect it to break through next month, Dutch international economists ING wrote in a study report.
The European political bureau could be a source of market volatility as holidays in China and other parts of Asia lead to a lack of data in the region next week.
The Italian government has ignored the financial commitments made to the EU, and other EU members will have to quickly determine whether to strongly oppose the decision against Italy.
As Brexit talks enter a critical stage, the annual meeting of the Conservative Party in Birmingham may also be a firecracker.
At the same time, with Brazil's highly anticipated presidential election next weekend, concerns about emerging markets are unlikely to ease.
[Abstract] The ship will be delivered to the East Sea Division of the National Oceanic Administration of China after completion, and Chen Chen, Director of the Ocean Prevention and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources, said that the ship's commissioning would be of significant significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the advancement of global ocean observation.
On September 29, the first large 3,000 tonne floating vessel in China was sunk by a Chinese warship group at the Sun Red 22 torpedo.
Once completed, the ship will break the bottleneck of equipment currently in China's major floating, submerged, recycled, and salvage work.
The Sun Red 22 turbine is mainly used for maintenance of floodplains/submarines, regular placement, recycling, emergency placement, recycling, and recovery, and has the ability to perform comprehensive marine survey tasks such as intermittent surveys.
The new ship is 89 metres long, 18 metres wide and 7.2 metres deep, with a cruising range of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Xiaoying, Vice General Manager of Wubo Group, said: "The Yangtze-Red 22 is the first large floating vessel in China and the only one in the country with a lifting capacity of 10 meters, which will further enhance our capacity to secure large floats".
It is understood that the ship will be delivered to the East Sea Division of the National Oceanic Administration of China after completion, and Chen Chen, Director of the Ocean Prevention and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources, said that the ship will be significant for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the advancement of global ocean observation.
The ship, which has a large floating-plate repair capacity and an integrated marine survey capability, is the first integrated vessel in China to be dedicated to the operation of the Central and Far East floating-plate and marine integrated surveys.
With such floating vessels, our ocean observations and ocean surveys will have a powerful leverage in the future.
The 2018 International Limited Sailing Series, scheduled to begin on September 30, 2018 was postponed to October 1st, and a pre-race meeting was held in the O'ahu Sailing Center in front of the race, with 12 water-winged double-decker sailing ships from 6 countries and regions, captain Sid Siding, appearing.
The storm's strong winds, which reached 24 knots, delayed the launch signal for almost 90 minutes from 1pm on 30 October, and the winds were not reduced.
The strong winds blowing from the shore continue, and the sea is really too strong.
Mdrand explained: "Well, in such a situation, no one knows what kind of wind is blowing at a racing boat.
The cancellation of the race was the wisest choice given the current wind conditions near the city.
The crew is still disappointed with all the crew that are ready.
The racing boat is ready to stop, and we are in good shape.
The team's head coach, Max Richardson, said: "I know that the change of game was the right choice, and I hope that today's wind is less, and we can get a hand in the game".
Omega Wilkinson, the star of the New Zealand team for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, said: "Loss of a day makes the game even more interesting".
The game is going to be a big one, because today's game will be a big one, and there are only two days left.
I'm sure you'll be very busy.
Despite the strong winds, French ABM batsman Pierre Ives Durand appealed to the pre-race meeting, saying he had a warm relationship with the venue of the match, Qingdao. Five years ago, the international extreme sailing series itself suffered an accidental injury, a broken muscle, and the treatment of the race medical team allowed him to stand on the field today, five years later.
The International Boundary Sailing Series was founded in 2007 as a World Sailing League event, alongside events such as the Volvo, America's Cup, and the World Sailing Against Tour.
The competition will be held using the Flying Phantom twin-body sail.
2018 was the eighth year of the event for the sailing vessel, which is also the series' final battle.
Despite the ongoing global financial market shaking, the Hong Kong Financial Administration said on Monday that the foreign exchange fund's investment income in the third quarter of this year fell by 97% year on year, but performed better than last quarter, due to the high tide of overseas stocks and significantly reduced foreign exchange losses under the China-US trade war.
According to the latest data from the Gold Administration, the FDI recorded investment income of HK$1.6 billion in July-September 2018, down significantly from HK$61.8 billion in the same period last year, but well above the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Chen Deong, the head of the Gold Board, told the legislature that at the beginning of the Sino-American trade war, the Hong Kong and emerging market stock indexes were slumping against the US stock indexes, and after the US stock market index continued to peak in late September and early October, market sentiment began to reverse, as investors became aware that the trade war was also detrimental to the US itself.
The change in market sentiment is good, and if the trade war is only one-sided, it will not help much to solve the situation.
But he also pointed out that if the Sino-US trade war is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise.
In the third quarter, the foreign exchange fund's loss of Hong Kong's stock investments in the third quarter narrowed by 8% to HK$4.7 billion, while its foreign exchange earnings increased by 172% to HK$12.8 billion; foreign exchange losses of HK$16.2 billion, bond earnings of HK$9.7 billion, decreased by 24% and 31%, respectively, reflecting the general rise in the dollar as the quarter's main currency, and the US interest rate rise to 3 cents in September.
The foreign exchange fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong.
Hong Kong has had a link exchange rate system with the dollar since 1983.
As for the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen said that while economic and asset market uncertainty has increased and downside risks have increased, Hong Kong's financial system is stable, well-defended and resilient to earthquakes.
Hong Kong has a rich international investment position, with a net foreign assets of $1.4 trillion equivalent to four times GDP, 2.5 times higher than Singapore and 0.6 times higher than Japan, if the downturn is to be met or reversed.
Recently, the decline in interest rates continued to increase with the dollar, and the expansion of interest rates, Chen Deong noted that the exchange rate of the dollar had risen by over 400 basis points on September 21, which is generally considered to be mainly related to the decline in interest rates, followed by the decline in the level of the dollar at around 7.80-7.84, and the recent decline in interest rates, which may attract market interest rates, increased interest rate activity in the dollar, which triggered the weak exchange rate again greater than a period earlier.
But he believes that the future of the lower-than-dollar rate will change as the interest rate cycle of the Bank of Hong Kong begins and the interest rate on the port is normalized.
The interest rate in the Hong Kong dollar will be more in line with the trend in the US dollar, and we must be more careful about managing the risks, be prepared and deal with market volatility.
The three-month interest rate breakdown, which was further reversed by the abundance of capital in the port, fell 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, with the dollar spread expanding from 46 basis points to 51 basis points, while the monthly interest breakdown created a new five-month low, with the dollar spread expanding from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
The current exchange rate in the Hong Kong currency has been close to $7.85 trillion for most of the month from May to September.
During the period, due to factors such as the outflow of some of the proceeds from the interest rate and large-scale public offering activities after the end of the public offering, the weak parties were prompted to exchange the guarantee for several times in May and August after it was first triggered in April.
The Bank of China is buying and withdrawing USD at 7.85 levels in order to maintain the exchange rate stability.
The Bank of China bought about HK521 billion in the framework of the weak-side swap guarantee mechanism in May and August.
Is the new tax law still beneficial to foreigners?
The Ministry of Finance, the head of the Tax Office, said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing to provide preferential arrangements for people abroad, including people in Hong Kong.
A reporter asked that the newly revised personal income tax law would adjust the standard for taxpayers in our country from one year to 183 days.
Please ask if there are any other benefits available to foreigners, including those in Hong Kong, when the law is implemented next.
The official responded that the current regulations on the implementation of the personal income tax law provide special preferences for the taxation of foreigners, and that individuals who have not been resident in China for more than five years and have lived there for less than one year and whose income originates outside China can pay personal income tax only on part of the income paid by the entities or individuals in China.
The official said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law would be to consider continuing to provide preferential arrangements for people abroad, including those in Hong Kong.
The Moon Center is not yet closed: Quality certification promotes quality improvement.
With the economic boom of the two-child boom, the mother-and-baby market has expanded from the north to the third and fourth tier cities, and there have been a number of different grades of monthly membership in the city.
The current hotly contested lunar session is meeting the demands of the masses, with fees ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan, but also in a situation of embarrassment, the institution has so far been without a threshold and there are still gaps in regulation.
The National Market Regulatory Agency recently launched a national series of lunar lunar lunar events for 2018 in the city of Tianjin, where journalists visited a five-star lunar center to experience the certification of maternal and infant care services.
The general lunar center provides services such as newborn care, nutrition meals, postpartum plastic repair and more.
In the center, the reporter saw that nurses check the condition of newborn breastfeeding every day, and that professional nurses provide care services such as washing, caressing, and touching.
At the same time, to meet the needs of the new mothers, services such as early wound care, mid-to-late-moon beauty care, and care programs such as Chinese medicine and beauty treatments help us to recover our body.
A new mother who lives in the village told reporters that she had only booked a month-long visit to the lunar eclipse eight months earlier.
Monthly services are directly influenced by the comfort and physical recovery of the mother during her monthly period, and some small monthly services are limited to simple monthly services, with the risk of de-sanitary issues, easy cross-infections, and a single unscientific diet.
The head of the lunar center said they were the only one of all five-star lunar centers in Tianjin to receive a B-grade service certification.
While some customers do not understand what a B-level certification means at first, certification is important for long-term business development by forcing companies to standardize their process management to the benefit of customers.
Panlifen, Deputy Director of the Certification Regulatory Department of the National Agency for Market Regulation, said that service certification is a new type of certification system based on customer perception, focused on the degree of quality management and service characteristics of organizations, and is an important part of the national quality infrastructure, which has a positive role in improving the quality of service delivery ratio and enhancing the international competitiveness of Chinese services.
Starting in 2004, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification program has gone through a process of gradual development from nothing, emerging a series of influential service certification such as financial services certification, maternal and child care services certification, after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification, health service certification.
According to the National Market Regulatory Agency, there are currently more than 130 service certification bodies in China, more than 2,000 service certification personnel, and nearly 8,000 valid certificates.
Panlifin said that further guidance and promotion of the development of service certification, the gradual expansion of service certification coverage in health, education, sports, finance, e-commerce and other sectors, and the promotion of service sector supply-side reform and quality improvement should be encouraged.
Reuters Hong Kong, November 5 - Hong Kong's housing prices have fallen for two consecutive months after peaking, and Hong Kong Financial Administration President Chen Deong said Monday that it is still time to see if the housing market has entered the downstream cycle and if confirmed, that a tightening policy on successive reverse-cycle measures can be considered at the appropriate time.
Chen Deong also pointed out that if the price of buildings were to recover, the first people affected by the impact would be those who were unemployed at the peak of the housing market, but there is a projected drop in housing prices, such as during the Asian financial storm of 1997, and the chances of citizens to significantly cut prices for selling property are very low.
Chen Deong, who led several senior officials of the Gold Administration, attended a legislative briefing meeting and said that if real estate markets are in a downturn, there can be a gradual easing of measures when appropriate.
The report also notes that the government has been working on a number of projects to improve the quality of housing in the country, including the development of new housing markets.
Since October 2009, the IRS has introduced eight reverse-cycle measures to drastically tighten mortgage rates on all types of property, including reducing the number of mortgages, requiring mortgage applicants to undergo rigorous stress tests, and more, to improve bank risk management and earthquake resistance.
With Hong Kong officially entering the rate hike cycle, the private housing price index for Hong Kong fell to a peak of 1.44% in September for two consecutive months.
The increase in the three quarters of the year was 10.2%.
According to the Gold Administration, the household financial situation of Hong Kong's earthquake-resistant financial risk assessment is still healthy, with the percentage of households living in homeless homes in Hong Kong in the second quarter of this year reaching 66%, up from the 2009-11 average of 60%, and the average number of new batches of mortgages and new batches of mortgages with a supply and interest rate of 47% and 34%, respectively, significantly improving from 64% and 41% in 2009-11.
But Chen said that high earthquake resistance does not mean that the unemployed will not be affected by the economic downturn, as property valuations will fall and those who buy buildings at peak times will be the first to take the risk.
While the IRS has tightened the banking credit limits on mortgage lenders, the homeowners can also get high-yield mortgages through mortgage insurance or through development lending.
Chen said that the current number of mortgages offered to developers, along with mortgage loans, is 85-90%, and if the price of buildings falls by 10%, negative assets will appear (i.e. the market value of real estate will fall below the level of the total unpaid mortgage loan).
However, the Deputy President of the Gold Administration, Zhang Heng, noted that the authorities estimate that the total number of mortgages offered by developers is high, accounting for only 2 to 2.5 percent of the total bank mortgages, which is still low.
At the peak of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of the total number of people in the building sector.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong has recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive seasons.
The Chinese company Xinhua, Beijing, October 1, 2020 (Xinhua, China) e-commerce retail exporting enterprises on October 1, launched another wave of tax benefits, involving VAT, excise duty and other aspects.
The Ministry of Finance, the National Tax Administration, the Ministry of Commerce, the General Customs Administration, together with the Ministry of Finance, have issued a joint declaration on the implementation of the e-commerce integrated test zone for cross-border e-commerce exports of goods that do not have a valid import certificate, while complying with the following conditions, and the testing of the VAT and excise duty-free policies.

The tax authorities of the various test zones shall strengthen the tax-free administration of export goods in accordance with the electronic information of the export declaration lists cleared by the National Tax Administration.
The notification noted that specific tax-free management measures were developed by the provincial tax department, the business finance department, and the business department.
The offices of the building leadership groups and the business authorities of the various test areas should coordinate the implementation of communication cooperation and related policies between the sectors, accelerate the establishment of a system of monitoring of e-commerce exports statistics and promote the rapid development of cross-border e-commerce health.
Zhang Linhyu, 5 November 2019 - A man in Penang killed and dumped his lover after a dispute over the distribution of money.
On 5th, the journalist from the Public Security Office of the Eastern District of the city of Purdue, N.M., reported that after a joint investigation by the police, the man was successfully caught.
On June 26, 2018, a woman in the city of Yangsan, Penang province, was reported missing by her family to the local police.
The police investigation concluded that this was not a simple case of disappearance of a population, the disappeared were most likely killed by a lover king, and the police immediately established a special task force to investigate further.

On June 22, 2018, Wang and Wei were divided over the control of the money, and Wang killed Wei in a taxi cab, dismembering the body and throwing it away.
The suspect, Wang, has been handed over to the Penang Police.

Shenzhen, China New Network October 1 (Xue Xuanwei, Shenzhen) October 1 is the first day of the National Day of Hong Kong Golden Week, and the last day of the Hong Kong National Day public holiday, many mainland residents take advantage of the holiday to travel and shop outside the country, and many Hong Kong residents return to the port on that day, with the shores of Shenzhen experiencing traffic jams, the opening of 22 self-service corridors on the shores of Lake Luo, Shenzhen Bay, improving the efficiency of shore transit, facilitating efficient and fast transit for travelers.
According to data provided by Shenzhen Border Inspection General Station, as of 16 pm on the same day, the number of people entering Shenzhen port reached more than 429 thousand, the number of transportation tools reached more than 168 thousand (boats, shelves, rows) times, and the ports are always busy and uninterrupted, maintaining good order of entry.
It is understood that the increase in the number of countries offering visa-free travel to Chinese citizens is influenced by many positive factors, and the continuing increase in travelers who use the National Day holiday to travel to Europe and Southeast Asia for holiday shopping.
On the first morning of the first day, the outbound directions of the port of Rohe Lake, Shenzhen Bay, Raijō, Fueda and others were accompanied by the peak of passenger traffic, which lasted from 9:00 am to 11:00 am, the peak of passenger traffic from 6:30 am to 13:00 noon.
According to the report, the main border inspection station in Shenzhen will respond to the arrivals' traffic flow peak, start the duty mode at the National Immigration Administration's Unified Office, schedule overtime police support to the first line of duty, open the check-in corridor in advance, guide travelers and vehicles to check-in in order, ensure that Chinese citizens line up for entrance and exit at the border crossing for no more than 30 minutes, while taking into account the efficiency of foreign nationals; strengthen the maintenance of order in densely populated areas and ensure the security of the border crossing.
Shenzhen border inspection station also reminds travellers to pay attention to the validity of documents and visas before departure, the validity of the visa, the reasonable arrangement of travel, avoid the peak of passenger traffic, choose the right time, the right port.
Passengers travelling to Hong Kong on the Guangdong Port Highway must have valid exit documents and visa visas, and the highway ticket is for driving licence only and cannot be used as an exit document, such as for reasons such as non-compliance with the document procedure, and must follow the instructions of the Civil Police of the border inspectorate, waiting for the personnel of the port railway company to bring them to the designated place for the return to the country.
Systemic scarlet fever is a chronic, multi-organ, chronic suspicious disease that was once considered incurable.
The disease is not known, there are no known treatments and no effective treatments.
Recently, researchers at the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University, Zhang Yi, and the Joint Team of the Director of the Center for Rheumatic Immunology at Beijing People's University Hospital, Kastong-Zheng, discovered that there are molecular variations in human immune globulin that increase systemic red-spot hypersensitivity, and that these variations are involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is a major cause of systemic scarlet fever.
According to Sun Xiaojun, one of the authors of the article, the Chongqing team collected nearly 2,000 large samples of systemic red-spot lupus patients and conducted research, which found that patients with immunoglobulin variations produced a significant increase in the incidence and severity of inflammation, such as pathogenic cells and a large number of autoantibodies, eczema, arthritis, meningitis, vascular inflammation, and other inflammation.
The team discovered the immune signaling pathways that activate these immunomolymers, and promoted the B cell's pathogenesis of multiple autoantibodies through various methods of immune cell tracking, animal testing, sequencing, and so on.
The reporter learned that the two teams have worked together to fully exploit their strengths and achieve a close combination of basic research and clinical applications.
The Zhengli team is dedicated to the identification of B lymphatic cell immunity and immunoactivation research, while the Chongqing team has been engaged in long-term clinical research on systemic red blood cell disease.
The study, one of the results of a long-term collaboration between the two teams, is the first time that the academic community recognizes mechanistically that immune globulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic red spot lupus, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted treatment.
This is not a shortcut, but a legal action.
The lawyer is holding the axe to the court?
The news was really exciting and it exploded in the legal circle.
The Fujian City of Quanzhou Law subsequently fined the lawyer involved 500 yuan and recommended in writing that the Quanzhou City Bar Association conduct an investigation.
According to the New York Times, the official press release of the Quanzhou City Law Association said that the two lawyers' actions were not illegal and could not be punished under the law.
According to various reports, the process of the Quanzhou City Law Association is not to shorten or fight, but to be approved by the Quanzhou Central Council.
The events that could have triggered tensions within the legal community were eventually properly resolved.
The reversal of the case stems from a more complete truth-report: the axes carried by the attorneys involved are the same as the accused's murder weapon, but unlabeled, and serve as supporting evidence only in the context of the evidence, without intimidating the movements or endangering the subjective intent of the court's security.
To determine whether the lawyer involved had committed a violation of law, there are four very important details that need to be considered: one, the local court has only shown the photo of the axe in two previous hearings, from the point of view of the defense, showing that the original material of the axe was necessary; two, the axe was not to be purchased until an hour before the hearing, and the lawyer was not willing to seek the consent of the judge but was objectively unable to contact the judge; three, the entire axe was not overused or improperly used; and four, the lawyer first publicly admitted the error and apologized to the court.
The court's decision to remove the axe from the courthouse was not a prank, but a defense.
After clarifying the whole matter, the Quanzhou City Council decided not to go ahead with the matter, but to avoid punishment under pressure.
The decision was also subject to factual and legal review.
As for the fact that an axe will be brought to the court without the permission of the court, it is easy to cause unrest and misunderstanding.
For safety and prudence, the Central Court of Quanzhou has not yet issued any recommendations for fines and judicial sanctions.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from taking legal advice on the death of lawyers, the Supreme Court issued the Judicial Police Safety Inspection Rules of the People's Court of Jharkhand in 2014.
Since the rule was issued, the general practitioner has rarely been involved in events that threatened the security of the court due to security breaches.
In a very individual case like Quanzhou, misunderstandings are easy to eliminate as long as they are communicated in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
The Association of Lawyers is a self-governing organization in the legal profession with the dual mission of punishing wrongdoing and protecting the law.
In the past, individual law organizations have suffered from a lack of protection and discipline.
The decision of the Quanzhou Law Society, regardless of the process or the outcome, is commendable and sets an example for more law firms to properly perform their duties.
What tax benefits will affect our money bags from October 1?
The new personal income tax law will come into force on January 1, 2019, in order to allow the general public to enjoy tax deductions as soon as possible, and from October 1, the previous wage earnings actually received from taxpayers will be deducted from the starting point of 5,000 yuan per month and the new tax rate table will be applied.
What are the benefits that will affect the money bags of the masses with the fall of the new regime?
Benefit: The tax cuts on wages are clear
Taxpayers who receive wages after October 1 can deduct the basic deduction of 5,000 yuan per month and apply the new tax rate table, with most taxpayers having different levels of tax reductions, especially for middle and low-income earners.
According to the tax reduction tables for different income groups, the monthly income of those who deducted from the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax deduction of the tax of the tax of the tax deduction
It is worth noting that due to the holiday season, wages that should have been paid in October by the end of September, as per the law, can be applied to the new basic deduction of fees and tax rates.
To this end, the deduction account software used by the tax department for the uniform promotion of the use of the account has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax must still be declared within the statutory declaration period.
Benefit 2: The low tax rate gap is significantly higher
In addition to the increase in starting points, the new tax rate table will be applied from 1 October.
The seven levels of wage-earnings tax are the same as before, and have not changed, but the tax rate range is significantly different, with the three levels of low tax rates of 3%, 10%, 20% being significantly expanded, the 25% being reduced, and the 30%, 35%, 45% being the same for the three levels of higher tax rates.
It is worth noting that the tax law also adjusted the tax rates for the production and operation income, with the lower threshold of the top 35 percent tax rate being raised from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan.
This means that individual entrepreneurs and individual sole proprietorships will all benefit from the tax reform.
In the context of the tax deduction calculations for individual taxpayers in Shanghai, the dividend will be fully felt by the large taxpayers, especially by the low- and middle-income population.
The head of the personal income tax department of the Shanghai City Tax Office of the National Tax Administration, Lammin, said:
Benefit 3: Tax services are easier and optimized
Since the introduction of the new personal income tax law, the Shanghai City Tax Department has undertaken a wide range of tax campaigns.
On the one hand, the implementation of one-to-one, one-to-one policy guidance on the key tax sources and key enterprises.
The Pudong New District Tax Office visited large enterprises such as Apple Trade, Shanghai Limited, Paypal China Network Technology Limited, Red Star, and Khelon Home Group Shares Limited, which have large employees, large workloads, large tax volumes, tax department's active advice and answers to confusion; the Xue Zhong Tax Office visited large labor enterprises in the region, including China Zhi Financial Consulting Limited, China Zhi Shanghai Economic Technology Cooperation Company, and others, to gather business concerns, respond to business claims, and solve business difficulties.
On the other hand, the tax policy of full-scale, multi-dimensional, and stereo-metallic metals is being pushed to the taxpayers of the general public.
The company uses the official website of the Shanghai Taxation, WeChat Public Number, and Weibo to deliver policy hotspots in a timely manner to ensure policy publicity is in place.
At the same time, on September 28, Shanghai Tax WeChat Public Service launched 12366 smart consulting platforms to launch tax reform publicity services aimed at integrating smart tax reforms with AI+ smart pumps.

The US-Mexico trade agreement will create new opportunities for 500 million people.
According to a statement issued by Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Letheiser on the Canadian government website, the United States, Canada and Mexico have reached a trilateral trade agreement, which will be known as the USMCA Accord.
Earlier, CTV News quoted senior US sources as saying that Canada and the US had eliminated their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post quoted two sources with knowledge of the situation as saying that the agreement reached by the United States and Canada on September 30 would retain the North American Free Trade Agreement as a trilateral trade agreement, with the three heads of state signing a new agreement within two months.
The statement said: "Today, Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed on a new trade agreement - the US-Mexico Trilateral Agreement (USMCA), which will provide our workers, farmers and companies with high standards of trade that will promote more free markets, fairer trade and more sustainable economic growth.
The North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1994 by the United States, Mexico and Canada.
After Trump took office, he announced plans to reconsider the agreement and sign a new agreement.
The three countries have started this process of negotiations since 2017.
The results of the early morning election of former governor Umeng-Mishi, due to his death from illness, were announced on 1 January, and Danny Yuri, who opposed the plan to move the US military base to Japan, was elected.
The election was held on September 30, with the final results showing Yue City won 39.663.2 million votes, making Okinawa County the most votes in the governor's election history, with more than 80,000 votes more than its main rival, Zhou Wei.
A total of four candidates contested the election, with a turnout of 63.24%, down 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 election for Governor of Okinawa County.
Yudo told media on 1 January that the election results showed that the people of the county did not want to let the governor's life-long efforts be wasted, and that he would inherit the governor's will to continue to work against the plans to move the US military bases and the closure of the space base, among other efforts against the Japanese government and the US government.
The U.S. military base in Okinawa County, which has been plagued by cholera, has been moved to the Okinawa area, but the people of Okinawa strongly oppose the move, hoping to move the base completely out of Okinawa.
Speaking about the move, which was strongly opposed by the people of the county and the demand to revoke the permits to fill the coastal area, Yucatan said that he did not initially stand in opposition to the central government and wanted to exchange views on the issue, which showed the intention to be resolved through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also told the media on the morning of 1 January that he took the results seriously and would make efforts to revive Okinawa and reduce the burden on the base.
Japanese official Liu Yiwei told a press conference on 1 January that the government's policy on moving US military bases as soon as possible has not changed.
He also expressed his desire to talk to Yogyakarta.
Yūshū will officially become Governor of Okinawa County on 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oils grew, farmer Paul Thomas of North Dakota has grown more soybeans on his land.
This shift reached its peak this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans on 5,000 acres, reaching an unprecedented size.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to replant the main crops of the former US agricultural lands: corn and wheat in 2019.
This year, US farmers have grown more soybeans than corn for the first time in 35 years.
The plan to move other crops is because US farmers are in trouble selling soybeans in the context of US President Trump's trade war with China.
China typically purchases about 60% of U.S. soybeans, but due to trade wars, almost zero U.S. soybean purchases in recent months have led to soybean prices falling to a decade-low.
Thomas plans to grow more wheat next year, hoping to grow more by reducing reliance on crops that rely on China for demand.
Thomas said that the soya price hike was a painful blow to us.
He said that there was no Chinese buy-in, and the current price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per ear of rice, while the price needed to cover the cost was $8.50.
US farmers have set a record for soybean cultivation this year, and their crops are expected to hit a record high.
At a time when it was so easily shocked, they were hit by the trade war.
In July, China imposed tariffs on imports of US soybeans against Trump for importing Chinese goods.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release the first forecast report on planting area next year, which will include considerations of the impact of tariffs.
The forecast is expected to confirm the expectation of the civil authorities that the area of soybean planting will be reduced.
According to a report seen by Reuters, on October 19, Info Economics expects corn plantations to increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019, while soybean plantations will decrease by 7% to 83 million acres.
Informa also expects wheat farming in the United States to increase by 4%.
The area of soybeans grown before the retaliatory tariffs increased to £89.6 million this year, up from about £15 million a decade ago.
Corn cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres to 89.1 million since 2008, and this year wheat cultivation has reached 47.8 million acres, near the lowest level in 100 years.
Aaron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Growers Association, has a total of 3,600 acres of land in his home, and this year he will spend nearly half of it growing soybeans, but plans to cut it down in the future.
He said his farm in northern Illinois could increase the area of corn by as much as 20%; the state is the largest soybean growing state in the United States.
The average production of soybeans per acre is less than that of maize, but the amount of chemical fertilizer required is also lower, which makes soybeans generally less expensive to grow.
If farmers switch to end-value corn, it may increase costs, but it will benefit some businesses, including Anderson Inc. wholesalers of fertilizer.

China International Times: Defending multilateralism and China's unity in action
In a time of unilateral reversal, international rules and multilateral order are under attack.
In some ways, the intersection of unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible power, China, with its ideology of supremacy, solidarity and robust action, is working with the international community to uphold multilateralism and promote multilateralism.
In the face of new challenges, China has made a strong voice about the direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Secretary and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in his General Debate Speech to the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, the new era of multilateralism should be driven by a win-win goal of cooperation, rule-based order, fair justice and effective action.
At the same time, China called for a global development cooperation framework to be built with the United Nations as its core, North-South cooperation as its main channel, and South-South cooperation as its complement, and called for all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's thinking and voice reflects the mainstream voice of the international community.
As the 73rd President of the United Nations, Espinosa, said, under the current situation, the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and uphold a rules-based international system more than ever.
International Monetary Fund President Lagarde said the international community should continue to be firm in upholding the multilateral trading system, adhering to international trade rules and resolving differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the global economic and political forces, some emerging markets and developing countries have emerged to play a greater role in major international multilateral mechanisms, providing new developmental impetus for multilateralism in the face of the winds of adversity.
Standing up for this dimension, China's advocates of building big families instead of making little circles, insisting on the multilateral concept of co-operation rather than winning, and following the trend of the times, are the inevitable choice to address global challenges and solve the world's problems, representing the common demands of most countries in the world.
The first is the development of the new technology, which is more advanced in thinking and more robust in action.
China's Belt and Road Initiative has become the largest international cooperation platform.
China's joint initiative for international and regional cooperation, including the Belt and Road Co-Building Initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the 16+1 Cooperation Initiative, promotes international regional cooperation, perfectly complements existing international systems and order, brings innovative vitality to multilateral cooperation and contributes to the development of the international order in a more just and rational direction.
As a defender of international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China's actions on the multilateral stage of the United Nations are becoming increasingly powerful.
To pivot to the international hotspots, to tackle climate change, to participate in peaceful actions, to work hard to reduce poverty and alleviate poverty, and to help other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As UN Secretary-General Guterres has said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
The world's most pressing need for multilateral cooperation is at a time when the global crisis of the trust deficit is intensifying, when populism and polarization are on the rise.
At such a historic juncture, the international community needs to come together to turn consensus into action, firmly defend multilateralism and jointly promote the construction of a community of human destiny.

The following is the report: September 30, the fifth national martyrs' day.
At 10 a.m., Xi's Equality Party and national leaders, along with representatives from the capital, attended the ceremony to pay tribute to the people's heroes and commemorate the heroic martyrs.
The Central Television has released a quick comment on the incident: This is the first martyrs' day after the Hero Martyrs Protection Act of our country came into force.
Five years ago, when the Chinese people set up the Martyrs' Day on the eve of the National Day to show the great journey of the Chinese people from suffering to death, we must always be alert: oh, where we come from, where we are going to death.
Xi Jinping's Secretary-General emphasized that abandoning tradition is essentially the same as cutting off one's own spiritual life.
The first is that the history of the world is not forgotten, but that the future is opened.
We honor heroes and commemorate martyrs, and we must remember history forever, keep the spirit alive, and unite the powerful positive energy of national revival.
The quick commentary points out that the Indignity is the backbone of the nation.
To honor the martyrs, to sacrifice the martyrs, is to make the passionate memory of our heart a noble, holy, powerful eternal memory.
According to incomplete statistics, about 20 million martyrs sacrificed their heroism for national independence, people's liberation and the nation's prosperity, the happiness and well-being.
Every pioneer who gives a gift to the nation will be remembered, and every spirit of faithful service will be admired.
The purpose of the National Day of Remembrance and various commemorative events for them is to pay tribute to them in the name of the country, to remember their great achievements and to learn to inherit their precious spirit of love for the fatherland, loyalty to the people, selfless devotion and courage to sacrifice.
The party committees at all levels of government have improved the system of caregiver preferences, continuously improving the level of caregiver treatment, and the party and the state have practiced the honor of heroes in practical actions.
Every year, countless people visit the Martyrs' Mausoleum to experience the deep love and memory of the people and feel the renewed energy that rises in the national blood.
The idea of honoring heroes, defending heroes, learning heroes, caring for heroes is a common theme throughout society.
In the final analysis, the Chinese characteristic of socialism entering a new era, we can console the long-sleeping elites: a strong China is rising in the East, the great revival of the Chinese nation is being realized in our hands.
Let us move forward with a spirit of enthusiasm and drive forward towards the great goal!

The fifth month of the Disability Speakers Month is coming to focus on the issue of disabled adolescents' sexual education - China New Network
In recent years, the topic of adolescent sex education in China has been widely discussed, but the challenges for adolescent sex education with disabilities remain tough.
Recently, a seminar on the comprehensive education challenges and practical strategies for people with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to provide sexual education to children and young people with disabilities was a major topic of the workshop.
The report on sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of children with disabilities and adolescents published at the meeting showed that children with disabilities suffered more sexual harassment and sexual assault than healthy children.
The social protection of children, adolescents and people with disabilities is also a major concern.
The workshop aims to explore the three aspects of family support, school education and institutional services in China to promote inclusive education for children and adolescents with disabilities, supporting children and adolescents with disabilities from the source, and giving them the right to enjoy love as others do.
Experts believe that the Chinese public's awareness of disability has remained at an insufficiently deep level.
Influenced by traditional ideas and other factors, China is not yet deep enough in the comprehensive education of people with disabilities, especially children and adolescents with disabilities.
However, in recent years, with the support of UNESCO and public interest groups, the practice and path to achieving full-cycle, comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education for people with disabilities in China has developed.
The report shows that although children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical disabilities have more difficulty than the general public in gaining access to sexual knowledge and understanding intimate relationships, they have generally developed towards facilitation and enrichment.
The Seminar on Comprehensive Education Challenges and Practice Strategies for People with Disabilities, co-sponsored by the Shanghai Humanitarian Fund, the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the International Disability Alliance (France) Beijing Representative Office, and the UN Population Fund Representative Office in China, aims to discuss and implement a common pathway for the full cycle development of sexual and reproductive health education practices for people with disabilities, and to promote special education and integration education policy makers, educators, researchers, social service organizations, parents, and stakeholders on behalf of the rights of children and adolescents with disabilities to comprehensive international education policies and health; and to exchange broadly on domestic disability education practices, strategies, challenges and resources for children and adolescents with disabilities, to understand how to develop and develop a comprehensive education for children and youth with disabilities and to develop blueprints for future development and support networks.
BEIJING, Sept. 30 - The Central Bank of China on Sunday released data on the forecasted short-term net outflows of foreign assets, showing that as of the end of August, the central bank's foreign exchange position on long-term contracts and futures contracts for the currency was zero for 12 consecutive months, and there were still no positions in the month.
The Central Bank's previous data showed that as of the end of August, the central bank held a total of $6044 billion in foreign currency positions in futures and futures contracts against the currency, which remained unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the SDR (special withdrawal rights) was 4276 million SDR.
The central bank's foreign exchange futures position has remained zero since then.
The central bank first released the data in late March 2016; data showed that the central bank's foreign exchange position for long-term and futures contracts with the currency at the end of February 2016 was $2.43 billion and the foreign exchange position for the currency at $28.9 billion.
The first time the data for September, released at the end of October, showed an increase in net vacancies of $164.01 million to $453.01 million.
The central bank has previously stated that the long-term and futures positions of foreign exchange against the currency mainly reflect the long-term foreign exchange operations conducted by the central bank with commercial banks to meet the needs of corporate foreign exchange liability portfolio security, and will continue to provide long-term hedge products on a real-time basis, with the long-term operations of the central bank having less impact on the size of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20, a student from Jo's third year of high school in Yangtze, China, took the K158 train to the Great Wall.
One of the ladies on the train bought a ticket without a seat, but took her seat: "Hello, shoot, shoot, shoot".
After two hours' journey, the trainmaster advised him to stay an hour.
In the end, a male passenger with the carriage could not see the lift.
From a sentimental point of view, although the end result is that the perpetrators are mostly condemned by the public, punished by the public safety administration, and even put on the blacklist of integrity, the public still feels uncomfortable with hatred.
Why can't we stop the immoral and illegal actions of the people and punish them afterwards?
And why does not a man raise it up in the way of the Ark, while he is a passenger?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance trains are equipped with passenger guards, while short-distance trains are not; even passenger guards and passengers are more concerned about the possible unwillingness of the passengers to act without taking forced evacuation measures.
The repeated incidents of horoscope have made people aware that it is necessary to force the horoscope to be removed or even punished before it can act as a shock.
This requires that our passenger trains dare to take strong measures in time, and that trains without passengers should be deployed as quickly as possible to ensure timely stopping and combating of illegal acts.
On October 1, the first day of the national holiday, vehicles headed for Matsun Pan in the northern part of Sichuan Province, north of the Sichuan Autonomous Region.
At around 13 pm, the North Kivu police received a call to help, saying that their family had been in a traffic accident in Shandong, and that due to limited medical conditions in the area, they were urgently needed to be sent to Shandong for treatment.
The police have requested 120 ambulances to be allowed to pass on the road to the lake.
After receiving a call for help, the on-duty civilian police quickly reported the situation to the brigade, and after Captain Huang Shengmen simply learned the situation, he immediately arranged for the police stationed at the control points to contact the civilian assistant, requesting that all possible escort work be done.
The vehicle that entered the control lane at the time was over a thousand vehicles, and after contacting 120 ambulances, we immediately arranged for deployment after arriving in the northern part of the state at about 15 pm.
Captain Liu of the squadron in the northern section of the NECA Police Station explained that the ambulance had to bypass the Ring Lake Road from Tang'an and the road was very narrow to prevent vehicles entering the road from running in pairs, the police had to place a check on the vehicle at the start, middle and end of the road one hour earlier, and reminded passing drivers to leave all the roads open to avoid the ambulance.
Subsequently, the drum squad of the civilian police also temporarily stopped the vehicles entering the control lane, and lined up to allow 120 ambulances to arrive.
At around 15:00, a license-holder ambulance from the U-Kuwa entered the North River region, and the North River Police sent a police car to escort the ambulance back to the control lane.
It is understood that only one vehicle can pass through the area on the Zhonglu Road, and the local police have placed provisional controls on the area in advance, ensuring that 120 ambulances have passed through.
When we reached the village of Ten Mile, there was a road that could not be missed, so the police contacted the two village committees in advance, bypassed the village road and banned social vehicles from entering.
The first of these was the North River Ambulance, which took only 40 minutes to reach the 302 Provincial Road.
The average time of the trip is four hours, according to Liu.
The patient was treated in a timely manner and was given a valuable treatment.
At 17:20 hours, it was reported that the seriously ill were sent to the sheep for treatment.

But they don't know that their actions have been seen by the naked civilian police.
The police caught the man in the fire while waiting for the man to steal, and the policeman stared at the man who was about to steal, and was caught by the detectives after they had stolen.
Beijing Morning newspaper reported that the police had seized 800 yuan in cash from the suspected thief.
The money they took from the passenger clothes box.
The police pointed to a broken jacket pocket and said: "Oh, they tore it apart and stole 800 yuan from a traveler who came to Beijing, and when we caught them, the money was just in their own pockets".
The reporter learned that the police had to wait an hour to catch the two men and finally got a hold of the case.
The two suspects are currently under police review.
Ben Eid al-Mani warned the prosecutors that the question of who is suspect among the crowd is simple for the police.
The more the thieves are caught, the more they find that their eyes, their godly eyes and their ordinary passengers are different, and they like to dig into the crowd rather than hide from people.
Police also told reporters that the suspects' cars often have no purpose and would like to wander around the station to find the object stolen.
I'm not sure if this is the case, but I'm sure you'll know.
In addition, the police also suggested that the best way to get out of the closet is to leave the items and to be stolen.
When travelling to play, be careful of your belongings to avoid being stolen.

Where the hazardous substance limits and odor requirements in the brine are specified in the brine, the total volatile organic compounds must not exceed 5 mg/m3 and methane must not exceed 0.4 mg/m3 and sulfur dioxide must not exceed 7 mg/m3 and brine must not exceed 0.1 mg/m3 and the odor level must not exceed 3 degrees.
The new flag also provides detailed rules on the requirements for sampling, testing, and determination of the rules for the plastic runway in the middle school.
In addition, artificial turf on campus is also included in the mandatory testing scope of national standards for the first time.
In recent years, special work on the implementation of the new national flags will be deployed in various places and the implementation of the new national flags will be reported to the Department of Sports Health and Art Education of the Ministry of Education within the year.
The Chinese government announced that the Chinese government will be taking part in the 2018 Women's World Cup final on Monday, September 30.
In the end, Ju Ju Ju Juang, the team-mate who won the men's 4-0 match at home, re-entered the women's World Cup in four years, the 21st time China has won the event.
Dingning and Ju Ju Ju are teammates and friends, and both are quite familiar with each other's tactics.
The two sides are like shadows, whether they are ready for battle or in the heat of the game.
The final was won by the two teams, who said they had completed their task.
The match between Dingning and Ju Ju Ju-Jun was a shadow of a light sword.
In the first round, the match experience dominated Dingning started with a 3:1 lead, followed by Ju Ju Ju Ju using Dingning's mistake to match the score to 3.
After the offensive errors began to increase, Dingning took the opportunity to take a 3-point, 9-5, lead and a 10-6, lead.
Although Ju Ju Ju Ju won the match by 3 runs, Dingning still used the ball to take the lead with 11:9.

In the end, Dingning defeated team-mate Ju Ju Ju won her third individual World Cup title, and she expressed satisfaction with her performance: "A championship is important to every athlete".
I didn't think about it before the game, just saying that a game to play, the final itself played, or was very satisfied.
When talking about whether the homecoming enthusiastic audience would put invisible pressure on themselves, Kawasaki's sister Ju Ju Ju won a silver medal without completing the defence goal, she said: "Oh, I think I can handle the whole match in terms of pressure, but today Dingning's performance is so great that I haven't found a rhythm".
Activating rural consumption, cleaning the market with normalization mechanisms, guiding healthy consumption demands and increasing the sense of access to farmers' consumption.
The data shows that the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be unleashed, with retail sales of rural consumer goods growing by 10.5% in the first half of this year, up 1.3 percentage points from the growth in towns.
In a poor village in the western part of the province, the village has only one convenience store, and some goods seem to have been introduced to the store.
In recent years, similar phenomena have been exposed frequently, some of the villages fake bad goods near the name, similar names, similar packaging, false truth, and unpredictable.
A consumer survey report released in a western city shows that the problem of counterfeit goods is serious for rural businesses, with 66% of users buying counterfeit goods in the countryside, of which more than half are food.
The government is trying to fix the rural market, and why is it that Li Jin-hwan is still fighting?
Unlike urban markets, farmers' rights awareness is relatively weak, and many rural areas are remote, in blind areas where there is insufficient regulatory power, allowing forfeit goods to have a fertile soil.
One product is multi-headed, some departmental price, some production, some markets, functions are crossed, year after year, the government is concentrated, the fake is hidden from the wind, and slowly emerges, just after the old fake, the new fake emerges.
The lack of long-term regulatory mechanisms, difficulty in cleaning rural markets, low illegal costs and high profits have led to some illegal traders getting up and down the slopes of the countryside, and some rural areas becoming waste markets.
From humid to poor, large farmers are moving towards developing consumption.
The Central and State Council of the Party released a number of comments on improving the mechanisms to promote consumption and further stimulate the consumption potential of residents, including proposing to promote the upgrading of the consumption ladder of rural residents, with the aim of making large farmers consume energy and energy.
On the one hand, we need to deepen reforms, eliminate multi-purpose market regulation policies, multi-purpose management flaws, make land affordable, strengthen food safety, monitor product quality networks, and constantly squeeze the space for counterfeiting and selling counterfeits in rural areas.
On the other hand, to increase the enforcement of the law, to regulate the use of the lymph nodes, and to prevent the spread of counterfeit deception in rural areas.
The strict punishment of the farmers is the protection of the farmers, no matter how hidden the counterfeiters, should not be the reason for the production of counterfeit goods, the relevant authorities should clearly state their responsibilities, the regulatory power of the base, which link is the problem, to be held accountable, to make the counterfeiters and sellers nowhere to hide.
Strict access to the market, strict qualification checks on production operators, market circulation, product flow and flow, source and root solutions, legal distributors safe to operate, farmers safe to buy.
Activating rural consumption to drive healthy consumption needs.
With the rise of consumption, many farmers are not only looking for a healthy, nutritious diet, but also a high quality of life, such as culture, health, and cannot compare rural markets with low-quality, low-cost, and low-cost paintings.
This will require promoting e-commerce to extend to large rural areas, promotion of dual-linked sales channels in cities, promotion of online industrial development platforms and online e-commerce trading platforms, support for the expansion of new business models of consumption to rural markets; promotion of conditional towns that integrate commercial logistics with recreational agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, and other organic means; strengthening rural modern distribution network systems, optimizing integrated storage facilities resources and effectively reducing rural distribution costs.
The aim of the project is to create a clear and secure market environment for rural areas, to ensure that farmers consume without worry, and that rural consumption can grow and increase the sense of well-being and happiness of farmers.
The country will lower the top rate of excise duty on some goods from November 1st, bringing the total level of duty to 7.5%.
According to the decision of the 26th Standing Meeting of the State Council, the State Council's Customs Tax was published by the Commission on 30 November 2018 and reduced the highest rate of state tax on certain goods from 1 November 2018.
According to the State Department's tariff tax, the Commission's announcement on the reduction of tariffs on imports of certain goods, in order to adapt to the needs of industrial upgrades, lower enterprise costs and meet the needs of large-scale consumption, has reduced the preferential rate of the country for certain goods, such as industrial products, from 1 November this year.
The total amount of tax cuts to goods was 1,585 taxes, which accounted for about 19% of the total tax cuts in China, and the average tax rate was reduced from 10.5% to 7.8%, with an average reduction of 26%.[3]
The tax cuts mainly cover textiles; stone, ceramics, glass products; parts of steel and base metals; mechanical and electrical equipment and parts such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, power transmission equipment, electrical equipment, instrumentation, etc.; resource goods and primary processed goods such as non-metallic minerals, mechanical chemicals, wood and paperless products, jewellery, etc.
At the same time, the rate of duty on imported goods was also lowered as the overall level of tariffs, especially on medicines and everyday consumer goods, was lowered.
To implement the decisions of the Central Party and the State Council, China has implemented zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported medicines since May 1, and from July 1, it has reduced tariffs on imports of cars and parts, some everyday consumer goods, and implemented a third-step tariff reduction on products under the information technology agreement.
The State Department's Customs Tax Committee learned that, after several consecutive autonomous adjustments, the total level of tariffs in China will decrease from 9.8% to 7.5% from last year, an average decrease of 23%.
The appropriate reduction of tariffs will promote the development of foreign trade balance and promote a higher level of open access to foreign trade, as well as facilitate the consolidation of international domestic and domestic resources and the promotion of structural reforms in the domestic supply side.
The relevant committee leaders said that this year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, and that the proactive reduction of the total tariff level is a practical action to implement the spirit of the keynote address delivered by Secretary-General Xi Jinping at the BoA Forum, and that China's important initiative to further expand opening up and proactive import expansion is based on its own high-quality development, and that this action and initiative shows China's determination to adhere to a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up, while strengthening its development potential and making China's development better for the world.
On September 29, the public brands of the Chinese people's Chinese agricultural products in the Jiangsu province of Guangdong province were held in Tianjin's southern district.
Red Army wheat, black beans, mountain goats, refined bitter tea, paper cut leather, handmade sneakers... ...a neatly packed set of fine agricultural products on the stand, all of which have a common brand name called the "Crowned People" (Crowned People).
The company has created the Zhongqing Peoples' Zhongqing regional brand, which effectively solves the development bottlenecks of the Zhongqing county's agricultural products, which are too numerous, small and weak, and is also a powerful vehicle for poverty alleviation.
The city is located in the province of Jiangnan-Tshi, and is the administrative center of the Jiangnan-Tshi province.
The food in the area, including lamb meat, rice wine, rice, and soft rice, is also a common taste in his hometown.
As the level of urbanisation in China continues to increase, the urban population is growing rapidly, and large numbers of rural youths are leaving their hometowns to start living in cities.
Chinese agricultural brand research expert Choi Jian says: "City life is fast-paced, stressful, and more and more people are beginning to miss the country life of childhood, but the best memory of the country is the country, which is the country, and the design of the country's brand is named after the country and country of the people who are wandering around the counties.
The climate conditions in the surrounding counties are exceptional, the sunlight is long, the temperature varies by day and night, and the conditions for growing small grains are exceptional.
The country is home to more than 20 varieties of small grains, the largest producer of sugar cane in China, and the highest quality in the country.
Wang Xiaoli, a girl from Tsingqing County who volunteered for the presentation, said: "The best people in the country, the best taste in the country, the brand of Chinese cuisine that has captured our hearts, memories, memories and memories of the past, and hopes that the farther the brand goes, the bigger the cuisine".
Dr. Liu, a researcher at the National Institute of Food and Resources Research, said that the advantages of the data on over 900 groups of indicators, including oats, pickles, black beans and other agricultural products in the county, were highlighted by the detection of the data, and that many of the bioactive substances in the cereal were higher than the standard data.
The Secretary of the Zhongshan County Commission, Chaichun, said that the release of the Zhongshan County Manish brand can further improve the quality, standardization, and scale of innovation development of the quality of agricultural products in Zhongshan County, and contribute to shaping the overall image of the Zhongshan County agricultural products, and rapidly increasing their popularity, competitiveness and added value.
Canada's GDP grew 0.2% in July, a higher-than-expected increase, warming the market's expectations of a rate hike for the Canadian Central Bank next month.
If the rate increases are true, it will be the fifth rate increase in a little over a year.
Analysts at Reuters previously predicted growth of 0.1%.
Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 of the 20 industries were growing.
The data is notable because the central bank expected earlier this month that temporary factors could drag the third quarter GDP data.
The president of the Central Bank of Canada, Polloz, promised Thursday that the central bank will continue to raise interest rates gradually and will keep a close eye on economic data.
The next Bank of Canada announcement of interest rates will be on October 24.
The Central Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017 due to the economic recovery and near-record low unemployment rates in Canada.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at the Canadian macro-investment group, said the country's economy is expected to grow at a GDP per capita rate of about 2 percent in the third quarter.
This will be 1.5 per cent higher than the Central Bank of Canada expected, and will therefore be another reason for the Central Bank of Canada's interest rate hike expected next month, Liu said in a report.
The overnight index swap shows that the market forecast for the October rate hike for the Canadian Central Bank rose from 76.46% to 78.27%.
The first joint exploration of the Han River in 65
The Ministry of Defence of South Korea confirmed on 5th that the Korean people had launched joint exploration of the mouths of the Han and Linjiang rivers on the same day.
The initiative is a preliminary preparation for the free movement of civilian vessels on both sides.
The Korean Ministry of Defense's press release on the day showed that this was the first joint survey of the Han River port since the signing of the North Korean Armistice Agreement in 1953.
The Korean government signed a military agreement in September this year, agreeing to jointly explore waters such as the Han River entrance and sea port from November to ensure the future environmental protection of the waters, development of tourism, etc.
In October, the Korean government planned a joint survey of the waters at a general-level meeting.
On November 5, the joint exploration of Korean waters officially began.
The Joint Expeditionary Force consists of 20 members from the Korean military, experts and others.
According to the Ministry of Defence of South Korea, both sides were not carrying weapons during the visit, and prohibited the use of provocative language.
The area was once an accidental high-altitude area, but through joint exploration, it will become a new peace zone in the future due to the lack of military boundaries near the entrance.
The total area of the joint Korean expedition is about 70 km2 and the total area is about 280 km2.
The Ministry of Defence of South Korea said that South Korea will send six reconnaissance ships to explore the depths of the sea to provide basic information for safe navigation in the waters; after the investigation is completed, it will provide navigation maps for civilian vessels.
The Korean government held a summit in Pyongyang in October 2007 to reach an agreement on jointly using the Han and Linjiang rivers to access the sea, but subsequent talks were hampered by tensions on the peninsula.
Under the Korean War's September military agreement, future ships will need to notify each other in advance before navigating in common waters.
According to the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia website, recently, Chinese citizens Guo Yue and Mao Zhen were missing during their tour of Mongolia.
It is understood that the duo, a member of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, contacted their local relatives on October 19, saying they were going to expedite into the mountains near Lake Kusugul immediately and shared their location via WeChat, after which they lost contact and were suspected of having gone to the desert area.
The Embassy of China in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and security of Chinese citizens in Mongolia, and to the protection and assistance of consular posts.
After learning of the loss of the two tourists, the embassy immediately launched the emergency preparedness of the convoy, striving to seize the time of the gold rescue and work to the full.
The embassy maintains close communication with the families of the parties, assists the family to report the case to the Mons police immediately and provides the family with a list of translations for their choice.
The embassy first met with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Police and Emergency Directorate of Mongolia, to inform the authorities of the situation, requesting the Ministry to carry out a search and rescue as soon as possible and to keep in close communication with the Ministry throughout the search and rescue process to ensure timely updates.
At the same time, the Embassy assisted the families in launching the search for people in Mon, and actively engaged in large-scale efforts in Mon, China and China to provide effective clues and provide relevant assistance to the numerous Blue Sky rescue teams that have come to the rescue in Mon.
The first time, under the strong pressure of the embassy, Moon Moon sent a rescue team and promised to free search and rescue costs.
The General Directorate of Police and Emergency Directorate of the Municipal Police Directorate has directed the police and emergency departments of the Kusugul Province to search and rescue the entire area.
As Lake Kusugul is located at the border with Russia in northern Mongolia, the location is remote, the land is sparsely populated, traffic and communication are extremely uncomfortable, and the country is currently in a severe winter with temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius, local police and emergency services have overcome great difficulties, mobilizing almost all the police and sending local herdsmen, by riding, walking, visiting herdsmen, and continuing to carry out wide-ranging carpet searches around the two-person disappearance.
At the same time, in response to the special situation in the pastoral area, the Monfong has been launching a search for people through a radio cycle for several days.
The Blue Sky Rescue Team has also been actively involved in the rescue alongside Moon.
The safety of the two missing persons has always touched our hearts.
The two have been missing for more than a decade, and the embassy has received a number of clues, but they have not been found, and the search and rescue operation is still underway.
The Embassy will always be committed to the principle of humanity, continue to take care of this matter, encourage the parties to continue their search and rescue efforts and provide maximum assistance to the families of the parties concerned.
The embassy urges the Mongolian community and businesses to contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia first if they have any leads.
Former security guard claims Michael Jackson had a ribbon stuck to his nose for making headlines
Michael Jackson's former bodyguard claims that the late singer deliberately committed strange acts in order to deliberately incite the media.
Matt Feeds, now a real estate developer and owner of a martial arts/dance chain, told the Huffington Post that Jackson believed his personal obsession with his character would end if he was no longer a buffalo in the public eye.
He reportedly wore a mask and a ribbon to his nose to make headlines.
We'll tell you the truth. You can have your own opinion.
He knows how to manipulate the media. He knows exactly how to make headlines, says Feeds, who was Jackson's defensive coordinator for 10 years. He says that he wants to be the biggest cat in the world in his life.
He added: "The result of the fight against will is very sad.
Feeds also discusses allegations of child sexual abuse by Wade Robson and James Seafolk against Jackson, which have been broadcast on the highly controversial Emmy Award-winning documentary The Whale Left the Dream Island Tomb.
Robson and Seafunk both claimed that they were abused by Jackson for years as children.
Fides claims that the whole thing about pedophilia is nonsense... this guy has multiple girlfriends and is legally married to Lisa Marie Presley, and that's his life.
He claimed that Jackson's child abuse at the Dream Island ranch was impossible because his mother was barely on the farm.
He said: "They say there are a lot of boys around, but it's not true.
Jackson Winehouse denies all allegations about the late star. Jackson denied all allegations against him before his death in 2009.
15 other top tax officials have retired for corruption
The new Delhi:
The government has forced the retirement of 15 tax officials in the fourth round of the crackdown on alleged corruption and other misconduct.
According to official reports, under Article 56 (J) of the Basic Rules of the State of Jharkhand, the Central Committee for Indirect Taxes and Customs, which is responsible for overseeing the collection of goods and services tax and import tax, has forced the retirement of 15 senior officials for corruption and other allegations.
This is the fourth round of corrupt tax officials' dismissals since June this year. In the first three rounds, a total of 49 tax officials were forced to retire, including 12 officials of the Central Direct Tax Commission.
The sources said the move was in line with Prime Minister Modi's speech to the nation in Red Fort, when he had said that some of the harmful groups in the tax department could abuse power, harass taxpayers, either target honest assessments or overdo minor or procedural violations.
He said: "Well, we recently took strong measures to force the retirement of a considerable number of tax officials and we will not tolerate this behavior, oh".
Nearly half of the retired officials are those arrested by the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation for allegedly receiving illegal benefits. One of them was arrested for embezzling 15,000 rupees. One official was accused of possessing a huge source of assets unknown.
In June, the government forced the retirement of 15 officials of the Central Commission of Indirect Taxes and Customs on charges of corruption, receipt of bribes, smuggling and even conspiracy to commit crimes. Before that, the government had forced the retirement of 12 senior officials of the State Tax Department under Section 56 (J) of the Central Public Service Commissioner Pension (PSR) Rules on charges of corruption, sexual harassment, and large unknown assets.
In August, the government forced the retirement of 22 officials of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs. Article 56 of the Central Board of Public Servants (CBSP) Retirement Rules of 1972 (J) provides for a periodic review of the performance of government civil servants to determine whether they should remain or retire in the public interest.
Under these provisions, the situation of government employees as provided for in Article 56 (1) of the Basic Rules of Civil Service of 1972 (J) 56 (1) or Article 48 (1) (b) of the Pension of Civil Servants of the Central Government of the Republic of China (PENSION) shall be reviewed six months before they reach the age of 50-55 years, if they are in accordance with the situation described in Article 56 (1) of the Basic Rules of Civil Service of 1972 (J) 56 (J) or Article 48 of the Pension of Civil Servants of the Central Government of China (PENSION) of the Rules of Civil Service of 1972 (PENSION) 48 (PENSION) ).
A woman in Maine received 500 letters from United Health Insurance within five days
Stephanie Ray said her mailbox was blown up by a letter from an insurance company from Thursday to Monday.
The first wave of the news started last Thursday, when I received 46 letters, which she told the cable news network.
The letter was received, however, and as of Monday, it had received more than 500 letters.
The letters were mailed to her son with autism who lived in a private nursing home, she explained. But when the letter was unsealed, the name of her son was not mentioned, but rather the respected Maine Department of Health and Human Services, Cincinnati, said she told local media.
The letters were about claims of $54 or $0 outside the scope of the joint health insurance policy, Ms. Ray said.
When she asked why she received a bunch of letters from the United Health Insurance Company, she was told that it was because of the coding issues, she said.
In a statement, United Health Insurance told the cable news network that they were addressing the issue and could not provide further details given the privacy requirements.
We have identified the root cause of the problem. We sincerely apologize for the incident, and we have contacted the family and asked about their situation, the health insurance company said.
Ms. Ray said that at the bottom of each letter was a message calling for people to implement paperlessness.
Antonio Brown declares that he is not ready to retire
Antonio Brown announced that he would not retire from the NFL, and just days ago, he tweeted that he had announced his retirement from the NFL.
The four-time All-Pro receiver tweeted Thursday: "Oh, I'm in a very good condition now, why am I retiring now?"
Brown was accused of indecency by two women. He was released by the New England Patriots after a game last week. In the last six months, Antonio Brown has been dropped by three different teams.
Brown, who lost his Nike sponsorship last week, said he would start in Miami, training one day a week in high school.
Brown, 31, also had a Twitter fight with L.A. Rams safety guard Eric Weddle, who frequently came into contact with him during his time with the Baltimore Ravens.
HSBC to turn crime detection tools into new business
British hedge fund group (HBS) has converted the algorithm used to detect financial crime into a means to open up new business opportunities, which was forced into existence earlier in the money laundering scandal, the bank's head said.
The system combines relevant data on customer banking operations and company ownership with public data on the position of director to identify potential customers that are appropriate for HSBC staff and provide a way to connect with them through existing customer relationships.
HSBC's overall revenue strategy is to try to make more profits from its massive physical networks and customer data, and using data and AI to try to increase revenue is also part of the strategy, with overall revenue being a top priority for interim CEO Noel Quinn.
"This is the first time that financial crime prevention has been used for commercial purposes, and the business itself is low-risk and quick to get results", said Stuart Nevison, global head of HSBC's customer network bank.
HSBC declined to disclose how much profit the new system is expected to bring, but said the overall Silicon Network Profit Initiative has generated hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue.
This is also a significant step in HSBC's efforts to maintain its global operations, and some analysts and investors have previously said that the bank should scale down or withdraw from markets where profits are lower than the cost of capital, such as the US market.
In 2012, HSBC reached a $1.9 billion settlement with U.S. authorities over its failure to prevent drug traffickers from laundering money through its Mexican subsidiaries. Hundreds of millions of dollars of forced investment in financial crime compliance were part of the agreement.
The system can achieve its original design goal by mapping the relationships between individual customers and companies, finding abnormal transaction patterns, or exploring previously unknown links between the two.
The system has freed up the workforce of more than 400 employees who no longer have to manually verify transactions and records, but take on more customer service, said Adrian Rigby, chief operating officer of HSBC's trade operations.
Niveson of HSBC noted that they suddenly realized that a slight modification to the tool would allow them to use it to find more attractive potential customers with a green flag, rather than a red flag for illegal searches.
"We've gotten customer data sets, combined them with data from UK company registries, and then reversed the potential of previous algorithms to find customers, which could be done through registries, company development or links to existing customers", said Pennywise.
The tool has mapped 22.5 million UK entities and individuals and can identify a linking network in three minutes, and it often takes bankers three hours to manually map, he said.
Rouhani: Iran has been promised that the United States will lift all sanctions in exchange for dialogue
European countries are eager to negotiate with Iran, and have hinted that the United States will end Iran's sanctions if Tehran is willing to do so, President Hassan Rouhani said.
According to Rouhani, the European signatories to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal urged him to meet with US President Donald Trump and promise Washington to lift all sanctions in exchange for dialogue.
The three countries of the Six Nations - the German prime minister, the British prime minister and the French president - insisted on holding the meeting, saying that the United States would lift all sanctions, the Iranian president said.
He said he rejected the proposal because the negotiations would put the United States under extreme pressure and sanctions on Iran, and there was no way to predict any outcome.
Trump quickly denied any relief to Iran and tweeted that Tehran had asked him to lift the sanctions as a condition for dialogue, but he of course refused.
Rouhani also said in the statement that many countries expressed support for Iran in one-on-one talks during the UN General Assembly. We discussed a number of issues with the countries, all of which condemned the US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and its pressure actions.
Government to launch consultations on dog law review
The dog breeding laws in Scotland are under review due to concerns about animal mismanagement and the fault of the owners.
The Scottish Government has launched a consultation to seek public opinion.
The Scottish Minister for Community Safety has pledged to ensure community safety and avoid the blame of the owner, in order to determine whether laws against dogs that are out of control need to be amended.
Scottish MP Ash Denham said: "Well, we are doing two reviews of the dog law because we are absolutely committed to ensuring community safety and keeping people away from the innocent dog owners and their uncontrolled dogs".
The consultation is aimed at seeking advice on how to improve the implementation of the Dog Control Act 2010 in Scotland, and we will review all dog control legislation more broadly next year to assess whether it needs to be amended.
Dog breeding carries a certain responsibility, including keeping your dog under effective control, and I encourage anyone interested in this area to respond to our public consultations.
The public consultation will continue until 15 January, including proposals to strengthen and clarify existing regulations, such as whether a national dog control database should be established.
The Scottish Parliament's post-legislation oversight committee has been hearing testimony from victims and parents of children who have been attacked or killed by dogs, urging the government to review the dog law.
Members of the Scottish Parliament were told that there was a pressing need for reform of the legislation to protect vulnerable people and children.
The committee learned that in Glasgow and Clyde alone, 1,417 people were admitted to hospital emergency rooms last year after being bitten by dogs, including 255 children.
912 people were treated at Lanarkshire National Health Service and 439 at Ayrshire National Health Service, both of which were the highest numbers in four years.
In July, the committee's members concluded that the current dog law was not in line with its purpose and called on the Scottish Government to review all dog law in full.
Jenny Mara, the head of the committee, said that the dog-breeding laws in Scotland were not in line with the purpose. There are still many cases of dog attacks against children, but the current laws that may prevent these attacks are almost never implemented or understood.
It is clear that the current dog law has not been implemented. The current dog law needs to be reformed urgently in order to properly deal with uncontrolled and dangerous dogs, and we can try to build a system to prevent our children from being harmed by dogs.
The consultation, published on the government website on Friday, said: "The Uniform Code of Practice is key to tackling the issue of dogs in Scotland".
The review focuses on measures that can be taken to help aid enforcement agencies such as local authorities use their power to maintain community security.
Saudi Arabia to issue first tourist visas, abolish the rule of the Abaya robe
Currently, Saudi visas are issued only to foreign employees, their families and Muslim pilgrims.
Saudi Arabia said on Friday it would open up the ultra-conservative kingdom to holidaymakers for the first time with tourist visas to promote economic diversification and reduce dependence on oil.
Launching tourism is one of the core elements of Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 Reform Plan, which aims to prepare the largest Arab economies to develop in the post-oil era.
Just two weeks ago, the US government accused Iran of launching a devastating attack on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure that disrupted global energy markets and raised concerns about wider regional conflict.
The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country, said Ahmed Khalif, Director of the UAE Tourism Authority in a statement.
Visitors will be amazed... the gems we share are the five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the vibrant local culture and the stunning natural beauty.
According to the blog, Saudi Arabia will open online visa applications to citizens of 49 countries on Saturday.
Khalif said Saudi Arabia would also relax the strict dress code for foreign women, allowing them to not wear the Abaya robe, which remains the public dress that Saudi women must wear.
However, he added that foreign women will be required to wear modest clothes, but no details were given.
In the desert kingdom, which has many Bedouin sites and archaeological sites, visas are currently limited to foreign workers, their families and Muslim pilgrims to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
Saudi Arabia began issuing temporary visas to tourists last year to allow them to participate in sporting and cultural activities to kick-start the tourism industry, a rare move.
However, the kingdom is strictly prohibited from drinking and has strict social norms, which many see as a barrier to tourism.
Prince Mohammed is trying to change this with a comprehensive liberalisation movement that has brought new cinemas, mixed-gender concerts and sports feasts to Saudi Arabia.
Observers said that international criticism of Saudi human rights records, including the horrific murder of critic Jamal Khashoggi last year and the crackdown on women activists, could further undermine the attraction of foreign tourists.
Concerns over regional conflicts may also weaken Saudi tourism attraction after the September 14 attack on state-owned oil giant Amer Petrol.
The government has said it hopes that by 2030, the tourism sector's contribution to GDP will reach 10%, compared to only 3%.
Saudi Arabia is said to have a target of attracting up to 100 million domestic and foreign tourists a year by 2030.
But Saudi Arabia currently lacks the infrastructure to accommodate such a large number of tourists, and officials estimate that the country will need 500,000 more hotel rooms in the next decade.
The government said that the tourism industry is expected to create up to 1 million tourism jobs in the face of high-level youth unemployment.
Saudi Arabia has invested billions of dollars to build tourism from scratch.
In 2017, Saudi Arabia announced a multibillion-dollar project to transform 50 Red Sea islands and other original sites into luxury resorts.
Last year, the Kidia Dam Entertainment City Dam, a man-made development near Riyadh, will include a high-end theme park, motorsport facilities and a hunting area.
The country is also developing historical sites such as the hundreds of years old Medan Shaleh, the site of the sandstone mausoleum that was left over from the same civilization that built Petra in Jordan.
Facebook hides the praise points in a new test in Australia
Facebook said today that it had begun to hide the dynamic boosted numbers released in Australia, a test that could be rolled out globally in the future to ease social pressure.
From today, Facebook users in Australia can no longer see the number of reactions to dynamics posted by others and the number of video views they have, but they can still see how others react to their own dynamics.
We don't want people to feel like Facebook is a competition, okay?
The company said it wanted to test how people use the new version. We wanted to spend some time looking at user feedback on the new version to see if it could be promoted.
Facebook has more than a billion users worldwide, but the social media giant is also under pressure to prevent its impact on users' mental health.
According to the Australian Cybersecurity Commissioner, one in five children in Australia report being subjected to cyber-violence.
Facebook had tested a version of the hidden likes on its other major social media platform - Photo Wall - in July before making the decision.
The photo walls were first tested in Canada and then expanded to Australia, Brazil and several other major user markets.
Facebook says the test is intended to help people learn about the situation as early as possible through small-scale testing.
While the photo walls are already being tested, Facebook and the photo wall are different platforms, so we may get different test data, Liu said.
The social media giant has not confirmed how long the test will last.
"We want to know if removing the likes will improve the user experience while limiting other positive interactions", said Mike Garrick, head of Facebook Australia.
Hurricane Lorenzo is a Category 4 hurricane in the eastern Caribbean
The National Hurricane Center said that Hurricane Lorenzo had strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane on Thursday, with the storm's powerful waves likely to affect the Windward Islands and parts of South America.
The storm's epicenter was located about 1,660 miles southwest of the Azores, at 11 p.m. local time. Eastern Summer Time was updated. The storm moved northwest-northwestward at 14 miles per hour, with maximum sustained winds of 145 miles per hour.
The storm is not expected to land in the coming days, but Saturday's northeast winds could bring Lorenzo closer to the Azores in the coming week. Weather forecasters predict the storm will weaken to below 3 degrees on Monday.
The storm's powerful waves could cause life-threatening waves and high tides in the Windward Islands and northeastern South America.
Lorenzo was the second Category 4 or higher storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. Dorian reached Category 5 near the Bahamas.
According to Philip Krausbach, a meteorologist at Colorado State University, 16 named storms have formed in the Western Hemisphere (including the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Basins) since August 21.
Philip Krausbach tweeted: "This is the largest recorded life-threatening named storm in the Western Hemisphere between August 21 and September 21, breaking the old record of 15 named storms from 1984 to 2002".
Patriotic missile system in Saudi Arabia after Iran attacks on oil facilities
After regularly checking patriotic missile batteries at the Turkish military base in Gaziantep, Turkey, U.S. troops have been debating.
The Pentagon announced Thursday that the United States plans to send a patriotic missile battery, radar system and about 200 support personnel to Saudi Arabia following the attack on Saudi oil facilities earlier this month.
Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman wrote in a statement that Defense Secretary Mark Esper had approved the increase in troops in preparation for the deployment of the command. Although no decision has yet been made on the deployment, they will remain on high alert.
The increased military force included two Patriot battery cannon and a final high-altitude regional defense system, also known as the SAD anti-missile system.
The SAD anti-ship system is one of the most advanced missile systems in the world, capable of targeting incoming missiles and destroying them in the air. SAD interceptor shells are launched by launch vehicles, using dynamic energy to strike ballistic threats to destroy missiles.
Importantly, these initiatives demonstrate our commitment to regional partners and to security and stability in the Middle East. Other countries have accused Iran of causing disasters in the region, but we hope they will help strengthen Saudi defence capabilities, Jo Hoffman wrote.
The UN world leaders said President Donald Trump had criticized Iran's role in the attack on Saudi oil facilities. The UN General Assembly said on Tuesday that they should put pressure on Tehran to engage in diplomatic negotiations.
In his call against Iran's actions, Trump said: "All nations have a responsibility to act. No responsible government should finance Iran's killing. Iran will not be lifted but will only be harsher if it does not stop its dangerous actions".
On September 14, the world's largest oil refineries and fields went on strike, forcing Saudi Arabia to shut down half of its production operations. The drone strike, which resulted in the biggest oil price hike in decades, again raised concerns about conflict in the Middle East. Although countries widely believed that Tehran should be responsible for the attack, Iran has always insisted that it was not involved.
Tech jumper crashes into a large tow truck on California highway
The 28-year-old woman and seven others jumped at around 2 p.m. on Thursday, California Highway Patrol public information officer Ruben Jones told USCBC News Network.
The group was reportedly flying from the Lodi Jumper Center.
Jones said the woman hit a truck while the jumping team was landing near Lodi Airport.
In an interview with the TV station, Lisa Reyes was driving on Highway 99 with her father and brother in the car when the woman crashed.
She told the TV station: "The man struggled in the wind, but her body was falling down at a very, very fast speed.
Central Coast transformation disguising child rapists in court ordered to look directly at victims
In May 2017, the man, dressed in a tree-leafy costume, grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind and dragged her into a bush while she was on her way to a school on the Central Coast.
He then tied the girl to a tree and sexually assaulted her.
Shortly after his arrest, police searched his home and found many items related to the case.
The man pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual assault in connection with the attack, in addition to three other counts of seduction and sexual assault of another 11-year-old girl between August 2016 and April 2017.
The 12-year-old victim was walking along a path when she turned around and saw him suddenly emerging from the bush with a large branch and a knife in his hand.
The man was wearing a colorful tree-leaf disguise.
Although the girl repeatedly asked the man to stay, he still tied her neck with his hand and dragged her into the bushes.
The man said to the girl: "Don't cry, don't cry, or don't blame me for being rude to you".
He held a knife in his right hand, tied the girl's hands and feet with a nylon strap, and then tied her to a tree, violating her for almost an hour. After he let the girl go, the girl ran to school crying.
The man arrived at the workplace at about 9:30 am and had not yet been able to respond to several messages and calls from his colleagues.
His clothes were covered with mud, hay and bark, and he claimed to have been in a road rage accident when he and another driver stopped the car and drove it into the bushes and overturned the roadway.
The sentencing hearing for the man will continue on Tuesday.
No federal charges have been filed after California police shot black men
Federal authorities on Thursday refused to file a civil rights lawsuit against the Sacramento police against the unarmed black man who shot and killed the man, sparking protests and pushing for changes to state laws restricting law enforcement agencies from using lethal force.
The U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI said the federal review of the 2018 shooting of Stephen Clark, 22, showed that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute two police officers, Trens Mercadent and Jared Lovinette. Both would return to police positions to serve.
In March, the California Attorney General's Office declined to bring criminal charges against two police officers in California after nearly a year of investigation into the case. Attorney General Havel Becerra noted that evidence showed that the two officers had reason to believe their lives were threatened because the man was approaching them and was suspected of carrying a gun.
On Thursday, Sacramento Police also issued a statement saying that its internal investigation found no conduct by the two officers that violated the regulations or training requirements of the police department.
"While no police were found to have committed any illegal acts in the course of this incident or the events that led to it, we are determined to implement new strategies to prevent such a tragedy from happening again", said Daniel Hahn, the head of the Sacramento Police Department, in a statement.
Clark's brother, Frank Clark, posted a dynamic on Facebook Thursday, saying he was meeting with federal and local authorities at the time.
Police said they were convinced that Clark was holding a gun when he approached the police, and that he had fled the police chase and ran to his grandmother's backyard. Police caught him after reports that someone broke the glass of a car and the glass slide of an elderly neighbor's house that night.
Clark was approached by two policemen and the police fired seven shots at him.
The FBI examined relevant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, live video and recordings, police reports and autopsy reports, to determine whether the police were intentionally using force beyond an objective reasonable limit.
Last month, lawmakers added an amendment to the law that would make the use of deadly force, the oldest law enforcement agency in the United States, the most stringent law enforcement standard in the country after all police officers are trained.
The old California standard makes it very difficult for police to prosecute shooters, and even more difficult to convict them. It is based on the principle of a reasonable fear of being shot, which is that if prosecutors or reviewers believe police have reason to worry about their own safety, they can use lethal force.
The new law, which came into force on January 1, requires police to use lethal force only when it is necessary to respond to the threat of death from police or those around them.
Pope Francis warns tech executives to use AI for public benefit
Pope Francis warned tech executives, diplomats and financiers on Friday that creating AI and other forms of digital development races increase the risk of social inequality unless the work has an ethical assessment of the public interest.
Francis spoke at a meeting in the Vatican attended by government representatives, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists and ethicists. A small number of scholars and Catholic bishops attended the public interest conference in the digital age.
The Vatican hopes to play a role in the prospects and the dangerous debate on AI, and this three-day conference is the latest proof of this idea.
The debates included technological advances in warfare, the increasing reliance on machines for future work, case studies of the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand, and decisions made by social media companies following the video of the massacre.
In his speech at the General Assembly, Francis praised the potential of technological advances and pointed out that machines kept workers out of danger and avoided unilateral labor during the early years of the Industrial Revolution. But Francis also warned that increasing reliance on robots for profit could deprive people of the dignity of their labor.
He warned: "If technological progress is the cause of increasing inequality, it is not true progress". He warned: "If so-called technological progress becomes the enemy of the public interest, then the whole society will unfortunately degenerate into a barbaric era ruled by the strongest laws".
The conference organizers said they wanted to use the expertise of the participants to find the right advisor for the Catholic Church on high-tech issues in the future.
The House of Representatives voted Friday to block President Donald Trump from issuing a national emergency declaration, which Trump wants to use to fund his proposed border wall.
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed a resolution ending the Trump operation by a vote of 236 to 174 and sent it to the President. Eleven Republicans and one Independent Party member expressed support for the resolution. The Senate passed the measure by a vote of 54 to 41 as 11 Republicans joined the Democratic ranks.
Trump may veto the resolution, which would be his sixth time as president to block legislation in Congress. In March, he vetoed a measure ending a state of emergency.
Both Houses of Congress seem to have failed to reach the two-thirds majority needed to overturn the veto.
In February, after failing to obtain the funds needed to build the desired southern border wall from the Mexican government and Congress, Trump declared a national emergency. The Trump administration plans to allocate $3.6 billion from military construction funds to border projects.
Democrats accuse Trump of not only circumventing the Congressional purse but also using critical defense funds to create unnecessary barriers. Minority Republicans in the House and Senate also fear that Trump's statements will lead to future overthrow.
Republicans in some of the upcoming Senate elections are under enormous political pressure to vote on a state of national emergency.
Google is launching its 21st anniversary graffiti: Stories you didn't know
Google celebrates its birthday with a graffiti. The graffiti is a computer photo in the style of the 1990s, featuring a Google search page and a date tag from September 27, 1998, surrounded by a colored Google cardboard. The search results page will display a smaller graffiti, with a Google logo designed to be a 21 digit-shaped tag. The search giant was founded 21 years ago by Larry Page and Sheryl Brynne, students at Stanford University in California. However, September 27 is not Google's actual birthday.
If you think that the company's birthday is September 4, 1998, then Google was born on September 4, 1998, however, the company never celebrated its birthday on this day, at least not in the form of a graffiti.
Originally, the search engine was called the Google Web Reptile Monkey, and later changed its name to Google Monkey.
Well, we named our system Google because it was a common spelling of Google (or 10100) which was in line with our goal of building a massive search engine, as Sergey Brin and Larry Page wrote in a paper published in 1998 about the introduction of the large-scale search engine prototype.
The company was founded by Andy Betolsheim, co-founder of Solar Computer System, who invested $100,000; in June 1999, the company raised $25 million from Redwoods Capital and Kaizen Warner. Google moved to the Mountain View office that same year, where it remains today. In 2001, the company's technology was patented.
From a web search engine to a large corporate group of corporate letter shareholders, Google is a subsidiary. Today, Google operates globally in more than 100 languages, answering trillions of search queries every year.
Google wrote on our story page: "The relentless search for better answers is still the core of everything we do". Today, Google has over 60,000 employees in 50 different countries, from pipelines, Android to heartbeats, and of course Google searches, developing hundreds of products for billions of people around the world. Although we abandoned the Lego server and the company added only a few dogs, our passion for building technology for everyone has continued to accompany us from our dorm rooms to our garage to this day.
Trump denies Iran claims the US proposed a drop in oil prices after lifting sanctions
On 10 January 2019, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani delivered a speech at a ceremony in Tehran, Iran.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani claimed on Friday that the US proposal to lift all sanctions against Iran in exchange for negotiations led to a drop in oil prices. President Donald Trump and the US State Department later denied the claims, causing oil prices to bounce back from low points.
The latest price of West Texas medium crude oil futures fell to $55.91, down 0.9%, down to $54.79 before that. Brent crude futures prices fell to $61.89, down 1.4%.
According to Reuters, Rouhani said on his official website that the German prime minister, the British prime minister and the French president were both in New York and insisted on convening the meeting. The United States said it would lift the sanctions.
Trump later responded to Iran, and of course not! He said Iran hopes he can lift the sanctions so that a meeting can be held.
According to Bloomberg News, the State Department said the report was unfounded and added that the United States was determined to reduce Iranian regime oil exports to zero.
On September 14, a series of drone strikes on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia forced the country to cut oil production in half, after which Rouhani commented. The United States and some European countries, as well as Saudi Arabia, blamed the attack on Iran. Tehran denies any role in the incident. The Trump administration also announced plans to deploy U.S. troops to the region.
The State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment from U.S. consumer news and business channels.
John Kildov, a revivalist in capital, said that the easing of tensions in the US may not be seen as a long-term solution, which would prompt a return to the market of large quantities of oil.
"This is not just about Iranian production and exports, but also the millions of barrels of oil in floating oil storage facilities and the millions of barrels of oil that are waiting for customs clearance in Chinese ports", said Ban Ki-moon.
Trump last year ordered the United States to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran, the United States and five other countries, which lifted sanctions against Iran in exchange for its commitment to halt its nuclear program.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has been the target of U.S. sanctions for decades, with Washington accusing it of the recent attack on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, which Tehran denies. Iran also shot down a U.S. military drone and announced plans to execute 17 suspected U.S. spies.
Afghanistan strengthens security in response to presidential elections
Afghanistan has launched a nationwide security operation to prepare for the national presidential election on Saturday.
The government will arrange about 100,000 security guards to guard the polling stations to respond to the threat posed by the Taliban.
Many voters - especially those in rural areas - will remain at home fearing reprisals, while others say the voting system is for the powerful and not for the poor.
Royal News: How Princess Jones Angrily Deals with Hostile Family Members
On Thursday, the Duke and Duchess of York announced that their eldest daughter, Princess Jones, was engaged to her boyfriend, 34-year-old estate tycoon Edward Mapley Moss. As the ninth heir to the British throne, the Princess will marry Mapley Moss next year. The couple said in a statement: "We are all excited to start this journey together.
We have many similar interests and values, and we know that this will be of great benefit to us in the years ahead of love and happiness.
Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, the parents of Princess of Wales, also expressed their excitement.
The Duchess of York tweeted: "Oh, I know how my mother feels, so I shed tears of joy.
Andrew and I are the luckiest people because we have two wonderful nieces and nephews.
The Royal Wedding will be an opportunity for the entire Royal Family to reunite, hoping to fully restore the relationship between the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh.
Since Sarah was involved in one of the biggest scandals in the Royal Family's history, her relationship with other members has become unusually difficult.
In 1992, five months after announcing her split from Prince Andrew, a photo of her and her younger financial advisor, Anne, taken at a holiday villa in St. Tropez, was unveiled.
Among the photos, John Bryan, a Texas millionaire, kissed and sucked the princess's ankles and bows, and Prince Philip reportedly reacted most strongly to the scandal.
However, he was reportedly shocked by the behaviour of the Duchess of York, who claimed that her mother was the victim of a behaviour that made her feel unpopular.
Kate and William: The couple's shock habits are exposed
The Duchess's spokesperson could not comment, but a friend of Fiona said: "It is no secret that the daughters of the Princess are very bored with the way the members of the Royal Family treat their mothers".
She was also a member of the National Association of Realtors.
They have been blaming their father for allowing this to happen, especially Jones, who has been begging Prince Andrew not to treat their mother as an exiled person.
In October last year, at the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank, Philip and Sarah were photographed together for the first time in 26 years.
The second wave of strikes in Oregon
State University staff complained that the main focus was on low wages and lack of dignity in the workplace. The pay gap was staggering. About half of these workers earned less than $40,000 a year (hundreds of people earned less than $25,000 a year). At the same time, the average annual salary for university presidents was $500,000 and for four university sports coaches was slightly lower, totaling $1 million. Although the salary for school administrators was six, overall administrative spending was still high, and one-sixth of the secret staff were eligible for food stamps.
As Alexander Segula, another information technology worker at Portland State University, said: "I am willing to go on strike because I think it's unfair that the wages paid to people can't guarantee the lives of the cities they serve".
As inflation intensified, the cost of living in Oregon soared, and these workers were in trouble, with management barely expressing sympathy. Contract negotiations that began in February were interrupted in mid-August. At that time, employers made some particularly excessive suggestions to slightly increase the cost of living, rejecting the qualifications of long-term university staff, and employees were treated with disrespect and even cruelty.
He continued: "For decades, educators have been attacked. We have finally stood up and fought back. Business executives can face class discrimination and the middle class being squeezed when they see their relatively jealous pay rising at a rate higher than inflation. But what happens in education is not tolerated by workers.
Oregon State University staff are not the only group to take action. Oregon is now a struggling firecracker, with the insurance wire burning and hot and bright. Grocery store workers at Fred Meyer's supermarket chain are campaigning against employers, although there are no formal strike plans yet, but tensions are escalating; their union, the Food and Commercial Workers' Union Local 555, has called for a joint boycott and has filed a report on unfair labor practices against the chain.
In the healthcare sector, the local 49 members of the International Federation of Service Employees of Kaisa Medical Institutions (IFSA) of 4,500 service employees would approve the strike if they did not reach an agreement before the expiration of their existing contracts in October (just to avoid it temporarily by a new interim agreement) (the approval rate was 98%) . In other areas of the industry, the Oregon Nurses Association, which represents more than 120 nurses at Astoria Hospital, is stuck in contract negotiations with the hospital administration, whose last contract expires on 5 May and the time is very pressing.
Burley explained that the labor movement in Oregon was very strong and was indeed very thorough. This was part of the wave of labor growth across the country. People saw economic instability, real wages were falling, and the solution was to take collective action in the workplace.
It is not clear to what extent this collective action will be carried out this fall, but it is certainly appropriate if the major strikes return to the Northwest in 2019. We can only hope that this spirit of action will spread further to the Midwest, to the South, to the Texas oil fields, to the Appalachian coal mines, to the Northeast, to the Silicon Valley tech giants and to any other sectors and industries in between.
Political Civilization: New Awards Program to eliminate Westminster's divisions and honor politicians who have been polite
The new awards program is designed to honor politicians who have been polite.
After the parliamentary session, Westminster opened a week of uninterrupted debate.
During this week of debate, MPs were outraged by threats and comments by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and others.
The Nobel Prize for Political Civilization was announced last Friday to reward political figures with £3,000 a year for charity.
Boris Johnson was criticized for his tone in the House of Commons
Sir Stuart announced the award: "Everyone agrees that British politics is facing a crisis of trust and a crisis of civilization.
The UK's growing Brexit debate, growing divisions and pain, and we believe that politics must respond, not react to these trends, but resist them.
These awards are a small attempt by a group of people to bring attention to politicians - whether they are different or not - who defend their cause in a more formal and polite way, and politicians who can transcend the differences that affect us all, and who engage and collaborate with people".
The nominations will be announced in cycle six and the awards ceremony will be held in March next year.
Former Cabinet Minister Amber Ladd, in an exclusive interview with the British Standard Evening Post today, accused Johnson of using provocative language that did incite violence.
Johnson said he regretted the threat to parliament.
Jesse Phillips is terrified of the monkey after receiving death threats from a mother who is afraid of her mother.
On Thursday, Labour MP Jesse Phillips - another critic of Johnson - said a man was arrested after trying to open the door to her constituency office, allegedly when the man shouted he was a fascist.
Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Joe Swenson addressed police after a young child was threatened.
The daughter of Labour MP Yvette Cooper, Ellie Cooper posted a quick spread post on Twitter describing her concerns about her mother after Cox's murder.
The US income gap is the highest ever.
Last year, the gap between the rich and the poor was the highest since the U.S. Census Bureau began statistics on income in 1967. Washington and New York are the largest income gaps.
The United States may be the richest country in the world, but it is also the way it is: the super-rich can continue to grow in any way, and a poor family often relies on the slums to finance health care. Economic imbalances affect both wealth and income, which are at an all-time high.
One way to measure income gap is the Gini coefficient. The Gini coefficient is 0, representing absolute average, and the maximum is 1, representing the assumption that a household has all the income in the country. The Census Bureau has been tracking this indicator for over 50 years. The Gini coefficient in the United States was 0.397 in 1967, but has risen to a peak of 0.485 in 2018.
There are also other countries in the world with more income gaps, including some fairly strong economies. For example, the World Bank estimated the Guinea Coefficient in South Africa in 2014 at 0.63 and the Guinea Coefficient in Brazil in 2017 at 0.53.[6] In contrast, all EU countries have a Guinea Coefficient below 0.4.[7]
New data shows that the worst income gaps are often in areas of wealth concentration, including Washington, D.C., New York, and Connecticut, and, of course, some poor areas, such as Puerto Rico and Louisiana, U.S.A. whereas the five states with the highest levels of economic equality are Utah, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota.
Census Bureau data also showed that the average household income growth stalled at over $62,000. This is the highest level measured by the U.S. Community Survey, but the growth was only 0.8 from 2017 to 2018, a significant decrease from the previous three years, which is almost unlikely to increase given inflation.
New statistics are likely to guide the direction of the Democratic nominees for next year's presidential election, with Democrats generally supporting more taxes on the super-rich and big business.
This could also undermine the ideological basis behind the current government's corporate tax incentive policies, which were approved by Congress in 2017 to convince multinational companies to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States while also sending income to the middle class and poor. In fact, these policies seem to only bring extra income to executives, while most other Americans miss the benefits of record-low economic growth and unemployment.
A North Carolina man draws five times in the same lottery draw
A North Carolina man draws five times in the same lottery draw, including the $163,634 grand prize.
Garland Lancaster of Pickville told a North Carolina education lottery official that while he was staying at the Weissam Brothers Company in Pickville, he bought five cash lotteries with his own five-digit number, with five draws available on Monday night.
When the lottery was drawn, my wife helped me write the numbers, and Lancaster said, "Oh, when my wife handed me the paper, I couldn't believe it when I checked the lottery. One line matched five numbers, the other line matched four numbers. I shouted, and I won!
Lancaster has a row of five numbers matching the middle order, for which he won a $163,634 prize, while the remaining four numbers matching the respective middle order numbers for which he won a $250 prize.
The winner of the award said he intends to use the money to pay his bills and to renovate some houses.
Tristan Thompson, the ex-boyfriend of Corel Cardassian, left another highly provocative comment on her photo wall, which was previously rumored to be about to be mixed up with Cardassian.
Tristan Thompson, the ex-boyfriend of Corel Cardassian, left another highly provocative comment on her photo wall, which was previously rumored to be about to be mixed up with Cardassian.
Earlier this year, the 35-year-old star completely abandoned the National Basketball Association player after Thompson was accused of spying on family friend Jordan Woods - before Tristan had cheated on Cole when she was nine months pregnant with their daughter, Troy.
One of the people found Tristan left another warm compliment on the front page of Cole's photo wall.
However, Tristan, 28, refused to give up easily - leaving an embarrassing overstatement on his latest self-portrait of his ex-girlfriend.
In this blurry photo, Cole stands before the rising sun and writes as a mother on the photo: "I wish you the courage to explore every dream you have".
In a public commentary, Richterstein wrote: "The sun shines brightly on your beautiful [diamond face]".
Fans were angry with the comment and someone replied: "Oh yes, the diamond you dropped".
When Cole was nine months pregnant, Tristan betrayed her.
Another fan warned: "The fox rolled out the photo wall".
The third person wrote: "Please don't cry, Mr. Cole".
Just days ago, Tristan wrote: "A perfectly dressed woman with heart-shaped eyes next to her is underneath another photo of Cole in a reality show, a photo she modeled for a pair of jeans for Gales".
Earlier this month, Tristan, on Drake's advice, spent £400,000 to buy Cole a Porsche in an attempt to merge with Cole.
Earlier this year, he was accused of spying on his friend Jody Wood, a friend of the Cardassian family.
After his rap partner urged him to come to a big action party, Tristan decided to pick the favourite gift, the Porsche 911.
Eventually, his friends said Tristan won Cole's invitation to a cocktail dinner at her home on Tuesday - a step away from getting back together with Cardassian and their 17-month-old daughter, Tru.
A source said that Puterstein and Drake were good friends and that he had been asking Drake for advice when he was planning to get back to Cardassian.
The infidelity of Tristan has broken Cole's heart
"Dreck told him that if he wanted to get back to Cole, he had to go all the way".
"It may not sound very reasonable to exchange a random dinner for a trendy supercar, but it is a good idea to have a supercar".
But after Tristan did this, Cole didn't immediately spread the red carpet for him.
The couple are the parents of 17-month-old Tru.
In the new season of the reality show The Simpsons and the Kardashians, a 16-episode trailer for the series, Cole Kardashian is crying silently over the cheating of boyfriend Tristan Thompson.
The Sun reported last month that Tristan had planned to invite Cole on a romantic trip to Greece after taking an oath: "Oh, I'll get my family back".
Although Cole was heartbroken by Tristan's continued betrayal during their courtship, he invited Tristan to their daughter, Troy,'s first birthday party earlier this year.
However, the star's family reality show co-creator and fellow contestant Kardashian later revealed that the incident ended with Cole having a hard time accepting Tristan's infidelity.
Children's Hospital freezer fails, 56 children with cancer have lost their stem cells
A failure in the refrigerator at Children's Hospital Los Angeles caused the destruction of 56 children's blood stem cells, which were collected and stored for future use at the beginning of each patient's treatment for the tumor.
In a statement, the hospital said: "We deeply apologize for the pain or confusion caused to patients and their families. If you do not receive letters or calls from our team, your children will not be affected".
All patients have received basic treatment, except one patient. Chief Medical Officer James Stein said the patient did need to recover stem cells.
The letters sent to the families of patients in early September informing them of the loss of stem cells were accidentally sent to the children, not the parents.
The hospital said that the damage to long-term storage stem cells did not harm the health of any children. The hospital has also provided assistance to families who want to retrieve them.
One patient called it a "bad-mouthed" treatment. 13-year-old Sean Anderson Corona was treated with stem cells after being diagnosed with stage 4 neuromal cell tumor (a cancer commonly found in the prostate gland). The boy was kept in the machine all day, and the machine would collect stem cells from his blood.
"I'm going to try to sleep, but my body will start to get sick, and then I'm going crazy and crying", Corona told ABC-7.
In November, Corona will have been without cancer for three years. But his mother Elizabeth Anderson said she was worried that if his cancer did recur, it might not be possible to extract more stem cells from his blood.
Stine said that only when patients need stem cells to recover from their disease would it be recommended to recover them.
He said: "Oh, we think it's almost unlikely, so we won't ask anyone to do it in advance".
The hospital has replaced the freezer, and the sensor monitoring and alarm system has been upgraded.
And it's obviously a huge expense for us. "We'll contact each family personally to make sure all their questions are answered".
Prince Harry attacked Princess Diana's mother-in-law walking through the Angolan region
It was the sixth day of the Duke of Sussex's visit to Africa with his wife, Meghan and Archie. But on Friday morning Prince Harry returned to Angola alone, intending to inherit the legacy of his mother, Queen Diana.
Harry, wearing a bright blue protective vest provided by the Halo Trust, successfully inherits his mother's legacy. Twenty-two years ago, Princess Diana left her mark on a similar road, through an area of deadly landmines buried in Angola, which were left behind during the Civil War. This became one of the most iconic images of her short life.
On 15 January 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales, wearing a protective vest and a mask, visited a lighthouse in Angola, which was cleaned up by the Charity Trust.
Diana had been working hard to eliminate these weapons of war, but she died in her lifetime, just months before the International Covenant on the Prevention of the Use of Chemical Weapons was signed in December 1997.
Twenty years later, the world is still unable to escape the threat of landmines. Prince Harry exploded a newly discovered mine, responding loudly and clearly to his mother's legacy.
Prince Harry said that the mine was a wound from war that has no cure. Through the mine we can help the local community achieve peace, and peace will bring opportunity.
Prince Harry has detonated the latest detected landmine in Angola.
Thomas Cook pension trustee planning spending to save the deal
The Thomas Cook-owned pension fund has begun negotiating a deal with professional insurers to save the retirement plan benefits of the bankrupt tourism group.
Sky News reported that Steves Steer, chairman of the board, is in talks with several companies to negotiate a buy-and-let deal that would significantly reduce the pension payments of the majority of the 140,000 members of the Thomas Cook pension plan.
Any transaction with the insurance company could involve spending cuts, which is much smaller than the 10% spending cuts triggered by transferring the pension plan to the Pension Protection Fund lifeboat.
The discussion is still in its very early stages - even if successful - until an agreement is reached after the Pension Protection Fund evaluates the Thomas Cook program.
Thomas Cook's owners are facing an investigation into the reasons for the group's collapse
The investigation could take two years and if the Thomas Cook scheme does introduce a pension protection fund, spending on about 10,000 pensioners will be reduced by 10% in the future.
According to reports, several pension risk transfer experts, as well as at least one new "superfund" integration company, are in talks with Thomas Cook's trustees about the deal.
Four days after the UK's longest-running travel company went into a four-day hiatus, news of trustees' efforts to secure membership benefits sparked an international repatriation scheme that resulted in thousands of unemployed people.
Thomas Cook's deep bankruptcy sparked a fierce blame game where board members, government ministers and auditors all needed to explain their actions in the months leading up to the group's bankruptcy.
According to the latest data, four pension plans at Thomas Cook are well funded, with an excess of £100 million under the Pension Protection Fund.
The company has a total of about £1.5 billion in assets under management.
However, Sky News revealed last month that the trustees had asked for more favorable terms to the rescue deal proposed by Thomas Cook, which complicated the deal.
Thomas Cook's bankruptcy ended his 178-year-old ability to pay deal, prompting government bankruptcy services, accounting regulators and an influential committee of MPs to investigate Thomas Cook.
Ministers have set up a task force to deal with the crisis, which has left creditors with limited profits after the group's bankruptcy.
To date, less than half of Thomas Cook's overseas UK customers have returned to the country.
Just hours before the bankruptcy, Thomas Cook issued a final petition to his lending institution to reduce the need for funding of £200 million.
What is the problem with Thomas Cook?
Negotiations ended on Sunday night, but no agreement was reached, and Thomas Cook was forced to seek new funding of over £10 billion, the latest in its madness.
It was founded in 1841 by Thomas Cook, a 32-year-old furniture carpenter and former Baptist minister, who introduced the idea of a day-train trip from Leicester to Loughborough, which required a ticket per person.
Since then, Thomas Cook has grown to become one of the world's largest holiday companies, marking its 175th anniversary three years ago.
A spokesperson for the Pension Protection Fund said: "Some bankruptcies, such as the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook, were the reason for the creation of the Pension Protection Fund.
If we provide financial security for the future of the members of the fixed income pension scheme, the members of the scheme should be confident that we will protect them.
A spokesman for the Thomas Cook Pension Trust declined to comment on Friday.
The images show newborn rhinos with their nostrils and exploring new homes.
The baby, named Stella, was born earlier this month at the Cotswold Wildlife Park in Oxfordshire, the first female baby born to Monty and Ruby.
The young are healthy and well cared for, as can be seen from the photos, and are curious about their surroundings and sleep with their mother on a crawling bed.
In 2009, mother Ruby and another female named Nancy joined the zoo in hopes of having the first baby rhino in the park with Monty.
In 2013, Nancy gave birth to the next female cub named Astrid, Stella, the third female cub born in the park's 49 years of development.
Jamie Craig, the director of the Cotswold Wildlife Park, said: "We have had great success in breeding existing rhino populations.
Munstra is the sixth child of Nancy and Ruby, and our bull Monty has proven to be an excellent father.
The mother of the boy was the perfect combination of a ruling bull and a caring parent.
It was especially pleasing to the mother that Ruby gave birth to a calf that was vital to the development of her breeding plan, and that Stella would eventually be transferred to another group, hoping to become a successful mother herself.
Ruby has previously given birth to two male cubs, Ian in 2015 and Alan in 2017. Alan remains at the park, while Ian is at the Turin Zoo in Italy.
When he was only a week old, Allen weighed about 11 pounds.
Captive births are considered extremely rare. Females reproduce only once every two and a half to five years, so the window of opportunity for successful reproduction is limited.
According to the park, female rhinoceroses typically have a gestation period of 16 to 18 months before they can produce a young.
It is considered to be one of the longest-living animals in land mammals, after elephants at 22 months.
The newborn rhinos can only stand for an hour after birth. After birth, the rhinos attempt to suck at once, although their legs may be slightly unstable for the first few days.
It will suck up about a year of milk under the watchful eye of its mother.
They are very close, and the young rhinoceros will stay with their mother for at least two years under her protection. The females will be very active in protecting their offspring and if challenged, they will intimidate their opponents.
Alex Minassian, a man who volunteered to be alone, told Toronto police that he was a member of the 4chan website organization.
The man in the picture allegedly killed 10 pedestrians in Toronto, told police he was a member of an online gang of sexually insane men.
Alex Minassian, 26, said he was a member of the 4chan website's non-voluntary singles forum.
Following the April 23, 2018 attacks, he is now facing 10 counts of murder and 16 counts of attempted murder in Canada.
When asked about the dead, he told police: "Oh, I feel like I've accomplished my mission".
The incident sparked a lot of interest in the online world of loneliness, anger and anti-feminism.
Minassian said he had been in contact with a killer in California who was angry at his wife for refusing to accept him.
He was accused of driving a rented pickup truck into a crowd in a busy community in northern Toronto. Eight women and two men were killed, ranging in age from 22 to 94 years old.
Minassian has not yet filed a defence. His trial began in February, but the publication ban on him from being questioned by police has been lifted today.
Minassian said he had never given up on a girlfriend and was a boy, admitted to using the van as a weapon and said he wanted to launch more attacks.
He said: "Well, a few other people I know online feel the same way, but they are too scared to take action to expose their anger".
The Minnesota-based group called themselves the "Minnesota Singles", which is an acronym for the "Minnesota Non-Voluntary Singles". The non-voluntary singles movement is an online subcultural group associated with the deadly attacks in Toronto and attacks in California and Florida. The group promotes the idea of hatred of women, that men have the right to have sex with women.
Sociologists and other scholars of the group believe that the term "non-voluntary single parent" has become a popular term for anger among men who are angry at women's rejection and tend to take violent revenge.
In online forums, people with an interest in sex sometimes use the terms "Chantadine" and "Chantadine" as disparaging slang for men and women who are more sexually active, respectively.
Minassian said he discussed his sexual misconduct on 4chan, a site that has become notorious for extremist views.
US court lines fear shooting repeats, ban clown viewers from watching Joe dressed
The largest independent theater in the United States forbids audiences dressed in Joe's to watch the critically acclaimed Joker - the story of the super-rebel in Batman movies. Although theaters have banned people from wearing masks or painted faces, safety concerns remain.
Most of the U.S. courtroom has banned viewers from wearing masks, painting faces or carrying toy weapons, as a result of a major shooting in Aurora, Colorado, during the 2012 release of another Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises. The gunman dressed in a clown costume shot at the audience and threw tear gas, killing 12 and injuring 70.
However, the Landmark Theatre announced that it would not allow Joe's dressed audience to watch the limited-run movie The Clown.
I hope the audience is more relaxed when they see the movie, Landmark's chairman and CEO, Ted Mondov, told Hollywood reporters.
The Los Angeles-based company, with 52 theaters in 27 locations nationwide, is the largest professional cinema chain in the United States.
Meanwhile, the largest chain of movie theaters in the United States, the Kansas-based American Multi-Hall Cinema, reiterated that the theater prohibits wearing masks, coloring people's faces or any objects that obscure their faces, but welcomes viewers in costume.
The ban on masks and fake guns was a practical safety concern, but as the release of the film "The Clown" approached, there was a fear that it would trigger a simulated shooting. The Los Angeles Police Department said that on the day of the premiere, police would be standing guard around the theater, while the Emperor's Theatre, the second largest chain of cinemas in the United States, said it was implementing security measures to develop the film in cooperation with NATO.
The U.S. Army even warned soldiers to beware of the unwillingly single men, often men who are unhappy with not being given the chance to date, who worship clowns and may imitate his cruel behavior.
The Joker, directed by Todd Phillips and starring Jacqueline Phoenix, is set to hit theaters nationwide on October 4 with predictions that the film will hit a new box office record. The film's protagonist is a descendant of an isolated, mentally unstable man who becomes a killer, with green hair, gray hair, and a miserable white face, and is Batman's ultimate enemy.
The film received positive reviews upon its premiere at the Venice Film Festival and won the Golden Lion Award, the highest award. It is a psychological thriller based on the comic book of the same name. Some critics fear that the film may have a negative impact because the film is sympathetic to the rebel protagonists and the violent images are too real. However, the film's main creative team said that the audience is adults who can clearly tell whether or not the film is true.

Romania spends billions on military bases in the Black Sea
According to the focus news agency, citing the Times of Thailand, Romania will spend €2.5 billion on modernizing its military base in the Black Sea to counter Russia's growing influence in the region. Documents published by local news websites show that the Mikhail Kogrignihanov air base, located about 200 kilometers east of Bucharest, will be in line with NATO standards. It will accommodate up to 10,000 NATO F-35 fighter jets.
The base has become the center of NATO's increased activity in the Black Sea, while the Black Sea has become a key area of tension between Russia and the West. After Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin began using its deep-sea base in Sevastopol to carry out naval missions in Syria to increase naval strength in the Black Sea. Russia also obstructed transportation to the region, capturing three Ukrainian ships in the Red Sea last year.
Romania and Bulgaria, former Soviet allies, joined NATO and the European Union after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In response to Russia's actions, they demanded NATO strengthen its forces in the region. In February, 500 US troops arrived at the Romanian air base. A squadron of British Air Force European Typhoon fighters has been stationed and completed deployment. Since April, these Russian fighters have been intercepted several times. Georgia, located on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, is also concerned about Russia's ambitions.
The fall of the new Berlin Wall, the fall of Ukraine, is another scandal
Boroshenko's desire to win the support of President Trump, who was increasingly worried that political opponents would block his re-election, paved the way for Julian to pressure the then-Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Yuri Lukashenko (later fired), to investigate Joe Biden and his son and help with the Trump re-election.
But it is unclear how the Trump administration hopes to help him turn the tide before the two presidential elections in Ukraine in March and April this year. In any case, he was hit hard and lost to Zelensky, whose officials soon became the new target of the Trump team to begin the fight against Biden.
While Democrats want President Trump impeached for his involvement in Ukraine, the president and his allies have countered with the self-made Ukraine scandal. They reiterate a disclosed claim that Ukraine colluded with the Clinton campaign team to reduce Trump's chances of running in 2016, and claim that Biden used his vice presidency to prevent Ukraine from investigating his son, with little evidence.
Over the years, the Ukrainian people have grown tired of seeing their leaders use their power and privileges in exchange for their personal economic or political interests; today, most Ukrainians are oblivious to what may be the worst scandal in the White House against the Trump administration since the overthrow of President Richard Nixon in 1974.
Ukraine, which was once the center of attention of few Americans, is now the center of Washington's attention, which is a source of great confusion in Ukraine. This feeling is also a source of pride, as after centuries of being in the shadow of Russia, the powerful northern neighbor, Ukraine is no longer considered a dead-water country, but incredibly a staging ground for the fate of the world's most powerful nation.
This week, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin tweeted a sharp message that the prospect of Ukraine being the country that led to the impeachment of the US president is not great.
Brother of Pakistani netizen Kardel Baroh sentenced to life in prison for honor killing
Karder Baroh, who was famous for his social media photos, was hanged in July 2016.
The brother of Pakistani social media star Carndale Baroh was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison on Friday, the country's most notorious murder case.
Baroh rose to fame for her humorous self-portraits, which were not considered anything by Western standards, but were considered provocative in Pakistan, which was highly anti-feminist, and she was hanged in July 2016.
Her brother Mohamed Wasim was arrested. A few days later, he told a press conference that he did not regret anything he had done, admitting that his sister was murdered by him, and that his sister's behavior was intolerable.
His lawyer Sadr Mehmud told AFP that a court in the eastern city of Multan had found his party guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment, a highly impressive verdict.
He said: "If the situation allows, he will be acquitted by the High Court, yes".
Earlier, Baroh's mother, Anwar May, told AFP that she had hoped her son would be released without charge.
My mother said, "He is innocent. My daughter was killed, and my son was murdered".
Baroh's murder made international headlines and again called for action to combat the spread of the so-called "honor killing" of a victim, usually a woman, who was murdered for violating paternal social norms.
Women were burned, shot, stabbed and strangled for their freedom to choose their husbands or wives in the Baroh case for praising their gender and bringing shame to their families.
The murder is usually committed by relatives. Under the Pakistani Blood Debt and Retaliation Act, they can seek forgiveness from the relatives of the victims.
Three months after Baroh's murder, Parliament passed new legislation that would sentence those who killed in defence of their honour to life imprisonment.
However, whether murder is defined as a felony is decided by the judge, which means that, in theory, the killer can claim different motives but still be granted amnesty.
In the case of Baroh, her parents initially insisted that they would not forgive their son.
But when they realized that they were too sorry to lose their son, they changed their minds and said they hoped that he would be forgiven.
The international community's reaction to the murder prompted the Pakistani government to take an unprecedented step to declare the government jointly with parents as the heir to the victim, but this forced the case to continue.
Some of Barokh's well-known acts include performing strip dances for the Pakistan cricket team and wearing a coveted orange red dress on Valentine's Day.
Her actions have received some criticism and threats, but many, including young people, believe that the Kim Kardashian-like figure can be seen as a bold, empowering political act that opened a new way for the country.
The origins of the practice of honor killings are in tribal social norms, which remain prevalent throughout South Asia and specifically regulate the behavior of women, although men may also be victims.
Three Scottish students named best students in Europe
Three students from the University of Dundee in the UK were named best graduates in Europe.
In the 2019 Global Undergraduate Student Awards, three students at Dundee University were named the best graduates in Europe in their respective fields, while five other students at the university also received recognition from the judging panel.
Scott Sherrick graduated with a degree in molecular genetics, winning the European Best Graduate Award in Life Sciences; Chester Comford pursued a Master of Science in Mental Health Care, winning awards in nursing, midwifery and occupational health care; and Laura Nebbs won the Visual Arts Award.
Despite the fact that all three students were in the final round of the global finals or were defeated in the final fierce competition, there were 3,500 students from all over the world in the final round.
Professor Blair Graub, Vice Chancellor for Education at Dundee University, said: "To reach this stage, our students and graduates face a competition with the world's top university students.
Thousands of students from all over the world are encouraged to compete for undergraduate awards, and Dundee University students are representative of these winners, which is a good reflection of the quality of our students and the level of education they have received here.
Congratulations to Scott, Chester and Laura for their outstanding achievements and to the other highly acclaimed students representing the Dundee community.
Five other students from Dundee University have also been recognized in the world's top undergraduate student awards, which recognize their outstanding academic achievements and share them with a global audience.
The five students who received the award were: Nicholas Garagall and James Osborne (both students majoring in life sciences), Florence Micha Michałskawa (specifically, a medical major), Kathleen Scott (anatomy) and Yoko Ono (philosophy).
The selection further praised the academic performance of the best undergraduates in the school and helped build bridges between students and graduates from around the world.
The oldest original galaxy cluster is the Queen's Palace Cluster
An international team of astronomers used the Sparrow, Cake and Twin Telescopes to discover 12 galaxies that existed about 13 billion years ago. This is the oldest known galaxy to date. The largest of these is the galaxy that was discovered 10 years ago by the Sparrow Telescope, named after the Queen of Japanese mythology. This discovery suggests that a massive galaxy structure like the Sparrow's Telescope existed only 800 million years before the formation of the universe, and only 6% of its present age.
In the present universe, galaxy clusters may contain hundreds of galaxies, but how they formed remains a matter of great questioning in astronomy. To understand the formation of galaxy clusters, astronomers look for possible origins in the ancient universe.
The team of astronomers led by Yu Yu-Gi-Oh, a researcher at the Japanese National Observatory for Astronomy, explained that the Zhou-san galaxy is a rare and exceptionally dense system of galaxies that is very difficult to find. To solve this problem, we used the wide field of view of the Sbarou telescope to map the vast sky and search for the original galaxy.
On a map of the universe drawn by the Sbalou Telescope, the team discovered a suspected galaxy z66OD, which was 15 times denser than the normal galaxies of the time. Subsequently, the team used the Keck Observatory and the North Telescope to make further spectral observations, confirming that the 12 galaxies existed 13 billion years ago, making them the oldest known galaxy clusters.
Interestingly, one of the 12 galaxies in z66OD was discovered by the Sbarru telescope in 2009 and contains a large amount of gas. Zheng Zhengmei, a member of the team that discovered the galaxy, and the Japanese National Observatory and Tokyo University, said that it is possible to find a galaxy near a mass object like Zhengmei in the center of the galaxy. However, we were surprised that Zhengmei was not at the center of the galaxy but was at the edge of the galaxy 500 million light years away. Ironically, the legendary queen of the galaxy was also said to have lived a life of isolation. Zhengmei continued: It is not clear why Zhengmei is not in the middle.
Nancy Pelosi as the main character in her daughter, Christine Pelosi's new book
The new book about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, author of which she knows her daughter, Christine Pelosi, is about to be published.
The Times Book Publishing Company announced on Thursday that Nancy Pelosi's Roadmap will be released on November 26. The work of Melissa Pelosi will tell the story of how a mother of five became the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives and her current leadership of House Democrats under the Trump administration. According to Time, Melissa Pelosi's new book will intertwine her mother's career and personal experiences as a cook.
Christie Pelosi is currently a Democratic strategic analyst with the campaign training camp and campaign training camp 2.0 series. Pelosi's sister, Alexandra Pelosi, is a filmmaker and journalist who has made several documentaries about contemporary politics.
Warren donated the money he bought for the water to an anti-abortion charity
When Senator Elizabeth Warren (Democrat) of Massachusetts bought drinks from two girls who ran a water-resistant stall in August, she may not have realized that the $10 she bought would be donated to an anti-abortion charity.
Our daughters think Warren is friendly, and she's a Trump supporter, and one of the girls' fathers, Dan Mitchell, told the Washington Free Press. She came over and told us she should vote for her. Our daughter told us she was a good person, but we didn't agree with her politically.
On August 8, Warren stopped at a watershed stand on a campaign bus trip in Iowa, with two 11-year-old children on the stand: Sienna Michaels and Audrey Billings.
When you come to Harlan, Iowa, and have a drink at a water heater, you're going to make a big structural change when life gives you a hard time!" Warren tweeted.
The two children were delighted to see a presidential candidate. After the photo was released, a girl named Michelle urged her parents to vote for the Massachusetts senator in 2020. However, the parents explained Warren's position on abortion. The girls and their parents decided to donate to the Foundation for Life Education and Defense, a nonprofit organization that supports anti-abortion legislation.
Michelle: My daughter told us that she wanted us to vote for her. She said that we talked about abortion and that maybe we should donate money to an anti-abortion campaign, and she totally agreed.
Why there is a need to reclassify herpes and Zika: the impact of biotechnology
The latest research suggests that the way people perceive the structure of viruses needs to be re-adjusted, as they are actually more diverse than previously understood, and the findings may have a significant impact on how we classify them, how they form, evolve and infect hosts, and how vaccines are designed to respond to them.
In the 1950s and 1960s, scientists began obtaining high-resolution images of viruses, revealing the detailed structure of the virus's clothing; the clothing was made up of an outer protective layer of multiple copies of the same protein, used to protect the virus's genetic material. Most of the clothing was typically spherical, with a twenty-sided symmetrical structure, like a twenty-sided necklace.
The coat is the protective layer of a virus, and when scientists discovered the structure of the coat, they proposed that it was of different sizes and carried a different number of genomes, so that the virus could infect the host in different ways.
Why is this important?
When designing drugs for viruses, scientists can now consider their different structural shapes to improve efficacy.
Two researchers at the Institute for Viral Information, a theoretical biophysicist at San Diego State University, Anthony Luke, and a mathematical physicist at York University, England, concluded that many viruses had been basically misclassified over 60 years, including common viruses such as herpes simplex and Zika virus.
Although we have obtained structural images of low-temperature electron microscopes, the researchers have not mathematically described the different viral structures.
Luke mentions: "Well, we've discovered six new protein compositions for the twenty-sided clover. Therefore, many viruses have adopted not only two widely known clover structures.
The researchers used the generalization of the principle of proportional equality to observe how proteins envelop twenty-fold clothing.
Their results, which will be published in the journal Nature Communications on Friday, September 27, also suggest that viruses belonging to the same structural spectrum will use a consistent twenty-sided coat arrangement based on their protein composition, providing a new approach to studying viral evolution.
Application of biotechnology
Structural biologists can now use this information to reclassify the structure of viruses, which will help reveal molecular and evolutionary relationships between different viruses.
It will also provide guidance for new molecular containers designed for nanothen and biotechnology applications and will help scientists identify specific strategies for protein assembly in clothing. This could provide a more systematic approach to developing antiviral vaccines.
Luke said: "We can use this finding to target the assembly and stability of the wardrobe to prevent viruses from forming when they infect the host cells or decomposing after they form. This could help characterize and identify anti-virus markers of viruses that share the same twenty-faceted body layout".
This new framework incorporates previously isolated viruses, provides new predictions of the structure of viral mantles, and identifies common geometric patterns in the long evolution of viruses from humans to bacteria that infect all organisms.
Diwalok noted that the new blueprint also provides a new perspective on the evolution of the Zika virus, showing a new path from simple viral evolution to larger and more complex viruses on the evolutionary time scale.
Applications of the building
Geometry can also be used in new building designs and construction.
Inspired by the geometrical dome of the geometrical curve designed by renowned architect Buckminster Fuller, structural biologist Donald Caspar and biophysicist Aaron Kruger introduced a geometrical framework for classifying viruses according to the geometrical framework of viral mantle since the 1960s. However, with the progression of molecular imaging techniques, including the herpes virus and Zika virus, more and more 3D virus mantle reconstructions have moved away from this classic geometric framework.
Luke explains that the Rubin study will introduce a more general framework than the classic Caspa-Klug structure. It is based on the preservation of local tops formed by proteins interacting within the rubin. This method discovers six new types of twenty-dimensional rubin layers, while recovering two classic patterns from the Caspa-Klugs, which are based on high-density and measured polygons.
A Wisconsin priest who sexually abused a boy was sentenced to 30 years in prison
A former priest accused of sexually abusing a boy in Wisconsin decades ago was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
Thomas Erickson, 72, was sentenced to life in prison on Thursday for two counts of child sexual abuse, both in the late 1970s and early 1980s, while he was serving a life sentence as a priest at St. Peter's Catholic Church, according to the Daily Pioneer of the Church in Wauwatosa.
Four men testified Thursday in court, accusing the sexual assault of affecting their lives. One of the victims was first publicly exposed.
Erickson apologized to the victims in court, saying he was beginning to realize the impact of his actions on the victims. At least 11 men claimed to have been abused while Erickson was a priest.
In 1988, Erickson was removed from the priesthood.
Overconsumption of this compound can damage the liver
Made from the bark of the carrot tree, the meat pie is a popular spice, a flavoring ingredient in various foods, and has even become a unique flavor in itself.
This spice has some impressive health benefits, such as reducing the risk of developing life-threatening diseases such as heart disease, cancer and even diabetes, and is therefore a must-have.
But don't rush to the conclusion that too much meat is harmful to the body. In this case, if the body consumes too much meat, there are some side effects. We should ensure safety.
Although it may help reduce the risk of cancer, it is unfortunate that it can also cause cancer. According to animal studies, too much soybeans common in meat tend to increase the risk of cancer. Scientists say that in the long run, soybeans can damage our DNA, causing cancer.
According to studies, excessive intake of soybeans can also lead to liver toxicity and damage. This is based on several studies on the effects of excessive intake of soybeans on the human body.
It is thought that this is because the meatball contains meatballs, which are a compound that causes an allergic reaction to meatballs in large quantities. However, only people who are allergic to meatballs can develop mouthballs.
It is more commonly used as a preventive measure because the meat is subtly thin, easily inhaled, can cause coughing and vomiting, and can irritate the throat.
For many people, it is beneficial because it has a significant effect on blood sugar reduction. This is very good, especially for those with high blood sugar. However, too much intake can cause blood sugar levels to drop too low, which can lead to a series of new health risks.
Tennessee abortion pending trial before a judge
In a 48-hour trial in Tennessee, a federal judge must decide which expert to hear.
During a four-day trial in Nashville that ended Thursday, Tennessee tried to prove that the law requiring women to visit clinics at least twice a 48-hour interval would give them time to reflect on their decision to abort was beneficial. The attorneys representing five abortion clinics (the state has seven abortion clinics) argued that the law would not bring any benefits but would instead create a huge burden.
Experts agree that some women seeking abortion are not sure what to think, and some women who have had abortions will later regret their decision. However, experts disagree that this percentage is less than the proportion of women seeking abortion, and that the Tennessee 48-hour waiting period has no effect on these women.
On Thursday, the state's attorneys presented a study in Utah on the effects of 72-hour waiting periods. The study found that 8% of women who went to the clinic for the first time said they no longer wanted to seek abortion.
When asked about the study, Anthony Biggs, a social psychologist at the University of California, San Francisco, agreed that some women would change their minds about abortion or that they would not initially have it. But she noted that the study did not prove that Utah's mandatory waiting period changed their minds, nor did it find it beneficial for women in other ways.
Biggs also confirmed that there is no evidence to date that abortion leads to mental health problems for women. She said that a national study compared women who had successful abortions before the end of the abortion deadline to women who had been denied access to the clinic after the end of the deadline, found no difference in the rates of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.
In a cross-sectional questionnaire, Biggs noted that the study did not track the mental health outcomes of women who changed their minds after a waiting period, although only three women were found in the study. She countered earlier this week the testimony of Priscilla Coleman, a psychology professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, who said that abortion was linked to mental health issues.
Coleman testified that she believes that most of the scientific literature on abortion supports the political tendency toward abortion.
On Thursday, a gynecologist in Memphis testified for the state that he joined a highly controversial network of women who tried to block abortion drugs. Dr. Britt noted that through this work he personally contacted women who had changed their minds about abortion.
The Tennessee waiting period law went into effect in mid-2015, and Pedrassa said he has witnessed many women who tried to stop the abortion after taking the abortion medication. Among these women, who changed their minds again, he testified that the idea of abortion was finally completed.
The head of the clinic confirmed earlier that waiting periods can be economically difficult and stressful for women. The head also said that the two consultations required brought a coordination challenge for both patients and the clinic, which led to abortions being delayed beyond the 48 hours prescribed by law, forcing some women to seek surgical abortions, which increase the risk of complications.
According to the Gutmach Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, 14 states have enacted laws requiring women seeking abortion to go to abortion clinics twice, with Tennessee being one of them.
When deciding whether a Tennessee waiting period violated the U.S. Constitution, District Judge Bernard Friedman had to determine whether it brought an excessive burden on women seeking abortions. Some subjective criteria led to the repeal of some waiting periods laws and others continued to be maintained, depending on the actual circumstances of each state.
On Thursday, after the parties had submitted their own evidence, Friedman said he would make a decision as soon as possible.
The problem is endless, the fire at the French chemical plant is extinguished
As a result of the scent of the fire, the French authorities and the Normandy residents are cleaning up the remains of the factory fire.
A fire at a Lubrication plant in Rouen broke out on Thursday, leaving no one injured, but residents on both sides of the Seine River in the vicinity have expressed concern about the potential health risks and consequences.
Local administration officials said on Friday that after nearly 24 hours of efforts, the fire was extinguished on Thursday night.
The French authorities have warned that after the fire is extinguished, a special odor may be released, which could spread to neighboring areas.
French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said that people with health problems should stay home until Friday night.
The cause of the fire is under investigation. The plant is listed as one of the most dangerous industrial sites in Europe.
Liquefied natural gas investment record and highest growth in China in 2019
Liquefied natural gas investment has reached $50 billion since the beginning of the year, the highest level in history, said Fatih Birol, Director General of the International Energy Agency, at an industry conference.
The investment volume of 2019 broke the record for the first time this year - $50 billion, Bloomberg said at a consumer conference of LNG producers in Tokyo, citing Reuters' comments.
Unsurprisingly, the driving force behind the investment growth is Asia's growing energy demand; China is expected to surpass Japan to become the world's largest importer of liquefied natural gas.
The largest growth in LNG is from China. In the next five years, one third of global LNG demand will come from China alone, said Banbiror. He added that in five years, China will become the largest importer of the fuel.
The United States and Canada have completed most of the investment.
In a report released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration in December 2018, it was estimated that by the end of this year, U.S. LNG exports would double to 8.9 billion cubic feet per day. This would also make the U.S. the world's third largest LNG exporter after Qatar and Australia. By 2030, U.S. LNG exports are expected to increase from 3 billion cubic feet per day at the beginning of 2019 to 17 billion cubic feet per day.
Canada currently has only one liquefied natural gas project under construction - Canadian Liquefied Natural Gas - but its final annual capacity could reach 28 million tons. The $31 billion project is being led by Shell and a minority shareholder group including Malaysia's state-owned oil company, China Oil, Samsung and South Korean natural gas company.
At the same time, Qatar is also stepping up its efforts to maintain its first position in the global liquefied natural gas export competition. Currently, Qatar and Iran share the world's largest offshore gas field, the Northern Gas Field, which has also lifted the ban on new drilling for the field, with the goal of increasing its annual export capacity by 43%, to 110,000 tonnes per year.
According to the forecasts of the world's leading business information service providers, global demand for liquefied natural gas is expected to reach 5.5 billion tonnes by 2030.
Viola Davis recorded the Jimmy Cummings live show, exploding the real-life journey of the actor as Michelle Obama
Viola Davis feels some pressure to play Michelle Obama.
The actor said on Thursday on the Jimmy Cummings live show: "Oh, I'm scared.
Last month it was announced that Davis would star as the former first lady in the series of the TV adaptation of the TV series The First Lady.
She told host Cammore: "Oh, I don't care what my career has been like, I've won an Emmy, an Oscar, two Tony Awards, but if I mess up this time, it's going to be a defining moment in my life".
Davis said she was waiting for her PR agent to call her and say goodbye, I'm Michelle Obama, and I'm gonna kill you.
Davis also considered the audience in the sixth and final season of the television series The Far Side.
She said, "Hey, I don't want to drive people crazy by watching me".
Judges concerned about teenage drinking on the night of rape
A teenager who assaulted his lover and was sentenced by a judge has expressed concern about the teenager's choice to drink before he was raped.
A 19-year-old man, Killian Clifton, beat up a 17-year-old teenager, whom he believes was responsible for his divorce from his ex-girlfriend.
The Royal Court of Oxford learned that Clifton had been drinking and brewing at Fat Fox's Bar in Watlington, Oxford, shortly before the violence in March.
Judge Nigel Daley told Clifton, who confessed to the actual physical harm (abh), that alcohol played a significant role in the night's violence.
But he talked about the problem of Clifton's choice of alcohol: Did you drink Coke and Italian almonds?
Clifton, from Charing Grove, was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for 12 months, ordered to complete 15 days of renovation work and 160 hours of unpaid work and to pay £750 in compensation.

Colombian President says head of Los Pelososos crime group has been shot dead
The top leader and founder of the Los Pelosos gang was shot dead in an operation led by the National Police of Colombia, President Ivan Duk announced on Friday.
The gang is one of the most notorious criminal organizations in the Andes, and the fighting in which it has been involved has cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in the region bordering Venezuela in the east.
Luis Antonio Quintero, known as Pacra, was a left-wing opposition leader who led more than 440 gang members, the government said.
Pakra, 49, who was wanted by police for terrorism and murder, was located in North Santander province on Thursday.
Our goal is clear: to completely defeat the organization, Mr. Duker said in a statement that he had traveled to the United States this week to attend the United Nations General Assembly.
The statement added that Kintaro was responsible for the killing of several human rights activists and community leaders by the organization.
Duke has been criticized by some in the international community for not taking more action to stop the killing across the country and for avoiding extreme acts.
Another Los Pelosos' leader was also arrested in the operation, the statement added, but did not mention details of Kintrow's death.
In a speech at the United Nations, Ms. Tumbery encouraged climate change protesters in the Netherlands.
On Friday, thousands of Dutch teenagers went on strike to protest global climate change, block local traffic, and question their leaders: "How dare you do this?"
On September 27, 2019, in The Hague, Netherlands, a protester held a portrait of the Swedish environmental activist Greta Thumbbery during a march, calling on the government to take action against climate change.
The number of people attending the parade in The Hague exceeded expectations, with organizers estimating the number to be around 35,000. Police were forced to change the route of the parade to guide the protest squad to locations that could accommodate more people.
Thumberi, 16, made a passionate speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York this week. On Friday, millions of people worldwide went on strike to join the climate change protest in support of the UN Climate Action Summit.
As people continue to join the protests, strike protests can have a huge impact, not only on today but also on the future, and we can see people from all walks of life coming in", said Randall Rustaima, a protest leader in the protest.
Protesters across the city centre waved flags, holding pictures of Tumblr with signs on their hands: "Mum for a beautiful grata, mum for a stupid old man, and mum for you to die of old age, we die of climate change".
I understand their concerns and believe people have heard their appeal, Prime Minister Mark Punt told reporters at a weekly press conference when protesters were marching near him: "We have put forward some costly plans to address these issues.
The summit was launched with a brief speech in Tungbery, which was intended to mobilize governments and businesses to break the international record of carbon emissions, despite decades of warnings from scientists about the effects of climate change, which reached record highs last year.
I'm not supposed to be sitting here. I should be studying across the ocean, and you're looking for our young people to hope for. How dare you? She said this in a passionate voice.
The Netherlands, which has 17 million inhabitants, used less than 7% of its total energy from renewable sources in 2017, compared to 15% in Germany and more than 50% in Sweden.
The Dutch government has pledged to halve 1990's CO2 emissions by 2030, but only achieved 13% of the reduction by 2017.
On Friday, Tumberry also participated in a climate protest in Canada, when the leaders of the United Nations Civil Aviation Organization were meeting in Montreal to discuss the air transportation emissions reduction targets.
The suicide rate is rising and the military is not optimistic
This year, the suicide rate among active duty soldiers has climbed to a new record high, a situation that continues to be deadly, and Pentagon officials say the situation is frustrating and is currently being actively addressed.
The Pentagon released data on Thursday showing that the suicide rate and overall suicide rate in the Army, Navy and Marine Corps are on the rise, while the suicide rate in the Air Force alone is on the decline.
Earlier this month, the Navy reported that three crew members serving aboard the aircraft carrier George H. W. Bush had died within a week of each other. This highlights the difficulties faced by the prisoners in identifying potential problems and in finding ways to prevent suicide.
Asked about the suicide of the carrier crew, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said: "Oh, I wish I could tell you that we have found the answer that could prevent more suicides in the future for the armed forces. But we have not found the answer.
The number of suicides in the U.S. military rose from 511 in 2017 to 541 in 2018. According to the Pentagon, the highest risk factor is young recruits, with at least 60% of them choosing guns as their method of suicide. The number of suicides in the Army increased from 114 to 139, the number of suicides in the Marine Corps increased from 43 to 58, and the number of suicides in the Navy increased from 65 to 68, while the Air Force decreased from 63 to 60.
Elizabeth Van Venk, director of the Pentagon's Office of Army Resistance, said: "Our numbers are not moving in the right direction". She said that most soldiers are treated differently than civilians, adding: "It's hard to be satisfied".
Military and defense leaders expressed disappointment and were determined to take more measures to improve the resilience of the force, train soldiers on how to cope with stress more effectively, and encourage troops to seek help when needed. Van Venk said the military was also considering strengthening training on the safe storage of weapons and drugs. She said that there were no uniform rules or regulations between departments requiring locking or other control measures, but some states or bases had their own limits.
She and Karen Owens, director of the Office of Suicide Prevention, said it was difficult to identify prisoners who may be in pain or have suicidal thoughts, and that suicide was sometimes a sudden decision with little warning in advance. They said it was difficult to find the cause of suicide because there were too many stressors that caused the suicide.
They also acknowledged that the prisoners were reluctant to seek help because they feared it would affect promotion or security checks.
Marine Corps Commander General David Berger said: "In addition to physical health, gun training, training and education, the Marine Corps must also be free to discuss life's difficulties, mental health and suicide. We must build a community to seek help and assistance in making important decisions as Marines and Marines".
This year, for the first time, the Pentagon included statistics on military spouses and family suicides in the category. Van Venk said the latest figures were for 2017, but officials are working to improve the ability to collect data on families.
According to the data, 186 families have committed suicide, 123 of them spouses and 63 of them families between the ages of 12 and 23.
The vast majority (nearly 70%) are female spouses under the age of 40, while 70% of families with suicides are male. About half of those who have died by suicide are over the age of 18, and for those younger, the majority of suicides are young people between the ages of 15 and 17.
Seth Meyers laughed at Donald Trump's tangos and cash crumbs
On Thursday, Late Night with Conan the Barbarian host Seth Meyers, who was relieved for a week of intense mass shooting, took a moment to pamper Donald Trump, but he couldn't stand the laugh in the kitchen.
The comedian mentioned a scene where Trump visited a hospital in El Paso, Texas, where the victims of the mass shooting at the weekend were being treated, and his campaign still owes the city more than $500,000 over a political rally in February.
The event also generated a one-time lag money due to the failure to pay on time.
"Oh, that's the president's consistent tune". My surprise was that his presidential office desk was not flooded with unreturned DVDs.
He then began to imitate Trump in the 1989 hit movie Tango and the Cash Box, but he soon became self-absorbed.
A man is jailed after a bullet was found in the woman's skull
A man in Georgia was sentenced to 25 years in prison for shooting his girlfriend after she realized she had left a bullet in her head and survived while she was being treated for a headache.
According to news media, 39-year-old Gerry Kane was sentenced Thursday for the felony charge of possession of a weapon in the 2017 attack on 42-year-old Nicole Gordon.
Gordon, who suffered from severe headaches and memory loss, was examined by a doctor last year and found a bullet in her skull.
Gordon told police that she did not remember being shot, but did remember the fight with Ken when her car window broke and she passed out. She thought she was broken glass and was confined to Ken's mother's house.
Men's fashion show in Paris on T-Show
As Miss Liu sang in her 2008 hit song, "Romeo's Dead": "Go, Go, Fashion Baby".
One editor said that a male model kept these words in mind, and his T-show blew the other models off the top of his head, and that he was the closing model for the 2020 Spring series of John Galia Nomagilla's Paris Fashion Week on Wednesday.
The 20-year-old model, Leon Dam, conquered the audience with his unique T-Texas cat, with his head up and his feet forward, his hands up and his feet forward, and his hands unsteady, while keeping a strong, hard-core look in his eyes.
He was wearing a belted coat, white shorts, and knee-length boots, and wore a schoolgirl hat, which caused a sensation online. In a video of a catwalk, he appeared to be smiling at the head of the show, Anna Wentworth, as he passed through the curtain while still in the kitchen.
Many have praised the young German model, who has been a contestant for the Gil Sand, Fay and Korean hard-hitting men's fashion brands for her unique sense of fashion.
Actress and actress Lisa Linnaeus describes Leon as a young soulful, while fashion designer and singer Rihanna is watching him on the Photo Wall app.
After the release of the video of the male model Leon's walk-on show, one fan wrote on Leon's page: "The video and off-site really stands out". Another fan also said: "Grandma Leon, while the makeup artist and giant Pat McGraw provided makeup for his performance, and the makeup artist of the show, left him with a flash and flame expression symbol".
The highest praise may come from Tim Bronx, the special editor of the fashion website Fashion Business Review.
You were a young man with no name when you left, but you were a hot star when you came back!
He added, "Oh, @leondame, the cat is going crazy. @maisonmargiela I think what they say is true.
Magnetic storms are expected in late September
According to the National Institute of Atmospheric and Marine Research's Space Weather Forecast Center, magnetic disturbances are expected to occur from September 27 to September 29.
The Russian Laboratory for Solar Activity Research at the Levlevyev Institute predicts that the disturbance will begin on the evening of September 27 and reach its peak the next morning to noon.
Geomagnetic storms can affect people with cardiovascular problems. Doctors warn that some people may experience heartburn, dizziness, headaches and distraction. Magnetic disturbances often affect people with mental disorders.
If there is a more severe disruption, the power grid will also fluctuate. Satellite signals that provide navigation information will also be weak.
The most beautiful view of the phenomenon is the spectacular polar light that appears in the sky above the two poles.
Sony is working with Disney again to launch the third installment of the Spider-Man franchise
Disney and Sony are now freezing, and the Spider-Man is back in the ring.
The two companies announced on Friday that they would be working together to make the third film in the Spider-Man franchise starring Tom Holland.
According to a press release released by the two sides, the as-yet-untitled film will be released on July 16, 2021, and is produced by Disney-owned Marvel Pictures and its president, Kevin Figg.
According to the press release, Amy Pasca will also be making films through Pasca Films, as she did in the first two films directing Hollande.
In a press release, Figg said: "The journey of Spider-Man will continue in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and I am very happy to continue working for it, and I am so excited about the entire Marvel film industry and myself.
The agreement also allows Spider-Man to appear in future films for Marvel.
Figg admitted that this collaboration made the flying saucer unique among superheroes.
He said: "The Spider-Man Monkey is the only superhero in the movie universe that has the ability to transcend, so as Sony continues to develop its own Spider-Man universe, we never know what surprises the future will bring".
It has been more than a month since the end of the Spider-Man franchise, when the two companies reportedly failed to reach an agreement on a sequel to the previous film Return of the Jedi and Return of the Jedi.
The problem is that Disney, who owns the role, wants to co-finance future films with Sony, which has agreed to acquire Marvel in 2009 before acquiring the rights to the film from Disney, which is based on the mouse.
Hollywood Reporter noted that both sides had good reason to cooperate. The Heroes' Expedition is Sony's highest-grossing film ever, while Marvel can maximize its product promotion and maintain creative control.
The end of the deadlock was also met with joy by Hollande himself, who expressed his joy on the Photo Wall app.
EU and UK negotiators in Belgium are working to reach a Brexit deal
The EU's chief negotiator for Brexit began negotiations with British officials in Belgium on Friday to reach a deal; the deadline for the deal is now about a month away.
Michel Barnier met with Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay in Brussels, where Barclay insisted that any agreement should exclude the Irish border protection measures. This border protection measure, which effectively ensured the soft border between the UK and Northern Ireland after Brexit, has become a major barrier to negotiations.
Barkley said that while the UK was committed to reaching an agreement, he said there was little time left.
I think there is a long way to go, and I think it's a crucial moment for negotiations", said Buckley.
The deadline for Brexit is 31 October, but a new law in the UK prohibits British Prime Minister Boris Johnson from leaving without a trade deal, and does not allow the UK Parliament to approve Brexit without a trade deal before 19 October.
Last week, EU negotiators said they were willing to accept an alternative to border protection measures, but Irish representative Simon Coveney said on Friday that London had not yet submitted a serious proposal to the European Parliament.
He said: "Unless there is a serious proposal as a basis for negotiations, the current huge differences will continue to exist".
The negotiator also said that there was little time left for the British Prime Minister and his team to make a serious proposal.
Johnson's office said on Friday that the agreement was still a difficult one to reach.
The Irish, of course, think that Brexit delay is better than no deal, but I think there is a good reason behind the request.
European Union President Jean-Claude Juncker said he and Barnier were doing everything possible to reach an agreement, and if they fail to reach an agreement, they are wrong in the UK.
Irish Prime Minister Vallard said he was pessimistic about the Brexit deal, but he would urge UK leaders to come up with a plan at the UK Brexit summit on October 17.
The Brexit deal is actually an international treaty, and Mr. Juvard Karadkar said that it is not something that can be changed in the dark or that can be made to look like a secret.
Scientists' confusion: giant planets orbiting tiny stars
Scientists have discovered that a giant wooden planet in a galaxy 30 light-years away from Earth revolves around a tiny red dwarf, completely disrupting the existing theory of planet formation, and scientists are surprised.
A picture of the gaseous giant planet GJ 3512b orbiting the red dwarf star, published on September 26, 2019.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planets orbiting them. However, the stars observed are not as large as the planets, researchers said on Thursday.
The star, named GJ 3512, has a mass of about 12 percent of the Sun, and the planet around it is almost half the mass of Jupiter (the largest planet in the solar system).
Yes, it is surprising, says Juan Carlos Morales, an astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Sciences in Spain, whose team published the results in the journal Science Fiction.
The discovery was surprising because theoretical models suggest that low-mass stars typically have asteroids similar to Earth or small oceanic planets like Jupiter. But this time we found a Jupiter-like gas giant orbiting a very low-mass star, added Tom Morales.
Using the telescope of the Spanish observatory of Caracallato, the researchers discovered the mainly gas-filled wooden planet, which orbits its main star in an elliptical orbit for 204 days.
The mass of the red dwarf stars is very small, with a relatively low surface temperature. GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the Sun, but smaller than even larger planets, and only 35% larger than Jupiter.
Red dwarfs release less energy, so their radiation is very faint, and their surface temperatures are low, at about 3,800 degrees Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit/3,527 degrees Celsius). This also explains why red dwarfs are micro-red, says Tom Morales.
There is evidence that another planet is orbiting the red dwarf, and that another planet may have been ejected from the star system, which explains the elliptical orbit of the wooden planet, Morales said.
Planets and their surrounding stars are born from the same disc of interstellar gas and dust. According to the most widely accepted model of planetary formation, the core accumulation model of the star is that the object originally formed from solid particles in the disc, and the gravitational pull of planetary embryos can collect the surrounding gas to form an atmosphere.
Another model relative to it is called the gravitational instability model, which may explain this unusual galaxy.
In this case, the original planetary disk around the young star may be larger than expected in mass and at lower temperatures, according to Tom Morales. This would cause the disc to become unstable, resulting in dense regions that form clusters. These clusters can continue to grow until they shrink and form planets.
School strikes in cities around the world demand climate action
On Friday, children around the world launched another wave of school strikes calling for action on climate change, their first major action since the issue became a top issue on the United Nations world leaders' agenda this week.
More than a year ago, the solo campaign launched by Swedish teenager Greta Samberg on Friday was rife with millions of students taking to the streets of cities like New York City, attracting the attention of developing African countries.
Some of the initial protests began in New Zealand, where, according to Samberg, an estimated 170,000 people marched across the country.
The protest on Friday followed a week-long climate negotiation at the United Nations in New York, which included a speech by Zuckerberg that strongly condemned the lack of action by world leaders.
"Your empty words stole my dreams and my childhood", she said Tuesday. "The eyes of my grandchildren and great-grandchildren are on you, and if your choices disappoint us, I can say we will never forgive you".
Protesters cited a report last year by the United Nations calling on governments to take steps to prevent global warming above 2.7 degrees Celsius, warning scientists that this would have dire consequences for human life and the planet.
Ms. Sauber and the young people she inspired said they would not stop the weekly classroom strike until they saw a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change.
In the Nigerian capital Abuja, Oradosu Adineek has been on strike for 46 consecutive Fridays. The activist posted on Twitter photos of students wearing blue school uniforms and banners that chanted that climate change is really happening and that is a slogan that we are not used to.
Hundreds of climate strike organizers gathered in Lausanne, Switzerland, in August to prepare for this week's event, and thousands marched in the city, according to local reports.
Thousands of people are expected to take to the streets of Helsinki, Finland, local media reported that the Helsinki school will allow students to participate.
After his visit to the United Nations, he remained in North America to participate in the climate strike in Montreal, Canada.
Serena Williams is fined $10,000 for allegedly damaging the Wimbledon tennis courts
Ten-time Wimbledon champion Serena Williams was fined $10,000 for allegedly damaging a London practice ground with a ball.
According to the Associated Press and the US cable news network, the All England Club, which hosts the WINnet, fined Williams for allegedly causing damage during an outdoor practice on 30 June.
The 37-year-old tennis star, interviewed by reporters after winning the quarter-final against Alison Reese on Tuesday, appeared to laugh at the penalty.
When asked about the penalty, she said: "To tell you the truth, I didn't mean to ruin the pitch. I just threw the ball.
Williams said she didn't know how this would damage the stadium.
She told reporters: "I mean, if you could tell me how I caused damage, I would be grateful. I've always been a vengeful person. Maybe I'm very strong. But I don't know.
Williams is competing for her eighth straight WWE title, which will be her 24th Grand Slam. In the singles semi-final on Thursday, she will face Czech player Babula Strykowa.
Last year, a US Open referee accused Williams of communicating with a coach during the tournament, which Williams defended, and fined him $17,000.
In the case, the referee sent three violations to Williams: the first was that she accepted the violation instructions, the second was that she interrupted the pitch because of emotional frustration, and the third was that she accused the other of cheating while confronting the referee.
Many Williams fans claimed that the referee's response was too harsh on her, especially given the excitement of male players throughout the history of the sport.
Do you know how many men do worse than that? Ms. Williams told the U.S. Open officials who walked into the stadium after she clashed with the referee during the match.
Williams is not the only person to be fined at this year's Open, but her penalty is the highest.
Italian selector Bior Fanini, who lost to US player Tennis Sandgren in the third round on Saturday, said that the penalty for the bombing of a tennis court should be a fine of $3,000.
Australian footballer Nick Kirgios was fined two times for violating sports ethics, one for $3,000 and the other for $5,000.
The band suspended their concerts last night: Friday and Sunday shows canceled
The legendary rock band J.O.H. Manmohan is touring the United States. In Houston, Texas, Roger Daltrey was forced to cancel the show halfway through the concert. The 75-year-old singer said to the disappointed audience: "Oh, I think it's best to say goodbye". The band has already performed eight songs, but promised to come back one day.
After playing the classic 1982 track "The Excellence" in the front row, Daltrey announced his retirement. He had been having trouble speaking, apparently following strictly the advice of his surgeon.
The British star told the audience that he could not finish the show: "Oh, I'd be hurt if I continued to perform for you. I thought it best to say goodbye... Last time I was in the hospital for a month, I didn't want to go anymore".
Pete Johnson explained the situation to the audience: "It looks like he can't continue to perform, and I'm afraid...
The band left the stage, and intended to work hard to finish the rest of the show without Roger.
When he returned, Manson said, "Oh, I'm really, really sorry. Roger is now mute".
And it's obvious that before the show, he saw a doctor, and you know, he sang very well on tour.
Oh, I'm really sorry you guys couldn't see the show tonight... we're missing something, it's Roger's show and it's in bad shape.
The audience was fully supportive of him, cheering for his 74-year-old, and he explained everything that had happened and how the band hoped to return to fulfill their commitment to the show.
"Well, we'll announce our date of return as soon as possible". said Johnson. "Let me explain... we're playing one day, resting one day".
I swear to you, we will come back and we will not let your ticket fall. I love you and I am sorry to disappoint you.
After the show, the upcoming Friday and Sunday night concerts in Dallas and Denver were cancelled.
Their next gig will be in San Francisco on October 9th. The band will begin their UK tour in Manchester on March 16th, 2020.
Michael Schumacher, the broker, issued a statement about his condition
An official statement on Michael Schumacher's health has been released. According to Gong.bg, the legendary figure has been recovering from injuries in a skiing accident in the Alps in 2013 for nearly six years.
A few weeks ago, global media reported that the former pilot had been admitted to a hospital in Paris.
"We're not going to comment on Michael's health, so we're not going to comment on it, just because we need to protect Michael's privacy as much as possible. We know it's hard for some people to understand, but we're doing it in full accordance with Michael's wishes, and we're very grateful for your understanding".
She also revealed that Schumach was a very sensitive person. He did not want his name to be in the headlines, and even avoided public exposure before the incident occurred.
The agents urged people not to believe any photos of the leaked leaks on social networks and yellow magazines around the world.
Authorities investigate a fatal car crash in the Los Angeles National Forest and have found bodies
Police are investigating a fatal car accident in the Los Angeles National Forest on Thursday afternoon.
According to police, a car with bodies was found underneath the Los Angeles Forest Road and the Grand Canyon Road.
Initial reports on the spot said the car may have been there for some time.
The vehicle was found in the area of the airport in the south of the country.
Is a world without nuclear weapons far from reachable?
Seventy-four years ago, two nuclear bombs exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing hundreds of thousands.
After that, the threat of nuclear war will follow as long as there is conflict between the great powers.
Although various treaties have tried to contain this threat, there are currently about 14,000 nuclear weapons in the world.
Thursday is the International Day for the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, but the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons seems increasingly difficult to achieve.
So, is there a political will in countries to abolish nuclear weapons?
Meghan was willing to move and persist in her pursuit of the royal duty while reluctantly giving up her mother's pursuit.
Meghan Markle decided to move freely and persist in her pursuit of the royal duties while remaining a member of the royal family, and she wanted to be a role model for young boys and girls.
The 38-year-old Duchess of Sussex reportedly made the above remarks earlier this week during a visit to South Africa with her husband Prince Harry at an event to inspire women entrepreneurs on the Cape Town Woodstock Exchange.
Woodstock Exchange is a UK-based South African technology centre that promotes skills development and market access by helping entrepreneurs, especially women, gain skills, resources and support.
At the Women Entrepreneurs Association meeting, the 38-year-old former actress met with several female founders in tech, environmental and fashion industries and praised their efforts to inspire the next generation of creative entrepreneurs.
In a conversation with women tech founders, Megan strongly advocated for empowering young women and girls, and expressed hope for empowering young men as well.
Nadia Moussaji, a South African engineer, social entrepreneur, co-founder of Women in Engineering, mother of two, revealed: "We recognize the importance of not only educating girls but also being an example to boys, we are influential women and should be an example that boys admire, according to the People of Myanmar.
Well, we both have sons, and we should remember that we are not only an example for girls, but also an example for boys, not only for our sons, but also for the masses.
She added that we didn't feel any level of idealism about Meghan's presence in the audience, because it was a gathering of women who talked about the difficulties we face and the mission we need to complete to move forward, grow and change our society.
Modis Modise, founder of Skills Training Company Simodisa, said that although Meghan is a member of the Royal Family, she is determined to keep moving and not give up her deep-seated pursuit.
She spoke of her responsibility as a mother and a duchess and her desire to achieve her innermost desire not to give up pursuits as a duchess, Modice recalled.
Oh, you must be true to yourself.
She said the Duchess urged them to continue to deepen their new ideas and said how they would continue to push and move forward, making it clear that they were doing so to set an example for others.
She added that she was not referring to being a member of the royal family, but to doing so when faced with challenges in everyday life, and admitted that she felt a little awe of Meghan.
She is embracing the task with such a graceful gesture, said Mumm Modi.
As a founder, many of us have made amazing achievements, but it's a bit daunting to meet a royal member. She's a very consistent member.
Megan also revealed that she enjoys the pressure of being a working mother, admitting that being a member of the royal family and caring for her children is a daunting task but a very exciting one.
Megan told Laura Rosmarine, CEO of Cape Innovation Technology, a mother of two, "I'm only five months old now. As a professional mother, traveling with a child is a mess, but it's all so exciting".
Sometimes you have to deal with something, but when you meet people and you can positively influence them, you say, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's worth it".
Megan then went to the city's outdoor institution, which trains and hires women with HIV.
She brought some of Archie's baby clothes, including one with the stamp of a future mother-in-law and a baby outfit with the stamp of a mother-in-law's unconquerable mother-in-law, and items donated by her mother's friends.
A couple were sentenced to six years in prison for putting their five-month-old baby in a handbag and throwing it in a garbage can.
A five-and-a-half-month-old baby's body was thrown into a garbage can, and on Thursday, her parents, who did not defend the death of the baby, were sentenced to six years in prison.
The Los Angeles County District Attorney announced that Adam Manson, 34, and Keanna Williams, 32, had not defended a felony charge of child abuse and death, and had denied a special charge that they had caused the death of their son, Jackson Manson.
Manson and the Williams couple initially pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Prosecutors said the two found their son dead on New Year's Eve while they were both drugging in a car hotel in South Los Angeles. Prosecutors added that they placed the child's body in a trunk and dumped it in a garbage can near Cranstown Square in Boundwin.
In late April, authorities cancelled the search after weeks of searching the Coronado El Sobrante landfill.
Police said in a statement at the time that they were in a state of shock and anxious to end the search for Jackson, but noted that they could not locate the exact location of the dump, so there was no reasonable reason to continue the search.
The supply of medicines in the UK under no deal remains unclear
UK government regulators say that if there is no deal, the government will still need to do a lot of work to ensure that it has sufficient medical supplies.
In a report released by the National Audit Office on Friday, the government said additional leased capacity for trans-English Channel freight could be available by the end of November (one month after the exit deadline of 31 October). There are about 12,300 medicines registered in the UK, of which 7,000 come from the EU or transported through the EU, most of them for trans-English transport.
According to the UK government's predictions of the worst possible scenario, drug shipments could be halved on the first day of a no-deal Brexit and could take a year to recover.
The report also noted that while the information on the amount of sodium in drug reserves is not complete, it is increasing daily. As of September 20, suppliers reported that 72% of drugs have six-week reserves.
The UK's health sector will work under highly uncertain circumstances without a deal, and the full implementation of the planned programme is extremely difficult, the government regulator wrote.
Meg Cyril, Chair of the Audit Oversight Committee, expressed deep concern about the report's content. She said she had seen the UK government miss deadlines countless times, but this was particularly worrying.
She said that if the government gets involved, it could have serious consequences.
Dr Richard Tobe, of the British Pharmaceutical Industry Association, said that while businesses are preparing for Brexit, there are some things that are not under corporate control.
He said that if the UK really wants to leave without a deal, businesses need to know more about the relevant situation and how to use the additional cargo capacity the government has prepared.
He believes that the best way to protect patients from malaria is to ensure that a Brexit deal is reached.
The Cleveland Police Department has been labeled as a failure by inspectors on all counts.
The Cleveland Police Department, which has been the subject of scandals, has become the first police force to be awarded the nickname "Failed Nick" by inspectors in all aspects.
The Queen's Police, Fire and Rescue Services Authority assessed its overall work in three key areas, including its ability to reduce crime, ensure people's safety, operate efficiently and treat the public and staff in a manner that was critical.
The results of the investigation suggest that special measures should be taken against the force, and the police chief, police and crime commissioner were consulted by the National Committee and asked to ensure that the plans for major improvements were implemented.
If there is no improvement, the Minister of Interior can intervene to solve this problem.
A series of scandals have plagued the squad, including Hartlepool, Redcar and Cleveland, Stockton and Middlesbrough in the north-east of England.
Over the years, six police chiefs have been replaced.
In 2012, former Sheriff Sean Price was fired for gross misconduct; seven police officers are being investigated after a reporter's phone was illegally intercepted, with long-standing complaints of racial discrimination among the squad.
Recently, the Inspector General of Police said that the way police work is unimaginably inefficient, and that police must share laptops and cameras.
British police inspector Phil Gomley said it was a failed military coup and the situation had been worsening for the past two years.
Tissue Valley Mayor Ben Huang said the report said that the police force was the worst-performing police force in the country's history, and Liu ultimately confirmed that the police force was seriously compromised and said the Interior Ministry needed to intervene now.
He added: "There is no question about it. This is the fact that the white paper in the report describes black and white.
And the results are some of the most painful and shocking I've ever read.
Cleveland was one of 15 units recently inspected by HMICFRS inspectors and the only one not qualified in all areas.
The troops were not given the proper priority of preventing crime. Lack of strategic direction and insufficient resources allocated to defense work. Failure to provide adequate protection to vulnerable groups such as children.
He said that the senior leaders did not always show the same level of moral hypocrisy, and that the misconduct of the senior leaders of the Duncliffe region was so serious that it was affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the force.
He added: "The force has not consistently been fair and respectful to its employees, communicated effectively with them or understood them; the process is considered unfair and the lack of understanding of the staff is not enough to support the staff".
Despite the seriousness of the investigation, the force has received some praise for its handling of serious and organized crime, but it has to improve the way it investigates the crime.
Police and Crime Commissioner Barry Kopingger said: "I am very concerned about the disturbing part of this report.
The last performance of the force was very poor.
He said he had been assured by current Sheriff Richard Lewis that he would take immediate action once he realized the mistakes.
The Home Office has ordered Kobing to respond to the report within 56 days.
Lewis said the report was like setting a boundary barrier for the force, adding: "The force has made improvements and I am fully responsible for pushing these obviously necessary changes. In my five months in office, I have met with outstanding police and staff at all levels, seeing the efforts and determination of the police on the front line to protect lives and protect vulnerable people".
If there is no substantial improvement fast enough, the government could intervene, such as a prison collapse.
But so far, politicians have never asked for the enforcement of this policy, inspectors said.
Keith Malthouse, Minister of Crime, Security and Fire, said he encouraged Sheriff Yang to act quickly to correct these errors and will monitor the position closely, adding that transparency and accountability are key to building public confidence in the police.
Manelli Christian School: Several sixth-grade boys in Virginia are accused of trapping black girls forcing their haircut
A black high school student in Virginia accused three white boys of trapping her and cutting off her neck. The incident occurred at the Emmanuel Christian School, where Vice President Mike Jones' wife, Karen Jones, taught.
A 12-year-old student at the private Christian school, Amarie Allen, said the boys caught her on the playground while she was resting in class, saying her neck was ugly and curled, and then cut her neck.
Looking at her, she told WUSA-TV, owned by Columbia Broadcasting, that they were constantly laughing at me and insulting me. They said I was ugly, and they said I shouldn't have been born.
According to WUSA, one of the boys allegedly clutched her mouth, another boy held her hands behind her, and another boy cut her neck with a scissor.
Marie did not tell her family about this until her grandmother discovered that her hair was shortened.
When they were laughing and running away, I sat there, and Mary said,
The incident happened on Monday, but the mother-of-two said she didn't tell her family until Wednesday because her grandmother noticed her hair had changed.
Emily's grandmother, Cynthia Allen, said: "It's so heartbreaking. I hope the school can get rid of these students.
The school costs her family nearly $12,000 a year to attend, and the school gained a reputation after Karen Jones taught art at the famous anti-gay school earlier this year.
In a statement, the Manley Christian School said that it attaches great importance to the mental and physical health of students and that it has a zero-tolerance policy against any form of bullying or violence. We are deeply concerned about these allegations and are currently communicating with the families of the victims, gathering information and providing support to them as best we can. We have also contacted law enforcement to request a thorough investigation and further information from the Falfax County Police Department.
Although the school has a zero-tolerance policy on bullying, Amari says the boys have tortured her before. She said the boys took her lunch and cursed her.
The family of Amari met with school officials on Thursday and the investigation is ongoing.
Iran releases British tanker Stanna Amprio
Iran released a tanker with a British flag last Friday, which was seized two months earlier by Iran for allegedly entering Iranian waters in violation of international law.
According to the Iranian state news agency, the Iranian Port and Maritime Administration confirmed that the tanker named Stana Amprio had left the port of Abbas at 9 am.
Eric Hanel, president and CEO of the Swedish Oil Company (the ship's operator), also confirmed that the ship had been released.
Eric Hannell tweeted: "The Swedish Oil Company and the UK Northern Ocean Authority confirm that Stannar Amprio and her crew have been released.
On July 19, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard seized the ship after it entered Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz, allegedly in violation of international maritime law.
However, the seizure of the vessel was widely seen as retaliation by Iran against British forces after British forces seized a tanker in the waters of Gibraltar that was allegedly transporting Persian oil to Syria in violation of international sanctions. Despite the efforts of the Trump administration to extend the detention period, the vessel was released in mid-August.
According to The New York Times, Steiner Amprio was officially authorized to leave on Monday, but remained at the port until the end of the investigation into the ship's conduct.
The tanker has left the port of Abbas and is heading to Dubai to have its crew boarded for medical examinations and reports, and Khan Khanel said the family of the tanker crew had been informed that the company is currently arranging to return its important crew as soon as possible.
The tanker was the victim of escalating tensions in the Persian Gulf, the United States and Iran shot down each other's drones near the Persian Gulf, and at least two tankers were blown up, and the Trump administration blamed Iran for this.
The Trump administration recently accused Iran of drone strikes on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, and Tehran denies any involvement.
Prime Minister Modi paid tribute to President Jaak Sharma on Twitter, calling him a true global politician, a friend of India.
Prime Minister Modi expressed his condolences over the passing of former French President Jacques Chirac, saying that India mourns the passing of a true global politician and friend.
Jacques Chirac, who expressed his support for India's nuclear tests in 1998, died on Thursday at the age of 86. He was president of France from 1995 to 2007.
I deeply condolish the passing of Mr. Jakhar Sharak. India mourns the passing of a truly global politician. Prime Minister Modi tweeted that as a friend of India, he played a decisive role in establishing and building the Indo-French strategic partnership.
India and France established a strategic partnership during the first visit of President Jacques Chirac to India in January 1998.
The story of Akshara is told in the form of a series of stories about a young boy who is in poor health.
Uganda: Government launches oral self-testing vaccine box for HIV
The Ugandan Ministry of Health has launched an oral HIV self-test box to ensure that citizens - especially male citizens - can get tested for HIV.
The program aims to reduce the number of new HIV infections in 2020.
OraQuick oral HIV self-testing test kit, produced by Orasure Technology, is designed specifically for vulnerable groups such as young people aged 18 to 24, adult males and sex workers.
Young people aged 18 to 24 are our current target group. This age group is our focus, and of course anyone over 18 should be included in the consideration category. We currently have no evidence of underage infection as stipulated by the Constitution, but as more evidence surfaces, we will move towards this goal. For men, we will give the test boxes to their mothers and then to their sexual partners, mainly sex workers, who are vulnerable to HIV testing services, said Mr. Jeffrey Tassi, Head of Technology for the HIV Testing Service.
Easy to use
Previously, self-testing boxes required blood testing for HIV, but oral HIV self-testing boxes can only be tested with oral fluid.
The test box is made possible by testing for antibodies (natural guards who are resistant to infection). If HIV is infected, the virus's antibodies are present in the blood and saliva. The test box is tested for antibodies in the mouth.
According to the Uganda AIDS Commission, Uganda has 1,000 new cases of HIV infection and 500 new deaths from AIDS each week, which means 53,000 new cases and 23,000 new deaths each year.
Dr. Diana Atwan, the Permanent Secretary of the Uganda Ministry of Health, said that the product, which was launched in a timely manner, will help people fight AIDS better.
However, she urged men to take HIV testing seriously.
She added that 14% of those infected still do not know they have HIV and that more work needs to be done to care for this segment of the population.
So the question now is how we can use this innovative technology. For me, it's actually like this... How are we creating demand now beyond the testing boxes, especially for those 14% of patients who don't get the care they need?
However, health officials warned that strict food prohibition would be imposed for 15 minutes before testing.
Mr. Tassie said that the relevant studies indicate that there were no suicides and the Ministry of Health is confident to avoid this possible tragedy because testing is voluntary.
Dr. Atwan said that in addition to educating users through images and videos, government and private institutions (including all pharmacies) should also provide 24-hour free telephone consultation services.
Studies have shown that HIV-infected and non-infected people tested with OraQuick HIV self-testing kits have more than 99% accuracy.
Qatar World Championships athletes feel high heat
At the World Championships in Athletics, which opened on Friday, many contestants have already faced their most challenging opponent: the hot weather in Qatar.
The humidity in Doha is suffocating, with temperatures of around 38 degrees Celsius during the day, and athletes and athletics officials are discussing the weather in Doha, which is why they are worried about some events.
Marathon and race races are held at midnight, thus minimizing the adverse effects of high temperatures.
Although the high temperatures have a smaller impact on players competing in the Hariri International Stadium, as indoor air conditioning and temperatures remain around 21 degrees Celsius, the players still need to adjust training arrangements as the training ground is located outside.
Well, we're from a tropical country, too, but it doesn't matter at all, Bahamian coach Ronald Cartwright told Reuters.
Hey, you're out here like someone's giving you heat. I guess that's why we're racing at midnight.
Athletics officials have pledged to provide more medical and safety measures for marathons and runners.
The International Association of Athletics Administrators (IAAT) said the women's marathon, which was scheduled to start at midnight on Friday, will be held as planned, as temperatures are expected to be below 30 degrees or around 30 degrees.
The agency said its medical representatives had assured athletes that they would monitor the weather throughout the day and report to the teams, ensuring the event was run at an acceptable level of health risk.
Athletes who participated in indoor events said that the high temperatures should not have a huge impact on their performance, but they also admit that training is especially exhausting.
I was in the gym and I was in the gym because the humidity was so high, and I was sweating and I was in the 400m, says Ray Benjamin.
I think it's not that bad, because the air conditioning is in the room.
Ryan Krauss, the 2016 Olympic champion, said he had to keep the ball heated to about 38 degrees Celsius every time to keep it moist while training in high-temperature, humid environments.
The normal temperature of the ball is much lower than the normal temperature of the spot, and once you take it out, it gets wet and dripping, the American athlete says.
European pole vault champion Amanda Duplantis, who regularly trains in hot weather in southern Louisiana, said that wet weather proved helpful for training because the grip was made stronger by rubbing the slime powder on her hands.
But for other athletes who regularly use sticky spray to increase grip, jumping high levers is harder to hold on to, he said, in this humidity.
I understand that people who use sticky sprays often have problems because their hands become slippery and sticky, Duplantis added.
Locksmiths arrested and major prison security breaches worrisome
A British locksmith was arrested recently for fearing that the keys to the jail cell had been copied and that taxpayers had spent £500,000 replacing all the locks in the cell.
The Queen's Majesty's Wandsworth Prison reported to police that some of the 1400 prisoners in the prison were concerned that copies of the key had been sold to them.
This suspected security flaw will lead to the replacement of the 3000 to lock, possibly the cell, internal and external door locks.
Police arrested a man in his forties on 13 September in the prison on suspicion of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. The man was from south-west London and worked for Government Facilities Services Limited, which provides maintenance services to 52 prisons in the south of England.
The police investigation has raised concerns that some key prints may have remained in the clay before the actual key replica was made.
However, the prison's head emphasized that they found no evidence that any of the prisoners had obtained the keys.
Wandsworth Prison is a Class B prison in south-west London, with a maximum capacity of 1628 inmates, and is one of the largest prisons in Western Europe. It was built in 1851 to house convicted male offenders and male offenders on probation.
A spokesman for the prison administration said: "Her Majesty the Queen has raised the security level of the Wandsworth prison gate, as a security incident is currently undergoing special identity checks.
House Speaker warns Trump to stop attacking whistleblowers
They said President Xi's remarks today constituted intimidation of witnesses and should be strongly condemned as an obstacle to the impeachment investigation of Congress. We condemn the president's attack and call on our Republican colleagues to condemn it as Congress must do everything in its power to protect this whistleblower and all whistleblowers.
The statement said that Trump is now fully aware that our committee is seeking testimony from the whistleblower and others cited in the whistleblower indictment announced today in the House impeachment inquiry, and that our country's laws prohibit any act of dissuasion, intimidation of witnesses or other pressure on witnesses to testify before Congress.
They added that any official who knew of the commission's investigation, including those who knew of the whistleblower's allegations, would not be intimidated, retaliated or threatened with retaliation, and that all witnesses must be able to testify before Congress.
The statement was issued on Thursday, coinciding with a week of whistleblowers accusing Trump of causing a wave of outrage in Washington, accusing him of abusing official power in the upcoming 2020 election to seek the intervention of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, while the White House took steps to cover it up. White House text-recorded July phone conversations released Wednesday showed Trump repeatedly urged the investigation of Zelensky by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
There is no evidence that Joe or Hunter Biden were wrong.
Just before whistleblowers filed a whistleblower indictment with lawmakers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday that Trump had betrayed his oath of office and announced the official start of an impeachment investigation into the president.
Michelle Obama praises Meghan Markle for her encouraging and heartwarming performance on the photo wall app
Michelle Obama on Thursday wrote a kindly message on the Photo Wall app, praising Meghan Markle, saying the Duchess of Sussex was a thoughtful leader who was breaking the rules to make the world a better place.
The Duchess and Prince Harry are currently on a 10-day royal tour of South Africa with their son, Archie Harrison Montbaton-Windsor, who attended a youth reception earlier this week and met with the Obama Foundation leadership.
The former First Lady of the United States wrote in a tweet: "Thank you, my friend, Her Royal Highness, Duchess of Sussex, for being a thoughtful leader who is breaking the codes and making the world a better place".
Michelle Obama added: "Whether it's meeting with our Obama Foundation @ObamaFoundation leaders or helping girls around the world seek education, she's inspired so many people".
Megan, who played the golden-haired lawyer Anne, is a freelance editor for the British fashion magazine Anne, where she interviewed Michelle Obama for the magazine's September issue. The two ladies enjoyed the conversation, and the former first lady reviewed her experiences as a mother and the changes that had taken place in her life.
In an interview, Michelle Obama said that motherhood has always been a master class for people who have learned to let go.
As a mother, I understand that most of the time my responsibility is to give my children space to explore and develop, to make them who they want to be. Not what I want them to be or what I want them to be at the age I want them to be, but what they are deep down.
Michelle Obama, who is well aware of the pressures of being in the spotlight around the world, gave the Duchess some advice in an interview with the Guardian.
She said: "The pressure that Mom feels from herself and others can sometimes be very great. So my biggest advice is to let go and not rush into anything".
She continued:
I spent the first few months at the White House worrying about my daughters, making sure they got off to a good start in school, and making new friends, so I'm going to be more ambitious.
Heroes' moment: Police rush to busy high speed, rescue a stray dog
It was a heroic moment when a police officer rushed to the busy highway to rescue another injured puppy.
Video footage taken by Joseph Puglia's travel recorder shows that Joseph Puglia saw the puppy jump off the police car within seconds of being hit by another car.
A police officer working at Pineapple Park, Florida, wrapped the injured puppy in a first aid kit, put it in his van, and rushed it to the nearest animal hospital.
Puglia told ABC News: "I was really feeling better until I saw the dog start breathing".
Thank God the puppy was spared the trouble and only suffered a slight scratch.
The officer said: "Oh, we gave him a nickname, Lucky Dog, and I think that name will never be appropriate again.
The puppy was sent to a local animal shelter, where his rescuer was hailed as a hero.
But Puglia insisted that he was just doing his job.
The officer added that if the Animal Service Center could not find the dog's owner, his family would be happy to give the lucky dog a home.
For the first time since WeWork went bankrupt, the public stock market has hit the brakes of a company that is not profitable.
The company's response to its IPO in the US was flat, especially when it was losing, which cast a shadow over its first publicly-traded calendar for the rest of the year.
Surprisingly, the sudden delay in WeWork's initial public offering highlights how the market is eroding confidence in companies and investors seeking funding.
The more provocative market for first-time publicly traded shares continued to punish Peloton Interactive Inc (PTON.O) on Friday, the second day it began trading, as the company's stock price fell to $24.74 and fell 4 percent. The company's current stock price fell 15 percent from its first-time publicly traded shares on Wednesday.
In the past, open market investors typically expected companies to be profitable about 18 months after their initial public offering. This time frame has been relaxed as capital managers are eager to incorporate rapidly growing revenue into their portfolio.
However, recent transactions seem to indicate that uncertainty about the economic outlook is making investors more challenging the loss-making businesses they are willing to support.
Peloton reported that the company's revenue grew rapidly, reaching a growth rate of 110% in the fiscal year ending June 30th. However, the company's operating leverage also showed negative value, with operating expenses up 147% from the previous year.
The loss-making dental firm SmileDirectClub (SDC.O) became the first dental firm to be listed in the U.S. earlier this month. Data from the research firm's capital recovery shows that for the first time in three years, the issuance of publicly traded shares will exceed the target range and close on the first trading day.
The average return on initial public offering in 2019 is currently around 9%, down from 30% at the end of June and 18% about two weeks ago.
In the United States, much of the third quarter's attention was focused on an unsuccessful transaction that raised WeWork's parent company's initial public offering of We Company's plans.
The company had originally planned to hold its initial public offering in early September, but postponed its IPO plans to later in 2019, after which it replaced its CEO and said it was reviewing the IPO timeline.
Endeavor Group Holdings (EDR.N), an entertainment and talent brokerage firm backed by Hollywood heavyweight broker Ali Immanuel, decided to abandon its first public offering at the last minute due to the dire market conditions, which had previously had a losing record. In early 2019, Uber Technologies (UBER.N) and Lyft Inc. (LYFT.O) had not yet set a clear profit timeline, and learned from the two companies that investors had begun delaying investments in companies with a history of serious losses.
Jonathan Van Nessong and Nancy Pelosi are promoting a project
The star of the show, Jonathan Van Ness, appeared on the floor of the US Congress on Thursday to discuss the Equal Rights Amendment with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Democrat) from California.
The Equal Rights Amendment Bill would provide non-discriminatory protection to individuals of gender minority in matters such as credit, education, employment, housing, federal financial aid, jury services, and public facilities.
The bill would amend the Civil Rights Amendment Act of 1964 to include sexual orientation and gender identity in the list of protected categories.
Van Ness recently publicly admitted to being HIV-positive, first sharing a video of himself in Congress with a cat, explaining in the text that he had met with the Speaker of the House of Representatives to discuss the passage of the Equal Rights Act, living together with HIV-positive people, and getting PrEP (a HIV-prevention drug):
He then shared a longer post, depicting a scene of two people holding hands, urging his followers to brave the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Republican from Kentucky) and press the Republican Senators to submit the bill to a Senate vote:
Pelosi introduced the Equal Rights Amendment on March 13. The House passed legislation in May. The bill has not yet been submitted to the Senate.
In August, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to fundamentally determine the legalization of anti-gay discrimination in the workplace, and argued in courtroom friendship that federal laws that discriminate against employers in the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were not intended to protect individuals from being dismissed for sexual orientation.
Earlier this year, Pelosi met with Van Ness and three other Plumbers and Representative Alexander Ocasio Cortez (D-NY) to discuss the policy and push the bill.
On Thursday, Pelosi shared a photo of her and Van Ness shaking hands in the balcony, thanking him for his voice for the fight:
David Aidenberg is making a brand new documentary about animals and colour
David Aidenburg is 93 years old, but the iconic natural master is still alive.
He launched the groundbreaking Nike documentary, Our Planet's Milk, and after its success, the popular star will return with another series: The Color of Life.
This time, the father of two will use a high-tech camera built specifically for the show to study how animals use color in their lives.
The British Broadcasting Corporation revealed that the star's intention was to show off the invisible colored world cup, which sounds very attractive indeed.
While fans are looking forward to the series being released soon, it seems that we all need to wait patiently because it will not be available on our screens until 2021.
But we are convinced that it is worth the wait.
Earlier this month, David was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Channel 4 Selection Channel magazine at a prestigious ceremony in London.
The 60-year-old national treasure has brought a cheerful smile to millions of people.
While collecting his medals, the reporter enthusiastically said: "Oh yes. What I do is not always so interesting, sometimes people hear things they don't like!"
But it is an honor and a great joy.
The winner was mentioned in the TV show 'Select' by the BBC: Sir David Aidenburg is still working, studying and doing shows, and he is not only a British hero but also a global icon.
This week, David is again praised for having a polar exploration ship named after him.
The star, along with Prince William and Queen Kate, attended the naming ceremony at Berkshire's Burkhardt Camel Ride in Merseyside.
He said: "The world is facing all sorts of tricky problems, which is not news to any of you, and the young people of today are the ones who will inherit the world.
The problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the people of the problem of the people of the problem of the people of the people of the people of the people of the parties.
This is what this amazing expedition ship will do, find out the facts, seek out the science to deal with the problems facing the world today, and in the future more and more people will do so.
The second season of the animated series is expected to air on BBC Two in 2021, while retaining worldwide copyright, according to NAF.
The husband of the murdered MP, Joe Cox, says don't use my wife's name to get political scores
Jeremy Corbyn criticized Boris Johnson last night by posting a video of the murder of a member of parliament, after Joe Cox's husband said his wife's name could not be used to get political scores.
The video by the Labour leader cuts footage of Mrs Cox and her post-mortem vigil and is captioned: Boris Johnson doesn't care about our street violence.
Critics said that Corbyn was using the murder of Joe Cox to get cheap political scores, while Joe Cox's husband Brendan Cox said that Labour leaders were mistaken for describing hate speech as a simple political party issue.
Mr Cox said: "Jeremy is right, the best way to respect Joe is to defeat hatred and division. He believes that MPs have a special responsibility and it is right".
But Jeremy is wrong to summarize hate speech as a simple political issue for a political party. Although Joe is an ardent Labour Party member, there are things that must go beyond party politics.
Cox also shared a post saying that Joe Cox's name was not just a political scoreboard and that he was accompanied by a caption. Thank you.
Speaking of clips about Mrs Cox, Johnson and the women MPs, Corbyn said: "The Prime Minister knows these words will promote violence and have serious consequences.
He continued to criticize Johnson and called for the establishment of a Labour government
Corbyn added: "Many people are deeply concerned about Boris Johnson's comments, which are being translated by far-right activists. When asked this question by female MPs who threatened to kill him, Johnson ignored them. It's a shame.
Meanwhile, Conservative MP and Minister of Commerce Nadine Zahavi said: "It was a big mistake to use Joe Cox like this because her family has made clear that she should not do this. Please stay away from politics".
Well, if you had a little respect, Jeremy Corbyn, you would have withdrawn the video. Well, before that, the British Parliament had a debate this week about some remarks, in which Johnson said that the best way to pay tribute to Mrs Cox was to stop the Brexit vote.
Jo's sister told the Independent: "I'm talking openly about some of the outrageous things about Boris Johnson - I just think that's not the way things are going. I can say what I think is right and wrong, but I'll try to try to do it in a cautious way".
Labour MP Yvette Cooper's daughter publicly stated yesterday that she has always been concerned about her mother's safety given the way people talk about politicians.
House of Representatives accuses Trump of border wall issues, but he plans to use a one-vote veto
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives attempted to overthrow President Donald Trump again by using emergency powers to attack military bases such as schools and casinos to pay for the construction of the border wall he had promised for a long time.
The bill was submitted to Trump by a vote of 236 to 174, but he will certainly reject it, just as he did a similar measure in March.
The Senate passed the bill last week, but more than a dozen senior Republican lawmakers condemned Trump.
Friday's vote was different because the government recently released a list of 127 military construction projects totaling $3.6 billion that will be cancelled to pay for the border wall, including many in Republican constituencies and states.
Brazil says its northeastern coast oil spill is not its fault
On Thursday, Brazil's Environmental Protection Agency - Brazil's Environment and Renewable Natural Resources Agency (BNR) said that analysis of large-scale oil leaks on the northeastern coast of Brazil showed that the leaked crude oil was not domestically produced.
The agency said in a statement that it had been conducting oil leakage investigations on several beaches in the northeastern states since September 2. Local media published several photos of beaches covered in black ash produced by the oil spill.
Oil spills along the northeastern coast of Brazil, covering a total of more than 1,500 kilometres (932 miles), have affected local wildlife and contaminated many of the country's popular tourist attractions, including Fortino Beach in Sierra, and Maragozinho Beach in Aragão, Aragon.
Brazilian state-owned oil holding company - Brazilian National Oil Company said in a statement that molecular analysis of crude oil has shown that the leaked crude oil was not produced or sold by the company.
Crude oil is usually checked before export to ensure that it meets the standards of the refinery that receives the crude oil. Crude oil produced in different oilfields can be identified by a range of chemical ingredients, including sulfur content, uranium content, acidity and viscosity.
Brazilian Petroleum Regulatory Authority - Director of Brazil's National Petroleum Administration, Decio Odoné, noted that the agency believed that a tanker off the Brazilian coast may have leaked oil, but added that this possibility had not been confirmed. A statement from the administration said that it had not received any reports of leaks on any oil drilling platforms in the country.
Some of the beaches were contaminated with oil and were sent to rehabilitation centers after being rescued in northern Rio Grande. The bodies of other animals were also found, the Brazilian Environment and Renewable Natural Resources Agency said, but did not disclose the specific species or death toll.
Brazilian state oil company said in a statement that while the company was not involved in the oil spill, it was also involved in the cleanup work, with about 100 employees helping to clean the beach.
Scoda provides voice digital assistants to drivers
Skoda will launch a digital assistant that can be started with voice commands. In an announcement on Wednesday, the Czech automaker said that drivers can use the phrase "good", "laughter" to start the digital assistant.
The system supports six languages and can perform a range of tasks, including navigating to destinations and searching for music. The system was originally to be configured in Kamiq's urban SUV and compact sedan Scala. According to the annual report of Skoda, the Skoda brand has delivered 125 million vehicles worldwide in 2018 since its acquisition by the Volkswagen Group in 1991.
The company's virtual voice assistant also reflects the efforts of other automakers in the automotive industry. For example, some BMW cars now have a smart personal assistant that can be started using buttons, a call or a hello, a BMW-style phrase. Drivers can use voice commands to start the seat heating function, get information about tyre pressure and adjust the temperature inside the car.
On Thursday, Jack Palmer, senior connected car expert at SBD Automotive, sent an email to CNBC, saying that the sound of the voice is the ideal communication tool for cars.
If most of the commands from drivers could be received through virtual assistants without the touchscreen and buttons being put on, the current driver distraction problem would be greatly reduced, Palmer added.
The actions of companies such as Skoda and BMW suggest that the way people interact with cars may change. Car analyst Hannah Casey, of Market Intelligence firm Intelligent, told CNBC via email that a recent report by the company highlighted why nearly 40% of American consumers who own cars want to use personal digital assistants in their cars.
Ghana: World Rabies Day is being observed
Akra organised an event on Wednesday to mark the 13th World Day of Rabies, actively calling on pet owners to vaccinate their pets to protect the lives of citizens.
The theme of the event is Vaccination: Eliminating Rabies, organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in cooperation with the Office of Agricultural Veterinary Medicine.
The aim of the event is to highlight the importance of large-scale vaccination of dogs in the elimination of rabies in Ghana.
Speaking at the meeting, Mr. Abebe Hale-Gabriel, Assistant Director-General and United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Representative in Ghana, noted that the problem of rabies can be reduced to a maximum extent if vaccination is intensified and stray animals are kept away from humans (especially children).
He said that according to the Global Strategic Plan for Rabies Zero Death by 2030, rabies kills 500,000 people a year, 40% of whom are children's rabies in Asia and Africa, and he called for comprehensive measures to address this situation and protect children from rabies.
Mr. Hale-Gabriel said that most stray animals are infected with rabies, which reflects the need for Ghana to further expand its Joint Anti-Rape Disease Campaign strategy (RPA) - a strategy that requires pet owners to vaccinate animals with rabies-related diseases by 2030 - to prevent rabies.
He stressed that Ghana must start campaigning and vaccination programs for five years to raise public awareness and eliminate the risk of rabies in humans.
He noted that through the Ghana Rapid Rabies Prevention and Action Plan (2018-2030), we have developed a comprehensive roadmap to phase out rabies, hoping to eradicate this long-neglected tropical epidemic by 2030.
Mr. Hail-Gabriel promised that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is ready to work with other relevant agencies to prevent and control rabies in Ghana.
Dr. Owen Kalua, the World Health Organization's representative in Ghana, said that rabies is an epidemic that must be controlled to save lives.
He explained that by supporting the National Plan to Eliminate Rabies by 2030, the National Strategy for Rabies Zero Deaths in the Human Race, which includes the concept of Rabies Health Integration and cross-sectoral cooperation, was implemented.
Dr. Kalua pointed out that 99% of the diseases that are common in humans and animals are transmitted to humans through dogs, adding that the treatment of and ultimately elimination of rabies in humans is a healthy and effective method.
Dr. Asseedu Bawa, Director of Veterinary Services, said with regret that rabies has become a global burden.
He said: "Although rabies cannot be cured, vaccination can prevent infection, so eliminating rabies is feasible and all animal owners must ensure that their animals are vaccinated".
Dr. Ba'a said that while the use of appropriate sustainable control strategies could prevent rabies completely, the mortality rate for rabies will continue to rise and the epidemic will increase due to lack of funding and insufficient collaboration.
He added that the animal sector needs to have sufficient resources to prevent rabies from spreading to dogs and prevent the disease.
12 year old girl who silenced the world
At the age of 16, Greta Thumbbery established herself as a global spokesperson on climate change. But 27 years ago, well before the social media boom, another girl was already denouncing the United Nations leaders on the world stage.
Her environmental campaign has been unstoppable since Greta Thumbbery, a student strike in her native Sweden to protest climate change; her angry, passionate speech at the UN Climate Action Summit on Monday pushed her environmental campaign to the top; she lashed out at politicians who stole her wild dreams and childhood memories with empty talk, while humanity witnessed a catastrophe of extinction.
The ruthless criticism of Tumbery has been both fierce and highly praised. New York magazine called her a saintly nun, Lady Jane Jane, who protested climate change, while the Guardian compared her remarks to the significance of the speech by US President Lincoln Gettysburg.
Back in 1992, the media gave the same assessment to Ms. Tumes. Before officials in the country in Timberi coldly accused Ms. Tumes of possibly not having a future, netizens split into two completely opposing factions - the opposition and the supporters of Ms. Tumes; when, at the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Ms. Tumes, a 12-year-old, made a similar cry, was called the girl who silenced the world for five minutes.
The tone and tone of Tumbarry are so out of tune. We're here to tell you adults that you have to change your lifestyle, and she starts her speech like Tumbarry told the adults at the meeting that we won't let you easily escape these responsibilities.
As Humberley told the UN climate summit that the catastrophe of the great extinction of the ticks was coming, and you all know the fairy tale of money and economic growth all day long, Dumbledore told the leaders of the nations that the ticks lost my future were not as simple as the election or the floating stock market.
The focus of the two girls' communication was on the null-destiny theory. Oh, I'm afraid to stand under the sun because the ozone layer is empty. I'm afraid to breathe air because I don't know what chemicals are in it, said Tom Thurston in a 1992 speech.
The environmental problems that Tom Thurber is hailing reflect the world of the early 1990s, when ecological issues focused on overharvesting, ozone depletion and species extinction. But after several years of intervention, humans have been fairly successful in solving these problems. Thanks to the landmark chemical ban, ozone depletion has slowed significantly, while global forest coverage has increased significantly, with an area equal to the sum of the two states of Texas and Alaska.
Tom Tomusser was the founder of an environmental think tank and worked for the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan's Special Advisory Group in the early 21st century.
What will happen to the future of Tomberi? It depends on how you look at the example of Mummy Thurgood. On the one hand, nothing that she worries about most has happened. On the other hand, governments are still struggling with environmental issues while also accepting the discipline of children.
Assuming that our world still exists 27 years later - unless, according to Dunbar, humanity cuts carbon emissions to zero within the next decade or so - the radical environmental activist is likely to look back on her long career at the United Nations and NGOs, which began with this famous speech.
By then, another worried child may be raising a furious warning about the acid rain in the Martian colonies.
The Scottish National Party may support Jeremy Corbyn as interim prime minister to prevent a no-deal Brexit
The Scottish National Party has expressed its possible support for Jeremy Corbyn as interim Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit.
As relations between MPs and the Prime Minister's Office have grown increasingly strained, Nicholas Sturkin has suggested that the Labour leader be supported as acting Prime Minister before the general election.
Mr. Corbyn called on Conservative rebels and opposition MPs to support him in August to lead the interim government, but this was boycotted, particularly by Liberal Democrat leader Joe Swenson.
Under these proposals, the opposition sought to remove Boris Johnson by a vote of no confidence and then form a coalition government, seeking an extension to prevent Britain from leaving the EU on 31 October.
The plan failed to gain cross-party support at the time, but Scottish National Party officials feared that Mr Johnson would ignore the law if no deal was reached by 19 October, forcing him to delay Brexit.
The Scottish National Party leader, Nicholas Sturgeon, suggested that the appointment of Corbyn could ensure the extension, as Johnson was responsible for handling a fool's errand.
In response to a tweet suggesting the appointment of a Labour leader or another interim prime minister, she said: "Mom agrees with this practice".
The vote of no confidence, the opposition united in one-man centers, the only goal being to ensure a postponement and then an immediate general election.
Everything is at risk, but leaving Johnson in office, not forcing any agreements, or even making bad ones, is a strategy in my opinion.
Senior MPs Harriet Harman and Ken Clark have both been nominated as potential candidates to lead the coalition government, but senior sources from the Scottish National Party insist that Labour must be the leader.
The source told Independent TV's Robert Peston that the situation was becoming clearer when we had to vote for a new Prime Minister through a vote of no confidence so that we could demand a postponement of Brexit and a general election.
It is too complicated to try to find a candidate who is consensual, who is national unity, especially now that we have a candidate.
A spokesman for the Scottish National Party said the party was committed to preventing a no-deal Brexit and to removing the dangerous and undemocratic incumbent Prime Minister Janis Joplin as soon as possible.
The spokesman said: "If there is political will, it is now possible for political parties to unite to ensure that the deferred letter does not fall into the hands of Boris Johnson and his close friends, who have decided to find a solution to avoid the Bannon Bill but are issued by the interim acting prime minister, the interim acting prime minister will serve only within the necessary time frame for the transmission, and immediately after the general election".
We remain open to all options to achieve the goal of stopping a no-deal Brexit and removing Boris Johnson.
Even with the support of the Scottish National Party, this would be a decisive vote for Mr. Corbyn. There are 288 Conservative MPs and 10 members of the Democratic Unionist Party, so the opposition needs to pull some of the 34 independent MPs.
Labour believes the plan is the simplest, most democratic way to stop a no-deal Brexit.
However, the Liberal Democrats believe that the interim government under Mr. Corbyn needs the support of former Conservative MPs and BJP traitors and therefore cannot get the support it needs in the House of Representatives.
Angus Conservative MP Kirsten Hale said: "This report confirms the long-standing suspicion that members of the Scottish National Party would be very happy to support Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
There is no doubt that Kobin's unstable stance on the second independence referendum (abbreviated as indyref2) was the determining factor for the nationalists.
If he were to become Prime Minister, he would have opened the door to a re-run of the 2014 referendum.
Only the Conservative government can stand up and support those who cast ballots against the banquet at a 100th anniversary event.
Suspected of sexual harassment, over 50 students at the University of Surrey banned from participating in sports teams
The people were just waiting for the guys to do what they should do on vacation.
However, students reacted that some students were very angry this year, especially during a match when members of the football club were being provoked by their teammates to provoke women, while their friends tried to stop them from doing so.
Alan Sutherland, president of the Surrey Students' Association, said: "We have learned that this behavior is wrong and that any student accused of making serious mistakes will be transferred to the school under the Student Discipline Regulations as the investigation goes on.
The school officially punished three students and personally investigated the behaviour of the football team.
A student was expelled from school for three sexual misconduct or harassment and one sexual assault.
At the same time, the final warning was issued to the other two students who were also accused of harassment and asked them to apologize.
One student was banned from entering the university campus at certain times, and another student was banned from participating in organized social activities. All three students were banned from attending graduation ceremonies.
The University of Surrey Men's Soccer Club has said it sincerely apologizes for the behaviour of its members on their tour of Croatia.
Matt de Groord should not be punished for schizophrenia
In 2016, Matthew De Groord, who killed five people at a family party in Calgary, was convicted of criminal negligence.
Now, in 2019, a hearing will decide whether he should be allowed more freedom, such as an unattended exit. The decision will be made in the coming weeks, so we will consider whether this is a good idea during this period. There are different views on this: one believes that given his past violence, the call should be made to prevent it from happening again, while the other believes in the power of change and recovery.
First, let's look at the more pessimistic side. De Groord did kill five people during a mental illness. It was an unpredictable violent attack. He had schizophrenia, which is why he was found not guilty but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication. His psychiatrist, Santok Ray, had told the review committee that the consequences would be serious if Matthew de Groord committed another crime.
I think that the stigma that people have for people with mental illness, especially those with schizophrenia, is largely what causes this fear. Some mental illnesses have become less terrible, such as mood and anxiety disorders. But other diseases, including schizophrenia, are still highly stigmatized. This is largely because many people portray schizophrenia as dangerous people, with voices in their heads telling them to kill.
This is true, but it is rare, and perhaps that is why we remember this so deeply. In fact, most people with schizophrenia are nonviolent, more likely to be victims of crime or violence than perpetrators. Given that the fear of repeated crimes is based more on biases against schizophrenia patients than on a practical possibility, it seems unreasonable to insist on depriving Degrad certain freedoms.
I don't think Degrod should be regulated forever. Regulation should be made through a similar system of parole to ensure that he is still on his medication and that medication is effective. He argues that it is a form of isolation that he or other mentally ill patients are kept in unless absolutely necessary. This will make it impossible for people with mental illness, especially those with schizophrenia, to integrate into society forever; thus they will continue to be stigmatized and the notion of dangerous criminals will be perpetuated. The court found him not criminally liable, so why should he be treated as a prisoner rather than as a person who is now living with a mental illness, now recovered?
Hungarian Prime Minister Alban defends the country's candidate for European Commission, with a solution at his fingertips
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said that he had several solutions to address the issue after the rejection of Hungary's nomination for a European Commission member.
According to Reuters, the Socialist Party of Romania's political figure, Roana Prende, appointed by the EU Minister of Transport, and the Commissioner for Nominations for the EU's Eastern Expansion, former Hungarian Minister of Justice Raslo Trojesni, were told that their nomination hearing could not be held due to inconsistencies in the financial statements.
I am convinced that Mr. Trotsky is the right candidate for the European Commission, Mr. Olban said. "If I don't say he is guilty, it means that he helped the government and me... to protect Hungary from immigration interference".
The move was embarrassing for the Troyesni recommendation by Alban, who has been in constant conflict with Brussels on issues such as immigration policy.
Meet a Baby on a Flight: Japan Airlines launches a service to avoid screaming baby seats
Japan Airlines has launched an online booking tool that can show seats for step-children, and long-haul flights that are haunted by crying babies may no longer exist.
When passengers with children aged eight days to two years are selected, a child identifier will automatically appear on the seat list to remind other passengers who have not yet been selected.
The new features do not guarantee that passengers can completely avoid crying baby screams.
If a passenger booked a flight through a third party, or joined a traveling team, or changed planes at the last minute, the icon may not appear, according to the Japan Airlines website.
Japanese Airlines and other airlines have not yet come up with a way to predict the seats of continuous gamblers and passengers who have their seats completely tilted when eating on the plane.
However, the move has won praise from some users on social media.
Thanks to @JAL_Official_jp for reminding me where the kids are planning to shout during the 13-hour journey, the businessman Rahat Ahmed wrote on Twitter.
However, some people have also urged travelers to remain tolerant.
We're going to learn to tolerate, or we're going to need a map of the places in our lives, like screaming, running water, drinking, and so on, a user wrote.
Pompeo accuses Syria of using chemical weapons in May attacks
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks during a United Nations conference. The United Nations General Assembly said on Thursday that the United States has confirmed the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government in an attack earlier this year.
Pompeo said U.S. officials had determined that the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad used hydrogen in an attack on the opposition armed forces in Idlib province on May 19.
In a press conference, Pompeo said that the Assad regime is responsible for countless atrocities, some of which have escalated to war crimes and crimes against humanity.
U.S. officials said in May that they received reports that were consistent with chemical attacks in northwestern Syria, but did not give any definitive conclusions at the time.
In April 2018, the United States, Britain and France launched airstrikes on Syria in retaliation for their alleged chemical attacks that killed more than 40 people earlier that month.
It's different in a way because it's a joke... but it's important to know that President Trump is actively protecting the world from chemical weapons attacks, Pompeo said.
He also said the United States will provide an additional $4.5 million to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to fund the investigation into other suspected chemical weapons incidents in Syria.
Pompeo also called on the Assad regime to release thousands of detainees unjustly detained, including the missing American journalist Austin Tissot, who was presumed imprisoned by the government for seven years.
He is just one of a few American citizens being held in Syria, and we call on the Syrian regime to release them all.
Tesla has released a report that Musk's goal is to deliver 100,000 vehicles this quarter.
Elon Musk, co-founder and CEO of Tesla Motor Company, is the CEO of Tesla Motor Company.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Tesla expects to deliver 100,000 vehicles this quarter, a new record, after Tesla's share price rose more than 5% following the news report.
Electrek said the news was leaked from an email Musk sent to Tesla employees. Musk wrote in the email: "Oh, we expect to deliver 100,000 cars for the first time this quarter, and this is an exciting milestone for our company!"
The CEO added in the report: "The challenge to meeting this goal is to ensure that we have the right models in the right place and concentrate the company's resources as much as possible to help achieve the delivery target at the end of the quarter".
The automaker is expected to report on its quarterly vehicle deliveries in the coming days.
Tesla delivered about 950,000 electric vehicles in the last quarter.
Greece: 5 people deny trafficking of poor women for illegal adoption
Five Greek and Georgian citizens are on trial for alleged involvement in a criminal organization that allegedly trafficked newborns for adoption.
On Friday, the five denied the allegations before the Thessaloniki Base Magistrate. Two of the Georgian nationals were charged with the main offences.
The group reportedly recruited several Bulgarian impoverished pregnant women who were willing to give up their newborn babies. According to authorities, the group sold the babies to a Greek couple with no children.
A total of 12 people were arrested this week on suspicion of illegally adopting and trafficking human eggs.
The police said it was one of the largest and most rigorously organized groups of its kind in Europe. The European Police Service provided assistance in the investigation of the case.
Mike Pompeo says the Syrian government used hydrogen-chemical weapons in the May attack
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday that the United States has concluded that the Syrian government used hydrogen-chemical weapons in May this year during its war with the rebels in Idlib.
In a press conference at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Pompeo said that the Assad regime is responsible for countless atrocities, some of which have escalated to war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Pompeo added: "Today I announce that the United States has concluded that the Assad regime used chemical weapons on May 19".
The United States said in May that the United States received a large number of reports that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces suspected some chemicals in the northwest of the area of armed conflict with the rebels; however, the United States has not made clear conclusions about whether the Syrian government used chemical weapons.
In April 2017 and April 2018, the Trump administration used chemical weapons to bomb Syria twice with Assad's Syrian government forces.
The parents still hope that the suspect who shot their son a year ago will one day be online.
The 20-year-old was shot dead a year ago, but the victim's family has not given up hope of finding the killer.
Guy Alford, the father of the victim, said: "Oh, I wish I could be with you, son, I wish I could be with you".
Alford returned to the scene of the crime a year after his son Guy Alford III was shot and killed at the Jack's fast food chain near the box office at 52nd Street and Atlantic Avenue. He said he wanted to draw attention to the murder of his unresolved son.
He said: "Oh, someone knows something and they need to tell me".
Never released security footage shows Alford parking in a restaurant with a second car behind him. Three suspects then get out of the car. One of them walks to the driver's seat of the car where Alford was driving and shoots Alford. Four people in the car jumped out and ran away.
The first time I saw the cat, I was in the car and I was in the car.
The sad father said he did not know who would want to hurt his son, nor who else was in the car when his son was shot.
"Oh, they ran out of my son's car like in the video, where did they go?" said Olford. "Did you guys go back and try to help him or do something?"
He was a star football player at Allemanni High School and then a standout safety for Long Beach City College football. He said his son was struggling to play football at the time, and was seeking entry into first-class school, and his dream was to become a nurse.
A friend of his son, Michael Harvey, said: "My father worked three jobs. I'm 21 years old and he's a year younger than me, and whoever keeps this busy and working attitude is admired by others".
Police are still investigating the fatal shooting, and Alford said he did not give up.
He said: "Oh, this will be solved, I can assure you".
Alford himself offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect. We strongly recommend that anyone who can provide information about the crime call the Sheriff's Office.
The difficulty of Brexit
If Johnson tries to avoid committing to a delay, he will be humiliated in Brussels by the European Court of Justice. This will ease the spirits of European officials, who will likely agree to do so. Mainly because spending more time looking for solutions to reduce the threat of a no-deal Brexit would hurt both economies.
However, diplomats in Europe also saw that the political stalemate in Britain led to a delay in decision-making. Parliamentarians were able to put aside differences, limit Johnson's actions and seek extension, but they could reach a consensus that this was all they could do. It was this Parliament that rejected the difficult Brexit deal with former Prime Minister Theresa May three times. Unless elections were held, it was up to another member of Parliament to decide, otherwise nothing would change.
Even with elections, the outlook remains alarming, as European countries seek to resolve the chaos caused by Brexit through a friendly solution. The policies of the opposition Labour Party are so painfully distorted that they are almost incomprehensible; while the Liberal Democrats of the Centre propose to cancel the Brexit, a debate that is considered too extreme.
Brussels may be optimistic if a viable outline of the agreement is put on the table at the European Commission's headquarters in Belém, but in reality, there is no such outline.
Johnson frequently criticized the former prime minister's proposals to avoid Ireland's return to the hard border and to protect the single market in the EU, but he also failed to come up with any convincing alternatives. Officials said that many of the alternatives proposed by the UK were not concrete enough, lacking practicality, and were difficult to implement before and when the UK left the EU on 31 October.
In addition, Johnson's weakness will make the leaders of the EU27 less willing to address the red line, despite the British minister in charge of the no-deal Brexit campaign, Michael Goff, claiming they were working to adjust the red line.
Johnson was criticized for his unfair speech in the Brexit debate, and the best outcome was that a series of strikes against him would bring the race to a close. Europe had no choice but to negotiate with the current British government while working to maintain unity among the other 27 member states.
But it was more like a football game where one side had 27 players in the defensive line while the other side was trying to pick up the ball and go home.
The EU is good at making rules, laying down the red line and sticking to enforcement, but it is short-sighted to impose its will unilaterally. At least before the UK general election or the second referendum break the deadlock, Britain has been unwilling to take care of its own internal contradictions.
The UK's exit is a difficult one.
The first time a black hole was captured, it was the first time a star had been caught swallowing and tearing.
The first image of a giant black hole swallowing and tearing a star was captured.
According to the paper published in the journal Astrophysics, the star is about the size of our Sun and is 375 million light-years away from us, where it can be seen twisting and spiraling upwards under the gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole.
The star was then swallowed, a rare cosmic event astronomers call the tidal rift event.
NASA's planet search telescope, and the Ling Ling Ling Exoplanet Satellite - capturing the detailed timeline from the beginning to the end of the event for the first time.
Astronomers used a global network telescope to detect this phenomenon before observing the Ling Ling Exoplanetary Satellite, a continuous observation area of the Ling Exoplanetary Satellite designed to search for distant planets captured the early stages of this violent event.
Thomas Hollyan, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institute of Science who led the study, said: "It's actually a combination of rationality and good luck, and sometimes it's what it takes to advance science".
When a star is too close to a supermassive black hole, it is absorbed into the center of most galaxies, such as the Earth's galaxy.
The strong gravity of the black hole tears the star apart, some of the matter from the star is thrown into space, while the rest is absorbed into the black hole, forming a glowing, hot glowing gas in the process of ingestion.
Mr. Holly added: "We can measure the speed at which the star is shining, and we observe rare planetary declines in temperature and dimming in brightness.
British Commerce Commission to investigate Thomas Cook's bankruptcy
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it planned to operate 72 flights after the collapse of Thomas Cook Tourist Group, bringing an additional 16,000 passengers back to the UK.
The air regulator said that more than 40% of passengers had been rescued in the wake of the largest peacetime repatriation operation, the PAMM-HON program, which began on Monday.
Meanwhile, the UK Parliamentary Commerce Committee has launched a bankruptcy investigation into Thomas Cook, seeking to question management about executive compensation and accounting policy.
Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel agency, closed its doors early Monday morning, and is home to many hotels, tourist attractions and resorts around the world.
The UK's oldest tourism company, which unfortunately went bankrupt, whose main leaders should face public scrutiny and be held accountable for their actions before the company went bankrupt, said Rachel Reeves, chair of the UK's Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Council.
The hearing will begin in mid-to-late October.
The board of directors welcomed the opportunity to clarify the facts to show that their actions were always in the best interests of Thomas Cook's customers, employees and stakeholders, a person familiar with the company told Reuters.
Why the Times published the details of the identity of the reporter
On Thursday, The Times released an exclusive detailed account of a reporter whose allegations led to the Democratic Party launching an impeachment investigation against President Trump this week. The article said the reporter was a CIA official who had previously served in the White House and was a senior expert on Ukraine.
Many readers - including national security and intelligence workers - have criticized the detailed reporting by the Times, saying the move could endanger the life of the reporter and may turn a blind eye to those who want to report.
We expressed our concerns to Dean Barquette, the executive editor of The Times of London, who responded to the comments in a discussion with the Reader's Centre:
The president and some of his supporters have criticized the report's credibility as the information provided by the whistleblower sparked a landmark impeachment process.
We decided to release limited information about the reporter, including his work with a non-political agency, and his complaint was based on a deep understanding of the White House because we wanted to provide readers with information that would allow readers to make their own judgments about the credibility of the reporter.
China says it has not provoked any war and has not invaded foreign lands
On Friday, China said it had no intention of provoking a war or a conflict, nor had it invaded land on the side of another country, avoiding mentioning the 1962 Sino-Indian War.
China has always been committed to resolving territorial issues and maritime boundary disputes through negotiations and consultation, and on October 1, four days before the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party's reign, China released an official white paper.
China has not actively provoked any wars and conflicts in 70 years, and has not invaded an inch of another country's land, the New Age China and World War II White Paper writes.
While the White Paper emphasizes the communist cause and the rise of the Chinese people, it makes no mention of the bloody war with India in 1962 and the large swath of land occupied by China, especially in the Axis region.
The disputes over the 3488 km line of actual control remained unresolved. China also claims that Arunachal Pradesh is part of southern Tibet, which India opposes.
So far, the two countries have held 21 rounds of special representative talks to resolve the border dispute.
In addition to the 1962 war, India and China also clashed in 2017 in Dokram, when the Chinese People's Liberation Army tried to pave a road in a corridor nearby known as the Yellow India, which is connected to the northeastern states of India, and which is claimed by the People's Liberation Army.
The two sides eventually resolved the issue through diplomatic means, withdrawing their troops.
In 1979, a major military conflict erupted between China and Vietnam. China claimed sovereignty over the entire South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan all expressed opposition.
China and 12 of its 14 neighbors have resolved the land border issue thoroughly, outlining the maritime boundary of the Gulf of Vietnam in the north, the White Paper said, noting that China has been cutting back its military personnel by 400 million yuan since reform and opening up in 1978.
China's military, with 2 million officers, remains the world's largest.
The prolonged monsoon season has brought flooding and chaos to many parts of India
India's monsoon season has raged for almost a month, with unprecedented rainfall causing buildings to collapse and many crops to start rotting.
Although the northern Indian monsoon season usually weakened in early September, the average rainfall this month was 37% above normal. Experts from the Indian Meteorological Department say that if this continues for several days, it will be the latest monsoon season in decades to recede.
Many parts of India are still suffering from unprecedented flooding disasters, with the latest one in Pune, western India, where heavy rains on Wednesday and Thursday killed several people and caused massive damage to buildings.
Houses are flooded, people walk down flooded streets, and this is usually only seen during the peak season.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad also experienced heavy rainfall. Houses were severely damaged by continuing rainfall in northern Akhand Province.
The season is also late. Many areas are water-scarce, and farmers are preparing for possible drought disasters.
The prolonged monsoon season has left the farmers with no headaches. So much rain is not normal at this time of year. This has led to my vegetable crops being rotted, including the cereal, beans, peas and tomatoes I have harvested, says Prakash Mehra, a small farmer in Bhimtal, northern Akhand.
For consumers, the late-season has led to higher prices for onions, which are an important ingredient in Indian food. In cities like Delhi and Mumbai, onions are sold at 80 rupees per kilogram (about 1 pound), while in normal circumstances they are 20 rupees per kilogram (about 23 pence).
The next big festival is the Ten Victory Festival on October 8, where Indians raise a huge cartoon-like robot portrait of the Hindu epic Romero, with a dark beard and a grin at evil.
Burning Robona's portraits symbolizes evil. But they are made of paper, and if the monsoon continues, Robona may laugh until the end.
Julian Assange: Private security company hacked by CIA to monitor WikiLeaks founder at Ecuadorian embassy
Julian Assange was reportedly living in London when he was the founder of the WikiLeaks, a private security company that was hired to protect the Ecuadorian embassy in London by the Spanish private security company for the US intelligence agency.
A report in the Spanish Nationalist newspaper reported that the Spanish private security company was alleged to have provided the CIA with audio and video of Assange's meeting with his lawyers.
The company is under investigation by the Spanish High Court, the company reported.
Assange himself filed a criminal complaint alleging that the company violated his privacy and the privilege of his client-lawyer.
The Spanish private security company failed to respond to a request for comment on the matter, according to the National Press.
In April, Assange was immediately expelled from the embassy by the authorities after being handed over to the British authorities in Ecuador.
In 2012, while on bail, Assange entered the Ecuadorian embassy in the UK as a refugee, facing the risk of extradition to Sweden on sexual assault charges; Assange said he was concerned that he would be extradited to the United States if he gave up WikiLeaks.
In June, the United States formally issued an extradition request for Assange, who was charged with 18 counts of computer abuse, unauthorized leakage of defense information, and other charges.
He is accused of conspiring to assassinate former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.
Assange, who was previously jailed for violating bail terms for Swedish extradition requests, is currently serving his sentence at Belmarsh Prison in London, where he should have been released last week, but is awaiting trial pending an extradition hearing in the United States in London in February 2020.
In May, the Swedish prosecutor's office resumed its investigation into Assange's rape allegations - which Assange has denied.
All-Power Airlines landed in Baltimore after declaring a state of emergency
The Federal Aviation Administration said that an All-Star International Airlines aircraft landed safely at Baltimore Washington International Airport after declaring a state of emergency.
The Federal Aviation Administration said in an email that Flight 328 landed at Baltimore Washington International Airport at 6:19 p.m. on Thursday after a hydraulic problem with the Boeing B777.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the flight was flying from Baltimore, but its destination is unknown. It is not yet known how many passengers were on the flight. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident.
All-Power International Airlines (TALSA, Oklahoma) received a phone message and immediately returned the message on Thursday night.
Why do we need Gandhi?
As we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the birth of an extraordinary person, the leaders of the world's two largest democracies should more than ever follow the principles he has followed.
Born on October 2, 1869, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, a lifelong advocate of morality, nonviolence, tolerance and social justice, left a valuable legacy for the world. He had a profound impact on the two most important American civil rights movements.
Howard Thurman and Benjamin Mays, American activists who traveled extensively across the ocean to India to meet Gandhi, thus Gandhi's influence on the civil rights movement began long before Martin Luther King Jr. embraced his ideas.
Chavez traces his political awakening to a news video of a gunless man conquering the powerful British Empire, which he later followed in Gandhi's footsteps when he led the farm workers movement.
Outside the United States, Gandhi has the same influence. To name a few, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai and climate change activists all see him as a beacon of light.
However, President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi seem to have no interest in his thoughts except for the verbal compliments Gandhi made at a large joint public rally in Houston recently. Both are practitioners of right-wing populism, which lacks empathy or tolerance in the regime, and have successfully launched white and Hindu voting groups in their respective countries, while fomenting division and social opposition.
Modi became a member of the Indian Nationalist Organization (INV) at the age of eight, the former member of the organization, Natul Ram Godson, who assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948. In fact, the National Assembly of India's ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, has been increasingly praising Gandhi's assassination in recent years.
The Modi government has demonstrated anti-Gandhiism in many ways, abolishing the autonomy and status of the Muslim-majority provinces of Jammu and Kashmir and imposing blockades on the region; nor welcomes the Rohingya refugees fleeing extreme persecution in Myanmar.
The Modi government has also caused social unrest by setting up a national register of citizens and holding camps in the border region of Assam, apparently to capture non-native citizens of Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority neighbor, but this could lead to nearly 2 million people being deprived of their right to vote and imprisoned.
Trump's policies are also striking. The Trump administration's travel ban on Muslim-majority countries is a response to Islamophobia, and it is a factor that is often considered by Modi in formulating policies. Its cruelty to refugees is a stark reflection of the suffering of the Rohingya by the Indian government, while the US detention camps are very different from the detention camps established by the Modi regime.
A moment worth learning emerged at the recent joint meeting of the two leaders. In the event, House Majority Leader Stern Hoyer cited Gandhi's definition of democracy as a way to make democracy equal opportunities for the weak and the strong.
It is the 150th anniversary of Gandhi's birth and they should have done much better in their tenure if Trump and Modi had kept Gandhi's advice in mind.
White House announcement: Trump nominates Peter Gainer as the Secretary of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
On April 3, 2019, at the U.S. Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., Peter Gaynor, acting director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, smiled and testified at a hearing on the agency's request for budget for fiscal year 2020 by the Senate Appropriations Committee's Homeland Security Subcommittee.
US President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gainer as the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the White House said in a statement.
Gaina, the current Deputy Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, served as the agency's acting Director, responsible for overseeing government response to hurricanes and wildfires.
Since Brock Lang resigned in March, the agency has not had a Senate-approved head. The Department of Homeland Security, the senior agency in the Administration, found that Long had violated the use of buses to Washington and his residence in North Carolina, and subsequently resigned as director.
Earlier this month, another candidate for governor, Jeffrey Bayard, was removed from the nomination after a background check found that he was suspected of being involved in a bar fight.
Gena's nomination was expected; he would need a Senate majority to approve the nomination and become the first deputy director.
Before becoming deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget in 2018, Gaina worked in the emergency management department in Rhode Island and served in the U.S. Navy, the White House said.
Man attacked and burned at his door
A man was set on fire at his home door, which police believe was a targeted attack.
The 48-year-old man was found dead in his home in Skemersdale, West Lancashire, after being bathed in flammable liquid, allegedly gasoline.
The man was seriously burned and is currently in hospital in critical but stable condition.
At around 1am on Thursday, police received a call to the police station to reach the man's home and investigate the attempted murder.
Police chief Paulin Stowburs, who is in charge of the investigation, said: "The nature of the incident is bad and the man is still in hospital and the situation is very bad.
We are conducting a series of investigations to try to find out who is responsible.
Well, we're trying to determine the motives behind the incident, we're sure it was targeted, and I want to emphasize that I don't think it's a threat to the wider community at the moment.
I hope the person who killed him can report to us.
When your family members return home, do they have suspicious behavior, smoke, gasoline, or unexplained scars?
We need someone to take responsibility for this terrible incident.
Fragile Democrats raise Pelosi's concerns about impeachment
Several members expressed their position during the meeting: Democrats should continue to focus on the investigation of Ukraine, accusing Trump of asking the Ukrainian president to investigate potential 2020 political opponents rather than other possible violations detailed in the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
Pelosi said in a news conference Thursday morning that the vast majority of Democrats agreed with the strategy that whistleblowers accuse the whistleblower of being a top priority.
The leaders hope to maintain party unity by continuing to focus on impeachment investigations while focusing on moderate members who have recently joined the proceedings. The MPs said that the issue in Ukraine is also clearer and easier to explain to the public. They also believe that the investigation led by the Intelligence Committee is smaller and progress will be faster, and may be implemented within the next two months.
Representative Angie Craig of Minnesota, who recently joined the Democratic Party, said earlier this week that she supported the impeachment investigation because Pelosi and Democratic leaders had largely heard from lawmakers at previous sessions.
Craig said that she stands with me and I have always been unwilling to push the investigation from the perspective of just being restricted, I want to see the proper process and I want to make sure we have all the facts and the process will allow us to do that, and she added that she supports a small-scale investigation led by the House Intelligence Committee.
Democratic Representative Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania told USCBC News that he would not vote for the impeachment clause at this time.
Carter: Well, I don't vote now because we haven't seen the whole truth. Well, we have to assume people are innocent, right? If it's true, we have to see if the press is reporting what news, and if there are documents that disclose it.
Democrats will soon hear from voters that they are pushing for impeachment, and members plan to return to their respective constituencies for a two-week hiatus in early October. This is the first time a large group of members from conservative areas have heard their own feedback, sometimes negative, since they called for the impeachment proceedings to begin in Ukraine earlier this week.
But Democratic Representative Dan Kildare of Michigan said it would be a good idea to take a break at this time.
He told reporters: "I really can't think of anything better than to report to the boss before the impeachment proceedings are initiated.
The parliamentary process may be faster, although the MPs have gone back.
Justice Commissioner Jamie Raskin, a supporter of the impeachment investigation, said: "I think everyone is going to finish this work in 2019".
The Maryland Democrat told reporters Thursday night: "We're always in agreement with the White House on the issue of illegal acts and corruption, and our job is to reduce these acts and issues through a series of nationally meaningful impeachment orders.
Anthony Brindisi, a new Democrat from New York who declined to call for an impeachment inquiry, told USCBC that he was suspending his opposition to impeaching Trump.
Brindisi: Well, while I found many of the statements in the whistleblower reports to be disturbing, there is more information. Well, we have to talk to some of these officials who have already listed the reports here and checked the report's direction.
According to the cable news network, more than half of the members of the U.S. House of Representatives have expressed support for the impeachment investigation. However, this includes many Democrats who, while saying they support the impeachment investigation, are still waiting for the results before deciding whether to vote in favor of impeaching Trump. Even if the House can vote to pass the impeachment clause, the Republican-controlled Senate will face a bump in the road, which is one of the many reasons the issue has sparked political divisions within the Democratic Party.
Trump discussed former Vice President Joe Biden in a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25, and about three days later, the number of people supporting the impeachment investigation increased by more than 75 members of the House of Representatives.
Trump officials say lawyers have transferred Ukrainian phone records to security systems
A senior Trump administration official admitted Friday that White House lawyers directed President Trump to transfer the phone records of July with Ukrainian President Zelensky to a highly secure system.
Other than the allegations in the reporting phone, it is not clear what other actions were taken to transfer the records.
The Trump administration declassified the whistleblower complaint and released it to the public Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee, which said White House officials said they had been instructed by White House counsel Mike to delete the call records from the computer system where the phones were usually stored.
The whistleblower claims that the notes are usually kept in confidential systems of varying degrees. The whistleblower also claims that, according to White House officials, it is not the first time that the White House has placed a presidential note in this system to protect politically sensitive information rather than national security sensitive information.
In the days after the call, I learned from several US officials that senior White House officials had intervened and locked all the records in the phone boxes, especially the White House Intelligence Room, which was making the calls as usual.
The White House released a non-classified version of the call on Wednesday. The memo, which is not a literal record of the call, but a collection of related records and memos, shows that Trump sought assistance in investigating the Biden family.
He said: "The other thing is that Biden's son is rumored to have a lot of things going on, and Biden has ended a whole series of lawsuits, and a lot of people want to find out, and if you can do something with the Attorney General, that's best, huh?"
Joe Biden, during his time as vice president, urged Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the bribery scandal involving the Ukrainian natural gas company PBSM, while Biden's youngest son, Hunter, was a director of the company. Biden's allies insisted that he had intervened on corruption issues.
The reporting complainant said that Trump sought foreign assistance in the 2020 campaign. However, the complainant admitted in the complaint that the complaints were based on second-hand information.
The White House lawyers demanded that the order to amend the record be disguised as a cover-up by Democratic high-level officials.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the president's situation in Ukraine this week, calling it a cover-up and saying it would be part of the impeachment investigation.
Meanwhile, Trump lawyer Jay Secco has downplayed the importance of record-keeping details.
Think about it, Secco said on Fox's Friday talk show "Friends and Friends". Shouldn't the White House protect the phone call with the President of Ukraine?
Ukrainian scandal: Pelosi says Baal is unreliable; former US officials support the investigation
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused US Attorney General William Barr of defending the president on Friday in a controversial phone call with President Trump and the Ukrainian leader, which sparked an impeachment investigation.
Before the California Democrat made the above statement, an unnamed intelligence official submitted the indictment to US intelligence agency Superintendent Michael Atkinson on Thursday.
In the July 25 phone call, Bar and Trump's lawyer Rudolf Julian was mentioned several times. The indictment said White House officials were very concerned about this and tried to block the record of the phone calls.
Pelosi told Microsoft National Broadcasting Company on Friday: "Bumbal has become very indifferent. Oh, I think they're trying to cover up the truth. I think it's sad that the Justice Department is so indifferent.
Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry this week after Trump admitted to ceasing military aid to Ukraine. The aid was finally approved, but House Democrats wanted to know if the aid had anything to do with the fact that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the case of Hunter Biden, who worked for the Ukrainian gas company for five years.
On Friday, nearly 300 former U.S. foreign policy and homeland security officials signed a letter in support of the impeachment investigation, which said Trump's actions posed a serious concern for national security.
The letter said: "We congratulate members of Congress, including President Pelosi, for guiding us on this necessary path. President Trump seems to have used the power and resources of the highest office in the country to invite more foreign powers to interfere with our democratic processes. This would constitute an unreasonable abuse of power".
And it would also represent an effort to subordinate the national interests of the United States and the interests of our closest allies and partners to the personal and political interests of the president.
Trump denied any wrongdoing in the call. On Friday, he denounced the complainant and reiterated that his call with Zelensky was a perfect conversation.
He tweeted: "Young people sound more and more like so-called whistleblowers, who are not whistleblowers at all. Besides, all the second-hand information has been proven to be inaccurate, and there may not be anyone else, a leak or a spy, who has provided him or her with it at all.
The whistleblower's complaint suggests that Vice President Pence also interacted with the Ukrainian leader, who met Zelensky earlier this month in Poland.
Chinese rights activists buried in a quarantine station call for a thorough investigation into torture
One Chinese activist was arrested and killed after demanding the removal of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and several activists called for a probe into his true cause of death.
Wang Meiyu, 38, filed a petition in July outside the Hunan Provincial Public Security Hall demanding that Xi Jinping and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang resign and implement a general election system in China.
According to Wang Yue's mother and lawyer, he died on Monday. Wang Yue's wife Cao Yun received a police call, claiming that her husband died in a unit hospital in Yangtze City, while Wang Yue's custody of Wang Yue's remains was located in Yangtze.
According to reports from Chinese human rights organization Liu Min-siang, Liu Xiaoping later saw the remains of Wang, found blood on his mouth, ears, nose and face as well as tinged with blue.
Chinese Human Rights Defenders Network (CHRD) issued a statement saying that the Chinese government must conduct a thorough investigation into the torture and death of human rights activist Wang Mei-yu during his detention and criminal responsibility for the perpetrators of torture and extrajudicial executions.
According to Radio Free Asia, Cao Cao said that the police had asked her to accept Wang Mei-yeon's untimely death, but she refused. A police officer at the Yangtze City Police Department said he could not comment on the case. Wang Mei-yeon's mother told the Guardian that authorities had issued more than 2 million yuan (about $220,000) in compensation to her family.
The Commission has not fully investigated the facts of the case, nor has it prosecuted the criminal liability of the parties, but has only paid compensation, so that it cannot really wash the innocent victims away, nor effectively prevent torture from happening, said Francis Iken, head of research at CHRD.
The family of the victims in particular have been taken hostage and may be forced to stop demanding the truth of the investigation for compensation.
Other Chinese rights activists have also faced similar incidents before Wang Meiyu, such as Zhang Jian, a grassroots lawyer who died in custody in July last year, and the Uyghur scholar Muhammad Salih Aqi, who died last year. In 2017, Nobel Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, who was serving an 11-year sentence in prison, died of cancer after authorities refused to treat him; and in 2014, Cao Cao, a human rights activist who successfully tried to attend a United Nations conference on the human rights situation in China, was detained and died on the way.
According to CHRD, authorities have jailed the remainder of Wang's family since the same week. Wang left behind two young children. Other people involved in the case were also pressured by the authorities. On Wednesday, human rights lawyer Xiang and rights activist Chen Zhenhui were under the control of the special police who fired six Dutch guns.
Wang Meiyu started his rights campaign early in his life after being forced to dismantle; he had previously been detained by the police and claimed to have been tortured.
In 2018, after a sign demanding Xi's resignation, he posted a message on the Internet that police had stormed his home, ordering him to write a letter of remorse and a warrant to stop such activities.
They don't even want to think about how they tortured me for years, even three days and three nights without water, and tortured me for hours with electrical needles, bleeding my mouth, and I won't give up.
Owners of pets who do not feed dogs face fines of A$2,700
If the owner fails to provide basic supplies such as shelter, food and water, they face a huge on-site fine. If the owner locks the dog for 24 hours, the pet must be allowed to freely move for the next two hours or else they will face prosecution.
The region was the first jurisdiction in Australia to recognize animal sensitivity.
The bill was also advocated by Chris Steele, Minister of Urban Services for the Action Party, who is concerned about how animals respond to their environment mentally and physically.
Hong Kong police say student arrests at protests have increased
On Friday, Hong Kong police said that 1,600 people have been detained since June in anti-democracy protests, while 29 percent of students were detained, and over the weekend, they urged young people to take the right steps when planning larger rallies.
Police Public Relations Department Chief Sherezheng said that despite resuming classes after the summer holidays, 207 high school and college students were detained this month alone, compared with 257 detained between June and August.
She said that the number of teenagers involved in violent crimes has increased, and some have been charged in court. These include a 16-year-old who was recently charged with arson, which could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted; a 13-year-old girl accused of desecrating the Chinese flag, and others who attacked police officers and carried dangerous weapons.
In a press conference, Liu said that it was worrying to see these young people breaking the law at such a young age and that there may be criminal records. We call on all young people to reflect on their behavior and hope that the education sector and parents can help our young people regulate their behavior.
Since June, the youth have been protesting the extradition bill, which the government has now agreed to withdraw. But since then, the protest has attracted more participants and has evolved into a larger movement against the Chinese government, which Beijing says is steadily violating Hong Kong's autonomy; Hong Kong was once a British colony, and its sovereignty was returned to China in 1997, when the Chinese government promised to implement Hong Kong's autonomy.
The protesters expanded their demands to include directly electing Hong Kong's leaders and independent investigations into alleged police brutality against protesters.
Thousands of people held peaceful protests in the city centre square on Friday night, accusing police of abusing their powers, waving anti-police slogans and shouting slogans of democracy. Hong Kong government said it would investigate complaints against police by a police watchdog, which critics said lacked real authority and no real investigative authority.
Police approved a large rally held by the Civil Rights Front on Saturday in downtown Hong Kong to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Hu Jinta Movement, which took place in Hong Kong during the Hu Jinta Movement, when protesters occupied the main streets for 79 days demanding universal suffrage.
On Sunday, protesters will also organize rallies in Hong Kong and many cities around the world to protest against the authoritarian dictatorship they condemn in China.
She called on protesters to stop manipulating peaceful protests, as they had done before, such as throwing gasoline bombs, starting a fire in the streets, destroying public facilities.
The Civil Rights Front is also planning another large march on October 1, fearing that the bloody final may embarrass the ruling Chinese Communist Party as it hosts a grand event in Beijing to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Hong Kong government has scaled down the national celebrations, cancelled an annual fireworks show, and changed the reception to an indoor event.
Nestle strengthens coffee bean control after herbicide panic
The world's largest coffee company said in a statement on Friday that it found glycemic residues close to the maximum in some green coffee bean products.
Glycine is a key component of Monsanto's herbicide Nooda. In the United States, a jury has ruled that people who claim their cancer is caused by exposure to glycine can receive a large compensation.
One of the world's largest traders, Newman Coffee Group, said glyphosate was one of the substances it was monitoring in its coffee purchases. Nestlé bought some beans from Newman Coffee Group. It is too early to predict the impact of Nestlé's strict control policies on Newman Coffee Group, a spokesman said.
Nestlé's decision to increase the frequency of inspections has little impact on the global coffee supply chain, a spokesperson said. "This is not a new process, we are just strengthening controls", a spokesperson told the cable news network's commercial channel.
Nestlé will start implementing the new technology from suppliers in the world's largest coffee producers, including Indonesia and Brazil.
Our farmers will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve herbal management practices, including the appropriate use of herbicides and other herbicide methods, said Swiss.
Nestlé's powdered and liquid beverage business is dominated by brands such as Nestlé Coffee and Nestlé Sauce, which accounted for 2.16 billion Swiss francs (approximately $2.17 billion) in sales in 2018.
Is glycemic acid cancer?
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, glycol is used in more than 100 food crops. Scientists from the Organic Food Industry Environmental Protection Organization say that the doses of chemicals in some popular breakfast cereals exceed their prescribed child safety doses.
However, EPA has said that glyphosate is not carcinogenic and does not pose a threat to public health. In an April statement, EPA said that ecological risks include the harm caused by pollinating insects and the problem of weed resistance.
But that didn't stop thousands of people from suing Monsanto, who claimed that contact with Nonda caused them or their loved ones to develop cancer.
Earlier this year, a jury ruled that Baylor paid $2 billion in damages to a couple in California who claimed to have used Noda for more than 30 years on their property and had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for four consecutive years.
A 2015 study by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer found that glycemic acid could cause cancer in humans based on limited evidence of human carcinogenesis and evidence from clinical trials that glycemic acid is a carcinogen in mammals. However, a joint panel of WHO and UNFPA later determined that glycemic acid had a lower risk of carcinogenicity through diet.
A man in Texas has been sentenced to death for killing his ex-wife and six family members
A Utah man facing the death penalty for killing his ex-wife and six family members was convicted in Texas on Thursday.
A Harris County jury found Ronald Hasker, 39, guilty of the July 2014 murder of six members of the Sta family: parents Stephen Sta and Katie Sta, 13-year-old Brian, 9-year-old Emily, 7-year-old Rebecca and 4-year-old Zach.
Harris County District Attorney Kim Og said in a statement: "We thank the jury for their attention to every piece of evidence in the case over the past few weeks. There is no doubt that Haskell carefully planned and executed the actions to kill the entire Sta family".
Police say Haskell was traveling from California to Spring, a suburb of Houston, to ambush his ex-wife's sister, husband and five children at home.
The couple and their four children were shot in the back of the head, and the fifth child, aged 15, survived the ordeal.
Prosecutors demanded the death penalty for his murder, but the jury will decide whether Haskell should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.
KPRC, the Houston-based agency of National Broadcasting Corporation, reported that during the interrogation, the defense argued that Haskell was mentally unstable and heard voices leading to his killing of the six people.
According to the TV station, one of Haskell's defense lawyers, Doug Durham, said: "I think he could be punished as much as everyone expected.
The sentencing process began on Monday. Haskell's defense attorney, Neil Davis III, said his team will work to save him once and for all.
According to the TV station, the sentencing process is expected to last about two and a half weeks.
Cassidy testified in court, and her family was present. According to KPRC, she appeared to be in prayer before her conviction was announced on Thursday.
At a memorial service for her family in 2014, Cassidy thanked the community for their support and said that her parents, two brothers and two sisters, who are in heaven, would be happy to see them again one day.
Haskell disguised himself as a Federal Express courier driver when he went to Stacy's house, apparently to find his ex-wife, Katie Stacy's sister.
Police said he forced his way in and tied Cassidy up. Minutes later, when her family returned, Haskell tied them up and asked to report the fall of her ex-wife.
Cassidy was left dead after being wounded and was able to identify him to the police. She told the police that he was planning to drive to her grandparents' home to kill them. But the police tracked down Haskell and after 20 minutes of police chase and three hours of confrontation, he was arrested.
Scotland bans smog products and e-cigarette advertising given the US mortality rate
Ministers are considering banning e-cigarettes and smoking products.
The Chief Minister has confirmed that the initiative will be discussed in the coming months.
The government of the country has said that it will act without hesitation if there is evidence to support further action against the sale of such products.
Meanwhile, reports have said that two more deaths were attributed to diseases related to smoking products, with 11 deaths.
Smoking products (a mixture of nicotine, water, solvents and spices) are considered to be an alternative to smoking to help quit smoking, but their safety has not been fully established.
But in the United States, more than 500 people have a mysterious lung disease caused by smoking e-cigarettes. Officials say hundreds of new cases have been reported in the past week alone.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, Florida and Georgia announced the first cases of the disease. Currently, 38 states have reported cases of the disease, including eight states with deaths.
While most patients reported using products containing four tonnes of cannabis (a psychoactive compound in cannabis), the deaths in Georgia on Wednesday were reported as a result of heavy smoking of smoking products.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more than 100 officials investigating the cause of the mysterious disease and warning citizens not to smoke e-cigarette products, especially those that have been renovated or purchased by street vendors, until they have more information.
The Chief Minister confirmed that the Scottish Government is closely monitoring developments in the United States and elsewhere following the emergence of deaths caused by smogged products.
She pointed out that so far, they have not seen any reported cases of deaths from smoking products in Europe.
She said: "We are careful, so in Scotland we have adopted the most stringent regulation of smog products in Europe.
The European Tobacco Products Directive restricts the advertising of e-cigarettes and ensures that e-liquids do not contain known harmful ingredients.
The directive also limits nicotine concentration in e-cigarettes.
In Scotland, we have also launched a retail registration and mandatory age verification scheme and funded trade standards departments in all parliamentary areas to ensure retailers comply.
In the coming months, we will consult on the full prohibition of smog advertising and promotion.
She added: "It is important to emphasize that we all remember that these devices are relatively new products and that we should continue to study their effects.
This is probably one of the reasons why e-cigarettes are not yet popular in Scotland.
We continue to take all necessary steps to ensure that we do not cause potential harm to people based on the best evidence.
While we have implemented the strictest management system for these products, we will take action without hesitation if there is evidence that further action is needed...
Cambodian court accuses political exile of rebellion
A Cambodian court has charged seven senior opposition leaders with plotting an armed rebellion that aims to end self-exile and seek regime change through mass peaceful protests.
The Kimping City Court also warned that anyone who supports the Cambodian opposition party overthrowing government plans could face long prison terms.
If convicted, opposition leaders ending their exile could be sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison, and their supporters could be sentenced to 5 to 10 years in prison. Citing Justice Department spokeswoman Pam Maline: Even attending rallies or expressing support online could be considered a conspiracy to overthrow the government.
The political struggle has been escalating since opposition leader Sanlansi announced plans to end more than three years of exile on November 9 to return to his homeland in a bid to restore democracy, and the court on Thursday accused it of launching the latest round of the political struggle.
November 9 is Cambodia's Independence Day, which was declared in 1953 after Cambodia broke away from French colonial rule.
Earlier this week, Sanlansi tweeted: "I will continue to call on the Cambodian people and armed forces to oppose the Hun Sen regime until the Hun Sen regime restores the right of the opposition to participate in the political life of the country, including real elections".
Last year, a pre-election court dissolved the opposition party in Sanlansi to ensure that Hun Sen's dictatorship continued for 40 years.
The opposition party had been keen to launch a powerful election challenge in July 2018, which was widely seen as politically motivated, with the ruling Cambodian People's Party, led by Hun Sen, fearing losing its lead in the election.
The Hun Sen government seems to be upset by the planned return of the opposition leader, although this seems impractical, and Sanlansi has called for the return of large numbers of Cambodian workers in Thailand and with him.
Officials vowed to arrest him as soon as he arrived in Cambodia, but there was speculation that Cambodia might simply prevent him from entering, and that if airlines were formally informed of the ban, he might be banned from boarding planes to Cambodia. Neighbouring countries are also unlikely to allow him to enter Cambodia from their territory.
However, the government has stepped up the arrests of supporters of Sanlansi, with reports that opposition organisers have recently been attacked in person.
In late 2015, Sanlansi was sentenced to two years in prison for criminal defamation and was exiled abroad to avoid prison.
In late 2017, in the midst of a crackdown on all opposition groups against the Hun Sen regime, opposition co-founder Gensoka was arrested and other senior members of the party went into exile abroad. Gensoka is currently in strict custody on charges of treason for establishing ties with a pro-democracy organization in the United States.
This year's Turner Prize nominations will be shown at the Magnet from tomorrow, and the UK's Brexit agenda will be put forward.
The work of Colombian artist Oscar Murillo depicts a scene of the North Sea, but the views of the North Sea and the European continent across the river are covered by a black canvas, which reveals only a small part of the distance through a slope on the canvas.
The work is one of four nominations, and is an annual art prize established in 1984 to honour artists born in the UK or UK but living elsewhere.
Curator Fiore Napari explains that Murillo's work focuses on the current political and socio-economic situation in Britain. The group of paper dolls represents a globalized workforce, while the black hood represents the dark times of the British and even the contemporary world.
She added: "I think it's a broader sense of obscuring the view, which actually means obscuring any distance view. There's also a posture of obscuring the light. But I think there's still a line of hope, a slope on the canvas, and you can see the ocean on the horizon.
Meanwhile, Helen Cammock's video work, which features a long-note chord, explores the neglected role of women in the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland's Dreyfuss/London Dreyfuss that began in 1968.
All works will be on display at the Turner Contemporary Gallery in Margate from 28 September to 12 January 2020, and the winners of the 2019 Turner Prize will be announced at the awards ceremony on 3 December.
The award is named after the 19th-century British landscape painter Joseph Malod William Turner, who dedicated his life to Grayson Perry, Damien Hirst and his twelve years as a slave to director Steve McQueen.
Men confess to kidnapping and torture of plastic surgeons
A Florida man admitted to abducting a plastic surgeon and using a flashlight to blackmail and abuse her.
According to the Sun Sentinel, Justin Boscio, 34, confessed Thursday to the details of the kidnapping and conspiracy of the surgeon who was attacked in January, whose identity has not yet been made public.
Bocio's lawyer, Kenneth Langer, said his client was involved in the kidnapping under the guise of fellow defendant Serge Corina, who will be extradited from the Spanish island of Tenerife.
According to court documents, the surgeon was abducted and pushed into a van by a man with a gun while leaving the Walmart store. After several hours of torture, he went back to his car and fell into a coma. The procedure was captured on video. Investigators said Corinna's wife was a client of the surgeon.
UK Parliament refuses early elections for the second time
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is again frustrated with pushing for early UK elections.
The Speaker of the House of Commons said that it was not possible to vote before 31 October (the planned date for the UK to leave the EU).
This is the second meeting of the Parliament since the Supreme Court's ruling that the general election was unlawful.
Meanwhile, the EU's chief negotiator, Michael Baner, said the EU was still waiting for new plans from the UK.
US forces to Saudi Arabia and deployment of air defense systems to stop Iranian attacks
US officials announced Thursday that the United States is sending a patriotic missile force, four ground-based radar systems and 200 support troops to Saudi Arabia to curb Iran's increasingly aggressive actions.
The Pentagon said a SDF missile defense system and two other Patriot missile forces were ready if needed.
Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said: "Other countries in the region have called for attention to the Iranian situation and we want them to contribute to international cooperation to strengthen Saudi defence forces".
Last week, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that more troops would be deployed to the Middle East as a defensive measure to help defend against attacks from Iran.
Espar said the deployment was the first step towards addressing Iran's increasingly violent actions in the region, including the drone strikes on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities this month, and he called on other countries to step up their actions and condemned the attacks.
Iran-backed Yemeni Houthi rebels claim responsibility for the September 14 attacks on the world's largest oil refinery and an important oil field, but the United States and Saudi Arabia directly condemn Iran.
The weapons used were Iranian-made, not launched from Yemen, Mr. Espar said on Friday, pointing out that all signs suggested that Iran was responsible for the attack.
The purpose of deploying troops and resources is to send out clear messages that the United States supports our partners and provide free flow of resources, Esparta said.
The Secretary of State said the United States called on other countries to stand up and condemn the attacks and contribute their strength.
Megan McCallum was never invited back to the Bar in Gold
Alan Corbett, the founder of the Golden Globe-winning law firm, said his mother had never invited Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, to return to the show, and that she was to play Rachel Zann in the final.
After the grand finale of the Golden Lawyer Show aired in the United States, Cortez was asked in an interview with the Hollywood News Frontline whether it was possible for the former resident actor to be invited to the grand finale.
"I'm not going to tell you what happened to the film, but I'm going to tell you what happened to the film".
I thought about inviting her, and I thought about using audio material (and we had to think of a way to do that), but I didn't say anything because I thought I wanted to respect her new life and not put her in the position where she had to be invited.
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
In the grand finale of the Golden Lawyer's Cabinet, the Duchess of Sussex appears in the Montague picture.
Megan played Rachel Zann in the New York-based legal drama from 2011 until her final episode aired last year.
In the final season of the show, Rachel's husband Mike Ross (Patrick Johns Adams) visits her from Seattle and asks how she is doing.
"Oh, you wouldn't believe me if I told you how good she was", he replied.
Bit Bulls killed a Florida boy by a snake to protect him
A man in Florida says that his eight-month-old house bull, Zeus, was bitten to death by a snake to protect his sons.
Gary Richardson told WOFL TV that his home in Sumter County, Florida, was where his sons were cleaning Zeus's water table outside on Monday when a venomous coral snake came crawling at them. Richardson said the children had not seen the snake at the time, but the dogs saw it and attacked the snake.
According to Richardson, the snake bit Zeus four times. Although Zeus was rushed to the vet, he died the next day after the attack.
Significant cases of Nile virus reported in Germany
The first human case of the Nile virus transmitted by mosquitoes in Germany was reported by authorities, and climate change has evidently accelerated the spread of the virus.
The German National Center for Disease Control and Tropical Medicine said on Friday that the patient had suffered a concussion but had recovered after being treated in hospital.
The Nile virus originated in Africa, but has spread northward through birds and mosquitoes. In recent years, there have been several outbreaks in southern and central Europe.
Jonas Schmidt Chanasett of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Bernhard-Nochter, Germany, said that the unusually hot summer months of the past two years have clearly accelerated the spread of the virus in the northern Alps due to climate change.
Less than 1% of those infected with the virus will develop dangerous meningitis or meningitis.
Radiation skipping after prostate cancer surgery is effective
A major study found that men who underwent prostate cancer surgery were in good shape without radiation therapy.
The screening of patients receiving surgical treatment is the largest experiment to date, and the results could save thousands of patients from the painful treatment that can lead to painful side effects.
The Royal Masden Hospital conducted a study of 1,400 men receiving treatment for prostate cancer.
Half of the patients received immediate radiation therapy, which is the standard treatment method to prevent disease recurrence to date. The rest were monitored and only given radiation therapy when signs of disease recurrence were present.
Five years later, scientists found that the disease recurrence rates in the two groups were almost identical, with patients who had not received radiation therapy being slightly better off.
The survival rate of the radiation therapy group without progression was 85% and the standard care group was 88%.
The data was adjusted for other factors, with the difference between the two groups being about 1%.
The study, funded by the UK's Centre for Cancer Research, found that patients receiving radiation therapy were twice as likely to experience worsening of urinary incontinence as patients who did not receive radiation therapy, and urinary incontinence is one of the main side effects of prostate cancer treatment.
In the year following the operation, 5.3% of patients receiving radiation therapy had worsened their condition, compared to only 2.7% of patients receiving standard care.
The radio claimed that the host of the WWL radio program in Louisiana, Seuss Dunlap, threatened to sue for anti-gay tweets, but the tweets were actually sent by him, and were similar to the case of Josie Smollett.
A New Orleans radio host said he received an anti-gay libel tweet from the station's Twitter account. WWL host Seuss Danrap, an openly gay man, said on Wednesday he intended to sue the station's parent company for working in a hostile environment that has been anti-gay for years. A strange twist occurred on Thursday, with the New Orleans Police Department saying that Danrap's intimidation was not from another source but was actually from Danrap's cell phone.
The controversial tweet was released earlier this month, the same day that Danlap hosted his own show as usual. According to WWL-TV, a subsidiary of Columbia Broadcasting Company, the tweet was released the following day and he announced his vacation.
In a statement, Danlap said that 14 people had access to the WWL Twitter account. He claimed he was not the only one using the account.
His lawyer, Megan Kiefer, said he decided to participate in the lie detection, thus dispelling speculation that he was the promoter. According to WWL-TV, Dunlap has not filed a lawsuit, but he said in a statement that it would be started soon.
WWL Radio is a subsidiary of Columbia Broadcasting Corporation, but is owned by Penguin Broadcasting, which said in a statement that it had opened an investigation into the tweet and decided to hand it over to law enforcement. WWL Radio said in a statement that WWL had completed an investigation into the highly rude, unauthorized tweet issued by its Twitter account on September 10 that directly targeted Seuss Della in a terrorist or libel attack.
The next step is to hand over the investigation to law enforcement. The investigation is being conducted by law enforcement and we are not prepared to comment on the specific circumstances of the investigation, according to the WWL.
The New Orleans Police Department opened their investigation into the tweet, which was turned upside down in a police report on Thursday: The threat and libel tweet was allegedly sent from Danrap's private cell phone.
Radio host Seuss Dunlap has said he has worked in a hostile and intimidating environment for years. He threatened to sue after allegedly receiving anti-homophobia tweets from his radio Twitter account.
According to NOLA.com, WWL accused Dunlap of threatening the station for money alone. According to WWL, the 35-year-old radio host said he would investigate a tweet and then claim more than $1.8 million in damages. According to a police report obtained by NOLA.com, WWL noted that Dunlap was facing personal financial problems when he threatened to sue.
The allegations were made by Kevin Cassidy, senior vice president of WWL, and the attorney who was the company's parent company. The police department is still trying to confirm the allegations, but has listed the case as potentially blackmailing. Louisiana defines blackmail as "the act of cheating on others in order to obtain anything of value".
Viola Davis as Michelle Obama in the role of First Lady
Viola Davis says her nervousness was fueled by her role as Michelle Obama in the latest television series.
The 54-year-old actress spoke on Thursday's Jimmy Jam Show about her role as Michelle Obama in the TV series The First Lady of the Moon!
Davis said she had met Michelle Obama but was not sure if the former first lady knew she was playing the role.
I was nervous. I was very nervous, and Dave said, "I don't care what else my pants have done - I've won an Emmy, an Oscar, two Tony Awards - but if I messed up this time, the impact on me would be huge".
She joked: "Mother is like mother you raised a really great kid, but you messed up Michelle Obama".
However, Davis said she was confident in the script by screenwriter Aaron Curry.
I promise you, this is a great play, and I don't want my people to go crazy.
In the first season of The First Lady's Show, we will explore the political and personal lives of the first ladies in American history. The first season focuses on Eleanor Roosevelt, Betty Ford and Michelle Obama.
In addition to the First Lady, Davis will also reunite with Dancer Washington in the black-and-white dance sequences of the Renée Tower, adapted for the screen, in which Dancer Washington co-stars in the title role.
I had to wear a fat suit, and Dave told host Jimmy Cummore, "Oh, I like this suit. I told them I wanted a very, very big [curse] suit. I wanted to look more mature".
Davis played Anna Lise Keating in the ABC series The Far Side, which premiered on Thursday for its sixth and final season.
McMiller's death: third man charged with drug trafficking
A third man has been arrested and charged with drug trafficking, in connection with rapper Mac Miller's death from a drug overdose.
Steven Walter, who was suspected of selling fake fentanyl-containing cyanide pills, died last year from an accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and powerful opioids, and was in possession of fentanyl before his death.
Walter is accused of being the source of the drugs for another man, Cameron Petit, who sold the drugs to Miller.
Ryan Revis, 36, was arrested this week in Lake Havasu, Arizona, and charged with drug-delivering Walter's running leg.
Walter was released from custody in 2005 for a drug case and is currently in detention.
Miller, who is from Pittsburgh and whose real name is Malcolm James Miles McCormick, talks frankly about his depression and drug addiction in the lyrics, which have won him some of the biggest fans on the hip-hop scene.
He ended his two-year relationship with Elena Grande in early 2018. Following Miller's death, Elena posted a video of his love for her on her photo wall and released a song Thank You, Next Mum, which was a song that was deeply in love with Miller.
In recent years, some musicians have died from opioid abuse and overdose, Miller being one of them.
Prince died in 2016 after taking a fake drug containing fentanyl, which looked like a replica of Vicodin's painkiller.
In 2016, the three-piece band's guitarist Matthew Roberts also died of a drug overdose, which contained fentanyl and cocaine.
Women are not hanging on Walmart's license plate
In a Wal-Mart store in Mexico City, a woman accused of stealing a store took extreme measures to prove herself innocent, standing in the store with her hands untied, causing the store's security guard to shut up.
Earlier this week, the company's Tepe Acquavarma office in Mexico City captured a picture of a supermarket security guard approaching the woman who was allegedly stealing while she was approaching the exit. However, when she was stopped, her reaction left the security silent.
The woman first took off her collar and then started to walk out, but she may have felt guilty, and soon turned around to take off her shirt.
The naked shopper's identity remains unknown, but it appears that after improvising on the strip show, the shopkeeper allowed her to leave the store.
Walmart has been aware of this strange phenomenon. In July, a surveillance camera at Walmart in Westmeath Town captured a woman in Pennsylvania unpacking a box of potatoes. The woman in the video was apparently drunk, accused of public indecency, drunkenness in public, misappropriation of property and disorderly conduct, and quickly went red.
This week, another British man, Steve Whitehurst, was forced to stand naked in a supermarket after he was found to have an unknown swelling of his neck, and was forced to expose himself to security.
I was born this way and I can't", Whitehurst told the Sun.

The minister also released two books during the event: The Amid Vidya Saṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅgaṅga
Some of the items used by Vidya Sagar will be removed from the dusty storage room and put in the museum for public viewing.
He said that this would help contemporaries to understand the famous man who waged a war against the oppression of women and encouraged widows to remarry.
Mr. Chatji said that the Ministry of School Education and Higher Education will organize a workshop during the year-long event, focusing on Vidya Saga's life and work in schools and colleges.
Listing other activities that the institute will be carrying out, Mr. Chatji said that a collection of Vidyasagar's works, which is not known to date, will be published.
Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee recently announced that Vidya Saagar will be built in the village of Bilsinhapur, where he was born, as an educational tourism center.
On Thursday, Vidya Saga College erected a bronze statue of Vidya Saga.
The minister said that the people who opposed Vidya Saga's social reforms had destroyed his half-spoon, which stands in the college that bears his name.
In May, during a road trip by the BJP chairman Amit Shah, the social reformer's semi-image was destroyed.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a report on 26 March stating that Iran has started using advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of uranium enrichment, further violating the 2015 nuclear agreement with the world powers.
The IAEA reports that advanced centrifugal pumps at Iran's Natanz Nuclear Facility are accumulating or are ready to accumulate uranium enriched uranium.
Since US President Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal last May and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran has been gradually violating the limits of the 2015 nuclear deal with the superpower.
The agreement stipulates that Iran can only use the first-generation IR-1 centrifuge to refine the aluminum.
Other signatories to the agreement, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have tried to save the agreement, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
Japanese Foreign Minister Maumimi Min-fu held a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov on a visit to the United States of America on the afternoon of 25 July, according to the Japanese Joint Agency, confirming that peace treaty negotiations including territorial issues including the four northern islands (Japan disputed islands, Japan named the Northern Four islands, and the Russian named the Nanjing Islands named the Northern Four islands) would be continued, and that the two countries would develop relations in broad fields such as politics and economics, and that the two sides would coordinate their visit to Russia as soon as possible.

Women's squad hopes to win the World Cup early!
On 27th, in a match against the Netherlands women's team, the Chinese team was defeated by their opponent in a two-game win, and ended up with a 3-1 victory over the Netherlands.
The World Cup is coming to an end, and while the defending champions are in sight, the Chinese women's team is still not going to lose sight of Serbia.
The Chinese women's team had a strong showing in the first two rounds of the tournament against the Netherlands, where they were beaten by the Netherlands in the first two rounds with a 25:19, 25:16 lead, and the team was frustrated until the third round.
The Dutch women's team were further behind, the Chinese team was hit, and the girls were aggressive, and mistakes began to increase, eventually being knocked out by their opponents at 21:25.
In an interview, the player also noted: "Ooh, the third game, because of the mistake we sent about 8 points.
Of course, the Dutch women's team had not been too hard on their hands, and they had made difficult preparations before the Chinese women's tournament, although they lost one innings, but everything was still in the hands of Luo Ping, and it was normal for Liu and the strong team to lose and win, and it was normal for them to play five innings, so we told the team to focus, Liu Luo Ping said.
In the fourth innings, the team members actively adjusted the situation, Zhang Zhenning was attacking with full firepower, single innings scored 8 points, giving the team a great victory.
The 11 rounds of the match are now two rounds away, and the Chinese women's team, although one hand has already touched the trophy, did sound the alarm in the match against the Netherlands: the more crucial the moment, the more they will go.
In another match on 27th, the Russian and American women's teams played five innings, and the US team failed to score three points from their opponents, so the Chinese women's team could only score three points in the match against Serbia to secure a round of defence.
The situation is changing in favour of Chinese women.
However, while the Serbian team is missing the sixth place, this does not mean that they will easily pass the third to the Chinese team.
In terms of the current score, Serbia are virtually medal-free, which means they can easily put on a stand against a Chinese women's team, putting down a pack to hit their opponents with all their energy, while the Chinese team is under pressure to win the title, and the situation may turn upside down instead.
In addition, the substitute Serbian team was not the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the lamb that was to be the sheep that was to be the sheep that was to be the sheep that was to be the sheep that was to be the sheep that was to be the sheep that was to be the sheep that was to be the sheep that was to be the sheep that was to be the sheep that was to be the sheep that was to be the sheep.
Before the third stage, Luoping also said that both teams were not good against: "Oh, Osaka will be very difficult, but we have to be prepared as always, seriously".
The current crown has been rung and the race has really entered the phase of the white-hot.
The Chinese women's team is the last straw about the strength squad, but it is also important to see if the girls can play at a normal level and release themselves as much as possible on the field.
The University of Macau is hosting the second Macau Stem Cell Seminar in Macau today, which attracts hundreds of experts from countries and regions such as the United States, Singapore, mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to engage in the field of "extra-canine stem cell research" to share and explore the latest technologies and developments in stem cell research with Macau University faculty.

In a speech at the US Military Academy at West Point, Stoltenberg said: "For 70 years, NATO's containment and defense measures have been based on maintaining technical advantage.
He said, "But the times they are a-changin'".
Stoltberg said: "The competition we face is getting fiercer.
So we should work harder now to make sure that no one is better than us.
He said: "Some of the new technologies were developed not by NATO members but by authoritarian states.
Chinese companies are studying 5G networks.
Russia is developing an independent Internet and investing heavily in the development of the next generation of weapons, such as supersonic missiles.
Stoltenberg said NATO's future security pipeline depends on its ability to understand, accept and apply the latest advanced technologies.
On September 24, Liu took me to see the Liang Love Aid event in Yangtze, where over 100 people with disabilities from Yangtze were invited to board the Star Cruise of Yangtze, to admire the lush winds of the Yangtze River and to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
The more than 100 disabled people who took part in the event were mostly on the first boat.
The 56-year-old is a crippled man who rarely goes out of his house due to his legs.
He said: "Today, for the first time, I was on a cruise ship, and I was near to see the tides of Zhejiang, and I felt the pulse of development of the sand, and I was so excited and I couldn't forget it".
Volunteers from the Foxconn Social Workers Service Center and Blue Sky Rescue Team in Yangsha provided minute services to people with disabilities.
Volunteers will take them on the next cruise, especially for those with serious disabilities.
The head of the Foxconn Social Work Services Center said that in the past 70 years, with the support of the party and the government, the development of the disability profession in Changsha has continued, and that more and more people with disabilities are becoming truly participants, contributors and beneficiaries of socio-economic development, and that concern for helping people with disabilities and supporting disability activities has become a common social consensus.
The 70th anniversary of the Republic is coming, the street media flashes the spotlight, so many images that we don't remember much about, flashing, flashing, and they are the ones who, for our shining days, are the silk that brings the heat energy, the light source...
However, if the hero walks around, he seems as ordinary as you are.
The Chinese were the first to be able to make a living in the world, and they were able to cultivate a good variety of crops, so that tens of millions of people could not go hungry and live in the country, and they were like old farmers who liked to live in the fields; the Chinese were the chief scientists who were trying to make China angry, and they were the only people who could do one thing in their life, and they were the only people who could do it.
They, seeking kindness, live plainly, simply and persistently, and it is easy to get up and running as long as they are immersed in foreign ignorance and their own precious business, without regard for their reputation, wealth and honor.
Like in the Golden Age of the novel, the temple is hidden by the monk who, despite his astonishing martial arts skills, is not tired, happy or sad.
Every monk in the village of Sawai, every red kid, has a country to live in.
The responsibility of the home is not only to hang on the shoulders of heroes but also to hold the hearts of millions of people.
Once upon a time, a high school girl was a word that was flipped around by netizens, and when a hero passed by, there was always someone sitting on the side of the road cheering... I didn't want to be a hero, I wanted to be the one sitting on the side of the road cheering.
In fact, when heroes and heroes applaud, there is no contradiction.
Those who are greeted by the street also pass on heat and light, and they themselves are a beacon of light.
Ordinary people like you and me, there are always some moments in life, some moments, some sunsets that are shaping up to be heroes.
The great judge of Shanghai, Liu Hua, who is in charge of judicial reform, but at the annual meeting, the media room teacher Liu Liu gets to tell his story, receives countless newspaper letters a year, from the faultless Liu, the simple thing to do is not simple.
It's a battle between heroes, one hero applauding another hero.

For example, the Chinese sky-eyed catcher, now it seems, is a myth.
In the 1990s, the Chinese tech community was still in a difficult climb, and novelist Liu Xiaoping had not yet started writing the novel.
The largest telescope of its time, the single-beam radiation telescope in the valley of the island of Puerto Rico, is the largest in the world. The telescope, 350 meters in diameter, is considered the world's largest.
The Chinese radiation telescope at the time was less than a tenth of a person's diameter.
While Nan Ren-dong, who enjoys world-class scientific conditions and salary in Japan, insisted on returning home with an almost crazy idea: build a new generation of radiation-rich telescopes in China to receive more messages from outer space!
China is a big star, so we're going to invest in the stars.
The country trusted Nanking and the project of the Tears of Heaven started in a moment of turmoil.
The project took 12 years to complete and 9 years to complete.
The 500-meter-tall pyramid is a landmark scientific project in China, unprecedented in the world.
So, the sky was full of tears, and the southern Indians were terrified, and the Republic was not able to stand tall and promising.
With the trust of the country, the goodwill of the people, the Nanking East has the chance to become the heart and soul of the people of the country.
There are young geniuses, white-haired heroes who walk by, and people who cheer lightly on the street, and a country like this is beautiful and harmonious.
The first Jirin kindergartens to teach garbage classification
On 27th, a kindergarten in Jilin, Jilin Province, held a class on garbage classification, teaching children to distinguish between recyclable garbage and other types of garbage.
It is reported that this is the first time that the garbage classification has been introduced into the local kindergarten classroom.
Nine departments of Jilin province have jointly launched a work programme to promote the classification of municipal living waste in the province of Jilin.
Based on the 2019 pilot for compulsory sorting of living waste in Changchun, the province decided to carry out the sorting of living waste in the local cities.
The city of Jilin is one of them.
We hope that through this event, we will achieve the impact of families with young children, and the society with kindergarten, and we will promote the concept of environmental protection.
The executive director of the International Kindergarten of Phnom Penh, Li Liang, said the event was organized by the Chinese government.
The day the gardener read a book on environmental protection, hoping to start sorting garbage from children.
The children were organized into a garbage sorting game after performing a low-carbon baby dance.
The instructor also released recyclable garbage cans and other garbage cans labels, advising children to stick the labels to the trash can and record small videos when they get home.
The children's daycare centre has been advocating for low-carbon, green environmental protection and regularly hosts environmental lectures.
The garbage disposal in the park also has a sorting bin, which is marked as a category of disposal.
Teachers teach kids about recycling garbage
According to preliminary statistics, the city of Jilin produced about 546.52 million tons of municipal waste in 2018, all of which went to landfills for treatment.
Of these, 329.29 million tonnes were filled, 209.23 million tonnes were incinerated and 801 million tonnes were processed using integrated techniques.
After years of efforts, the provincial municipalities and counties have the capacity to treat life-saving waste.
The Jinjiang Province's proposed urban urban waste classification work programme, which has already been launched, specifically calls for in-depth activities to classify waste into campuses, into teaching materials, into classrooms, and to enhance interaction between students and parents by creating songs, songs, comics, and micro-video, to help raise a child, influence a family, drive a community, and cultivate a new generation of entrepreneurs.

The political legacy of the late President survives
On 26 July, French President Nicolas Sarkozy died at the age of 86.
In a world in a century of unprecedented change, the political legacy of the French politician during his reign is still commendable.
He was the president of France for 12 years in a very personal manner.
He was a strong supporter of European integration and a leading figure in the pursuit of the European dream.
He was also a strong advocate of world polarization and multilateralism, and a politician with a strategic view.
As a result, the French media has acclaimed him as the outstanding representative of France on the world stage.
One of the political decisions that made him angry was against the US-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France took the lead in the anti-war struggle against German pressure.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the Iraq war would lead to increased terrorism and make the world more dangerous.
The warning of the prophet was correct.
In the wake of the unilateralism of the United States, which is becoming increasingly prominent in the context of European integration, and which has been a long time coming, Mr. Hirac's strategic thinking and decisions on international politics and global affairs have undoubtedly been very revealing.
She was also a French politician who made the Chinese feel familiar and friendly.
He was one of the advocates and creators of the Golden Decade of Sino-French relations, and after first being elected President of France in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of Sino-French relations with a strategic view of politicians.
In 2004, China-France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and China-France bilateral relations entered a new phase.
During the reign of President Hiraq, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly and the two countries made breakthrough progress in cooperation in a number of areas, including aviation, nuclear energy, rail transportation and more.
The Chinese-French Cultural Year, initiated by Hirac, created a whole new model of cultural exchange in French history.
The love of the Chinese culture during his lifetime is particularly impressive.
According to his Chinese diplomats, he was able to write some poems about the history of the Chinese bronzeware, including the poetry of Li Wei, and even the precise dates of the bronzeware.
The pyramids are not really in Egypt, the pyramids are not in China, the golden phrase "the pyramids are not in Egypt" comes from the Greek word for "the pyramids".
In an interview with Xinhua, he said: "The West is concerned about China's political and social development, the ecological problems caused by China's economic growth and China's political position internationally".
But I am confident in China.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is enough to help it establish the ideals and values of achieving harmonious development and take its own long-term responsibility on the world stage.
I also believe that the Chinese revival will bring new creative energy to world culture and enrich world culture.
The Sikhs are gone, but the political legacy and revelation that Sirach left to the world will live on forever.
The 7th Chinese Computer Society's Big Data Academic Conference on the topic of the Silicon Valley, Intelligent Future of the Sun, was unveiled in Wuhan on June 27, with nearly 1,000 experts and industry leaders in the field of big data research focusing on the topic of big data hotspots research and interpreting big data's technological processes in the era of artificial intelligence.

Hong Kong Special District Legislature members unite against US-led Port Act
The Hong Kong Special District Legislature, which is part of the Hong Kong Special District, issued a Joint Statement on 27 April, expressing strong opposition to the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 by the House of Representatives of the United States.
The statement, which was joined by 40 MPs, said Hong Kong's rights under the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, including the status of a free trade port and separate customs zone, in various fields such as economics, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, sports, to promote Hong Kong's reputation as a global trading, cooperation and development hub, and to sign and implement bilateral and multilateral agreements.
These rights are not conferred by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always been strictly adhering to international agreements, international rules, legal and business ethics, and has been involved in cooperation with various countries and regions in many relevant fields.
The statement said that the move by the House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs to pass the relevant bill was not necessary, but merely to respond to the call of its whaling port agents, as a means of grossly interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs and seeking political gain for its agents in Hong Kong.
The House of Representatives expressed deep regret and strong opposition to the move.
The statement noted that Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the largest source of trade surpluses.
Hong Kong's excellent rule of law, fair and free business environment, and clean society make it a good destination for American businessmen and businessmen.
The US would not only attack Hong Kong and its own interests, but also make China-US relations worse, with no benefit or harm to the US.
The statement said Hong Kong will continue to exercise its rights under the Basic Law and to fulfil its obligations as it has done in the implementation of the two-pronged approach of One Nation without any qualms.
Hong Kong will continue to make its contribution to the international community and international trade, past, present and future.
According to the European Times, the French parliament will discuss immigration reforms next week.
French President Macron recently said that France cannot accept all people's vaccines, but that it must also work to properly accept vaccines.
Macron is reportedly trying to find a middle ground on immigration issues to slow down the upcoming debate shock.
In an interview recently in New York, Macron said he hoped for a real two-tiered approach to immigration policy that would strike a balance between humanitarian and efficiency.
Macron said: "If France wants to be able to properly accept immigrants, it cannot accept everyone".
Macron outlined four priorities for immigration policy: granting asylum to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; more effectively promoting immigration integration; welcoming and protecting all immigrants entering French territory; and more effectively resettling those who entered France illegally without a stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the AME system is the most discussed topic in the world.
Macron said he hoped to be able to assess the system, but did not cancel it, but instead imposed certain restrictions on it.
Following Macron's remarks, Le Pen, leader of the far-right Nationalist Alliance for Democracy, tweeted that Macron's comments were empty-handed.
Right-wing Republican Senator Rachel also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a calm, calm but faced with reality-based criticism of Macron.
The left-wing Socialist Party MP, Rao, believes that France should accept more and better the issue of immigration, and criticizes Macron's manipulation of the issue.
The new version of the asylum and immigration law has been in force for a year, and it has led to internal disagreements within the ruling party, but has not appeased the right-wing opposition.
In the next 2022 general election, the issue of immigration policy will once again be the focus of the far right, and Macron needs to do something about it, but he also risks anger from the left within the ruling party.
The French National Assembly is reported to be debating immigration policy from September 30 in the lower house, while the Senate will be debating it from October 2.
There are signs that Chinese A shares are entering a buyout trend, with many publicly traded companies issuing their shares in the realm of gold and silver.
According to financial data service provider Eastern Wealth, the total amount of A-listed companies' repurchases implemented as of 27 January 2019 has exceeded 100 billion yuan (Rw, below), far exceeding the same-year data, creating a new record high in the amount of A-listed stock repurchases.
In this regard, Chairman of Shanghai MyKirong Information Consulting Limited, Xu Yang said that the overall valuation of the A-share market this year, with relatively low prices, is conducive to the efficiency of using the funds of the listed companies, and reflects the willingness of the listed companies to actively manage the market value and the abundant cash flow, which is conducive to boosting investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the share buyback system has also encouraged the active share buyback of publicly traded companies.
For example, earlier this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued rules for the implementation of share repurchases of listed companies, providing detailed share repurchasing rules and guidance for listed companies.
According to media statistics, the companies that have implemented the increase in buy-back plans since this year are mainly concentrated in the infrastructure, real estate, information technology and electronics manufacturing industries.
In addition, in terms of the amount of repurchase payments, six publicly traded companies have repurchased over 1 billion yuan this year.
The first of these was Eli's shares, which were bought back for more than $5 billion.
What impact will the market have on the repurchase of shares by publicly traded companies?
In an interview with Xinhua, Shenzhen Vice-Director of the Chinese People's University's Financial and Financial Institute, said that the buy-back shows that the listed companies have strong economic strength and good financial status, are able to maintain stock price stability and give investors confidence; and that the listed companies and their shareholders are responsible for the company, the market and the investors.
The former is based on good operating performance, while the latter requires higher quality of the listed companies and their shareholders.
For the capital market, these are the most fundamental elements.
The repurchase of shares by publicly traded companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence and supporting the price of shares of publicly traded companies.
According to the Oriental Securities Research Report, the expected number of share buybacks of the listed A-stock companies as a whole since the beginning of the year, and the average share buyback price calculated, is expected to exceed 150 billion yuan in capital gains for the A-stock market this year.
After almost two months of work, the National Historical and Cultural Center announced the completion of the monumental mural restoration work on the 26th of January, which will be reopened to the public during the National Day celebrations this year.
The Tōjō of the Afterlife is a large traditional mural painting that fully reflects the life of my grandfather.
The original was painted by the director of the Tianjin Citizen Folk Museum (Tangzhou Palace) Yang Cheng-gu, from 1991 to 1994.
The mural depicts more than 30 stories of the afterlife, the rise of the sea, the rise of the foam, and the life of his grandfather, 358 characters.
In recent years, the rainfall in Tianjin during the summer and the dry winters, which caused the wall paintings to crack, caused the part to crack to make up 60% of the total wall painting volume.
In order to protect and rescue the murals from the remains of the ancestors, the Antiquities and Cultural Street Administration Commission and the Palace of Heaven have started restoration work on the Palace of Heaven and the murals inside the palace.
The restoration work was carried out by the Governor of Guizhou, inviting four famous national painters to participate.
The restoration work was done in accordance with the principles of the old and the old, while also making local adjustments to the original mural content, and supplementing the restoration of the original mural where it was not so perfect.
In the process of repairs, we also innovate and experiment with colours, materials, inks and so on.
After the restoration, the style of the original mural, its spirituality, spirituality and artistic style were preserved.
The Palace of Heaven and Earth, originally known as the Queen's Palace, was built in 1326 and has been renovated several times. It is the oldest building in Tianjin and one of the earliest surviving Chinese grand palaces.
On September 25, a ceremony for the launch of the Beijing Daxing International Airport was held.
The Beijing Daxing International Airport's flagship airport is known as the Seven Wonders of the New World.
Beijing Capital International Airport is currently in a state of overload operation, carrying more than 100 million passengers last year, becoming the second-largest passenger-carrying airport in the world after Atlanta International Airport in the United States.
By 2022, the passenger throughput at Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to reach 45 million passengers, accounting for 20% of international flights; by 2025, the passenger throughput will reach 72 million passengers, accounting for 30% of international flights.
The first is that the new country is a new country, and the second is that it is a new country.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is located between Beijing's Daxing District and Guangyang District of Guangdong, Hebei Province, and is 46 kilometres from Tianjin Gate, the largest airport currently under construction in the world.
The roof of the airport's steel-framed building has a floor area of 180,000 square meters and is the size of 25 standard football pitches.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is the first airport in the world to have two arrivals and two departures. The F1-F4 is an international airport, with domestic arrivals, domestic departures and international departures.
The airport connects high-speed and airport double-decker bridges outside the airport, respectively, with the airport departures F3 and F4 respectively.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is the first airport to open the Beijing-Bingbo Airport boom era.
The new airport is positioned as a major international air hub, a new source of energy for national development, and a regional integrated transport hub in Beijing-Zhongshan, which is under construction in the Xi'an-Yue district. As of now, a total of 66 airlines have plans to enter Beijing Daxing International Airport, including 20 domestic airlines, 46 domestic and foreign airlines in the Hong Kong and Macau regions, and each airline has received regular flights.
In the winter and spring 2019 seasons, Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to open 116 routes, 101 inland China and 15 international routes; covering 112 international routes, including 97 domestic and 15 international routes.
This has created a coordinated development, moderate competition, and a highly competitive, international-class dual-hub airport format, which has both eased the operating pressure of the capital's capacity clutch and better met the urgent need for the rapid growth of air transport in Beijing and surrounding areas, effectively enhancing the international competitiveness of our national aviation industry.
To ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daxing International Airport takes full account of the geographical location, the airport's relationship with the surrounding airspace and the operating environment, the airport runway uses a full-directional fitting system for the first time in the country, the world's largest air-conditioning automation system, and the largest terminal control zone in China, which can maximize air operation efficiency.
The domestic airport of this size for the first time uses a domestic baggage automation and information management system, adopting innovative baggage transfer models, to improve the efficiency of baggage handling systems.
Beijing Daxing International Airport, the first flight, predicts the flying of the kite with its wings extended and its wings cool.
The new airport, which has created more than 40 international and domestic firsts, with a domestic production rate of more than 98%, will have a direct and indirect economic impact on the surrounding industry and will give Beijing a boost to its economic development.
Mawar suspends November convention and plans to lower party age to 16
Mawara suspended the Central Congress in early November, proposing to amend the party's party chapter to lower the party age to 16 years.

Chairman of the National Assembly of Malawi, Nadu Sri Chincheng said that the Central Assembly of Malawi was scheduled to be convened on November 2 and 3, but the date of the assembly may change due to the re-election of the Dhanbeei Assembly seat.
He said that since the Election Commission will meet on October 1 to decide the date of nomination and vote for the Dhan Pei State Assembly, they will meet the next day, October 2, to discuss whether to change the date of this year's Central Congress.
He also explained that the purpose of the Central Committee convened yesterday (July 26) was to finalize the date of the Congress and amend the party chapter, but that the accidental illness of Nadu Mohamad Fadi, a member of the National Assembly of the Native Unity Party of Dhanbad Ai, led to the addition of the agenda for the upcoming elections.
Shandong Shui Sheng County Commissioner Wang Bershing, Yang Yang, Yangtze County, and the people of the state of Qinghai
Wang Bersiang, Shandong Shu-sun, born February 1943, joined the work in 1967, and previously served as township party committee secretary, county committee secretary, mayor and other positions.
In 1986, Wang Bershing was appointed as the secretary of the Suzhou County Commission in Shandong Province, which was then a poor county in Zhejiang.
During his five years in office, Wang Bershing-yeo concentrated his efforts on three things: to promote vegetable industrialization; to develop the North Salt Lake plant; and to lay the foundations for the industry, so that the people of Shu Sheng-yeo could raise their pockets and stand up for themselves.
The Sukhuni farmers have a variety of vegetable traditions and have also learned from them.
In the early 1980s, the crops harvested by the Shūshū farmers were not sold and were rotting in the ground.
Wang Bersiang's research has found that grabbing vegetables is key to getting them to circulate.
The company is the first to build a wholesale market for vegetables, which opened the door to the development of a market economy.
The party's leadership is going to lead, it's going to be a mess, and all the losses are being borne by the county.
In 1989, 17 members of the party, including Yu Yuura Wang Liyi, under Wang Bersiang's support, set up 17 winter-heated vegetable shelves, which in 1989 raised 17 million yuan for the village.
The promotion group was established in the county, and under Wang Bershing's guidance, Wang Li Yi toured the towns and cities; in the first year, more than 5,000 vegetable shelves were promoted, and then the trend of vegetable shelves such as the banana plant was expanded throughout the county and even nationwide.
For thousands of years, the 1.6 million hectares of land in the north of the country, except for salt marshes, have been covered with shallow sea water.
The local population lives in a very difficult situation.
So, what is the meaning of the word "green shelf" in the Chinese language?
And he organized ten thousand men for the battle, and encamped in the wilderness forty and fifty days.
Wang Bershing and the county's leadership staff ate all at work, driving the same wagons as the civil servants, and the people saw them all with their thumbs outstretched and their eyes worshipped... ... At that time, the Shū North developed 150,000 ponds, 200,000 tonnes of salt fields, 600,000 tonnes of cotton fields, and developed a salt-coated pool of cotton.
In July 1986, Wang Berqing first attended the Shenyang City Industrial Conference as County Commissioner.
During the meeting, a comparative industrial economic figures for the 12 counties of the city of Zhejiang were released.
But if the raw salt is removed, the pure industrial output of SUS light is only 119 million yuan, ranking third in the decimal place.
Wang Berxiang, with more than 70 men, ran to the outside to change his mind.
In less than a year, the entire county invested 150 million yuan and added 77 projects.
The company has been organizing a group of rice extraction operations every year since then, which have been carried out in Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai.
The number of people who are in the business world is increasing.
Wang Bersiang hosted a conference with the theme of "Plattering: 40 talented and professional managers have been selected for the first time in the entire county".
In 1991, Shuo-sung entered the list of 100 best counties in the country, and Wang Berxiang was appointed deputy mayor of Shenzhen.
He left over 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million tons of cotton fields, salt fields, salt ponds, 4,854 enterprises, over 100,000 yuan of households, and a people-recognized dry troop.
On September 26, Chinese Foreign Minister and Foreign Minister Wang Yi hosted a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of China and the African members of the Security Council in New York.
Foreign Ministers of Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, South Africa, and Niger, and Tunisia, including former Foreign Minister Karla Ghinavi, attended the meeting.
Wang Xi proposed four recommendations to strengthen cooperation between the two sides in the Security Council.
First, by uniting forces.
The greatest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, with the direct consequence that the basic norms of international relations are challenged, the role of the United Nations is impacted, and the interests of large and small developing countries, including African countries, are damaged.
The challenge is to reach out to the people of Central Africa, shoulder to shoulder, and unite to meet this challenge.
At the Security Council, the three African countries spoke with one voice, focusing on the distribution of not just three votes, but the entire African continent.
China and Africa stand together, not just with four votes, but to move other countries to follow, influence and shape the agenda of the Security Council.
Since 2018, China and the African members of the Security Council have established a Coordination Mechanism of 3+1 to make full use of this coordination mechanism.
The second is to resolve disputes through consultation.
China has been advocating political solutions to hotspots, has a good tradition of consultation in Africa, and has had success in the rotation of African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex issues in the conference process, particularly the African hotspots, were largely the root causes of colonialism, some of which were directly related to external factors.
We will work together to use Chapter 6 of the UN Charter to play the role of the UN in mediation and mediation.
The third is self-empowerment.
African countries and people are the ones who know the best about Africa's problems, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
The Council should focus on listening to and respecting the will of Africa when dealing with the issue of Africa's hotspots, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations, and should encourage and support in-depth solutions from Africa.
China is willing to strengthen coordination with non-African countries and firmly promote the capacity building of autonomous and peaceful action in Africa.
Fourth, the development of the fundamentals.
China and the wider African countries are developing countries, and we must insist on putting economic and social development first and supporting each other in their respective paths of development.
China is willing to work together to build Belt and Road, Belt and Road and Africa's Agenda 2063, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and closely link African countries' development strategies to help African countries build their development capacities and eliminate the root causes of conflict.
We will work together to promote the United Nations' increased contribution to Africa's development.
The Congolese government has and will continue to provide all its resources and human and material assistance, and is willing to coordinate with African countries, mobilize the United Nations, WHO and others to increase its assistance to play the role of the UN Stabilisation Mission in Congo.
The first is the newborn baby, which is a life-saving tool.
It's scary!
A second pregnancy came on prematurely, and on the way to the hospital, a 32-week-old premature baby was born in her father's car.
Fortunately, the obstetricians and neonatologists were able to save this small life.
Coincidentally, on 19, 20 and 21, the obstetrics and gynecology department of Hubei Province's Women's and Children's Health Centre treated three children born prematurely on the road for three consecutive days, and two others were born in 120 ambulances, all at 29 weeks of age.
Ms. Chen, a second-term pregnant mother, felt a bit of a stomach ache at 7am on September 19, thinking she was 32 weeks pregnant and her first child was also premature, and she packed up the products to wash and headed straight to the hospital.
After 9:30 pm, Ms. Chen packed up and let her husband drive from Xuo Dong's home to the hospital.
I can't believe that the baby was born in the car after the car opened and the baby was born in the car after the father was a co-driver.
After 20 minutes, Ms. Chen and her baby finally arrived at the maternity ward of Hubei Provincial Women's and Children's Health Centre.
Hospital security saw the panicked couple and baby, and immediately notified the maternity ward, and four doctors and midwives, including Deputy Director Dr. Zhang Chei, rushed down with the baby bags and the ribbon plates.
The mother was half-lived in the car's co-driver, with sheep's and blood water underneath her, and a baby boy was next to her, still wearing a seatbelt.
Zhang asked if the baby was born 32 weeks early, the parents hadn't been able to cover the baby on the way, it was cold in the early autumn morning, his skin was bleached, he didn't cry, his legs were soft.
Zhang Jiang drilled in from the cockpit, quickly opened the baby's package, wrapped the baby with a therapeutic towel and a wrapper of the baby's package in several layers, and cleaned the baby's airway (see picture) before carrying the baby to the newborn ward on the 12th floor.
The newborn baby doctor immediately rushed to the nursing station to rescue the premature baby.
The baby was purple and choked with oxygen deficiency, and the doctor immediately gave him a tube, and within a minute, the baby regained heartbeat and the skin color gradually returned to redness, and the recovery was successful.
After being admitted to hospital, the 32-week-old baby was given a respirator, and after continuous rescue, breathing was stable, and the next day, the plane was successfully removed.
After a week of treatment, the baby's vital signs are stable, breathing is in order, and she has started to breastfeed.
Coincidentally, on 19, 20 and 21, the hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department treated three children who were born prematurely on the road for three consecutive days, and two others were born in 120 ambulances, all 29 weeks old, and are currently being actively treated in the newborn ward.
In recent years, the head of obstetrics at the Provincial Institute of Women and Children's Health, Son Kang-yong, explained that many babies born in the subway and private cars have been diagnosed in the province, and that this situation is not well handled and could threaten the life of the mother.
The director reminded that pregnant women should be immediately admitted to hospital if they experience abdominal pain, breakage of water, redness, etc.
If at home or on the road, the mother should make sure that the bed is as flat as possible, cover the bed with blankets, etc., to prevent the baby from giving birth to a head injury, and the baby should be immediately warmed up after birth and taken to the doctor as soon as possible.

The maximum score for a penalty is three points.
On April 27, the NBA Development League announced a new rule for testing penalties, with only one penalty per game, and the scores will be determined by the violation.
O'Neal is one of the NBA's stars, with a very low penalty shoot-out rate.
The new rules state that two penalty points can be scored, three penalty points can be scored, and one penalty point can be added.
The final two minutes of regular time and extra time were played, following the previous penalty rules.
While the rule is only available for the NBA Development League, fans are more concerned about the impact it would have on current players if it were implemented in the NBA.
At the moment, many people believe that the new rules may be in the best interest of the bearded, but the penalty is not so good for James.
Wuhan to promote industrial enterprise smart transformation, granting a maximum of 20 million yuan
The reporter learned from the official press office of the Wuhan Municipal Government at the event held on 27th June that the city has been accelerating the transformation of industrial intelligence and implementing a maximum of 20 million yuan in transformation grants since this year.
To date, more than 800 industrial enterprises have collected information on the needs of intelligent transformation.
Zhang Red, Deputy Director of Wuhan City Economic and Information Bureau, said that this year, Wuhan launched an Intelligent Enterprise Transformation Action Plan to provide free consulting diagnostic services and solutions to large-scale industrial enterprises in need to advance a new round of high-level enterprise technology transformation.
According to the plan, Wuhan City will open a public screening of a number of specialized diagnostic services every year, through the opening of columns, questionnaires, and door-to-door filings, to conduct smart conversion needs surveys for all industrial enterprises of all sizes across the city.
To date, more than 800 regulations have been collected on the demand for smart transformation by industrial enterprises, accounting for nearly a third of the total industrial enterprises of the market size.
Five city-wide diagnostic platforms have organized teams into enterprises to carry out one-on-one on-site assessments and programmatic arguments.
Zhang Red said that the city is currently organizing 373 projects for the smart transformation, with a total investment of 29760 million yuan, and that the first 5G smart production line in China, the first in the country, Motorola, the first in the country, the first in the country, the first in the country, the first in the country, the first in a series of smart workshops and smart factories, including the first in the country, the first in a series of smart satellite production lines, the first in the world, the leading in the world of biotechnology, the leading in the world of veterinary medicine, the smart home, the smart home, the smart home, the smart factory in Europe, and others, are starting construction.

The Trudeau-Trouble is going down, and he's going to be re-elected.
This time, Trudeau dug a large hole with a hole in the head, which he himself dug a little bit.
Recently, Canadian media have uncovered several old photographs of the current Prime Minister, in which he disguises himself as a black man.
This is considered a clear act of racism, which has sparked a wave of outrage in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, Canadians do not have the means to pay their bills.
Trudy lifted a stone and pierced his own feet.
As political commentators, including Riley, have pointed out, since the rise of the anti-Black Face movement in the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been vocal in accusing opposition or dissenters within the party of being at a disadvantage in this regard, and have repeatedly advocated that anyone who makes this mistake should be removed immediately.
In a nutshell, this time he dug a crater with a crater that was a little bit of a hole in the head.
Trudeau was the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, a handsome young man who had just started a political idol cyclone.
He was a former amateur politician who fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the 2015 Canadian federal legislative election after taking over as leader of the federal Liberal Party.
At the time, Trudeau presented many deafening policies and ideas such as ethnic and gender equality, ecological protection, ecological sustainability, economic revitalization, and the abolition of corruption and inequality.
However, during his five years in office, he was a snake in almost all of the above aspects, with a high-pitched, low-pitched voice.
The issue of the Navajo race and gender equality, apart from the blackface incident, was not so much a matter of debate about a series of issues related to the natives that the leaders of the indigenous groups moved the protest tent to the entrance to the Capitol Hill on the 150th anniversary of the founding of Canada.
In the fight against corruption, Trudeau was involved in the heated Riyadh incident at the end of last year and early this year.
The report revealed that the construction company in his home town, Lan Lan Ling, had committed a serious violation of the lawsuit, and that the authorities and officials in charge of the investigation were being pressured to raise their hands.
In addition, Trudeau became angry with the official who disclosed the wrongdoing after the incident escalated, and Wang Zhuang, who was the first Canadian Attorney General to directly handle the case, was the first to disclose the wrongdoing.
The case itself is not without its suspicions, but it is difficult to wash them away.
Many observers point out that Trudeau's five-year rule collapsed largely due to his own crater crater, the largest of which was the tail of a tiger-headed snake.
Canada's most authoritative Angus-Red poll data shows that since 2015, respondents who support Trudeau have dropped from more than 60% in one direction to more than 30%, while those who oppose him have never risen from 30% to more than 60%.
Despite the similarly poor performance of other opposition parties and their party leaders, even a significant portion of the voters who still want to vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now not sure about the Federal Prime Minister, the ruling party leader.
On October 21, the new federal legislative election in Canada is about to begin, and will Trudeau be able to repeat the spectacle of winning five years ago?
The answer may be one word: difficult.
Both from the level of corporate competition, consumer experience, and regional aviation integration, the development of Jinjiang, have a profound impact and positive significance.
On September 25, Beijing-Dang International Airport officially opened its doors.
The Beijing-based City Development Commission informed the Xinhua news agency that the capital's airport is in a super-cluttered and operational state and that the opening of Daxing International Airport will improve the capacity of the capital's air services.
Beijing became the second city in China to have two airports after Shanghai, with Shanghai Neonbridge International Airport serving mainly domestic aviation, while Pudong Airport is similar to International Shipping Airlines, and in the future, the capital airport and Daxing Airport will also be differentiated to serve different domestic and international aviation businesses, providing more detailed services.
The airport is also a major hub for the development of business, with a positive impact on the capital's airport.
The capital airport has a passenger capacity of over 100 million passengers in 2018, which is the country's top destination, but there is still a significant gap in traffic demand, especially international routes, compared to the rapidly growing business demand.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign travel and travel, and to adapt to Beijing's increasingly open and international urban development trends, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a major international hub airport, with plans to meet the annual passenger capacity of 100 million people and cargo capacity of 4 million tons in the future.
The two airports are not overlapping, so they have a different customer base and a sufficient market space.
From an economic point of view, the operation of Daxing International Airport will obviously have a win-win effect, easing tensions in Beijing air transport, accelerating the growth of passenger and cargo throughput, and creating a cake of growth for the capital airline's dual-core operations.
From a user perspective, as the transit of Daxing International Airport is moving forward, it will not have to be concentrated on the capital airport, but it will also reduce a number of problems that are caused by the over-centred route, such as increased stop-guarantee times, slower traveler boarding speeds, indirectly increased aircraft and passenger staying time at the airport, increased airport operating burden, and reduced travel through the capital airport, and actually improved travel experience for passengers.
According to the media, many transport routes are used to measure the time and cost of travel to large international airports, such as starting from the South 5th ring to Beijing directly to the high-speed to Daxing Airport high speed, 50 minutes to drive, and the cost of oil to return is about 40 yuan, high-speed 15 yuan; and the choice of rail transport metro Daxing Airport line, the route is limited to 20 km, 30 km, the ticket price is 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan three degrees; citizens can also take the Jixing city, from Beijing West Station to Daxing Airport station only 20 minutes.
In general, there are many transportation options available to citizens to Daxing Airport, and costs and time are within a more reasonable range.
The location of Daxing Airport is a transport hub in Beijing, so it is a bit far from Beijing, but it has strengthened the radiation to Hebei, Tianjin, facilitating more people to travel, and is important for the economic development of Hebei, Tianjin.
In the future, passengers from Hebei and Tianjin will be able to enjoy more international airline services provided by Daxing International Airport, as reflected in the traffic planning at Daxing International Airport.
The airport's supporting transportation facilities are very well maintained, and in addition to the new airport line to Beijing's Daxing Airport, there are several highways connecting Daxing Airport and surrounding areas.
Just as passengers from cities such as Guangdong, Dongguan, Foshan, and Qingdao can travel to Guangzhou's Weiwei Airport via highways such as Guangzhou, Guangdong, and Guangdong, residents of the surrounding corridors, Xi'an and Zhongshui districts will also benefit from the airport, which provides convenient and efficient aviation services.
It can be seen that the transition of Daxing International Airport, not only adding several runways and several aircraft, both from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, and regional aviation integration, but also from the level of development of the development of Jinjiang, has a profound impact and positive significance, not only in the long-term layout and development of the Beijing shipping industry, but also in the diversification of the choice of travel for the residents of the greater area of Jinjiang, promoting further improvement of the quality of services in the Beijing shipping industry, and contributing to the development of the process of Jinjiang integration, and attracting the economic and commercial development of the surrounding areas of Daxing Airport.
Therefore, for the operation of Daxing Airport, we are not only going to be a small account of individual economic growth, but also a big account of overall development.
The average price of a home is 1.46%.
The average of the 27th month of the year, the average score was higher, with a final yield of 6077.23 points, up 87.55 points from the previous trading day, an increase of 1.46%.
On that day, the SME made a turnover of 108 billion yuan, down from 319 billion yuan on the previous trading day.
Among the shares traded on the day, there were 668 closed stocks, 15 stocks including the Jiabao Group, and 15 stocks including the Jiabao Group, 222 closed stocks and 4 closed stocks including the Shueishi and 40 closed stocks including the Weiwei shares.
The 2019 Forum on Economic and Social Issues in Vietnam was held in Shanxi province
The Vice-Director of the Economic Committee of the Vietnamese Parliament, Dr. Phan Thien, said that early this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new ups and downs and continued to grow.
The forum focused on the economic and social issues that were highlighted in the months leading up to 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development in late 2019 and 2020.
The Forum will also provide an in-depth exchange of views and views on the state of economic development in 2019 and the impact of some of the FTAs, some of the key issues in Vietnam's economy in 2019, key issues in Vietnam's social culture in 2019, and forecasts and recommendations on Vietnam's economic and social development in 2020.
Representatives generally believe that the first few months of 2019 saw a slowdown in global economic growth, with increased risks and challenges.
Trade friction between major economies has further tightened global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has identified that despite the uncertainty of the global economy, with 70% of the world's economies in a stagnant growth state, Vietnam's economic development has achieved many positive achievements, with macroeconomic stability and effective control of inflation. The consumer price index for residents grew by an average of 2.64% in the first half of 2019, the lowest growth in three years.
GDP growth in the first half of 2019 was 6.76%, although it was below 7.05%, compared to the same period last year, but growth was still higher than the level in the period 2011-2017.
In making forecasts on Vietnam's economic development trends for 2019-2020, Vice Director of the National Economic and Social Forecasting Center of Vietnam, Dr. Deng Ying, said that Vietnam's economy showed a higher growth momentum in 2019 amidst the global economic turmoil.
The implementation of various free trade agreements will further boost trade development, economic structural adjustment, and work to improve the business environment, and Vietnam's foreign exports will decline due to the effects of trade friction.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring and forecasting and warning mechanisms, to actively seek trade relief measures for Vietnamese exports, to seek opportunities to expand new export markets and to facilitate the export of various goods, such as agricultural and water products.
At the same time, inflation is controlled at a reasonable level, thus promoting the development of assisted industries, supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic and ecological agriculture, etc.

The reception was attended by Kenvenson, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, Chairman of the Council of the Province of Phnom Penh, the Governors of the 5 provinces of the Territory, the Phnom Penh Branch of the Council of Cambodia, volunteer teachers, the Phnom Penh Branch of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, representatives of Chinese enterprises and foreign delegations in Phnom Penh.
China's digital decade witnessed the rise of the Chinese in Yunnan Township
If we take the 2009 Local Web Forum as the starting point, the 2019 Cloud Summit in Hangzhou, held from 25 to 27, has been going on for a full decade.
From the concept of a cloud-filled, cloud-filled practice to the practice of cloud-filled, big data, cloud computing have become one of the core technologies that support China's economic development, social management, and public services over the next decade.
In the Nungtai New Energy Photovoltaic Battery Workshop in Zhejiang Heining, a recent interrogator was beside a colleague of a new generation of AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-powered AI-based AI-powered AI-based AI-powered AI-powered AI-based AI-powered AI-based AI-powered AI-based AI-powered AI-based AI-powered AI-based tool.
It is available 24 hours a day, with a speed of more than twice that of a human, and a quality control accuracy of more than 95%.
According to the company's head, the camera-loaded silicon quality inspector, Liu, has studied more than 40,000 silicon samples and, thanks to the cloud computing power behind it, is able to quickly convert infrared images into binary language, which will place the silicon-based battery classification.
The company is just a shorthand for the transformation of the manufacturing industry that is now being driven by cloud computing.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a 2018 guidance document promoting the implementation of cloud in enterprises (2018-2020) which proposed that by 2020, efforts to achieve significantly improved awareness and motivation in enterprises, the proportion and depth of applications of clouds will be significantly improved.
Wang, founder of Ali Yun, said that today, data-centric cloud computing has built a bridge to the digital economy where data is a key element.
At the same time, the cloud computing industry in China has been expanding steadily for 10 years.
The Chinese Institute of Information and Communication released a white paper on cloud computing development in July 2019 (WEB which shows that the overall Chinese cloud computing market in 2018 was worth 962.8 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2% from 2017.
In addition to being a key technology supporting industrial transformation and digital economic development, the invisible cloud cloud has unknowingly transformed urban management and social life.
The three-year-old city of Yangon brainwashed people at this year's congress.
Ali Yun said that the urban brain has now become the hub of urban governance from a tool for traffic governance, and the related collaboration applications have expanded to 23 cities worldwide.
Through camera perception, AI algorithms, and powerful computing capabilities, the city brain allows people to pay for parking before they arrive.
In the field of government services, cloud computing has facilitated the delivery of government services on both sides.
Currently, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform across the province through government-sponsored cloud computing.
As of September 11, the platform has covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million corporate units in the province, collecting 19,080 million items of governance data from the 3066 category.
The average monthly call sharing between Zhejiang provincial government departments has reached 12 million times, and the data flowing through the Zhejiang cloud may mean fewer crowds of people doing their jobs.
Be careful with plastic tea bubbles!
A recent study in Canada found that a plastic tea bag could release billions or even 10 billion plastic particles, significantly more than the estimated amount of microplastics consumed by a person for a year, according to the Xinhua news agency.
Researchers at Marguerite University in Canada reportedly found that dipping a plastic tea bag into a glass of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius) released about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplast particles into the cup.
This is significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastics consumed per person in a year.
According to a study published earlier in 2019, the average person consumes at least 50,000 plastic particles per year while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.
The study, published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, found that researchers tested four different types of plastic tea bags for sale in Mont Blanc shops and cafes, opened them, and dipped them in almost boiling water for five minutes after cleaning them, and then analyzed them using electron microscopes and spectrometers.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag releases more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, which are several degrees higher than the plastic loads of previous foods.
Most tea bags are made from natural fibers, but many brands that use natural fibers to make tea bags still use plastic to cover them.
Some brands of tea bags are now using plastic instead of paper, and these plastic tea bags are being tested by researchers.
Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic, defined by researchers as being between 100 nm and 5 cm in size, and produced mainly from the decomposition of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and deepest seawalls around the world, and they can also be found in fresh water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
In October 2018, researchers first detected plastic particles in human feces samples in several countries in different regions of the world.
To test the potential toxicity of tea packaging to release plastic particles, the Canadian research team placed the water soot in contaminated water and found that the microplastics affected the behavior of the soot and caused it to develop deformities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that the consumption of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, WHO notes that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread to the environment and what impact they have on humans.
Researchers have speculated that the plastic bags may release large amounts of plastic particles from the tea bags, which may break down or release toxic substances even when the grade of the tea bag is heated to more than 40 degrees Celsius.
Guterres said the climate emergency is the biggest threat to the survival of small island nations.
The first is the development of a generation of people who have been devastated by a natural disaster.
The disaster in the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic, which has been hit by hurricanes this year, is a testament to this.
About a quarter of the population of small island developing countries live at or below 5 metres above sea level.
The relocation can seriously affect their social and lifestyle, even raising questions of sovereignty and national identity.
At this Monday's Climate Action Summit, small island nations have joined forces to achieve carbon and 100% renewable energy by 2030, leading the world once again in the right direction.
Guterres said: "The climate crisis is piling up new injustices on old ones.
Small island developing countries have paid the highest price, despite their small contribution to global warming.
Due to their middle-income status, many countries are still in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disaster and debt.
The world must act, and now is the time to make big decisions and invest heavily in small island developing countries.
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for efforts to help small island developing countries manage disaster risks, invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and approaches to the transition to renewable energy; urging international institutions to help small island developing countries, especially indebted middle-income countries, to obtain funding.
Small island developing countries are at the forefront of protecting and maintaining the Earth's life line, the oceans and oceans.
The latest special report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week confirms that the oceans have already suffered the dire consequences of the global warming of the climate crisis.
By the middle of the century, there could be an annual rise in sea levels in many areas that would have occurred in the previous century.
The report warns that without significant investment in adaptation, some island countries could become uninhabitable.
The country's population is estimated to be around 1,600,000 people.
In the last 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the last 40 years.
The demand for industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to a reduction in resources, including the maintenance of fishing grounds in many island communities.
Small island countries also face high costs for transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, which makes them subject to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also working to address the security implications of illegal human trafficking, weapons and drugs.
Guterres said: "The problem can be solved anywhere by solving a problem in the most challenging environment".
The efforts of small island developing countries to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons and examples from which to draw from the world.
He stressed that small island developing countries are a prime example of sustainable development.
They need the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
The Ministry of Finance of India says that the financial system is sufficiently liquid.
Finance Minister Sitharaman said on 26th that the current liquidity of the financial system is sufficient and that the Indian economy is expected to recover in the second half of the current financial year, driven by holiday consumption demand.
The statement was made after Sitharaman had met with representatives of Indian private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks and others.
The statement was not directed at the target of the statement.
Some Indian and overseas media have previously blamed the ongoing slowdown in India's current economy on the liquidity tensions of non-bank financial institutions.
Sitalman, who has been cited as an example of a fall in car sales, denies that liquidity tensions are the main cause of the fall.
Sitrahman pointed out that the decline in automobile sales was mainly due to cyclical factors.
Sitharaman expects that the Indian economy may recover in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday consumption.
The annual shopping season in India starts in September and will last until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping consumption will greatly boost India's economic growth.
The Ministry of Education of Jiangxi Province recently issued a notice that the entire province has strictly banned secondary schools from violating the curriculum during the National Day holiday, and that organizers are randomly inspected.
In the forthcoming notice of strictly prohibiting National Day Long Leave non-compliance, the Jiangxi Provincial Ministry of Education stressed that secondary schools throughout the country must be determined to do this during National Day: never to organize collective classes or take new classes, never to hold school training, special classes, odd-school classes, interest classes, promotion classes, etc., never to rent campus and school buildings to other educational institutions for all kinds of training classes.
At the same time, it is strictly prohibited to organize and encourage teachers in primary schools to participate in extracurricular irregularities, to prohibit teachers in primary schools from participating in extracurricular irregularities or from participating in extracurricular irregularities organized by other teachers, parents, parents' committees, and to prohibit teachers in primary schools from presenting their sources of life and providing relevant information to others.
Notify that the disregard of subsidy in the secondary and primary schools in Chhattisgarh will be subject to a heavy deduction on the local education administration in the quality development of education examination of the county government for the year; that the teachers involved in the disregard of subsidy will be treated with due care in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Teacher's Code of Practice.
Supporting pig production and ensuring market supply
Liu Loy demands that measures be implemented from six points of view
The provincial television conference on promoting live pig production and ensuring the market supply was held today to mobilize and deploy the implementation of the policies of the Central and Provincial Committees and the provincial governments on supporting live pig production and ensuring the market supply.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MRA) has also called for the implementation of measures to ensure the production of live pigs in six areas.
The Mayor of the city of Chiang Mai has been responsible for the implementation of the catch of the chicken basket, and this year the province's 45 million clear pig farming tasks have been broken down into the cities and states to include accountability checks.
The Commission is also working on the implementation of the policy measures to effectively address the last kilometre of the road.
To ensure that pig production is implemented, to seriously implement the subsidy policy for pig breeding, to encourage pig breeding enterprises to expand pig breeding and to select good pigs from the commodity pig population.
The government has also taken steps to implement the bidding process, with the main focus being on domestic well-known large farming enterprises that have not yet entered our province.
To implement market distribution system, accelerate the construction of pig farming cold chain logistics facilities and promote the transition from pig-fed to chicken-fed pigmeat.
To implement the modern system of prevention of epidemics, the first line of prevention for disease control should be established in places where the level of prevention of epidemics is appropriate to the scale and work of the crop.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MRA) has committed to ensuring the full supply of meat products to the market, ensuring that there is no widespread shortage and large-scale supply interruptions, and ensuring the supply of pork on major holidays is stable.
The conference also continued to focus on the prevention of swine fever in Africa, the prevention of fishing and re-fishing in important waters of the Yangtze River basin in Yangtze Province, and the late acquisition of pigs throughout the province.
The Chinese characters represent the students of the university in party lessons.
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a job in the future, but I'm going to be able to get a job in the future.
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, four famous Chinese characters, namely, the Chinese Tai Chi, the Chinese Tai Chi, the Chinese Tai Chi, the Chinese Tai Chi, the Chinese Tai Chi, and the Chinese Tai Chi, gathered for the Chinese Tai Chi Party class on the 27th of the same month.
The exhibition features products from the brands of the old characters.
The love story inside the classroom made students shout, the elaborate display of old-style branded products outside the classroom, and the fact that I and my hometown's campus were playing cards made college students happy to think.
Big White Cinnamon Lipstick, Big White Cinnamon Ice Cream, Big White Cinnamon Milk Sugar, as an old-fashioned brand, has been actively evolving in recent years, taking action, staying innovative and cross-border.
The White White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-haired White-Hepepic-Highed White-haired White-haired White-haired White-Highed White-Highed White-Highed White-Highed-Highed-Highed-High-High-High-High-High-High-High-High-High-High-High-High-High-High-High-High-High-High-High-
The company also focuses on youth consumer groups.
The party secretary and deputy general manager of Shanghai Li Liang Liang Food Ltd. said that the Chinese people were constantly innovating in the way they ate chicken, summer heat, autumn wind, and winter.
The company also explores brand culture in terms of taste innovation, comic book packaging design, and more to adapt to the legacy of the younger generation of consumers.
The old letters represent the people of the Chinese Arts Party in the classroom of the Chinese Arts Party, telling about the path of innovation.
Yu Jae, manager of Shanghai Fresh Fruit and Cakes Co., Ltd., also believes that all innovation is based on solid foundations, and that every new innovation is a process of thickness and thinness.
The first is that the new version of the game is not available to the public.
The era of small and beautiful products should be starting.
As one of the first Chinese old-letter Chinese brands in the country, Shanghai Fresh has also adapted rapidly to market trends, implemented VI visual upgrades to the brand, introduced a professional operations team, and achieved a significant increase in turnover.
The old characters are not only visible in these traditional channels such as supermarkets, but also actively participate in new retail and various activities.
All of our changes are ultimately about making consumers see, hear and finally buy.
The company is headed by the deputy general manager of Shanghai Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Yuang Ji-yong.
In the future, Shanghai-based companies will also adhere to high-end development, broad prospects for system development, user-satisfied energy-saving and environmental protection products, and high-tech content and high economic efficiency.
The students of the Art Party class have been very successful in this way.
The old characters have accompanied my growth, carrying beautiful memories and emotions of my childhood.
The students of the school are shocked.
The Shanghai Old Letter represents the national spirit of the old letter brand to over 200 young scholars.
Zhou Zhong said that how to dig into brand culture and keep quality traditional culture alive and alive is a question we as design students need to think and explore.
The party class is based on the Shanghai Video Concept project of Deng Wei, dean of the School of Arts and Technology at HCMU, and the Chinese Chinese Chinese character integrated brand innovation studio of Professor Liu Jing, who wants to explore the cultural potential and modern commercial value of the Chinese character, to use the competitive and influential power of the Chinese characters to enhance the cultural radiation concentration of the Chinese character, to realize the industrial effect of the Chinese character in the form of a "concept" + "culture" and to showcase Shanghai culture from a new perspective.
It is reported that the Art Party classroom will continue to invite literature historians, masters of painting, masters of ceramics, non-hereditary masters, masters of architecture, masters of landscape gardening as lecturers, by telling them about the innovation and perseverance of the Chinese culture, highlighting the characteristics of the era, further strengthening the ideals of university students, reinforcing the patriotism of university students, using works to speak, make works to speak, form innovative parties, make students like the theme of the party, enhance the idealism, theoretical and pro-partisanness of the party lessons, focus, increase the influence of the party lessons, develop new generation capable of taking the responsibility of national revival!
Abe Jin-soo video to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China, also says a sentence in Chinese
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe congratulated the People's Republic of China on its 70th anniversary via video.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good evening, I am Shinzo Abe.
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I would like to extend my warm congratulations on behalf of the Japanese government and people.
At the G20 Osaka Summit in June, the two countries announced their strong commitment to the G20 to work together to make the summit a success and through the G20 leaders' Osaka Summit Declaration, they declared their resolve to the world.
In addition, at the summit and dinner before the summit, the two sides agreed that President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to Japan next spring, while also agreeing to open a new era in China.
The two countries share a significant responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.
I am convinced that working together to address the issues facing the region and the world, and contributing to the international community, will help to build a new model for the future of our relations.
Finally, I wish the relationship to flourish and the friends to thrive in their work.
It is estimated that over half of the overage farmers in some of the workplaces are employed by the farmers.
Where do we find young workers now?
I don't want to use so many old people at work, there is no way.
Recently, the phenomenon of overage farmers working in the workplace (over the retirement age) has been the subject of a long-standing complaint by Yang Qu, a construction contractor.
Recently, the university where I live has been conducting a project to distribute rainwater, and there are a lot of farmers working on campus, and if you look closely, you will see that there are many overage farmers working here.
The overage farmers are not forced to work because they cannot work, but because they have to work so hard and tirelessly, whether it is to earn money to solve their own pension and medical problems or to help their children, which drives these older people who should have been forced to work.
The elderly farmers who are over the age of majority have a dependence on the elderly, and it is not as easy as we thought.
To raise children, to provide for the elderly, to read for children, to help children build houses and buy cars, to help children start their own businesses, to raise grandchildren and great-grandchildren, when these farmers have completed their life's work, the money bags have been emptied and even a lot of debt, most of which lack wealth accumulation.
In order not to drag children and to accumulate more wealth, many farmers work hard to get out of the way.
Many late 80s, early 90s, and even early 00s were unwilling to engage in hard conditions, high-labour secondary industries or low-end services, resulting in structural waste of raw materials, which lacked attractive jobs and provided opportunities for overage farmers.
Due to the lack of skills, physical and labor capacity decreases, many overage farmers work hard, low income, high risk, and low security jobs.
The problem of the survival of overage farmers who cannot cope with the problems of the past, cannot be ignored and ignored.
Solving the problems of unpaid and paid wages, strengthening labour protection, reducing security risks, increasing labour income, improving the survival of overage farmers, and their self-rescue, as well as the institutional and humanitarian care of the public sector.
Some scholars point out that overage farmers are unlikely to rely on home farming to solve their own pension and health problems, and they must provide for their families through other means.
Reading about the power and strength of the unstoppable work of overage farmers helps us to better understand the love and pain of overage farmers.
To see the backdrop of overage farmers, to hear their sights, to think about how to make them really live their lives in the countryside, to share responsibility in a good interaction between the public sector, the market and society, to work together in a multi-faceted way.
Chemezov said that Russia will not export this system in the next five years, because the pump will supply its army first, and then export production.
This is in line with international custom.
The main producers of arms and military equipment always ensure the needs of their defence services first, before processing export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Ghlehov, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Air Force, said that the development of the system was about to be completed.
The S-500 system was developed by the S-Diamond-Antaian Space Defense Company.
It is a new generation of air defense systems that use the principles of the Air Force to destroy ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The S-500's primary role is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, capable of intercepting missiles below 3,500 km in range.
In addition, according to some sources, the S-500 can also destroy high-speed cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of drones, high-speed missiles over 5 times the speed of sound, and even targets in close space.
This weapon can also be integrated into a network with other air defense systems, especially the S-400 system, which is very important from a defense perspective.
Sergey Chemezov expressed particular concern about the S-400
He said that the system is in great demand in the world today, but the Russian military also needs it, including in the Arctic.
S-400 anti-aircraft systems are in service with the Arctic Air Defense Corps.
According to the news of September 15, the work of the Arctic Air Defense Corps on the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system has been completed.
This is not the militarization of Russia in the Arctic.
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, this is a process entirely within the transition plan for more advanced defense tools in a strategic direction north.
The Russian Northern Fleet News Agency reported: "The controlled airspace in the Arctic has increased significantly with the transition to the new S-400 air defense system".
The military estimates that the system is used successfully in the Arctic and Arctic regions.
Air Defense Corps officers were trained for the new system and prepared for combat duty.
The S-300 remote air defense system was previously installed there, but some parts are still retained.
Speaking of air defense systems, it must have weapons capable of destroying a variety of air targets, whether they are targets for high-speed flight at outer altitudes or close to the leakage network of protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by Diamond-Anthony Sky Defense Co., is designed for strategic and tactical attack aircraft, ballistic missiles, high-speed ultrasonic targets and other air-to-air weapons.
The weapon can strike aerial dynamic targets at a range of 400 km and hit ballistic targets at a speed of 4.8 km/s at a distance of 60 km.
Russia has never hidden its intention to deploy air defense forces in the Arctic to ensure air and air security along the Northern Sea Route.
Recently, the first 12 sets of Tor - M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Arctic region of Russia, which were enough to form an anti-aircraft base to strengthen the anti-aircraft system in the Arctic region.
The Russian Defense Ministry said at the time that the Arctic Torpedo Force would be expanded to a full brigade formation in the future.
In addition to the new S-400 remote systems deployed to New Zealand and the Kola Peninsula and the Pantsir-SA short range systems deployed in the Arctic, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons are capable of defending the Russian polar skies.
The enemy's planes, helicopters and drones will be hard to break through this defense.
According to the Russian government, flagship stores will be a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complex and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
Russian merchandise companies, which operate Russian merchandise stores, focus on selling Russian goods in China.
The largest trading platforms in China, including Tomato (Tmall), JD (Jingdong), 1688 (Pinduoduo), Hand Q (ShouQ), Wechat (WeChat), have online stores and their own online platform Epinduo.com and Russian merchandise retail chain stores.
The Russian Export Center will work with Russian merchandise to develop marketing strategies and engagement standards for stores and select virtual shelf-based products.
The store is set to open by the end of this year and will sell at least 10 products from Russian manufacturers.
According to the Russian Export Center, the total monthly visits to Chinese e-commerce platforms reached 1 billion times.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, surpassing $1 billion in 2018.
Currently, Alibaba Group will also open a pilot store for the sale of goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore as part of its global import strategy.
According to Alexei Kodevnikov, the new store will display merchandise from companies with sales of at least 500 million rubles or more.
In fact, I'm not sure if the sales of 500 million rupees are worth the price I expected.
We all know that Chinese consumers are very positive about Russian goods, and that they see our products as high-quality and green products.
Kozhnevnikov said that the competition for strong Chinese consumers is fierce and growing.
He said: "We have an ambitious goal of launching 500 businesses through this store in three years".
At the same time, the platform will also offer products for Russian Far Eastern companies.
Prof. Vyacheslav Cheglov, Professor of the Department of Trade Policy and Fundamental Studies at the Prelhanov University of Economics, Russia, said: "This is a political project that represents the image of both sides, because the Russian export hub is a state-owned, not a private institution".
I don't see a lot of competitive Russian goods on the market.
He said the project is unlikely to be implemented in real terms, but would help strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to Russian News Agency, Andrey Slepnev, President of the Russian Export Center, said during the Eastern Economic Forum that the product information of more than 170 Russian companies has been published on the largest international wholesale online platform Alibaba.com, which can be purchased in China or elsewhere.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, a training project for experts from Taobao University on Russian enterprises, whose first workshop was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Center will also be the organizer of industry exhibitions and commercial projects for Russian companies at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November.
The 1000 sqm exhibition hall will be the center of a large exhibition, where business projects, agreement signing ceremonies, presentations and talks with Chinese business representatives will be held.
So far, about 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Russian Export Center news agency said: "Outside of the agricultural stands, we will also have to hold business meetings, which will arrange direct contact between entrepreneurs".
This is another direction in which we are working, to support and ensure that dozens of special meetings are held for businesses.
In addition, the exhibition will also host master classes, a yoga contest and a Russian American Food Awards for the famous Russian chefs who explore the Shanghai Station of Russian cuisine project.
After the coroner's office issued a verdict on the death of the victim on Friday, police are awaiting a full report and instructions from the Attorney General's Office to take the next step.
National Police Criminal Investigation Agency (NIPID) Naidu Hozl issued a statement on Friday that the police will wait for further instructions from the Attorney General's Office, according to the court's ruling.
In a statement, he stressed that the police have never stopped investigating the death of Mohamad while the investigation is ongoing.
Sheriff General Noachin of Shire, on the other hand, said that the police will wait for a full report on the ruling to take action.
He said this when asked about the incident after attending the ceremony of handover of the office of Sheriff of Shire State on Friday morning at Shire Police Headquarters.
He said that the police were investigating the case based on reports.
He added that the police would also ignore the progress of the investigation and decide whether to call back the person who had been admitted earlier.
The report was reported by the Beijing City Park Greening Bureau that Beijing has recently been a key player in the development of the Park Greening landscape, creating a peaceful atmosphere along the Yangtze Street and its alongside.
Currently, 12 square flower beds along Chang'an Street have been all made, and 20 million vases of flowers in the city as the capital, dressed to welcome the National Day of the People.
The 12 beautiful, diverse, and diverse squat flower platforms along Long An Street attract a large number of citizen visitors to view and photograph.
The theme of the flower altars is clear, from the magnificent 70 years of the northwest corner of the Gateway to the beautiful end of the beautiful tomorrow of the rebirth of the Gateway to the northeast corner, and the achievements of the people in all fields in the 70 years of the founding of the new China.
The Beijing City Park Greening Bureau said that this year's green environment is taking full advantage of its own innovation and incorporating new varieties and technologies both domestically and internationally.
The flower garden has over 230 varieties, including 16 self-growing varieties, 18 green resistant new varieties and 11 rural plants.
The first three varieties of cherry blossoms have been used in China.
In order to welcome the national holiday, Beijing has recently completed a comprehensive restoration of the city's green landscape environment, planting more than 120,000 seeds of shrubs, 230,000 seeds of shrubs and 2.3 million square meters of grassland flowers.
At the same time, important areas such as the city's ring road, the Long An Street extension line, the Shansan Monument, the new airport and the important tourist attractions surrounding the city have also been set up 200 flower platforms, planting flower beds with a capacity of 20 million barrels, laying 10,000 flower pillars, 5000 sets of combined containers, and 150,000 hanging flower boxes, which will allow the green environment landscape of the capital to be fully upgraded.

The number of deaths from e-cigarettes in the United States has reached 805 and lung damage has reached 12.
According to the official report, US health officials said that 12 people have died from e-cigarette-related diseases in the United States, and 805 from lung damage related to e-cigarettes.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reportedly reported the figures and said that the specific substances that cause the disease have not yet been identified.
However, most patients reported using e-cigarette products containing four tonnes of cannabis, the main compound in cannabis that affects mental states.
The rise in lung cases is reportedly linked to the purchase of contaminated electronic smoke alarms on the black market.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that the 12 deaths were reported in 10 states from California to Florida, while 805 confirmed and suspected cases were reported in 46 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
In the last three weeks, India and the US states of Maharashtra have banned the sale of e-cigarettes, while New York and Michigan have banned the addition of e-cigarettes.
The Trump administration plans to ban all e-cigarette products with flavor other than tobacco from October, the report said.
When is the next bus?
The Internet+ Smart Stations brand has a number on your mind.
On 27th, Nanjing Smart Transportation Joint Quality Map announced: The first of the country's first Internet+ smart station signs officially landed in Nanjing, where 54 bus electronic screens will be lit, a move that will enhance the level of information services in Nanjing, improve bus service efficiency and people's happiness in travel.
In the past, anxiety scenes of waiting cars were played almost daily at bus stations.
Buses are difficult to predict, and the conditions along the roads and locations of the vehicles are difficult to know, and the problem of pain points is still to be solved, especially in some large cities, and the long commute routes and the complex traffic conditions at early and late commute peak times have made it difficult to guarantee the bus points.
To this end, Nanjing Smart Transport, working with Goode Map, explores the new direction of Internet+ transportation and public transportation services, launching the first smart service project in the country, called the Internet+ Smart Station.
The first generation of the National Internet+ Smart Station Layout was launched in Nanjing, which combines high-speed data and high-speed vehicle travel time ETA algorithms, and relies on bus electronic station Layout and mobile Internet, traffic big data upgrades, and the ability to deliver high-speed bus smart station Layout+ e-maps, bus expected to stop times, and more.
With the help of the Internet+ Smart Station Signage, Nanjing citizens can not only easily access the expected bus timing of the bus stop, get a real-time location of the bus and the distance from the current station, but also intuitively master the bus route along the route through the three colors of red and green, so that all routes of the bus route at the station can be seen in real time.
Thanks to the warmth of the technology of the Internet + Smart Station signage, Nanjing citizens have been able to easily and efficiently navigate buses, such as buses that ask for bus locations before they leave, buses that know when to stop, buses that know when to get to their destination, and buses that know when to get to their destination.
Based on the real-time bus information provided by the Internet+ Smart Stations license plate, choosing the most suitable route for your travel is also a way to improve your psychological expectations and reduce anxiety about cars, making travel easier to handle.

China: We are determined not to move our own way
The answer to the Chinese New Age White Paper published on 27th is that in 70 years of China's success, the main reason for which is that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have found the right path to the development of Chinese characteristic socialism and have steadfastly followed it.
China's path to development is the choice of history, the choice of the people.
In the context of the recent years of poverty and internal and external problems, a generation of humanitarian workers has been seeking to save the country and its people.
However, the monarchy, the restoration of the monarchy, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, the presidential system, all were thought about, tried, and failed.
It was not until the Chinese Communist Party and the New China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a Chinese-characteristic socialist path in practice.
This road out of China is the path of happiness for the Chinese people, the path of the Chinese people's revival, and the path of China's development with the rest of the world.
It is because China is on the right track that it can do its own thing, become the world's second largest economy, and contribute the most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As the White Paper points out, this development path in China, in line with China's national situation and adapting to the demands of the times, will show a bright development prospect as the times progress.
In retrospect, the Chinese people know how difficult it is to find the right path; looking around the world, the Chinese people value this right path even more.
The Chinese understand the philosophy of South China Sea, that it is not necessary to be suitable for others, but only for oneself.
It is with this road confidence and strategic resilience that China has created the world's greatest miracle.
In the course of the curve of human progress, the end of the story of the ancient world was a time of great controversy.
Today, the success of China's characteristic socialist path is the end of the Chinese history, the end of the Chinese collapse, the failure of the socialist failure.
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries in achieving strong national wealth, expanded the path of development towards modernisation, and provided experience and lessons for those countries and peoples in the world who want to accelerate development and maintain their independence, and follow the path of their own country.
The world is full of color.
China has always respected the right of countries to choose their own paths of development.
China will not hesitate to import or export Chinese models, but will remain committed to its own path, to achieve its own continuous development, to strengthen political and political exchanges with countries, and to make its due contribution to the common good of good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that the owner of a Foodworks supermarket had texted a 66-year-old female worker who was dismissed for preferring to hire employees of Asian descent.
The committee said that the way Ms. Gail Ayton, who had worked at Wagga Wagga for more than 20 years, was treated was extremely unfair and likely to violate the Anti-Discrimination Act.
Ms. Ayton told the committee that Mr. Wang took over the store in 2016 and he was always trying to get rid of me because she was not Chinese.
In this case, the vice-chairman of the committee, Peter Sams, did an internet search and found some of the recruitment advertisements that Mr. Wang had previously posted on various Chinese employment forums in Australia.
Among the job requirements listed for these positions, one was for the first Asian woman to be elected, and the other was for the first Asian employee to be elected.
The third post says that he prefers foreigners.
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton in April this year by text, later claiming that this was due to her absence and the alleged cash shortage from $5.10 to $30 in cash.
But Mr. Sams said that Mr. Wang's reasons for firing Ms. Ayton were weak and there was no evidence.
She has only been absent from work for one week in three years, and the total amount of missing work is A$10 million.
He said that Ms. Ayton's firing had nothing to do with her behavior or performance.
He said: "I think the real reason why the defendant should fire her is because he would rather hire employees with Asian backgrounds, supported by the evidence of Mr. Wang's recruitment advertisement".
Under Section 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's conduct is a violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or is illegal for the applicant to be dismissed.
Mr Sams said that given Mr Wang's disgraceful treatment of Ms Ayton, he considered it inappropriate to restore her position.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton, a temporary worker, who is paid A$26 per hour.
Given the potential violations of anti-discrimination and labor law, Sams said he would submit his own ruling and documents to the committee's director to consider whether to transfer Mr. Wang's actions to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
He said that Mr. Wang had not given Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to what was allegedly the reason for her firing.
He said: "Well, I think the defendant should have taken an irreparable unfair and biased procedure to fire the applicant, and Mr. Wang Yang is waiting for this opportunity, and he thinks it will prove that Wang Yang's termination of the applicant's employment is justified".
The defendant should have ignored any natural fair treatment given to her when he fired the applicant, and it is shocking that he was rude and extremely unfair.
Mr Sams said that while Foodworks is a small business, it is important to be frank that no good employer will dismiss employees in the extremely unfair and perverse manner that is acknowledged in this case.
He said: "Oh, that's shameful and extremely unfair".

Six denied selling fake Jamaican paper, appealed to the High Court
Six men, including one assistant director of the National Register Office and one Dutch merchant, who were accused of forging and selling our passports, passport and identity cards, were tried on Thursday, and the trial was transferred to the High Court.
The defence lawyer, who represented the Nadu Chinese defendant, Li Zhenghua, and the member of the Congress of the Sun Yat-sen District, Reil, requested the judge to withdraw from the hearing on behalf of the case, that is, to cease to be the defendant's representative lawyer, which was approved by the court.
He said that he had himself been criticized by the political opponents for representing the accused and that his activist party was also being fooled.
He stressed that he was not afraid of any threat but did not want to be used by irresponsible entities to defame the AK Party and the HAE government or other HAE leaders, so he made this decision after careful consideration.
He also said that there was no conflict of interest between representing the accused and being a member of parliament, and that there was no legal prohibition against him representing any of the accused, and that the accused, Li Zhenghua, had not been convicted to date.
The six defendants were charged on 12 September this year with multiple counts of counterfeiting documents under Article 26E of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Immigration Act and Article 466 of the Criminal Code, all of which were denied and the court did not approve the stay of the trial.
On Thursday, two district court judges, Nosaha and Mazlan, approved the appeal after the defendant's statements, and transferred the charges against the six defendants in the anti-trafficking in persons and anti-trafficking in immigrants laws to the High Court; the charges of falsifying documents will be heard on October 3 in the courtroom pending the transfer of the documents to the defendant.
The six previous defendants were arrested under the SOSMA Act 2012 on the basis of national security offences and the judge did not grant bail.
The first is the military police, which is a group of people who are fighting for their country.
Kim A-K, a paratrooper training ground, is being trained by a team of armed police officers, who are 1.83 meters tall on average.
The shiny spikes, the unique olive green and bright red shoulder blades together form a bright landscape line.
The day before, journalists entered the squad, feeling the determination of the armed police officers to remain loyal guards of the party and the people and their passion and pursuit of honor.
The song was written by the team of the army officers of the army, who were the team that created the song.
In the squad, the song is the motto of each team member.
The 1.92m tall, brightly lit, stands out in the squad.
As the flag bearer of the National Guard of the RAF, he has a deeper understanding of honor.
The honor of a soldier comes from hard training.
As the engine flag bearer, Zhijiang Light has been training to high standards and strict requirements.
He was tied to a sandbag to practice typing, he was wearing a second watch to practice his pace, he was blindfolded, he was practicing his pace with a head of wind.
In the background of his career, there is a picture that will always be remembered.
The first flag-raising ceremony was held in a rain-filled valley, and no one left the visitor to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
The moment the flag was raised, the bright light felt deeply the glory represented by the five-star red flag on his shoulder.
In 2019, Chihiro was selected as a cadet recruit.
The standard for the use of the flags of the base soldiers and engines is different.
The speed of the engineers and the guardsmen's progress, although only 20 steps away, is more difficult to train.
The base soldiers were the first in the first line, directly determining the order of the squad.
After the paratroopers' training, he repeatedly rubbed his legs and practiced his leg hard.
In the demonstration, he accurately gained the accuracy of his pace, and quickly won the applause of the officers' squad.
Almost every officer in the squadron had the same experience with Zhijiang.
The father of the warrior, Zhu Yuan Oriental, participated in the 50th anniversary parade of the National Day of China 20 years ago.
He was a part of the squad that followed in his father's footsteps, but never gave up after a setback.
He said: "To be able to walk through Tiananmen Square like my father, to accept the party and people's examination is my life's honor, and I want to eat whatever I suffer".
The eight words of the Master of the Order of the Legion of Honor were reflected in the tears of the people of the capital, Vieszang.
Wang Modhi, the party's political committee, said that the party's members are all from the Beijing General Team of the Armed Forces, the Yangtze, a unit with an honorable tradition that has previously been responsible for major tasks such as the opening ceremony, the national celebrations, the security of the National Congress of the Party and the stability of the capital, the development of a large number of British models and individuals such as the Yangtze National Flag Guard, Yangtze National Guard Hero Squadron, and more than 50 units and individuals have been awarded honorary titles by the State Council, the Central Military Commission and the Armed Police Force.

Vietnam must seize the opportunity to develop AI.
The four criteria used to assess and rank cities for their level of preparedness for AI waves include prospects, capabilities, asset base and development direction.
Singapore is the first city to be ranked, followed by cities in the UK, USA, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an expert at the organization, said in an interview with the journalist Moisin Bavan, "I think it makes a lot of sense for him to review and evaluate cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam".
Overall, I think that the future of Vietnam is bright in the context of high growth, strong economic development pathways and rapidly developing talent base.
I think Vietnam is on the right track and doing well.
It is important that Vietnam should know how to use the opportunities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution to promote economic growth.
AI is completely changing people's work, communication and lifestyle.
It has brought greater efficiency, but it also poses a threat to worsening social, economic and technological inequality.
However, according to a global study by Oliver Wyman, only one city in the world today is prepared for the breakthrough of the AI era.
Guterres said he was happy to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of China together and congratulated the Chinese government and people on the impressive achievements of the past 70 years.
Guterres said: "Every time I visit China, I am shocked by the speed of change and progress it has made.
You have created one of the most dynamic economies in the world and helped more than 850 million people out of poverty.
He said that China has seen transformative results in achieving the Millennium Development Goals: lower infant and maternal mortality, improved nutrition, slowed development, and halved people without access to safe drinking water and sanitation.
At the same time, China has one of the best education systems in the world, attracting international students from all over the world to visit.
The Photo Exhibition celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China opens today at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
Guterres said this year is also the 40th anniversary of the United Nations' visit to China.
Over the past 40 years, China has been a key player in the work of the United Nations, becoming a pillar of international cooperation and multilateralism.
After pushing for the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, China is actively implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As the second largest contributor to the United Nations' regular budget and peacekeeping budget, China has been a partner in ensuring the stability of the United Nations' activities.
China has sent troops to eight peacekeeping missions, including more than 1,000 Blue Helmets soldiers in South Sudan.

About 800 million people visiting China during the National Day of the People's Republic of China, which doubled the demand for tourism in China
Some 800 million people will travel to the next 11 tons of gold!
The big data from various tourism platforms shows that the tourism consumption market in China is booming in terms of supply and demand.
The National Day of Celebration Travel Report predicts that domestic tourists will be close to 800 million this year, based on previous year's National Day of Celebration tourism statistics; more than 7.5 million will be outbound tourists.
Currently, tourists from over 500 cities and regions are booking products for group tours, free tours, custom tours, and local toys, covering 100 countries and regions.
According to the Institute of Tourism of China, the country received 726 million domestic visitors during the Chinese national holiday last year, an increase of 9.43%.
This year's national holiday will not only be a new year for tourists, but also a new year for consumers.
The report said that the cost of the national holiday to travelers across provinces is more than 3000 yuan, an increase from the same period last year, due to the popularity of the choice of products that are better for the experience, such as high-rated branded hotels, non-shopping tourism groups, elite groups, bus guides, etc.
Donkey Dogs tourism network reservation data shows a similar trend, with the domestic long-line use of all-comfort models, private-seat groups less than 10 people, more popular than in previous years.
Spring and autumn tourism data shows that consumers prefer heavy experiences, heavy services, heavy variation in the flow of goods.
Fly Pig data shows that the number of tourist bookings in China's Fourth Line and below has grown the fastest, reaching a growth rate of 30%, which reflects the upward consumption of residents in more regions of the country.
Personalization is a big feature of this year's 11th Golden Week tour.
Carrying data shows that the number of holiday rental car self-driving travel orders is expected to increase by almost 60% in comparison, while short self-driving travel along the surrounding small business lines continues to be popular; the number of private groups registered has increased by up to 155%.
Sharing joy has become the main purpose of tourist leisure.
Data from Carrier shows that 28% of the holiday tourists are parents, 25% are couples and 23% are friends.
In terms of age, the 80s and 90s account for more than 50% of the total number of visitors.
It is worth noting that the domestic tourism market has performed more sharply this year, in contrast to the more rapid growth in exports in the previous gold week.
According to FIE Pig data, the number of people booking domestic travel routes for the Holidays this year increased by 42% compared to the previous year, faster than the number of people booking exits.
Industry analysis shows that while demand is high, tourism is promoting supply-side reforms across the country, offering tourists a richer variety of rice and rice.
For example, the National Sports Directorate, Ministry of Culture and Tourism jointly released the 2019 11th Golden Week Sports Tourism Special Lines on the eve of the 11th Golden Week; the 2019 Shanghai Tourism Festival is launching seven of its 100 cultural and tourism events to attract Chinese and foreign tourists; several provinces, including Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Shandong, are launching a free or reduced ticket price for the tourist areas in the coming Golden Week.

China is expected to become Australia's largest beef export market.
An animal protein analyst at Rabobank, a Dutch cooperative bank, said China faced a severe pork shortage following the outbreak of African swine fever, which is expected to become Australia's largest beef export market.
After the outbreak, Chinese consumers were switching from eating pork to other animal proteins, and the epidemic led to the destruction of many livestock by the authorities, halving the number of live pigs in China over the past year and nearly doubling the price of pork.
China produces and consumes two-thirds of the world's pork.
Senior animal protein analyst at the Dutch Cooperative Bank China (CCB) Chenjun Pan said that there has been an increase in demand for other meats, including beef, with China, the world's largest importer of animal protein, currently accounting for 27% of global pork imports and 24% of global beef imports.
Ms. Pan said that China's beef imports from Australia increased by 65% in the first half of this year, surpassing the US and Japan to become Australia's largest beef export market.
The Chinese government said yesterday that it would release more pork from emergency reserves before celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party of China's rule.

The world's oldest barber has died at the age of 108, having cut his hair for 96 years
Anthony Mancinelli, the world's oldest certified world record-breaking barber, who never retired to do daily barbering for his clients, died of complications from pancreatic cancer on 19 January, ending his 96-year-old life as a hairdresser.
According to CNN, Mancini immigrated to the United States at the age of eight and helped clean the floors of a hair salon shortly after, and at the age of 12, began to take up the business of serving clients with scissors, thus relieving the economic pressures of his family.
Manciniley was in elementary school at the time but did not graduate.
Mancini's son, Robert, revealed that his father loved his work and that people from all over the world loved him, although he was healthy and diagnosed with cancer in February this year, and that he was unable to work for six weeks before his death due to physical reasons, but that was not retirement, because he planned to wait until he recovered and come back to cut his hair.
Robert, 82, said he had to find a new barber after his father died because he had been helping his father cut his hair all his life.
New record high for a company listed in China for over 100 billion yuan in a year
In order to stabilize the company's stock prices and maintain its image, publicly traded companies have begun to buy back shares frequently in the past two years, in order to transmit the undervalued information to the market through targeted buy-back, collective bidding transactions, and so on, to stabilize the stock price and boost investor confidence.
According to the Eastern Fortune Choice data, the total amount of shares of A listed companies used to buy back shares in 2017 was 7.9 billion yuan, which rose to 51 billion yuan in 2018, and since 2019, the total amount of shares of A listed companies that have been bought back has exceeded 100 billion yuan, setting a new high in the history of A listed companies to buy back shares, and far more than the previous year.
In terms of the purpose of the repurchase, the company's repurchase shares appear to increase with the major shareholders, but there are significant differences in the implementation of the entity, the source of funds, the use of the repurchase, and the interests of the shares themselves.
In an interview with the Xiang Daily of Shanghai Securities, Chairman of Shanghai Mai Kwon Information Consulting Limited, Xu Yang said that the Xiang opinion issued in November 2018 on supporting the share buyback of publicly traded companies was corrected by the existing system of narrowing the scope of share buyback, complex decision-making procedures, and unsound inventory system, which led to a sharp increase in the share buyback phenomenon that year due to the policy-based incentives that had been initiated earlier.
In January, Deep S&P officially released rules for the repurchase of shares of publicly traded companies, which expanded the sources of publicly traded companies' repurchase funds, simplified the implementation procedures, guided better governance arrangements, and encouraged all types of publicly traded companies to implement equity incentives or employee stock holding plans.
Following the opinion, the actions of the publicly traded companies to buy back shares were more appropriate, the process of buying back shares was simpler and the incentive to buy back shares was greater.
The relatively low repurchase rate also helps the publicly traded companies to improve their efficiency in using their funds, thus increasing their earnings per share, improving their net asset yields and reducing the pressure on the company's earnings indicators.
The increase in the share price of publicly traded companies is more significant than the increase in the share price of large shareholders, which reflects the willingness to manage the market value and the abundance of cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that undervalued shares are the main factor in the recapture of listed companies, and that the company's stock prices are no longer able to reflect the company's future development prospects, so these companies are worth the attention of investors, but cannot invest blindly, and need to pay attention to the profitability of such listed companies and the specific operating situation.
The company's public offering of large-scale buybacks shows at least its confidence in growth and its financial strength.
The company's share buyback has been heating up and has also made buyback behaviour normal, with data showing that nearly 1,000 publicly traded companies have already made share buybacks this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the dominant force in the buybacks market.
China's recent disclosure of the acquisition progress said that the company has acquired 5,759,000 shares of A shares through a centralised bidding process, representing 0.315% of the company's total equity, and the total amount of funds paid is 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction fees).
Eli's shares have paid 5792 million yuan for share buyback and adjustments to the use of share buyback in the near future, with the original plan to use all of the share buyback shares as a stock source for the later implementation of the share incentives to cumulatively buy back 1883 million shares, of which 1522 million shares will be used for the implementation of the share incentives, and the remaining 30.49 million shares will be used for liquidation to reduce registered capital.
Eli shares said that the cancellation of some of the shares that had been bought back would further increase the level of earnings per share and actually increase the return on investment of the company's shareholders.
TCL Group issued a progress announcement on the acquisition on September 25, showing that TCL Group has acquired a cumulative 3.59% stake in the company, for a total cost of US$1.65 billion.
The TCL Group Board of Directors' Office told the daily Sun Sun newspaper that the repurchase of shares will be used for employee stock holding plans, stock incentives or for convertible corporate bonds issued by publicly traded companies.
TCL Group adheres to its established operating strategy, continuously improving competitiveness and sustainable healthy development.
Based on confidence in the company's future development and the preservation of investor interests, combined with the performance of the company's stock in the secondary market in the past year and taking into account factors such as the company's operating and financial situation, the company plans to buy back shares of the company using own funds, self-funding and other financing methods.
The chief economist of the Pronghai Open Source Fund, Dr. Pendron, said that the actions of publicly traded companies to buy back shares could reduce the number of shares circulating in the market, increase the earnings per share of publicly traded companies, and be a significant benefit for secondary market shares; and that the willingness of publicly traded companies to actively extract real silver to buy back shares from the stock market, which greatly boosted market confidence.
The recall of domestic listed companies has gradually increased in recent years, particularly in the performance of equities, and it is a very good way to boost investor confidence through share recalls, which is also a positive and encouraging practice.

The world's leading engineering and mechanical industry group in Yangtze is the strongest in terms of building concrete surfaces.
As a city of the Inland Provinces, the people of Yangsha shouted this famous slogan: "What's the point?"
The power of the hydrogen gas leak is the main reason for this.
The four engineering and mechanical companies that participated in the dialogue, each with their own hands, covered all areas of the sky, underground, at sea and on land: light aircraft with Mountain River intelligence, concrete transportation tanks in the heavy-duty heavy-duty unit, three heavy-duty all-terrain lifts, steel-built tunnel shielding machines, whose hard-powered hulls can be called a single-handed underground, and the arrogant group of men.
For a long time, China had virtually no say in the field of engineering and machinery manufacturing.
When the Chinese enterprise moved to China, the Chinese enterprise moved in, and the Chinese enterprise moved out with twin-wheel drive, taking the east wind of the Belt and Road Initiative, acquisitions, mergers, plant-building, and so on, and became the leader of the global engineering machinery industry.
Among them, the three leading engineering machinery companies, heavy industry, heavy industry, iron construction, and mountain engineering, such as Intelligent, have significantly led the way in terms of output, market share, sales and other key economic indicators.
The first is the camera-driven timing.
The company is the largest engineering machinery company in China and the largest in the world.
In the global industrial lake, who lives and lives well is the hard-to-speak.
In the early years, the global engineering machinery industry experienced a cold winter, and many internationally renowned engineering machinery manufacturing companies have fallen, but the engineering machinery manufacturing companies in Shanghai have not only gone backwards, but also strengthened the bones of the body by adding pressure, self-disruption, and transforming industrial structures from manufacturing to artificial intelligence.
The government is also being given the same power by the stars.
The development of a strong industry requires both the active involvement of businesses and the active role of the government.
Changsha has the reputation of being the hub of aluminum engineering machinery, which has brought together entire industrial chains from upstream to downstream, created many related industrial clusters, and greatly reduced the R&D, manufacturing and sales costs of enterprises through optimizing the business environment, improving support services, simplifying approval processes and other regulatory initiatives.
The good business environment has allowed engineering and machinery manufacturing enterprises to flourish.
History has pushed Chansha to the forefront of building the world's leading level of engineering machinery, and I can't wait, I won't let it.
Both government and business, as well as related industries, should seize the opportunity to build a strong manufacturing power and contribute to the strength of Hunan.
Wang Xi speaks at the summit of China and the African members of the Security Council.
Wang said China is a good brother and partner with African countries.
China stands firmly with its African brothers, past, present and future.
We advocate holding this meeting as a concrete step in implementing the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and African leaders at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on Central African Cooperation last September, to strengthen China's cooperation with African countries in the Security Council and to promote greater international support for peace and development in Africa.
Wang said that Africa is China's most important and trusted partner.
As a permanent member, China's vote in the Security Council has always belonged to the broad developing world, including African countries.
In the face of the new situation, China is willing to join the Security Council with African countries to strengthen cooperation and solidarity and uphold common interests.
The two sides should rely on strengthening their forces, resolving disputes through consultation, independence and development.
The foreign ministers of the African member states who attended the meeting thanked China for its initiative to convene the conference and congratulated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
The foreign ministers said that Africa and China have always been the most trusted and reliable partners in non-China relations based on equality and mutual respect.
The non-Party appreciates China's significant and active role as a permanent member of the Security Council in African affairs, its strong contribution to the promotion of a just and inclusive solution to African issues, and its great efforts and contributions to the protection of African interests and the promotion of peace and security in Africa.
Africa is currently facing the threat of terrorism and extremism and only solving security issues can truly achieve long-term peaceful development.
Looking forward to further coordinating the position with China in the Security Council and strengthening cooperation in solidarity.
Wang said that today's meeting reached an important consensus.
We support the maintenance of multilateralism, the strengthening of the authority and role of the United Nations, the maintenance of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the fight against unilateralism and bullying; we agree to strengthen mutually supportive cooperation in the affairs of the United Nations and the Security Council; we support the common interests of Central and wider developing countries in Africa; we support African countries in solving African problems in an African way; we call for the financial support of the United Nations for independent and peaceful operations in Africa; we support the idea of cooperative development, development and peace and development, and help African countries achieve sustainable development; we are committed to upholding the legitimate interests of developing countries and against any country creating barriers to development and depriving them of their rights to achieve development.
Genghis Khan: The Lakeshore is a place to get out of poverty.
The autumn of September, the Yellow Earth Plateau was flooded.
In the local farming cooperative in Puma, 58-year-old Shavely, a village man, filled the last straw in a sheepskin, watched the white lake sheep's mouth.
The food is good, until the autumn and winter are full of potatoes, and the potatoes can be sold at a good price.
Shavely said he gave sheep a special meal every day, cooked, cleaned regularly, disinfected, and served carefully.
Sharvey has been a sheep farmer for over 20 years, until he came to the cooperative to learn how rough shepherding was in the past.
Shavely is a village in the Shanxi Lake of the Yangtze province of Gansu.
His left-neighborhood and right-neighborhood are all sheep farmers, but he adheres to traditional herding methods, poor quality sheep, and low feed.
In June, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative under the guidance of the government, and everything started to change.
The first time I saw the world, I was in the middle of a conversation with a man who was a big fan of the world.
The people who are in the stock are poor people, they all give the sheep to cooperatives, they can not distribute, sell at higher prices, but they expect him.
With the help of a technical staff, he gradually learned how to prevent the spread of the disease, mastered scientific breeding, and became a popular breeding dog in the village.
The pro-civil farming professional cooperative is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1,400 sheep.
The head of the cooperative, Liu, said that there are many doors to standardized sheep sheds, both inside and outside.
The wool is thick and easily breeds bacteria, the sheep must not be kept in hot and humid places, the sheep shed must be built in three-lane areas, and the ventilator must be fitted to ventilate the heat.
The official said that the vaccine should be administered to sheep in a regular manner, and that vaccination needles should be applied three to four times a quarter.
The small, fat sheep chickens are also well-suited to eating grass with a mixture of frog corn, wheatgrass, and rice, and have a wide enough playground to comfort the muscles.
The cooperatives adopted a method of fostering breeding, guiding local farmers to bring good sheep to the area, unifying their breeding, management, sales, and the achievement of good breeding, scientific, standardization, and consolidation of farming.
Today, 140 poor families with sheep shares, divided by more than 6000 yuan per year, have four registered poverty alleviation persons working in cooperatives.
From the cattle grazing in the mountains of Guangdong to the cattle breeding in the mountains of Guangdong, from the cattle breeding in the mountains to the artificial insemination of the cattle, from the cattle looking at the body, the belly of the cattle touching the belly of the cattle to the cattle doing B-supercattle... ... In Guangdong, the shift in the way of raising the sheep is not only a way of feeding, but also the pattern of the cattle farming in the mountains of Guangdong, where the cattle were sold in the market, overcoming the poor days of traditional farming and the poor days of the farmers as modernised livestock became.
Liu said that if the market price weakens, local leader Gankong Farmers Development Co., Ltd. will acquire the tooth at a market protection price of 27 yuan per kilogram, helping farmers to spread market risk.
Xu Jiangfeng, general counsel of Gansu Sheng Ranch Development Limited, said that companies are driving more and more poor families to consider sheep farming through providing loan guarantees, sheep supply, order breeding, offer purchases, and unified processing sales.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have achieved steady growth through the cultivation of straw, good breeding, large-scale cultivation, slaughter division, market sales of the crops grown in the rice paddies.
The northern croplands of Qingyang are rich in grassland resources.
The city has 913 large-scale sheep farms, cooperatives, more than 5 million sheep and sheep farms, and two processing lines for the slaughter of 1.3 million sheep and sheep, which are becoming the leading breeding sheep in the region.
French Finance Minister says he will cut more than 10 billion euros in taxes next year and urges Germany to follow suit
Reuters Paris, September 26 - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France will reduce taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, while Germany should follow France's fiscal stimulus pace to revive a sluggish economy.
LeMel, in presenting France's 2020 budget, said the latest monetary easing initiative by the European Central Bank created an opportunity for governments of member states with the capacity to afford more investment.
The ECB lowered interest rates to record lows on 12 September and plans to restart debt to reduce borrowing costs, hoping to stimulate economic recovery and boost inflation.
Lower interest rates will not bring Europe back to prosperity, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough, LeMel told reporters.
The more the better, the more investment Germany needs, the more it needs to do. Don't wait until the situation gets worse and move on, he added.
He has repeatedly appealed to Germany.
France has already implemented tax cuts of more than 10 billion euros this year, which has brought a major boost to France's economic growth.
The global economy is losing momentum, and Germany's export-dependent economy is the first to be hit.
Lemel noted that the tax burden on French families will be reduced by 9.3 billion euros next year, including 5 billion euros of income tax relief.
In addition, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by almost 1 billion euros as the corporate tax rate is reduced from 33.3% to 25% over five years.

Study: National Health Diet Index of the United States: Small but Challenging Growth - China New Network
According to the US daily newspaper, the latest US study shows that the US government's healthy eating index has grown moderately in 16 years, from 56 to 58.
But it is not worth celebrating when the score is 100.
The United States continues to face significant challenges in dieting.
Dr. Zhang Fong, a nutritionist at Tufts University in Massachusetts, who was one of the authors of the study, said Americans still eat too much food that could lead to heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, the most common diseases among Americans.
The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on June 24.
The study is based on the U.S. government's health survey of 44,000 adults from 1999 to 2016.
The authors write that despite the dramatic improvements, significant dietary challenges remain.
The challenges include reducing the consumption of snacks, hot dogs, fat cows, butter, and other saturated foods.
Research has shown that people's daily intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5% to 12% above the recommended 10% intake limit.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. national diet was a reduction in sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but the intake was still too high.
Officials believe that the daily intake of added sugar should be less than 10% of the daily diet.
The reason for the reduced sugar intake is thought to be related to the reduction in the consumption of sweet liquor, but Zhang Faang stressed that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and tomato sauce.
The United States has seen a slight increase in the consumption of fruits, nuts, oats and other whole grains by adults.
However, data from 2016 shows that these foods still account for less than 5% of the daily diet.
Although the consumption of salt is slightly reduced and the consumption of fruit juices is reduced, which leads to the consumption of low-quality carbohydrates, Zhang said they still account for up to 42% of daily calories, many of which come from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study was based on a biannual personal health survey that enables adults to recall what they ate in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have been conducted twice a few days since 2003.
The government's guidelines on the diet for U.S. residents recommend that people adopt a healthy diet based on dietary supplements to reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases.
The guidelines point out that people should consume more nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and foods that can provide protein in seafood, lean meats, poultry, eggs, and seeds.
The number of people with diabetes in the United States almost doubled during the study, to more than 7%, and obesity rates increased over the years.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death among Americans.
The EU promotes strategic partnership with Asia
The forum was attended by the members of the CPC Politburo, the secretary of the Central Secretariat, and the Central Economic Ministry's Yuanping Group.
Based on the close cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the Forum focuses on the theme of building bridges for a sustainable future.
The Forum was held in the European Union's two continents, one year after the implementation of the Strategy for Combining.
The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said that strengthening the link was part of the above proposals, as it would benefit the people and economies of the countries concerned.
The above relations have helped to bring stability and prosperity to all concerned.
He also said that the EU wanted to convey a message about increasing participation and strengthening mutually beneficial links between Europe and Asia.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is a guest of honour at the forum and will deliver a keynote address at the plenary session.
The first stock finance subsidiary in the country was established to empower the business of capital management with technology
On 26th, Guangdong Bank's wholly owned subsidiary Guangdong Finance Limited was officially established in Qingdao, the first joint stock bank finance subsidiary established in China.
According to experts, asset management is an important area for the development of financial technology, and banks set up financial subsidiaries to help them use technology to boost their investment management business.
In April, Guangzhou Bank and Commercial Bank respectively issued a statement that they had received approval from the Chinese Banking Authority to set up a financial subsidiary.
On September 24, Guangdong Bank announced that Guangdong Jiaxi has been officially approved for opening.
Just two days later, Guangzhou Bank led a number of equity-backed banks, leading to the establishment of Guangdong Finance in Qingdao.
Li Xiaojun, Chairman of the Group, said that the Group will accelerate the pace of innovation, use modern technology thinking and means, rely on big data, IoT, cloud computing, improve the coverage, utilization and penetration of financial capital, and improve the sense of customer access, happiness and security.
By 2021, the eight pillars of strengthening the development of our country's financial technology are to be established, further strengthen the application of technology in the financial industry, achieve a deep integration of finance and technology, coordinate development, and significantly increase the satisfaction of the people with digitization, networking, and intelligent financial products and services.
Zhang Yang, Chairman of FOMC, said that the platform will use smart consulting, smart investment, big data and other technologies to help FOMC better judge macroeconomic situations.
The future will also see the use of new technologies such as blockchain to capture the direction and trends from traditional assets to alternative assets to digital alternative assets.
Dr. Dong Shih, a research associate at the National Laboratory for Finance and Development, said that in the face of a new competitive situation in the capital management industry, financial technology companies and financial regulators will work together to explore new growth paths with capital management technology.
The need for transformation of the financial technology sector, which is itself a need for transformation, will give new life and vitality to the development of the financial technology business.
Earlier this year, JITO Digital Technology introduced a new capital technology system, which will use technology and digital means to improve the capacity of capital products to develop and control wind power.
The new system will start with the four capabilities of product design, sales transactions, asset management, risk assessment and improve the overall level of intelligent operations in the investment management industry.
Experts believe that while the technology of capital management improves customer service capabilities and innovates rich products, it can also improve risk prevention and capital management efficiency.
Zhang Yang said that in the past, the risk preferences of customers were easily biased to be located through questionnaires, but now using AI to image users helps to better position customers, and to launch products according to their investment preferences, which helps to solve risks.
Alternative big data such as e-commerce, space and time data can help us better map a region, an industry, a geography.
Zhang Yiyang said that while decomposing the risks, big data technology will also help improve wind control capabilities.
China's deepest tunnel, the deepest well, was refreshed
On September 27, after more than 1,200 days of day and night construction, the well at the Goryeong Mountain Tunnel No. 1 of the Great Ri Ri Ri Railway completed its excavation on September 27, reaching 762.59 meters below the ground, breaking the record for the deepest tunnel in China, which was created largely under floodwaters.
The 34.5 km long Gao-ri-gong tunnel of the Da-ri Railway is located in Yunnan, and runs from the western bank of the Reng River across the Gao-ri-gong Mountains, the longest single-line tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel crosses 19 fault lines and is buried at a maximum depth of 1,155 metres, covering almost all the potential geological and major risks to the construction of the tunnel. The Goryeong Mountain Tunnel is known as the Tunnel Construction Stained Geology Museum.
The well is the most important auxiliary crater in the Goryeong Mountain Tunnel, which is responsible for increasing the operational area to achieve the long-term shortening of the dam and the important task of ventilating the later railway operations.
Well 1 was successfully dug to the bottom, marking the official entry of the Goryeong Mountain Tunnel into the construction of a horizontal tunnel, and after the well's parking lot was opened and replaced, the well was added to four working surfaces, accelerating the opening of the tunnel.
The well is located in the granite layer, and the water is constantly flowing from above to below, basically the depth of the well is the pressure of the water.
Director General of the Darai Railway Project Department, Directorate General of the Metro Rail Agency, Shi Jing-Jin told reporters that the dam was damaged by mud and water and collapses, and the builders invited experts to the site to discuss the project more than 20 times.
The maximum flow of water in the well is over 300 cubic meters per hour, with a well depth of over 700 meters, and water pressure equivalent to 700 meters.
If we don't draw the water in time, we'll drown 10 meters in an hour, and we spend almost 85% of our time cleaning the water, 15% of our time digging it.
To overcome the geological challenges of the 1st well surrounding the rock along the way to manage the development, mudflow, rich granite, and other problems, tunnel construction uses systemic water management measures combined with drilling, drilling, and drilling to reduce construction risks.
After several improvements, the construction of well 1 formed a mechanized flow line, such as excavation system, excavation system, suspension system, brake lift system, and achieved the entire process of mechanized work such as eye-opening, explosion, excavation, mold installation, concrete construction, accelerated construction progress.
After more than 1,200 days and nights of work, the well was finally completed at a depth of 762.59 meters.
The 330 km long Dairy Railway is an important part of the China-Myanmar International Route and is an important transport infrastructure for the implementation of the Belt and Road Bridge.
Once the tram is completed, the journey time from Dali to Raleigh will be reduced from the current road of 6 hours to 2 hours, which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in the Pyongyang region and contribute to promoting economic and trade cooperation and people-friendliness between China and Southeast Asian countries.

British tourist car keys dropped in the lake, family trapped in France for five days
A couple in Wales recently took their two children to France for a holiday, and their car keys were dropped into the lake without their knowledge, forcing the whole family to wait five days to get the new car key from the car manufacturer.
The couple then left France with their children.
The British family reportedly dropped the car keys into the lake on September 16 while visiting a lake in France, when their daughter accidentally rolled over a briefcase.
But they spent hours and hours trying to find the key.
The police were also arrested for the murder of a woman who was stabbed in the back of a car.
Although British tourists bought insurance before departure, the insurance company refused to help them with the risk of their vehicles not being stolen.
They hired a tractor to tow the car to a repair shop and then re-ordered the keys from the car manufacturer.
A few days later, British tourists finally got the key to the recipe, and the couple left France with their children.
The trip they had planned was cancelled due to the loss of the car keys.

Pilot agreements in the areas of low-risk food production permits, including the notification of commitment mechanisms, delegation of the power to act as a representative of foreign companies to the FTA
On 27th, the Shanghai City Market Regulatory Authority and the Pudong New District Government signed a working memorandum introducing 20 market regulatory reform measures, some of which are among the first pilot measures in the country.
The notification commitment is understood to mean that the administrative body, when handling the relevant licensing registration matters, requires the applicant to be notified in writing of the terms and conditions laid down by the law and regulations and to be notified on a one-off basis.
The application can be directly handled by the administrative body after the applicant signs the pledge.
According to the memorandum, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority will support the pilot commitment mechanism in three areas: Pudong New District and Shanghai Free Trade Trial Zone in the name of enterprise registration, process simplicity, low-risk food production permits, partial measuring instrument type approval, to facilitate access for enterprises.
Shanghai Shenzhen Food Co., Ltd. on 27th of January, obtained a license to produce soybeans on the spot by promising to become the first company to enjoy pilot dividends.
The company's head said that food permits can also be obtained on the spot, and also adopted a method of tolerance of acceptance of the food permit, which allows companies to submit some materials within the deadline set out in the promissory note, and that the company has really felt the convenience of the reform.
The Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority said that the implementation of the notification commitment for food production licenses is a pioneering pilot in the country.
After the reform, the approval link was compressed from the previous registration, acceptance, on-site verification, sampling inspection, material audit, approval certificate, and six other links to the registration, acceptance, approval certificate, and three other links, with the completion time being reduced from the 20 working days prior to the reform to the on-site completion.
Given the high external orientation of the Pudong economy, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority has transferred the registration of foreign (regional) companies to the Shanghai Free Trade Area, facilitating business access.
Statistics show that the dismissal of the case involved a total of 1592 permanent representative bodies within the Shanghai Free Trade Area, of which 99 have been treated in accordance with the new rules.
The survey on the consumption of long-term holidays: more diverse choices, tourism takes the top spot.
The holiday is approaching and people's holiday plans are gradually finalized.
The daily newspaper Jiaotong Securities recently launched a small investigation into the arrangement of the 11th anniversary holidays in the circle of friends, and almost 20 comments received showed that while everyone's plans differ, Jiaotong Tourism + Consumption Jiaotong became the key word for the 11th anniversary holidays.
In particular, in the feedback received by the daily newspaper Jia Jia, over half of the people chose tourism.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said that during the 11th and 11th Hours of the year, Mr. Liu plans to go to Shanghai with his family, Disney is the first stop, then to the surrounding cities; Ms. Li, from Beijing, opts to travel to Taiwan, and a family of three sets out on September 28, planning a 10-day trip to the island of Xuan; Ms. Liu, from Guangzhou, plans to go on a trip to New York; Mr. Zhang, from Hebei, North Korea, opts for a self-driving trip, he says, with his daughter under two years old, going out of the remote door, planning to drive to Shandong, for a few days at sea, and Mr. Liu.
The travel and excursion trends report of residents of the 2019 National Day of the People's Republic of China, released recently jointly by Dong Dongguan and Dongguan Tourism, shows that the consumption upgrading trend in travel and excursion in the three segments of travel, residence and tourism is evident this year.
The permeability of airplanes, high-speed rail travel has steadily increased, and the demand for personalized non-standard accommodation in star hotels has increased.
On September 23, the Chinese Tourism Consumer Trends Report 2019 released by Merriam-Webster showed that tourism consumption continues to grow and that there is a diversified upward trend in the tourism industry.
More young people are enjoying high quality travel, unique experiences, cultural tourism, and nightlife.
In addition to tourism, various consumer demands were also released during the eleventh lunar month.
Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the Hong Kong daily that the main plan for the year is to buy a car.
The staff of a 4S store in Beijing told the daily Zhenghua that in general, September, October is the golden period of automobile sales.
During the 11th of January, shops will launch a number of activities, such as sweepstakes, to shop closures, etc.
In addition, many brands have recently launched new models, and the new products are expected to have a more significant effect on sales.
The trend of consumer upgrading has led to a greater focus on meeting spiritual needs, and the increasing share of services such as culture, education and more.
Ms. Du, who lives in Beijing, said that since the birth of her children, cultural, educational spending has been the main source of household spending.
This year, the 11th class is full of people to go to the Kauai Astronomical Museum, the Children's Theatre, to camp in the Deer Museum for a few family weekends, and to arrange some rehearsal lessons.
Some in the industry have said that theoretically, the path of population consumption upgrading is evolved by subsistence consumption to developmental consumption and enjoyment consumption, where a significant portion of enjoyment consumption is categorized as service consumption.
With the continuous development of our economic society and the rising income levels of residents, people are increasingly focusing on spiritual consumption needs, and travel is a great way to travel.
The country's economy is growing rapidly, especially after the 11th National Day holiday, with more time, more people willing to travel and consume, which can both meet the needs of consumption on a spiritual level and reflect the upgrading of consumption in the population.
The afternoon started to be lonely and didn't want to go out, and the kids weren't around.
And he touched the spirit, and said to the dog, Bring thee out.
The characteristics of Type A blood are becoming stronger and I feel very different.
They buy clothes, buy food grains, pay for it, buy fish chips, and snack food.
This is the reason why I left.
In the phone, she had just finished talking to her sister, Nana, and she had no excuse to buy snacks.
The children were all laughing and saying that the children would come and call and they hung up.
And she leaped up from the carriage, and sat down, and saw that she was driving; and she was afraid, and was troubled, and did not want to go with me.
She was a young woman, and she was very happy to be with her husband.
Even admiring the delicious salad made with salmon and coconut oil, he went to bed to watch TV.
And he looked at the windows on the wall, and it was seven o'clock in the morning, and it was evening in the east.
The new moon is being invented in the circle of friends, and it was supposed to be mid-autumn.
He washed a bunch of grapes from his friends and left half for Boo, and put the rest in his favorite flower bowl, and went out to see the moon.
And I sat down with Nana, and ate the grapes, and she ate the skin; and I spat the grapes with my strength far away.
The moon was hidden in the clouds, and the clouds were passing away. The moon was suddenly hidden, and the light was darkened.
The poems about the coming month flooded my mind, and I liked the phrase: every time three or five people gathered together/they were all over the moon/the sky was full of light/they were all looking up at each other.
Perhaps we are giving too much of a sentiment to the moon. But as far as I am concerned, it is better to give to God what is God's and to give to Caesar what is Caesar's.
The moon is the color of the moon, the emotions are yours.
And when they had eaten the grapes, the frost was cold.
And she rose up, and laid her little blanket by her little house, and she lay down on it.
The man opened the door and shouted: "Is the bath water hot?"
The window of the bathroom was not visible from the moon, only the moon's color, the bathroom lights were turned off and the glass was pulled open.
I didn't eat any cake or drink any wine.

Is Mawar running for the Dhanbad Aai Assembly seat in Juwar?
Chairman of the Maharashtra General Assembly, Narad Sri Chin: The Supreme Council of the National Front is discussing the issue
The Dhanbi A party's re-election is a question of whether the Mawar party will contest the traditional state seat.
However, after a meeting, the Central Committee of the Mawara Party announced that the Supreme Council of the National Front would be handed over to decide whether to continue to hand over the traditional Mawara parliamentary seat to the Mawara Party or to other party members.
After the meeting of the Maharashtra Central Committee on Thursday afternoon, Liu Xiaobo told the media that any by-election would be held in accordance with the standard operating procedure (SOP) and would be decided after the meeting of the National Assembly's Supreme Council.
He said that as the Election Commission will meet on Monday to finalize the matter of the Dhanbi Aai state by-election, the meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front is expected to be held in early October.
I also met with the National Front President Nadu Sri Alamzah yesterday morning and we agreed that we must reclaim this seat from the hands of the coalition hopes.
The party has decided to hold a special meeting of the National Front leaders in early October, where the National Front tripartite party leadership will determine which member party will be in the party.
Asked whether the Maharashtra would hold the traditional parliamentary seat to the National Front's Supreme Council, Wang Wangxian reiterated that as the President-General of Maharashtra, he must act according to standard operating procedures and therefore any decision must be made by consensus of the National Front.
In any by-election, there are people who are willing to run, there are parties, somehow they think they should come out, this is common practice.
What is the most important thing about which organization and political alliance we are from?
This is a great test for us to be a political alliance for years, and we believe that the National Front has come a long way and has some valuable values.
I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but I think it's a good idea to have a look at the results.
But once the Supreme Council of the National Front has decided, everyone must be fully prepared for war, which is the most precious thing.
In any case, Liu Xiaobo said that Mawara will be fully prepared for the upcoming Danbian A-level by-election at three levels: District Council, State Union Commission and Central.
The Zhongshan District Council is headed by the Chairman of the Danbei Ai District Council, Nadu Shri Huang; the State Joint Commission is headed by the Chairman of the Zhongshan Joint Commission, Nadu Lingping; and the Central Committee is headed by the Chairman of the Joint Commission, Nadu Mahanshan, and the General Secretary, Nadu Zhangsheng.
On Saturday (21 October), Native Unity Party Dan-Beibi MP Nadu Mohamad Farid died of heart problems at the age of 42 in the Government Hospital in Shenzhen.
A village in Hubei Bokong County is hunting wildlife and is ordered to patrol the mountains
A village in Hubei Parkong County was sentenced for hunting wildlife while ordering him to pay 154,20 yuan for environmental damage to the ecological resources.
Due to the family poverty of the accused, the prosecutor's office enabled the cost of alternative labour compensation ecological repair, achieving the organic unification of legal and social effects.
Wang Zhongjian, deputy prosecutor of the Parkong County Prosecutor's Office, said on 27 July that through three months of forced labor and alternative work, the accused had established a deep relationship with wild boar and felt deeply guilty about their previous hunting behavior.
On June 21, a criminal civil civil interest lawsuit in the field of ecological resources filed by the Parkong County Prosecutor's Office was opened to the public in the county court and sentenced in court.
The accused was sentenced to three years in prison, four years of probation and a fine of 3,000 yuan on Monday, while ordering him to pay 154,20 yuan in damages to the environment for environmental resources.
The investigation began in late January 2014 with the installation of a power grid on the cliffs, hunting more than 20 wild animals, including zebras, small lizards, and crown deer.
The zebra is a National Endangered Wildlife Refuge, and the small, crowned deer is listed on the National Wildlife Refuge List.
During the trial, Sumoji confessed to his wrongdoing and willing to assume the accompanying civil liability.
But given the poor economic situation in the village of Juno, the local village commission, the forest station, and the Juno trio, in coordination with the Parkong County Prosecutor's Office, reached an agreement on alternative labour compensation ecological repair costs: providing public service workers with compensation for ecological repair costs by providing a year of mandatory care and maintenance work in the village of Juno in the reserve.
On the recommendation of the prosecutor, the court acknowledged that it agreed to the obligation to actively implement the ecological repair of the cost of the alternative labour compensation allowance allowance while enforcing the suspension on Monday.
The first is that the government has been working hard on the mountain for three months, and the tour is doing well.
In recent years, the Park County Prosecutor's Office has implemented an organic blend of prosecutorial functions and social governance practices, scientifically applied methods of prosecutorial advice, surveillance of detection, and litigation supervision, to minimize the environmental damage caused by criminal acts through judicial means.
UN Earthwatchers Award for the Forest of Rosewood
In a lively applause and musical tone, Xu Deete, head of the Yangtze Forest Forest Forest Forest Forest Project, and Shen Liang, the user representative, took the podium to receive the 2019 United Nations Earth Guards Award for the Earthquake from the host.
The 2019 Earth Watchers Award Ceremony was held in New York, USA, on the 26th anniversary of the Earth Watchers Award, which was awarded to the Earth Watchers' Project for Animation and Animation, which has helped hundreds of millions of people to participate in environmental action using mobile phones.
A week ago, the UN Environment Programme announced the list of winners at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but the crowd at the awards ceremony on the day was still thrilled.
In an interview with Xinhua, UN Environment Executive Director Inge Anon said that the pine forest is an exciting innovation that moves hundreds of millions of people to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humans can do about the environment.
It will have a huge impact by connecting people and the environment with technology, allowing everyone to participate in the action to protect the planet.
The Chinese mining financial services group (Chinese mining financial services group) launched the platform in August 2016 to help users store green energy through recording their daily green trips in mining mining mining, online payments for hydroelectricity, and other low-carbon activities.
For every virtual tree that users grow, the monkey, monkey and other public utility partners plant a real tree in desertified areas.
As of August, the total carbon emissions of the forestry sector was 7.92 million tonnes, with 122.0 million trees planted in desertified areas.
In the award ceremony, Costa Rica's National Environmental Efforts Award winner Carlos Alvarado, the future President of Costa Rica, praised the contribution of the pine forest to the green movement, which has inspired so many people to participate in the green movement.
The Chairman and CEO of the company, Iwan, said that the award was a confirmation of the project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for people to participate in low-carbon lives, an honor that belongs to all participants.
In the past three years, the impact of deforestation has reached 500 million people, and the goal of deforestation in the next three years is to get 1 billion people worldwide involved in low-carbon actions.
While fighting desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to increase farmers' income from green water in the mountains.
In addition to providing jobs through tree planting, the company hopes to help farmers achieve increased revenue through agricultural product development projects, e-commerce platforms and more.
The public-benefit model of environmental protection based on digital technology created by the Forestry Commission has also been successfully launched, and has been taken as a model by other countries.
In June, the Philippines' largest silicon e-wallet, GCash, launched its Philippine version of the silicon forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through a low-carbon life.
GCash, working with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, Environmental Public Interest Organization and others, plans to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within a year of the project's launch.
The Earth Guards Medal is the highest award in the field of environmental protection of the United Nations, awarded annually.
The award was won by the Chinese Green Innovation Project, which won the Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li
The US economy is in a state of economic turmoil.
The second quarter of the U.S. economic growth chart shows that the U.S. GDP growth rate has slowed significantly over the previous quarter, as a result of the significant decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts noted that the economic and trade friction and the uncertainty it brought about were the main factors that led to the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final corrected data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on 26 March showed that the U.S. GDP grew 2% year-on-year in the second quarter, on par with the corrected data released earlier, but significantly below the 3.1% of the first quarter.
The data shows that consumption growth is the main factor supporting the U.S. economy's growth in the second quarter.
Personal consumption spending, which accounts for about 70% of the total U.S. economy, grew at a quarterly rate of 4.6%, driving economic growth of 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government spending and investment have driven economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment in the second quarter declined 6.3% from the previous quarter, dragging the economic growth of the quarter by 1.16 percentage points; exports declined 5.7% from the previous quarter, and net exports dragged the economic growth of the quarter by 0.68 percentage points.
Barry Knapp, managing partner of the US-based Ainside Macrosocial Consulting firm, said private sector investment not only failed to keep up with last year's growth momentum, but also fell sharply as trade and trade friction and rising uncertainty hit business confidence.
Knap believes that US corporate capital spending is expected to remain downward next year, driven by policy uncertainty.
Analysts believe that while consumption growth provided strong support for the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are increasing signs that trade friction and the uncertainty it has created has affected consumer confidence and adversely affected the U.S. consumer outlook.
Richard Curtin, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, who led the survey, said that in a recent survey, 38% of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, a new high in six months.
The US economy is expected to slow down further in the coming months.
But experts also say that if the economic and trade friction is eased, the performance of the US industrial sector and financial markets will improve.
Global economist Karen Birch of the British Economist's think tank predicts that the U.S. economy will continue the slowdown trend of the year, falling to a level lower than the second quarter.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's, predicts that the U.S. economy will grow at 2.3 percent this year and further slow to 1.6 percent next year, assuming that trade friction no longer continues to escalate.
Ellen Harkin, investment manager at Pattern Investment, noted that the biggest concern of the current business is the uncertainty surrounding the trade dispute and its consequences. If the trade dispute is resolved, the uncertainty will be significantly reduced and the performance of the industrial sector will be much better than it is today.
Matt Melly, a stock strategist at Miller-Tabak Asset Management, said that the economic friction remains the top issue and is the main cause of the significant volatility in the U.S. capital markets this year.
Parents of children aged 0 to 3 years old can take 10 days off each year
The protection of women's legitimate rights is a manifestation of respect for and protection of human rights and an important sign of progress in social civilization.
On September 27, the 15th session of the 12th Plenary Assembly of the People's Assembly of the People's Autonomous Region of Ningxia returned the resolution on the protection of women's rights in the People's Autonomous Region of Ningxia returned.
This is a comprehensive system of local regulations promulgated by the first provincial ministry of Ningxia to protect the legitimate rights of women, which will be officially implemented from 1 November 2019.
It is understood that the current Zhou Regulations were revised in accordance with the Zhou Law on the Protection of Women's Rights in the People's Republic of China, which was implemented in Pyongyang in 2007, and are divided into articles 9 and 65, including general rights, political rights, cultural and educational rights, labour and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, marriage and family rights, legal responsibilities, and annexes.
In the wake of the ban, Ningxia encouraged the exploration of a couples' joint parental leave, a first in the country.
In April, the State Council Office issued a guideline on promoting the development of childcare services for children under 3 years of age, which describes the relationship between spouses and co-parenting.
In the process of revising the regulations, Ningxia has proposed the innovation of the unit to encourage couples who have children in accordance with the laws and regulations to give the couple joint parental leave every 10 days every year between the ages of 0 and 3 years.
At the same time, the Statute of Mohenjo-Jin highlights the anti-sexual harassment and protection of women minors.
Article 43 of the Zhou Ordinance incorporates the latest legislative results of the current Chinese Civil Code on the rights of persons, and provides for a detailed definition of the constituent elements of sexual harassment, the subject and mechanisms of anti-sexual harassment.
The JCC decrees that Article 44 of the JCC prohibits the frequent sexual abuse of girls and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, prevention and prevention work, which is the new standard for the protection of girls in local legislation.
Regarding the right of women to know and to deal with the common property of married families, Article 35 of the Penal Code explicitly provides for the right of women to know and the obligation of the property registration bodies and relevant entities to provide strong institutional support for women's rights.
In addition, Article 26 of the EIA also prohibits direct discrimination against women, and also orders the prohibition of indirect discrimination, and draws on the latest jointly negotiated practices to strengthen the discipline of gender discrimination and to strengthen the legitimate rights of women.
In recent years, the Ninja Women's Association's Joint Public Prosecution Law Division, civil affairs and other departments have been very effective in promoting and introducing social professional forces to engage in mediation of family disputes and anti-family violence.
The Constitution summarizes and enhances this, encourages the mobilization of social forces, gathers social resources to defend women's rights together, and requires the people's government at the county level to provide stable, institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services, among other ways.
In Mongolia, the work of the alumni of the Xinjiang University of Technology, Ph.D., has been breaking through the Silicon Valley.
The press reported from the Xianjiang administrative office of the Autonomous Region of Myanmar on 27 May that the news of the approval of the review of the production of salt water resistant aluminum from the Yangtze University of Science and Technology, which was held in Xi'an on the previous day, broke the average yield of 1000 kg of aluminum from the salt water resistant aluminum valley.
A team of six experts from the Agricultural Sciences Institute of the State of Maharashtra, Yangzhou University, and the Agricultural Rural Office of Hunan Province, collected samples of the salt water pumps from the Zhengjiang salt series.
The average yield of sodium silicon in salt water metals is 508.8 kg, measured by experts, on land with a pH of 8.8 to 9.6 and a salt content of 5‰ to 6‰.
The Executive Director of the Xian Liangping Institute of Science, Wang Zhong said: "We intend to innovate and reform, based on this year's experiments, to cultivate and optimize the salt-resistant water-resistant strains again, so that the quality and production are better".
The head of the team of experts in the field of production, the vice-dean of the Agricultural Science Institute of the State of Hlongoria, the researchers came to say: "I think that with the premise that the production elements will remain the same, I think that the continuous strengthening of the technological offensive, the salt-resistant water pump will continue to work miracles in the salt-water pump.
The Xinjiang Union is a special zone of the Dakhshan An-nam District.
In October 2018, the work of Professor Pyongyang was unveiled by the Xi'an Union.
Dr. Pyongyang led a team of experts to accelerate the introduction of the latest cultivated salt-resistant hybrid strains and advanced technologies, and built a 960-ton salt-resistant salt-resistant salt-resistant salt-resistant base in the centre of the Colony, using side-test demonstrations and side-promotion technology routes to promote the growth of the local poor population and the enrichment of the poor.
This field test of salt water pumpkin yields not only gave hope for the upliftment of low-yield fields in the Xinjiang salt water basin to medium-high-yield fields, but also provided scientific basis for the cultivation of saltwater pumpkin in our country under similar conditions.
According to Australian Net, after a marathon-style debate and weeks of protests, the state of New South Wales passed the abortion law on 26 September, local time.
The bill has sparked political debate in the last eight weeks and has been a source of serious disagreement within the Liberal Party of Australia since the introduction of the bill by independent MP Greenwich.
After nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Australian New Zealand Senate passed the abortion legalization bill late on 25 April by a vote of 26 to 14, making it the third longest-running bill in New Zealand's Senate to be considered.
On the morning of the 26th, the New York State House of Representatives voted to legalize abortion after the last vote.
The bill allows women to terminate their pregnancy at 22 weeks of pregnancy and allows women to have abortions later in pregnancy if both doctors agree.
The Senate passed an amendment late on Thursday that allows doctors to seek advice from the multidisciplinary panel of the Hospital Advisory Committee before performing abortion surgery on women 22 weeks after pregnancy.
In addition, the Senate amendment also included that physicians must provide appropriate care for babies who survive termination of pregnancy.
Previously, New York Governor Berry Griglin had faced open criticism from conservatives over the bill, and Berry Griglin had intervened several times to gain more time for debate over the bill, but she did not attend the final vote.
Berry Griglin defended his absence from the vote: "Oh, I need to spend time running the entire state".
Australian Liberal Party MP Davids was reportedly the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, threatening to remove the new state government and calling it a crisis for the government.
But afterwards, Davis made concessions.
Davis said: "The amendments to the Abortion Legalisation Act that were submitted to the House of Representatives on the morning of June 26 actually provide more protection for women and doctors.
At the same time, Barillaro, leader of the Australian New States National Party, said he was proud to be part of the government that legalized abortion.
The achievements we made last night were historic for New York State, making abortion legal, no longer a crime, and not treating abortion as a crime.
The company is also involved in the development of the newly-created company.

Finance Minister Sheng Kun: 67 central and financial institutions have allocated $860.1 billion in state funds to social security funds.
Minister of Finance, Sheng Kun, said on 27th that as of now, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the allocation of some state-owned capital to the Social Security Fund, totaling about 861.1 billion yuan.
The above statement was made by the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the National Finance Commission at the meeting on the National allocation of the state capital to the Social Security Fund.
The redistribution of some state-owned social security funds is an important initiative to reform and improve the basic pension system, a full expression of the results of the development of state-owned enterprises and the generational equity of the basic pension system, and a policy measure that is consistent with the current and long-term.
In 2017, the State Council issued a plan to implement the Social Security Fund with a share of state-owned capital, which required the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces for pilot projects.
According to the official, the work on the pre-closure has been successful.
At the central level, the three batches of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been completed, allocating a total of about 861.1 billion yuan of state capital.
Among them, the work of the Ministry of Finance to redistribute the central financial institutions that fulfil the responsibilities of investors has been substantially completed.
The central business division has a certain scale.
At the local level, businesses are doing their work in succession.
By the end of 2018, the pilot work in the two provinces of Zhejiang and Yunnan had been completed, with the allocation of state capital of 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also been carrying out successive pre-allocation preparations, laying the groundwork for the next phase of allocation implementation.
According to the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, National Finance Commission, Tax Directorate, and the Pre-Term Joint Notice, the central and local allocation of some state-owned funds to fill the Social Security Fund will be fully launched in 2019 and substantially completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on the same day made a concrete deployment of the full implementation of the work of the redistribution.
The conference stressed the need to do the work of redistributing effectively and effectively.
According to the progress, the work on the redistribution should be completed by the end of 2020.
The work schedule is tight, the tasks are heavy.
Mr. Qin said that the regions and sectors should be organized carefully and closely, to ensure that the work is done as requested; to advance the work and to understand the content of the policy; to strengthen communication coordination and to resolve questions in a timely manner.
The state funds are allocated to the reimbursement of social security funds. The aim of the fund is to provide strong support for pension insurance.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple transfer of ownership of the potassium but the opening of the potassium mathematical addition.
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Human Resources, National Finance Commission, Tax Administration and Securities and Exchange Commission jointly issued a notice on the full implementation of the allocation of some state-owned funds to social security fund work.
The document was released and the implementation of the measures by the Ministry of Finance and other departments was completed soon.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance will allot 10% of its shares in commercial banks and agricultural banks to the Social Security Fund, with the total value of the two shares being more than 115 billion yuan.
According to the provisions, the undertaking, such as the Social Security Foundation, as a financial investor, enjoys the right to acquire, dispose of and know the rights of state-owned shares.
The Ministry of Labour and Agriculture said in the announcement that the changes in the rights of the shareholders and the actual controllers of the company would not lead to changes in the shareholders.
In this regard, he argues that similar divisions of state-owned enterprises are not simply changes in ownership attribution, but can inspire a series of effects of the Zanga-Fara operations.
The first step in the allocation of some state funds to social security is to create a law that would allow for the creation of a state-owned enterprise that is owned by the people and the development of the results of development shared by the people.
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important sectors and sectors of our economy, and overall profitability is strong and more stable.
The company's main business is to improve its performance and grow stronger.
On July 10, the State Council's Standing Meeting decided to fully launch the allocation of some state capital to the Social Security Fund this year.
The Ministry of Finance said that it will work with relevant departments to fully implement the work of redistributing some of the state capital to social security funds, in line with the deployment of the State Council's Standing Meeting, to fully reflect the intergenerational equity and the public participation in the results of the development of state-owned enterprises in the basic pension insurance system.
The second step of the split was to strengthen the sustainability of our social security funds and further strengthen the foundations of the social security system.
As the population ages, the social security funds in China are under pressure, and this time as a devolved entity, the state funds have a sustained profitability and dividend capacity, which can not only effectively supplement the social security funds but also provide the source of living water for the social security funds.
The calculations show that for every 3.8 percentage points of allocated state capital, the proportion of corporate basic pension contributions can be reduced by 1 percentage point.
The third step of the spin-off is to increase the stability of capital markets.
The distribution of the receivables is based on the distribution of dividends, with the distribution being the co-financing.
Social Security funds, as financial investors in state capital, are indeed based on dividend gains.
However, the Social Security Fund, as a value investor in the capital market, has a stronger capital capacity.
For publicly traded assets in state-owned capital, the participation of Social Security Funds in holding will further optimize the corporate governance structure of publicly traded enterprises, favourable to the improvement of the level of business of enterprises, and have a positive positive impact on publicly traded companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the Social Security Fund, as an investment benchmark, has increased shareholding, which contributes to further enhancing its market influence and to the role of the liquidity stabiliser in the market.
In addition, it is also conducive to the full exploitation of the value of institutional investors in finding the function of the leverage, guiding investors to rational investments, value investments.

US Senate approves Scalia as Labor Secretary - Xinhua
The Senate of the United States Congress voted on the nomination of President Trump for the post of Secretary of Labor for Eugene Scalia on September 26.
The vote was 53 in favour and 44 against, with no Democrats voting for Scalia.
Republicans believe that Scalia's track record makes him well suited to serve as Labor Minister.
But in the eyes of the Democrats, Scalia has been on the opposite side of workers and unions for a long time in his legal career.
Scalia will replace Alexander Acosta.
Acosta, then-Minister of Labour, announced his resignation in July under intense pressure from public opinion over allegations of sexual assault and kidnapping of American billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.
Scalia, 56, is a partner in a prominent law firm in the United States whose father is the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
The Department of Labor is a cabinet-level department of the United States federal government responsible for labor-related matters.
The White House also issued a statement on the day that Trump had nominated Peter Gainer, acting secretary of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to formally lead the agency.
According to the procedure, Gena's nomination must also be approved by the Senate of Congress.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for coordinating federal government resources to address emergencies and their aftermath, such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other incidents in the United States.
Since the 35th anniversary of the parade, every major parade has been organized by a huge and unarmed front of strategic missile forces.
The first rocket launch was in Chang'an Street after the Japanese army was defeated by the Yan Yan.
The head of the Command Group of the Armed Forces of the Rocket Force, Wang Bo, said:
The paratroopers' missile forces are fully developed with a special ability to eat, a special ability to fight, a special dedication, a serious training, scientific training, and paratroop training, which show a good strategic military image and a stronger focus on rigorous tactics.
In this parade, both generals and soldiers were required to practice strict standards, to make strong winds, and to make the movement illegal.
They also focused on nurturing the spirit of craftsmen, capturing every detail to practice techniques, practice strength, practice style, forming the characteristics of a strong military posture, quick action, bright words, and constantly using strict style to create a defensive missile squadron, with more focus on technological innovation.
The Rocket Force is a high-tech strategic force, and technology and innovation are a tradition and a great advantage.
This training, which draws on their past experience, broke the thinking paradigm, broke traditional methods, used advanced means such as satellite positioning, laser range measurement, high-resolution imaging, real-time measurement, to improve training levels and quality efficiency, ensure that the manned vehicles combine in millimeters, the squadron moves in seconds, and more in line with the standard of practice.
The Royal Air Force's paratroopers adhere to the same standards and requirements, to keep every gate closed, to tighten every detail, to keep the paratroopers trained with a fire, and to make the National Day parade ground a training ground and a training ground for the strength of the troops.
Iran confirms advanced centrifuge development and further suspension of implementation of the Iran nuclear deal
According to the official news agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 26 September said that Iran has violated the Iran nuclear deal with the use of advanced centrifugal pumps to produce uranium enriched in uranium.
Iran is reportedly violating the limits of the Iran nuclear deal in response to US President Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018 and the resumption and strengthening of sanctions against Iran.
Iran has suspended two other commitments in July to keep the amount of uranium enriched below 300 kg and the purity of uranium enriched below 3.67%, and now there are further steps.
Under the nuclear agreement, Iran could only install about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges at Natanz to accumulate uranium enrichment, and only allowed Iran to use a few more advanced models for research, but not to produce uranium enrichment.
If Iran succeeds in developing a more advanced centrifuge, it will be able to produce titanium at a rate several times faster, possibly for use in the manufacture of nuclear bombs.
The International Atomic Energy Agency reported that: "On September 25, the agency confirmed that Iran's advanced centrifuge Type 2 and Type 3 have been accumulating or are ready to accumulate uranium".
The International Atomic Energy Agency submitted the report to the Member States on 26 May, and a diplomatic official responded by saying: "Oh, they are busy at the Natanz enrichment facility".

Italian Education Minister proposes to impose a sugar tax to protect the health of the people.
The new Italian government's Minister of Education, Lorenzo Fioramonti, a member of the Five Star Movement, has presented a motion to parliament to propose a new tax policy on sugary drinks, snacks and air tickets.
According to reports, the Italian government will impose a levy on health-damaging food products such as sugary drinks, snacks, and other items, as well as an environmental tax on air tickets, a €1 fee for domestic flights and €1.5 for international flights, on the initiative of Education Minister Fioramonti.
Fioramounthi said the government expects to raise 3 billion euros in taxes through this series of seemingly small tax measures.
The tax revenue will be used for education, health and environmental protection.
In response, Italian Prime Minister Conti said he thought it was a viable plan; Italian MPs, MEPs and Union leader Salvini tweeted ironically, urging everyone to hide their desserts, cookies, bread and candy as the new government begins to impose a snack tax.
The report noted that the snack tax refers to a special tax on sugary drinks and high-calorie foods.
The tax is a public health benefit.

The first self-driving taxi fleet of Baidu is set to start its pilot operation
Yesterday, Baidu announced in Yangtze that the autonomous taxi company Robotaxi is officially opening its pilot operations.
The first 45 Apollo vehicles, developed jointly with a Red Flag carrier, the Red Flag EV and Robotaxi fleet, have been opened for test run at the test track in Yangsha.
From the same day, ordinary citizens of Shanghai can sign up to apply to be a seed user and have the opportunity to try out the experience.
One experienced passenger said he sat in the back row of the vehicle and clicked on the screen in front of the passenger seat, which triggered the vehicle's self-driving journey with a single click.
In the vehicle, in order to ensure the safety of passengers and the requirements of current policy regulations, the vehicle is tested and operated with a security guard at the driver's seat, to maximize passenger safety.
During the journey, vehicles can make intelligent changes based on road conditions, and can judge the driving conditions of surrounding vehicles, and make automatic avoidance of situations such as nearby supercars.
During the entire experience, the passenger area screen shows the status of pedestrians, cars, and even some traditional blind areas on the road in real time.
Even if the vehicle is shaded, you can see the red-green lights in front of you and the time to wait in advance, and all the traffic conditions are clear.
It's a strange feeling to find that driverless driving is a thing that we've heard on TV and thought was far away from us, but now it's in our lives.
We look forward to its real impact on people's lives in the future.
In June 2019, Apollo received 45 human test licenses issued by the City of Yangtze.
Currently, the Autonomous Driving Testing Road in Changsha, which runs through the city of artificial intelligence technology, Lake Meiji, Lake Yang, Dawang Mountain, and the Yangtze region, is 135 km long and has a demonstration area of 70 km2, making it the longest road distance, largest area, most complex scenic covering, and the most advanced smart driving demonstration area in China.
The Apollo Robotaxi team is expected to cover about 50 km of test roads in Yangtze by the end of 2019, and the 135 km of roads currently open in Yangtze are planned for the first half of 2020.
Women's volleyball winner Pyongyang is still unhappy: it will be difficult to make so many mistakes in strengthening the team
On the afternoon of 27th Beijing time, the Chinese women's team hosted the ninth match of the 2019 Women's World Cup, against the strong Dutch women, who ultimately defeated the Dutch women's team 3-1 to claim nine consecutive World Cup victories.
However, after the match, the women's head coach, Luo Ping, expressed dissatisfaction with the team's performance in the third innings.
The third leg of the match saw the other side boost their offensive, and we were able to score a few more goals in the first half, and we made a lot more mistakes.
It's hard to play against a strong team, it's so much mistakes, it's hard.
The first time I saw the video was in a video game.
"We told our team to focus, once the attack is not in place, we will make the adjustment and we will defend with each other".
The ruling also criticized Zhang Xuanping's performance, saying that she faced some difficulties in the offense, was more pressed, and wanted to kill the ball, and the action would be distorted.
I hope she is patient, and we all want to protect her.
China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
(New China 70s) White Paper: China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The White Paper notes that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and a challenge.
The White Paper says that with China's comprehensive national and international influence rapidly increasing, some people internationally fear that China will take the path of a strong nation, and some have raised the so-called "Chinese threat".
This is a cognitive misreading, a deep-rooted bias, a psychological imbalance that has the power to eradicate it, and an intentional distortion of self-interest.
Achieving national prosperity, national revitalization, and people's happiness is a dream of the Chinese people as well as a shared dream of the peoples of the world.
China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
The White Paper notes that China is the main stabilizer and driver of global economic growth, the largest contributor to global economic growth, and that Chinese technological innovation is an important driver of global economic growth, and that the role of stabilizers and drivers of the future Chinese economy is more prominent.
The current global economic growth is under-developed and a strong Chinese economy is increasingly important to the world.
China's economy is moving from rapid growth to high-quality development, with new types of industrialization, informatization, urbanization, accelerated advancement of agricultural modernization, deep adjustment of economic structure, continuous upgrading of industrial optimization, and emerging new economic growth points.
According to a study by the Boom-Kennedy Global Research Institute, the convergence of China and the rest of the world's economies is expected to create an economic value of $22 trillion to $37 trillion by 2040, equivalent to 15% to 26% of the global economy.
The White Paper emphasizes that the Chinese economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and are deeply intertwined.
China's economic performance is more stable, its growth quality is higher, its growth prospects are more sustainable, and it is good for the world economy in the long term.
To see China's economic development as a threat to the world and a challenge to China, to try to push China out of the global industrial, supply chain, value chain, to break the chain between China and the world economy, is both impossible and harmful.
The White Paper notes that the full open-ended foreign policy will create more opportunities for countries to share Chinese dividends.
China is firmly committed to a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of openness to achieve greater strength, higher levels of openness to the outside world, China has the most potential consumer market in the world, China is the most attractive investment destination, and China is expanding its reach to more countries.
The opening-up should be two-way, mutually beneficial, not one-way, mutually beneficial.
The two sides have a long-term relationship.
The White Paper said China is committed to continuing to expand imports, ease market access, improve business environment, and strengthen intellectual property protection, and other countries should also expand openness and take appropriate steps to improve their business environment.
Only the parties can work together to create an environment of open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development, to increase the size of the joint cake jointly developed and to form a community of mutually beneficial and win-win interests.
The White Paper notes that China provides more public goods to the international community.
Including promoting high-quality co-operation in the construction of Belt and Road, building a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively carrying out foreign assistance.
China's development is beneficial to the international community and it will always be remembered that the international community is providing more and better public products to the international community.
In a recent written interview with Xinhua, Andrey Slepnyov, General Manager of the Russian Export Center, said that Russia is willing to strengthen cooperation with China in the field of economic and trade, further optimize the export structure and promote Russian exports to China diversification.

Speaking about Russia's optimization of its export structure to China, Sreppnikov said that Russia has set a task of expanding exports of high-tech products to meet the import demand for high-tech products from countries and regions around the world, including China.
Russia will further improve its financial and non-financial support measures to further increase the number of high-tech enterprises.
Slepnyov said that Russia is willing to export construction technology and high-tech building materials to China and cooperate with China in developing fields such as pharmaceutical, aerospace manufacturing.
The two sides have a great potential for cooperation in the field of urban environmental development.
He stressed that Russia has advantages in terms of quality and price competitiveness over Western analogue products in many areas.
Speaking about the two countries' goal of reaching a bilateral trade volume of $200 billion by 2024, Sreppeniov said that the agricultural, mechanical, chemical and forestry sectors would play a major role in achieving this goal.
Russia intends to promote diversification of supply in these areas and promote exports of deep-processed products.
He stressed that Russia intends to push its exporters into the global value chain, where China is one of the directions.
Russian producers in the fields of agriculture, mining, oil and gas and chemicals have the full capacity to participate in this process.
Currently, the two countries need to continue to deepen cooperation between enterprises, to establish more Russian-Chinese joint ventures and to develop exports to third countries.
Slepnyov said that the Russian Export Centre is taking various measures and services through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Import and Export Bank to support Russian exports to China.
At the same time, the Russian Export Center will continue to work in depth with relevant Chinese authorities to facilitate the entry of Russian goods into the Chinese market and the development of new categories of Chinese export products.

Taiwan's Foreign Ministry responds to what it calls a "silent diplomatic breakthrough"
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Sheng said that the small move was unfortunate and laughed at the general audience.
According to Taiwanese media, Taiwanese officials in the New York office of Taipei entered the United Nations headquarters for a religious-related meeting held in the United States the day before, and called it a diplomatic breakthrough.
This meeting you mentioned was a United States side meeting held on the United Nations site, not a United Nations conference at all.

The government has been trying to crack down on the government's crackdown on the Taliban.
The hashtags and social media are strongly encouraging Egyptian people to take to the streets today to appeal for President Sisi's peaceful resignation.
The government has already indicated that it intends to use force to suppress the regime.
Since the military coup in 2013 that took power, the then military chief, Sisi, has almost disappeared from the face of the world, and any form of protest is in danger of becoming more extreme.
The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a Cairo-based NGO, reported that more than 1,900 people have been arrested since the rare outbreak of protests last weekend calling for Sisi's resignation.
The corruption allegations surrounding Sessi and his family are a sham and a vain pursuit of corruption, leading thousands of people to march on the streets on the 20th.
The Egyptian Interior Ministry has made clear that any attempt to undermine the stability of the country will be decisive and unyielding.
The city centre of Cairo has been on high alert for years, and the streets around Tahrir Square, where the Egyptian Revolution broke out in 2011, are full of police, security vehicles and uniformed police.
The security forces detained several important academics and social figures for 25 days, including Nafa, a professor of political science at Cairo University, a well-known columnist.
He tweeted on 24th: "I have no doubt that the continued rule of Cece will cause disaster.
The government has also announced that it will step down immediately in line with Egypt's interests.
Hosni, a former spokesman for the Egyptian army chief of staff, was detained before Nafa was arrested.
Anand was arrested last year after trying to run for president with Cece.
The president of the Constitutional Party, Davud, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that the way dissidents are swept away reflects the instability and fragility of the government at a time when the economic hardships of the poor and middle class are escalating.
Ayman Nour, the opposition leader who has been running for president, said: "The arrest of the rebels highlights the regime's indifference to the Egyptian people and its own fear".
Because the economy had been thrown into a state of confusion by him, coupled with the widespread political repression, Cessi tried to convey a clear message to important generals and politicians who could replace him.
Norr pointed out that the government's use of high-pressure measures will only increase the anger of the people if the socio-economic situation continues to deteriorate.
Since the barrier of fear has been broken, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Ali, a former Egyptian military contractor and actor currently in exile in Spain, started uploading a series of videos in early May, accepting the benefits of government corruption, which triggered small protests in different cities over the weekend.
Ali said his company Amrak General contracted without going through a legal tender process to get lucrative contracts, stressing the corruption of the military and the Sisi family, including First Lady Tottiza (Intissar Amer al-Sisi).
He was deeply sorry for his involvement in the affair.
Ali claimed that the rich palaces and luxury hotels he helped to build in Sessigaea contrast sharply with the impoverished lives of the Egyptians of today, and that the two had not paid.
In tweets, titles like "You're not alone", "You're not alone", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs", "You're out of eggs".
The Egyptian star of Hollywood, Amawiq, has nearly 7 million followers on Twitter.
He tweeted in Arabic yesterday: "Jones Cessi is doomed... he is done, and those who support him are now going to make a big mistake".

Are you tired of exercise?
According to Russian satellite network, a study of athletes showed that the brain shows signs of fatigue after high-intensity exercise.
The study, led by French expert Macy's PeziGrion of the Pitiers-Saalpatril Hospital, shows that there is an obscure link between brain and physical labor: both require cognitive control of activity.
Pesiglion explains: "You need to control the muscle and joint pain and you can force the self-control process to stop".
The study was initiated by the French National Institute of Sports (INSEP).
The school's experts are responsible for guiding athletes to the Olympics.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from overtraining syndrome, which is an uncontrollable feeling of fatigue after high-load exercise, unable to recover, and poor performance.
The INSEP poses a question: Is it possible that part of the cause of this disease is neurological fatigue, which is caused by excessive brain work?
The research was published in the journal Biology Contemporary of the Cuckoo.

After the project is launched from East to South, the project will deliver 100 million degrees of electricity every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which could help solve the problem of discharge of existing new energy in Xinjiang.
According to full-load estimates, the electricity transmission of this line alone will reach 600 to 85 billion kilowatt hours per year, which will meet more than half of Shanghai's total electricity consumption.
The Sutum GIL Integrated Pipeline Project is a control project of the high-voltage transmission network across the Yangtze River.
The main purpose of the project is to build two giant iron towers over 450 metres across the river and to build an artificial island the size of a football field for each of them.
In response, the National Electricity Network boldly innovated and developed a compact special high-pressure transmission GIL technology that would allow the river to be crossed from underwater through tunnels to avoid the impact on the Golden Gateway.
The two projects have taken a new leap forward in our capacity to manufacture electrical equipment.
Currently, the national grid has been built in 10-11 straight-line high-pressure projects, and 4-3 straight-line projects are under construction.
Foreign Office: Foreign debt structure continuously optimised and stability strengthened
Overall, the external debt structure of China has been continuously optimised and the stability of foreign debt has been strengthened.
The spokesman for the National Foreign Exchange Administration, Wang Chun-ing, the chief economist, said on 27 that the main indicators of our foreign debt are within the internationally recognized lines of security, and that the overall foreign debt risk is controllable.
Wang Chun-yin made the above statement when he answered a reporter's question about the foreign debt data released by the Foreign Exchange Service at the end of June 2019.
Data shows that as of the end of June 2019, China's total external debt balance (including foreign currency) was $198.8 billion, up from $26.3 billion at the end of March 2019, an increase of 1.3%, mainly due to the growth of debt securities balance.
In the second quarter of 2019, over 70% of China's total external debt growth was driven by non-residents buying domestic RMB bonds, and non-residents were mainly medium-term investors such as central banks.
At the end of June 2019, the medium-term foreign debt ratio rose by 3 percentage points at the end of March 2019, while the foreign currency ratio rose by 1 percentage point at the end of March 2019.
Wang Chun-ing said that with domestic RMB bonds being included in the Bloomberg Global Comprehensive Index in April 2019, international investors have continued to increase their recognition of the Chinese bond market.
The government has also announced that it will continue to monitor the country's international payments and that foreign debt risks will be controlled.
The journalist learned from the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences on 27th that at present, the Yunan grassland grazing night owl has been effectively controlled without causing major land-based flooding disasters, and the control work has achieved phased results.
In January, Yunnan's Pyongyang city-state first detected grasshoppers from abroad, and in 129 counties, grasshoppers were confirmed to have spread from Yunnan to mainland China, posing a direct threat to Chinese food production.
The grasshopper is a multi-focused, long-distance migratory agricultural pest native to the tropics and subtropics of the Americas, and is a major migratory pest of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's global warning, characterized by its international, migratory, outbreaks and destructive pests.
The pest is a pest of more than 80 crops, including corn, sugarcane, and cane, and is consumed in large quantities, causing up to 70% of the production loss.
The problem is that there is no registered pesticide in China to control the bug.
Since the grassland night owl migration invaded Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural Sciences Academy has selected researchers from Yunnan Agricultural Sciences Academy to lead the innovation team of the Yunnan Agricultural Sciences Academy for Transboundary Harmful Biology Cooperation in Green Prevention, to go to the front line, field investigations, sampling, and technical guidance and demonstration.
The team has already obtained initial knowledge of the population characteristics of the grassland of Yunnan, the insect resources, the outdoor insect sources, the migration trajectory of the population, the toxicity of drugs and the field control effects.
They actively conducted research and application of green control technologies, implementing new green control technologies such as population monitoring, insect trapping, scientific use and agricultural measures, which have reached more than 90% of the control effect in the demonstration areas, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting natural resources and the ecological environment, providing technical guarantees for the effective control of the wildfires and sustainable governance of Yunnan.
Currently, the Yunan grassland grazing night owls have been effectively controlled without causing major land-based outbreaks and the control work has achieved phased results.
The next step, Yunnan Agricultural Sciences Institute will focus on developing ecological mechanisms for population migration to invade outbreaks, breaking through the system of biocontrol and green control technologies.
At the same time, actively promote international cross-border cooperation and strive to establish joint focus laboratories and joint monitoring network and demonstration zones abroad to enhance monitoring and prevention capabilities in all areas of the Yunnan grassland.

White Paper: China steps out of a path of development that is consistent with national conditions
The State Council of China Press Office on September 27th released a new era of China and the world's best-selling white paper.
The White Paper notes that over the past 70 years, the Chinese people have worked hard to explore and advance, successfully opening up the Chinese characteristic socialist path, and achieved world-class developmental achievements.
The White Paper says China's development is based on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development is based on the steadfast spirit of selling 800 million shirts for a Boeing car, generations of tireless struggle, and the unimaginable hard work and sweat of others; on the spirit of carrying its own burden, whether through hardship or adversity, not to produce problems, not to overcome contradictions, not to force the sale and plunder of other countries; on the spirit of exploring the river, not to walk the old imperialist and colonial path, not to move the Western model of development, but to combine China's practical, general experience lessons, to take advantage of human civilization, and dare to try to find its own path.
The White Paper states that China is developing in its interaction with the world, China's development has injected positive energy into world peace and development, and China's roads are in line with China's national situation and adapt to the requirements of the times.
China is maintaining world peace through practical action.
In 70 years, China has not actively provoked any wars and conflicts, nor has it invaded an inch of another country's land.
The White Paper notes that China's development has been a huge success in 70 years, largely because it has found the right path to Chinese socialism and has steadfastly followed it.
It is a path to establish, put the interests of the people first, reform innovation, seek common development in the open, and fully uphold the rule of law.
China is huge, the country is complex, governance is difficult, and without a centralized unity and strong leadership, China will go to division and decomposition, bringing disaster to the world.
The White Paper says that over the past 70 years, China has overcome all the risks and challenges, creating one of the most amazing Chinese wonders of the world.
In particular, since the 18th CPC, China's development has achieved historical achievements, historical changes have taken place, and the Chinese people have made great leaps from rising, rising to strength, and are closer than ever in history to the great goal of national revival.
The Chinese development path will show a bright development prospect as time progresses.

Taiwanese scholars suggest: Chinese are not sure when Chinese businessmen need to keep up with mainstream industry
The 2019 Taipei Business Innovation Operating Model Forum was held in Taipei on 26 and 27 June 2019.
The event invited representatives of Taiwanese businessmen and academics to share their experiences on business transformation, innovation, shiftwork and market pioneering.

Chen Ming-yeon, director of Taipei Institute of Management, said that the ongoing trade friction between China and the US continues, and Taiwanese businesses face a period of uncertainty.
He believes that Taiwan needs to keep up with the times and keep up with mainstream industries in the development of the continent, especially with a focus on innovative products related to technology, culture, tourism and healthcare.
Taiwanese companies have always been committed to quality, efficiency and delivery.
Chenming-hwan believes that the above conditions alone are not enough for Taiwan.
He said that Taiwanese companies need to combine speed and service, accelerate the speed of supply chain, and focus on extending services and life products services.
In addition, the value-added market for lithium-ion services is also a new area for Taiwan to grow strongly.
Speaking on behalf of Taiwanese, Chairman of Taiwanese Aymor Electronics Limited from Guangdong, Xu Wendong said that the sudden decline in orders caused operational difficulties, and the group has started to improve its operating conditions from restructuring, activating assets and more.

New rules for opinion: Social capital is required to have the right to operate rural land
Social capital is required to have the right to operate rural land
The Rural Land Management Movement (RMM) is open to public opinion on the proposal to regulate the movement of social capital, such as commercial enterprises, to obtain land management rights
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs website published a notice of public consultation on the management of the movement of the right to own land in rural areas of Myanmar (the revised draft request for comment) and increased the control and risk prevention of the movement of social capital to obtain the right to own land of industrial enterprises.
The comments were made publicly to the public.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that in order to implement the newly amended Law on Land Contract in the Rural Areas of Chongqing, further consolidate and improve the basic operating system in rural areas, deepen the reform of the rural land system, implement the system of three-tiered land allocation, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has revised the methodology for the transfer of management of the transfer of the operating rights in the Rural Areas of Chongqing, forming a memorandum of understanding.
The Beijing Youth Journalist learned about the important changes in the first-published commentary.
The newly amended Law on Land Contract for the Consolidated Rural Areas clarifies the scope of land transfer, implements the concept of the three-tiered right of separation of consolidated land, and sets out the separate sections of the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Transfer of Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Land Contract for the Consolidated Land Contract for the Land Contract for the Leasing, the Consolidated, the Consolidated, the Consolidated, the Consolidated, the Consolidated or other).
In this draft opinion, in order to implement the concept of the three-tiered division of rights, effectively respond to the principles of the Law on Land Contract Law and take into account the large differences in the transfer of land rights and land contract management rights, transfer of parties, procedures, and regulation, the draft amendment defines the scope of the transfer, focusing on the transfer of land rights, including leasing and transfer of shares, and changing the name of the regulatory framework from the transfer of land contract management to the transfer of land contract management methods to the transfer of land management methods.
The provision for the transfer and exchange of the rights to contract land will be made for alternative management measures.
The comments by the Minister pointed out that in the context of the three-party split of the land, farmers' shares are only limited to a period of land management rights.
In theory, even if the bankruptcy clearance occurs, there is a risk that farmers will lose their right to operate only one term, so the provision of contractual return to the original contractor is no longer legally necessary and conflicts with the bankruptcy law.
In practice, the first-tier, pre-lease, and repurchase methods have been developed to address the problem of preventing the risk of land loss to farmers.
Given the more established theoretical exploration of preferred stock in corporate law, it is recommended that it be used as an advocacy provision to prevent risk of loss of equity.
Scientists at Stanford University School of Medicine announced Monday that they had invented a new diagnostic tool that can classify cells by type: a printed microchip that can be made using standard inkjet printers, which can cost about a cent each.

The monitoring system is certainly a strong indication to those who look after animals that animal welfare is the most important thing.
The US Geological Survey International Seismic Map shows that Iceland has not experienced an earthquake in the past week.
The Icelandic Meteorological Office also reported that no earthquake activity occurred in the area of Hekla in the last 48 hours.
The massive earthquake that caused the phase change occurred on March 10 on the northeast side of the volcano's summit.
The volcano is reported to have been under the mountain, with no connection to the volcanic activity.
The clouds could lead to doubts about the actual eruption.
The Luno contained 120-160 cubic metres of fuel. After a failure, the storm and waves pushed it to the tidal deck.

The 100-meter-long ship was intended to carry common chemical fertilisers, and officials initially feared that the cargo on board would leak.
The amendment was passed in both Houses in 2011.
The legislature made a change in the second sentence, which was removed by the House of Representatives and then approved by the Senate on Monday, as a cannon law.
The second sentence prohibiting same-sex civil unions failed to pass, which could open the door to future same-sex marriage.
Following this process, the next elected legislature will review HJR-3 again in 2015 or 2016 to ensure its continued implementation.
In addition to directing films, Wotier's achievements included a hunger strike in 1973 against the political repression he saw in his eyes.
The protest led to the reform of French law. His activism dates back to the age of 15, when he volunteered to fight in the French Resistance during World War II.
He published an autobiography in 1998 which documented his life.
In the 1960s, he returned to the newly independent Algeria, where he taught film directing.

Cano was a renowned but controversial English teacher who taught in modern education and the Imperial School, claiming to have had 9000 students at the peak of his career.
In his notes, he used some words that his parents thought were rude, and he was also said to have spoken dirty words in class.
Modern Education Group accused him of posting large ads on buses without authorization and lying about being the chief English teacher.
He was also accused of copyright infringement, but was not prosecuted.
One student he taught said that the teacher used slang in class and taught dating skills in notes, like a student's friend".
Over the past three decades, China has developed a market economy despite being still a communist country at the official level.
The first economic reform was carried out under the leadership of Liu Xiaobo.
Since then, China's economy has grown 90 times.
Last year, China's automobile exports surpassed Germany for the first time and surpassed the United States to become the largest market for automobile exports.
China's GDP is likely to surpass that of the United States in 20 years.
Tropical Storm Hurricane Daniels formed in the eastern Atlantic, the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season.
The storm was located about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, and had maximum sustained winds of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predicted that Daniel would strengthen into a major hurricane by Wednesday.
Given the storm's relatively recent landfall, it is still difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in Zagreb, Croatia, Bobek became famous for his time with the Belgrade Guerrilla Football Club.
He joined the team in 1945 and played until 1958.
During his time with the team, he made 468 appearances and scored 403 goals.
Nobody has scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995, he was named the best player in the history of the Guerrilla.

The accident left Zayed unharmed.
On the global financial situation, Sappartro continued: "The financial system is part of the economy, a key part.
The financial crisis has been going on for a year, the most severe in the last two months, and I think the financial markets are starting to recover now.
Naked News announced last week that it would launch three new broadcast programs to significantly increase its international language licensing in news coverage.
The global organization has reported in English and Japanese and is currently launching programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, network and mobile devices.
Luckily, nothing happened to me, but I saw a terrible scene where people tried to break the window and escape.
The people used chairs to knock on glass, but the windows were not broken.
The survivor, Franzische Kowal, said: "The monkey finally broke a piece of glass and they started running out the window".
Stars emit light and heat, which is due to the fusion of hydrogen atoms to form heavier elements.
Scientists are currently working on building a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
However, this is a difficult problem to solve. It will take many years before we see a practical fusion reactor built.
The steel needle can float on the water surface due to the surface tension.
The surface tension is caused by the strong attraction between water molecules on the surface, which is greater than the attraction between water molecules and air molecules above.
Water molecules form an invisible outer layer on the surface of water that allows a needle to float on the surface.
The blade of modern skating shoes is double-edged, with a hole between the blade and the blade. The blade has better grip on ice (even when tilted).
The blade's bottom is slightly curved, and when the blade is bent to one side, the edges of the blade that come into contact with ice are curved.
In this way, the ice skater can turn. The ice knife is tilted to the right, the ice skater to the right. The ice knife is tilted to the left, the ice skater to the left.
They must remove the excess energy from light to restore it to its previous energy level.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a fluorescent particle.
Scientists call this process the radiation-sensitive reaction because atoms are excited by strong light and cause photons to be emitted, while light is also a form of radiation.
The following image shows the situation of the atoms emitting photons. Of course, the photons are actually much smaller than what they look like in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the matter that makes up atoms!
After several hundred hours of use, the filament finally burned and the lamp was not lit.
The light bulb is then replaced.
First, it is necessary to turn off the switch on the lighting lamps or cut the cable connection.
This is because when a part of the bulb is connected to the plug, when you touch the plug inside or the metal base of the bulb, electricity flows into the plug (the connection point of the bulb's metal base) causing you to be severely electrocuted.
The heart is the main organ of the circulatory system, responsible for the blood supply.
Blood flows from the heart through a tube called the arteries, and then back to the heart through a tube called the veins. The smallest of these is called the capillaries.
The teeth of the Triangles not only bite the leaves but also the very hard branches and roots of trees.
Some scientists believe that the dragon feeds on suet, a plant common in the Late Bronze Age.
The plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of spiky leaves like nails.
Before eating the stems, the dragon triangles the leaves with its powerful mouth.
Other scientists believe that these plants are poisonous, so it is unlikely that dinosaurs will eat them, even if the trees and other animals such as the monkeys (the descendants of dinosaurs) can now eat the poisonous leaves or fruits.
If you were standing on the surface of a wooden vehicle, your weight would be lighter than on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth weighs about 36 pounds (16 kg) on a wooden board. So gravity naturally produces less gravity for you.
The sun is not as flat as the earth. The entire sun is made up of gas, fire and plasma.
The thinner the gas the further away from the center of the sun.
The outer layer of the sun we see is called the globular layer, which means the globular layer of the sun.
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe the celestial body and discovered that Venus had a phase consistent with the Moon.
The change occurred because Venus (or the Moon) was only illuminated on one side of the Sun. The change in Venus supported Copernicus' theory that the planet orbits the Sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a Venus Sun.
After the reconquest of the Danish-French area (Danelaw), England experienced a long period of peace.
However, in 991, Eszterlade faced the largest Viking fleet after the Gusslum fleet a century earlier.
The fleet was led by Olaf Trigvason, a Norwegian who wanted to take Norway back from Denmark.
After an initial military defeat, Eslerred finally reached an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to regain the throne, but without success.
The Han alphabet is the only one specifically invented for everyday use, and was invented during the reign of Emperor Seong in 1444.
King Seong-sook, the fourth monarch of the Korean dynasty, is one of the most revered monarchs.
He originally named the Korean alphabet pronunciation chart as the Song Song Song Song Song, which means "longing" for teaching people to pronounce correctly.
There are many theories about the origin of the Yiddish language. One of them is that the Arian people migrated from the West to India and brought their language here.
The language is an ancient language that is similar to Latin in Europe.
The earliest known books in the world were written in the Cantonese language. After the completion of the Cantonese language, Cantonese gradually disappeared due to the hierarchy.
The language is a highly sophisticated language and is the origin of many modern Indian languages, as is Latin, which is the origin of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the end of the war against France, Germany began preparations for the invasion of the British Isles.
The German code for this attack was Operation Sea Lion. The British army lost most of its heavy weapons and supplies when it withdrew from Dunkirk, and suffered heavy casualties.
The Royal Navy was much stronger than the German Kriegsmarine, which could destroy any invading fleet across the English Channel.
However, few Royal Navy ships were stationed near the potential invasion route, as the Navy commanders feared they would be sunk by German airstrikes.
Let's first explain the plans of Italy. Italy is basically a small brotherhood of Germany and Japan.
The country's army and navy were both weaker, although they built four new ships shortly before the war began.
Italy's main objective was to conquer African countries. To capture them, they needed an army base so that the army could cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
The British had to withdraw their bases and ships from Egypt. Other than these actions, the Italian warships should have had no action.
Now let's look at Japan. Like Britain, Japan is an island nation.
Submarines are vessels designed to navigate underwater and stay longer underwater.
Submarines were used during both World War I and World War II. At that time they were slow and had very limited range.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly sailed on the surface, but as radar progressed and accuracy improved, the submarines were forced to dive underwater to avoid detection.
German submarines are known as U-boats. The Germans are very good at navigating and operating submarines.
The Germans were successful in submarine operations, and they were not able to handle large numbers of submarines after the war.
King Tutankhamun, sometimes known as the King of Tutankhamun or the King of the Juveniles, was one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt in modern times.
Interestingly, he was not considered a figure of great importance in antiquity and was not recorded in most ancient kings' lists.
However, his tomb was discovered in 1922 and made him famous. Although many of the tombs in the past were stolen, the tomb was almost intact.
Most of the Tutankhamun's burial goods are well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare gems.
The invention of the radial wheel made the Assyrian chariot lighter, faster, and easier to ride than soldiers and other chariots.
They fired arrows from deadly crossbows that could penetrate enemy armor. The first cavalry was used by the Assyrians around 1000 BC.
The Assyrian cavalry was an army that fought on horseback. As the Assyrian cavalry was not yet invented, it was only possible to fight on bright horses.
We know that many Greek politicians, scientists and artists - perhaps the most famous in Greek culture - were the legendary blind poet Homer, who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature: the Pioliae and the Oedipus.
Sophocles and Aristophanes remain popular playwrights, and their plays are considered among the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek was the mathematician Pythagoras, best known for his famous theorem about the angular relations of right triangles.
There are different definitions of Hindi as a language. It is estimated that Hindi is the second to fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers depends on whether the closely related dialects are included.
It is estimated that the number of people who speak the language ranges from 340 million to 500 million, while the number of people who understand the language reaches 800 million.
Hindi and Urdu have similar vocabulary, but different spelling; in everyday conversation, the two languages can often communicate with each other.
After the 15th century, the north of Estonia was heavily influenced by German culture.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to their people, so they invented the written language of Estonia.
It is a German alphabet that adds a letter /õ.
Over time, many foreign words in German were merged with the original vocabulary. This was the beginning of the Enlightenment movement.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne would be directly enlisted after completing his education.
However, Charles attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, obtaining a 2:2 degree.
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to receive a degree.
Turkey is located in parts of Europe (east of the Balkan Peninsula, in the region of Thrace or Rumily) and covers 3% of its land area.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 kilometres (500 mi) wide, roughly rectangular.
Turkey has a land area of 783,562 km2 (including lakes) of which 755,688 km2 (291,773 sq mi) are in Southwest Asia, 23,764 km2 (9174 sq mi) are in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world by land area, about the same as the combined area of France and the United Kingdom.
Turkey has three seas: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg is a historic city, but it was not until 1839 that it became an independent nation.
Some parts of present-day Belgium were formerly part of Luxembourg, but were ceded to Belgium after the Belgian Revolution of the 1930s.
Luxembourg has tried to become a neutral country, but it was occupied by Germany in both World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of what is now known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined fortress and Buddhist temple located in the upper part of the Paro district in the village of Vander.
It is said that the fort was built by Zhabdrung nawang Namgyel in 1649 to commemorate his victory over the Tibetan Mongol army.
In 1951, a fire left only a few remains of Dukay Castle, such as the statue of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fort was maintained and protected, becoming one of Bhutan's most popular attractions.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was torn between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thai invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and destroyed the Golden Gate in 1772.
In the last years of the 18th century, Vietnamese invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of the workers are non-formal economic practitioners.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans are in the service sector, nearly a quarter are in industry and a fifth are in agriculture.
Venezuela is a net oil exporter, and despite only one percent of the population working in the oil industry, the oil industry remains an important industry in the country.
In the early days of the country's independence, the Singapore Botanical Garden used its expertise to help the island become a tropical cityscape.
In 1981, the Choi Jingwei-lan was chosen as the national flower of the country. It is a hybrid variety of oranges.
Every year, after the beginning of October, about 1.5 million herbivores travel from the northern mountain ranges across the Mara River to the rain-filled southern plains.
Then, after the rainy season in about April, they returned from the west to the north and crossed the Mara River again.
Serengeti includes Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Nature Reserve in Tanzania, Maswa Wildlife Reserve and Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning how to create interactive media requires traditional skills and the tools to master in interactive courses (storyboarding, audio and video editing, storyboard design, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to reassess assumptions about media production and learn nonlinear thinking.
Interactive design requires that the components of a project are interconnected, but can also exist as an independent entity.
The disadvantage of focusing lenses is that the focal length complexity and number of lens elements required to achieve a certain focal range is much greater than the number of focusing lenses.
This is no longer a problem as lens manufacturers reach higher standards in lens production.
This allows the focused lens to take pictures that match the quality of the fixed-focus lens.
Another disadvantage of focusing lenses is that the maximum focal length of the lens (speed) is usually smaller.
This makes it difficult to use in low light conditions in the absence of flashing lights.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie to DVD format is over-scanning.
Most TV shows are produced for entertainment.
For this reason, the edges of the images you see on TV, including the top, bottom and sides, are cut off.
This is done to ensure that images can cover the entire screen. This is called a screening scan.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, the edges are likely to be cut off, and if the subtitles in the video are too close to the bottom, the subtitles will be incomplete.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination of people, bringing to mind the images of the spear behind the horse, the feast and the spirit of King Arthur's knighthood.
Even in the ruins of a thousand years, people can easily recall the sounds and smells of wars that have long since passed away, can almost hear the clashes of horses on rocks, and can smell the breath of fear that comes from the crater.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
As a typical building of the period, the castle of Muxloe was a real castle rather than a fortified house.
Its large glass windows and thin walls could not withstand a firm attack for long.
The country was relatively peaceful when Lord Hastings began building the castle in the 15th century, only to defend a small group of roaming looters.
The balance of power is a system of European states seeking to maintain the sovereignty of all European countries.
The idea is that all European countries must try to prevent a country/region from becoming strong on its own, and that governments often change allies to maintain balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession marked the first war to center on the balance of power.
This marked a significant change as the great powers of Europe would no longer be able to justify religious warfare. Thus, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be labeled a religious war.
On July 21, 356 B.C., the act of Herostratus's burning of the temple in Ephesus led to the destruction of the goddess Artemis.
According to the story, the man is willing to go at any cost. Angry Ephesians declare the name of Black Rostatus (Herostratus) to be a hard book.
The Greek historian Strabo later mentioned the name, which is the name we know today. The temple was destroyed on the night of Alexander the Great's birth.
The temple was originally proposed by Alexander the Great, but was rejected. After Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Make sure your hands are as relaxed as possible while still being able to tap all the notes correctly and try not to do too many unrelated moves.
This will save you as much energy as possible. Remember, you don't have to push the keys as hard to raise the volume as you do on a piano.
To increase the volume of the organ, the windbox can be pulled with more force or at a faster speed.
The pursuit of the ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God, is to communicate, identify with, or achieve consciousness.
The believers seek a direct experience, intuition, or insight into the divine reality/deity or gods.
Followers pursue a lifestyle or practice designed to nurture these experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship because it emphasizes the direct experience of individual states of consciousness, especially those states of peace, insight, happiness, or even joyfulness.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in Punjab in the 15th century, with internal sectarian divisions derived from Hindu traditions.
Sikhs believe that they believe in a religion different from Hinduism, although they acknowledge that Sikhism is derived from Hinduism and includes Hindu traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which means Guru in Punjabi. Gurma is a fundamental part of all Indian religions, but is particularly prominent among Sikhs and has become the core of Sikh belief.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539), followed by nine other gurus.
However, Khrushchev's commitment was put to the test in June 1956, when riots by Polish workers protesting food shortages and wage cuts turned into protests against the communist system itself.
Although the tank was eventually restored, Khrushchev made concessions to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indian River Valley civilization is a Bronze Age civilization in the northwestern Indian subcontinent, covering most of modern-day Pakistan, as well as parts of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
The Indian River Basin was a thriving civilization, hence its name.
Although some scholars speculate that the civilization was also present in the now-arid Saraswati basin, it is not appropriate to call it the Indian-Sarawaswati River civilization, although some have called it the Jharkhand civilization after the first site excavated in the area in the 1920s.
The military state of the Roman Empire promoted the progress and development of medicine.
The emperor Augustus began recruiting doctors and even formed the first Roman medical team for postwar medical use.
Surgeons are familiar with a variety of sedatives, including morphine extracted from the seeds of the plant and tetanus extracted from the seeds of the plant.
In addition to using blood-staining bands and arterial arteries to block blood flow, they have been skilled in rescuing patients with bad epilepsy through amputation.
In the course of centuries, the Roman Empire achieved great results in the field of medicine, which constituted much of the knowledge we know today.
The rules of the pure-ground folding, which are restricted to one folding only, do not allow more complex movements like reverse folding, and all folding positions must be simple.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help paper craftsmen with little experience or poor hand skills.
Children are aware of racial and racial stereotypes from a young age, and these stereotypes influence their behavior.
For example, if people modelly think that a minority child is not performing well in school, they often do poorly in school once they learn the model theory about their ethnicity.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States, with 54 million registered accounts.
These sites have received a lot of attention, especially in the field of education.
These sites also have benefits, such as the ability to easily create a class page with blog, video, photo, and other content.
The website is accessible by providing a single address. This makes it easier to remember and easier to enter for students who do not have difficulty with keyboards or spelling.
It can be customized to be read, and can use more or less of the color as needed.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a neurological syndrome in which three typical limiting symptoms are impulse, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and excessive energy.
This is not a lack of learning ability, but a learning disability; it affects 3 to 5% of all children in the United States, and may reach 2 million people.
Children with ADHD have difficulty concentrating on tasks, such as homework, but they can concentrate on doing things they like to do, such as playing games, watching favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without a scorecard.
These children often get into a lot of trouble because normal methods do not stimulate their brains, and in order to stimulate their brains, they engage in dangerous behavior, fight, challenge authority.
Attention deficit disorder (ADD) affects the relationship between children with ADHD and their peers because other children cannot understand why they behave, spell, or mature differently.
When the ability to acquire knowledge and to learn changes as described above, the basic rate of acquiring knowledge also changes accordingly.
The way to get information is different. Stress is no longer present in personal memories, but the ability to remember text is becoming more important.
The Renaissance fundamentally changed the way learning and knowledge spread.
The difference between primitive humans and other primates is that they no longer move their bodies with their hands, carrying their weight, and roaming the woods.
The similar size and length of the chimpanzee's hands and feet reflect the fact that the hands are used to carry weight when walking on their backs.
Human hands are shorter than feet, and the bones of the ankle are straight.
The fossils of the hand between 2 and 3 million years ago have been transformed from a mobile to a hand-operated manner.
Some people believe that frequent artificial induction and lucid dreams can make people exhausted.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that clear dreams prolong the time interval between fast-moving states.
The shorter the REM period each night, the less often the body is able to restore its mood and sleep well, and the more problems can arise.
It's as exhausting as waking up to watch TV every 22 or 30 minutes.
The effect depends on how often your brain is sleeping awake each night.
The situation in North Africa was almost unimpressive from the start. On 10 June 1940, less than a week after Italy declared war, the British 11th Cavalry captured Fort Capizzo in Libya.
In a raid in eastern Bastia, the British captured General Latousi, the commander of the Italian 10th Army of Engineers.
On 28 June, the successor to the Libyan governor, Marshal Italo Balbo, was shot dead by friendly forces on the landing at Tobruk.
Modern fencing is divided into several levels: the initial level of university students, the professional and Olympic athletics.
The game is played in a duel format, where one fighter is in charge of the other fighter.
Golf is a sport in which players use a ball to hit a hole in the ground.
The regular season consists of 18 holes, usually starting with the first hole of the pitch and ending with the 18th hole.
The player who finishes the game with the fewest hits or batting average wins.
The competition was held on grassland, where the grass around the hole was cut shorter and called the fruit grass.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism, and what most people think of when they think of tourism: leisure tourism.
It refers to people going to a place that is completely different from their daily lives to relax and have fun.
The beaches, theme parks and campgrounds are often the most visited places for leisure tourists.
If a person visits a particular place for the purpose of learning about its history and culture, this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Visitors may visit different landmarks in a particular country or may focus on one area.
The colony was also in a state of emergency and the colony was in a state of emergency.
The supporting forces at the front line were the 200-man 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments, commanded by Colonel John Stack and Colonel James Reid (later to become a general).
Stark's soldiers were stationed at the defensive fence along the northern end of the colonial post.
As the tide receded, a mysterious river that flowed along the northeastern side of the peninsula opened a gap, and they quickly built a short stone wall that extended the wall to the small beach at the northern end of the peninsula.
Gridley or Stark placed a log 100 feet (30 m) in front of the dam and ordered no fire before the regular army passed.
The US plans to launch a co-invasion from three different directions.
General John Cadwade will launch an offensive against the British garrison at the town of Bodon, diverting the enemy's attention to block any reinforcements.
General James Ewing led 700 militiamen to the Trenton Crossing, capturing the bridge over Aspen Bay, blocking the enemy's escape route.
The main force of 2,400 men will cross the river 9 miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, one led by Greene and one led by Sullivan, to launch an attack before dawn.
The speed of the race has become less important, and endurance has become an absolute factor.
Of course, to be a top half-mile runner (running in two minutes) you have to be fast enough and have endurance at all costs.
In the winter, you can practice cross-country running, along with upper-body fitness, to be well prepared for the running season.
Proper nutritional practices alone are not enough to produce excellent performance, but they can significantly affect the overall health of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, maintaining a habit of effectively supplementing with water, and understanding all aspects of the proper use of nutritional supplements can help athletes improve performance and increase their enjoyment of exercise.
Mid-range running is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, participants have a lot of misconceptions about the few pieces of equipment needed.
The product can be purchased as needed, but most products have little real impact on performance.
Athletes may think they prefer a product, even though it has no benefits.
Atoms can be considered as one of the basic building blocks of all matter.
According to the simplified Polar model, it is a very complex entity, containing a central atomic nucleus surrounded by electrons, which are somewhat like planets orbiting the Sun. See Figure 1.1.
The atomic nucleus is composed of both neutrons and protons.
Protons carry positive electricity, neutrons carry no electricity. Electrons carry negative electricity.
To inspect the victims, you must first inspect the site to ensure your safety.
When approaching a victim, it is necessary to pay attention to his posture and any unconscious danger signals.
If you want to hurt others, you only make things worse.
Research has found that depression, fear, and disastrous emotions can mediate pain and disability in people with low back pain.
Only those who are concerned about the effects of mental health, rather than the effects of depression and fear, can conditionally exercise regularly on a weekly basis.
People who participate in regular training need more support in their passive perception of pain to help them distinguish between chronic pain and discomfort and normal physical activity.
The ability to see or see depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, the eyes.
The structure of the eye is diverse, and its complexity depends on the needs of the organism.
Different structures have different functions, sensitivity to different wavelengths, and sensitivity. They also require different processing methods to understand inputs and require different amounts of inputs to achieve optimal performance.
Population refers to the collection of specific species of organisms within a specific geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are at the same time on a particular pattern, they are called monotypes.
When individuals exhibit several variants of a particular trait, they are polymorphic.
The development and nesting of the marines are also divided into different stages.
During the migration phase, the army marched at night and camped during the day.
When food is scarce, the herd enters a migration period. At this stage, the herd builds temporary nests that are replaced daily.
The first time the group was seen in the area, the first time it was seen in the area.
The word cell membrane comes from the Latin word cell membrane, meaning a small chamber membrane, and was originally created by microscopists who observed softwood structures.
Cells are the basic unit of all living things, and all living things are made up of one or more cells.
In fact, cells have such a fundamental and critical place in biological research that they are often called the basic units of the cell.
The nervous system maintains a smooth flow of blood by sending nerve impulses throughout the body, thus maintaining balance within the body.
These neurons can be transmitted very quickly to the whole body, keeping the body free from any potential threat of harm.
The area of the hurricane is smaller than other major storms, but can destroy everything along its way.
Tornadoes can uproot trees, tear up the wooden planks on buildings, and throw cars into the sky. Two percent of tornadoes are the strongest, and can last for more than three hours.
These monstrous storms, with winds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph)
For thousands of years, humans have been making and using magnifying glasses.
However, the first true telescope was made in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes use a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear both close and large.
Greed and selfishness are always with us, and the essence of cooperation is that short-term selfishness always brings more benefits when it benefits the majority.
I hope that most people realize that in the long run, working with others is the best option.
Many people dream of one day being able to migrate to other planets and explore other worlds. Some people wonder what the universe is about; others believe that there may be aliens or other life on other planets.
But if this really happens, it probably won't happen again for a long time. These stars are very scattered, with their neighbouring stars trillions of miles apart.
Perhaps one day your grandchildren's descendants will live in an alien world and guess what their ancient ancestors lived like.
Animals are made up of many cells. Animals digest food in their bodies after eating it. Most animals are able to move.
Only animals have brains (but not all animals, like seals, have brains).
And the form of the beast was in every corner of the earth: and they digged under the earth, and floated in the sea, and floated in the air.
Cells are the smallest structural and functional units of any organism.
Cell (cell) is a Latin word derived from the Latin cell, meaning small room.
Looking at the organisms under the microscope, you will see that they are made up of small squares or balls.
The British biologist Robert Hooke used a microscope to see some small squares hidden in the softwoods.
He was the first person to observe the dead cells.
Elements and compounds can change the material in the event of chemical changes.
Gaseous silicon still has the same properties as liquid silicon. Liquid silicon has a higher density, but the molecules are the same.
Another example is water. Compound water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
The molecular structure of the molecule is the same, whether it is gas, liquid or solid.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains unchanged.
Time is around us and influences everything we do, but it is hard to understand.
For thousands of years, time has been the subject of study by religious, philosophical and scientific scholars.
The time we have been through is a series of events from the future to the present and the past.
Time is also the way we compare the length of an event.
You can record the passage of time by observing repeated cyclical events. Cyclical events are regular events that happen over and over again.
Today, we use computers to process images and videos.
Complex animation can be built on computers, and this type of animation is increasingly being used in television and movies.
The recording of music is often done with complex computers and mixed sounds.
For a long time in the 19th and 20th centuries, the first inhabitants of New Zealand were thought to be Maori, who hunted a large bird called the phoenix.
The theory then established the view that the Maori had migrated from Polynesia by boat and captured New Zealand from the Māori to establish an agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Māori are part of the mainland Māori people who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands to develop their own unique culture of noble peace.
There is another tribe in the Chatham Islands, the Maori who migrated from New Zealand.
They call themselves the Moriori people. There have been some minor conflicts, and the Moriori people have finally been exterminated.
People who have been involved for decades have helped us to recognize our strengths and enthusiasm while honestly evaluating difficulties and even failures.
When we listen to others share their personal, family and organizational stories, we gain a valuable knowledge of the past and of some of the people who have had a positive or negative impact on organizational culture.
While understanding history does not mean understanding culture, it can at least help people understand their place in organizational history.
In summing up success and failure, individuals and all participants will have a deeper understanding of the values, mission and motivation of the organization.
In this context, reviewing previous entrepreneurial practices and successes can help to keep people open to new changes and new directions in the local church.
Success stories like this have eased people's fear of change while creating a positive trend for future change.
The convergence of thinking patterns is a technique of solving problems by combining different ideas or fields to find solutions.
This thinking model is focused on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as on separating facts, re-applying existing technologies and gathering information.
The most important factor in this thinking pattern is that there is only one correct answer. You only need to consider two answers, right or wrong.
This thinking model is not associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
This type of thinking has logical thinking, memory, problem solving, and scientific testing.
So far, humans have been the best species to read the minds of others.
This means that we can successfully predict other people's perceptions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge or desires.
Understanding the intentions of others is essential in these capacities. With this ability, we can understand the ambiguity of the questions that physical behavior may express.
For example, if you see someone breaking a car window, you are likely to think that this person is stealing a stranger's car.
If he lost his car keys and tried to open the door to his car, he might have a different opinion.
The magnetic resonance imaging base is a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (working at Harvard University).
In this resonance, magnetic fields and radio waves cause weak radio signals to be emitted by atoms.
In 1970, MD and research scientist Raymond Damadian discovered the basics of using MRI as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was approved, the first patent in the world for the field of nuclear magnetic resonance.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the first full-body hydrogen-based nuclear magnetic resonance imaging scanner, which he called the hydrogen-indestructible ion.
Asynchronous communication gives people time to think about how others react and react.
This allows students to learn at their own pace and control the pace of teaching information.
In addition, there are fewer time restrictions because of the flexibility of working hours.
Students can access information at any time using the Internet and the World Wide Web.
Students can also submit questions to the teacher at any time of the day and can expect a quick response within a reasonable time without having to wait for the next conversation.
The postmodernist approach to learning gives people absolute freedom. There is no one way to learn that is a good way to learn.
In fact, nothing requires special learning. Learning behaviour occurs when the learner experiences knowledge and presents it.
This is evident in all the experiences we have had with DIY, presenting information and learning as the main content of TV shows.
Many of us find that the TV shows we watch tell us about a process or experience, but we never participate in or apply that knowledge.
We will never make major repairs to cars, build no fountains in the backyard, visit ancient sites in Peru, or transform our neighbors' houses.
Thanks to the submarine cable and broadband satellites connected to Europe, the Greenland network connects 93% of the population to the Internet.
Your hotel or landlord (if you live in a hostel or private home) may have a computer with wifi or internet access.
As mentioned above, while the term "Esquima" is still accepted in the United States, many non-Americans in the Arctic region, especially for Canadians, consider the term to be of a derogatory meaning.
Although you may have heard the term used by the locals in Greenland, foreigners should avoid using it.
In Canada, the indigenous people of Greenland call themselves Inuit, and in Greenland they call themselves Kalaalleq (plural Kalaallit), meaning "the Greenlander's coat of arms".
In Greenland, the crime and malicious behavior against foreigners is almost unknown in general. Even in towns, there are no high crime rates.
The cold may be the only real danger facing those who are not prepared.
If you visit Greenland during the cold season (remember that the colder you go north), you must bring enough warm clothes.
Long summer days can lead to sleep deprivation and related health problems.
In the summer, you should also pay attention to the northern European mosquitoes. Although they do not spread any disease, they can make you feel uncomfortable.

For many American families, going to Disneyland to play is a great activity.
This typical fun-filled process includes flying to Orlando International Airport, taking a bus to the Disney Park Hotel, and spending about a week at Disney before returning home.
There are countless Disney games, but for most people, going to Disneyland is what it means.
Many tickets sold on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day passes.
While this is a common practice, Disney prohibits it: tickets are non-transferable.
A permit to camp in the country is required to camp below the edge of the Grand Canyon.
In order to protect the Grand Canyon, limited licensing is available. Licenses are issued on the first day of the month, four months in advance, according to the launch month.
Therefore, if the launch date is May, the field camping permit will be issued on January 1.
The most popular areas, such as Bright Angel campgrounds near the Phantom Ranch, are usually filled with reservations on the first day of opening.
For unattended visits, the number of reservations is limited and permits are issued on a first-come, first-served basis.
South Africa is ideal for driving, where visitors can enjoy all the beauty of the region and get to places other than the usual tourist routes.
While a regular car can do this with careful planning, it is strongly recommended to use a four-wheel drive vehicle, and in many places only large-axis four-wheel drive vehicles can pass through.
During the planning phase, please remember that while South Africa is stable, not all neighbouring countries are.
Visa requirements and fees vary by country/region and will be affected by your nationality.
Each country/region has specific laws that provide for the necessity of emergency items in vehicles.
Victoria Falls is a small town in western Zimbabwe, bordering with Livingston, Zambia, near Botswana.
The town is close to the waterfall, which is the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers plenty of opportunities for explorers and visitors to stay for a long time.
During the rainy season (November to March), the water level is higher and the waterfall is more pronounced.
If you cross the bridge or walk along the dirt path near the falls, you will surely get wet.
On the other hand, the water is so large that the eyes are blocked by the water and the waterfall is not visible.
Tutankhamun Cemetery (KV62) KV62 is perhaps the most famous burial ground in the valley. Howard Carter discovered the young king's near-complete royal tomb in 1922.
But compared to most other royal tombs, Tutankhamun is hardly worth a visit because of its smaller size and flat decorations.
If anyone wanted to see the mummy removed from the coffin and it was damaged, they would be very disappointed, because only the head and shoulders of the mummy were visible.
The vast wealth in ancient tombs is no longer in the tombs, but is transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
The tourist is not allowed to travel to the country for a long time.
The Grom temple is located 12 kilometers southwest of the city of Phnom Penh. The temple was built during the reign of King Yeong-tung of the 9th century.

The temple is accessible by a ticket to the temple, so don't forget to bring your passport when you go to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, although most other countries/regions and the United Nations do not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
The ancient city, located on the Judean Hills, has a fascinating history dating back thousands of years.
The city is the holy place of the three major religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and is a true spiritual, religious and cultural center.
The religious significance of Jerusalem (especially many sites in the Old City) makes it one of Israel's major tourist destinations.
Jerusalem is not only rich in historical, archaeological and cultural sites, but also a vibrant, bustling shopping center, cafe and restaurant.
Ecuador: Cuban citizens must enter Ecuador after receiving an invitation to travel through an international airport or border port.
The letter must be approved by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and meet certain requirements.
These requirements are designed to achieve a smooth migration between the two countries.
Cuban citizens holding a U.S. green card should visit the Ecuadorian consulate for exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be at least 6 months old from the date of departure and a return/conference ticket is required to prove your stay.
Travel is cheaper for larger groups. If you are alone or only with a friend, you can try to get to know others and form a group of four to six people to get a more favorable per capita price.
However, there is also a bit of concern, as tourists are often transported and transported to fill their cars.
This is actually more like a scam to make people think they have to pay more money.
The hill, which rises above the northern end of Machu Picchu, is often the background for many site photos.
From below, it looks a little scary and a steep and difficult climb, but most people in good physical condition should be able to do it in 45 minutes.
Most of the paths are paved with stone steps; steel cables are used as supporting arms in the steeper parts.
It is said that breathing is a dangerous condition, and caution should be exercised in wet areas, especially when the weather is wet.
The first time the man was in the cave, he had to go through a very low, very narrow hole near the top.
The best transportation to visit the Galapagos Islands is by boat. Charles Darwin visited the island by boat in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships regularly return to and from Galapagos Islands waters, with a capacity of 8 to 100 people.
Most people book their seats early, as the boats are usually full during the peak season.
Make sure that the agent you booked is a Galapagos Islands expert with extensive knowledge of various ships.
This ensures that your particular interests and/or constraints are matched to the vessels that best suit them.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was ruled by the Incas, while the indigenous Araucanians (Araucanians) (Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche were one of the last independent Native American tribes, and only after Chile's independence were they completely brought under the rule of the Spanish system of rulers.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (with Spain's central government not functioning normally for years during the Napoleonic Wars), it was not until 1818 that it achieved a decisive victory over Spain.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country located in the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which is divided between the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
In addition to its white sands and mountainous landscapes, the country is home to the oldest European-style city in the Americas, and is now part of the city of San Domingo.

Some of the hotels' origins date back to the golden age of steam trains and ocean liners: before World War II, in the 19th or early 20th century.
These hotels were the resting places of the rich and famous at the time, and often had high-end restaurants and nightlife.
The city is also characterized by its elegant flavor, which is characterized by the lack of traditional equipment, the lack of the latest facilities and the sense of timing.
Although they are usually privately owned, they sometimes provide accommodation for visiting heads of state and other politicians.
A traveler who is a cyclist may consider traveling the world by plane and staying in many hotels like this one.

Over the years, many different film formats have been used. The standard 35mm film (36x24mm film) is the most common.
The film can usually be easily refilled with the finished film, and the resolution is approximately the same as the current digital reverse camera.
Some medium-sized cameras use 6x6cm frames, more precisely, 56x56mm film.
In this way, the resolution is almost four times that of the 35 mm bottom (3136 mm2 vs. 864).
For photographers, wildlife is one of the most difficult objects to photograph. Good luck, patience, experience, excellent equipment, and a lack of it.

This may require a form to be filled out at the local police station or a migration office.
In many countries with such laws, local hotels can handle registration procedures (please be clear).
In other cases, only those who live outside the tourist accommodation facilities need to register. However, the law is very vague, so you should know in advance.
Architecture is the study of architectural design and construction. The architecture of a place is often itself a tourist attraction.

Although this is by no means a modern phenomenon, most people will probably associate it with the use of paint to destroy public and private property by young people.
However, there are now mature graffiti artists, graffiti activities and the legal use of graffiti walls. Graffiti paintings created in this context are often more like works of art than hard to identify labels.
Throwing the spinning wheel is a popular skill for many tourists who want to learn.
If you want to learn how to fly a turtle and let it fly out and fly back in your hand, use a suitable turtle that can fly back.

Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth, surrounded by the Antarctic.
Travel costs are high, physical qualifications are high, and travel is only possible during the summer months of November to February, with tourist destinations mainly limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
In the summer, over forty bases here will accommodate thousands of staff, most of whom are stationed in the area; a small number stay during the winter.
Antarctica is a barren plateau covered by 2-3 km of ice.
Occasionally, special air travel crews will travel inland, participate in mountaineering activities, or travel to large bases in the Arctic.
The South Pole Traverse (or Highway) starts at McMurdo Station in the Ross Sea and runs for 1,600 km.
The snow was pressed, the gaps were filled, and the flags were marked. Only special tractors and snowmen with fuel and supplies were allowed to pass through.
The car was not very flexible, so it had to go around the Antarctic Mountains and turn a long arch to reach the plateau.
The most common cause of accidents in winter is wet road and pavement, especially stairs.
You need at least the right shoes under your shoes. It is usually smooth to walk in the snow in summer shoes, and even some winter shoes are not enough.
The shoe should be deep enough, at 5 mm (1.5 inches) or more; the material should be soft enough under low temperatures.
Some boots have shoe nails; there are also extensions designed for wet slippery roads with shoe nails, which are suitable for most shoes and boots, and can be fitted on the shoe trunk or at the same time on the shoe trunk and sole.
The foot should be low and wide. On the road, sandstone or salt grains are often sprinkled with lime to increase friction.
Snowfall is not uncommon; snowfall is limited in size and the excess snow falls as a snowstorm.
The problem is that snow is very sticky. It requires some triggers to make snow, and a little snowfall may trigger other snowfalls.
Sometimes the initial trigger is due to the sun warming the snow, sometimes due to more snowfall, sometimes due to other natural events, but the more common causes are often human factors.
Tornadoes are a type of rotating air flow column with extremely low air pressure that can inhale the air around it upwards and inwards.
Tornadoes produce strong winds (often 100-200 miles per hour) that can throw heavy objects into the air and wrap them around moving forward.
At the beginning, the funnel-shaped clouds stretched downward from the thunder clouds and turned into tornadoes when they touched the ground.
Personal VPNs (Virtual Dedicated Networks) are an excellent tool for avoiding political censorship and commercial IP geographic filtering.
They are better than web agents because they redirect all Internet traffic, not just the content of the hypertext protocol (http).
They usually provide higher bandwidth and better quality services. They are encrypted and harder to monitor.
Media companies lie to cover up their purpose, claiming that this is to prevent piracy.
In fact, the area code has no effect on illegal copying; a step-by-step copy of the disc can be played smoothly on any device that can play the original disc.
The real goal is to get these companies to better control their markets; it's all about making money.
Since calls are routed over the Internet, you do not need to use the phone company in your area of residence or travel.
Whether you have a local number in your community is not required; you can get a satellite internet connection in the wilds of Alaska, and then choose a number that shows you are in sunny Arizona.
Many times, you have to buy a number that can be used globally to receive calls from the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
Real-time text translation applications: An application that can automatically convert entire text from one language to another.
Some such applications even allow users to translate foreign text by using their smartphones to mark or other objects in the real world.
Translation engines have improved significantly, and now often provide more or less correct translations (and more often there is little nonsense), but it is worth noting that they can still be completely wrong.
One of the most prominent such applications is Google Translate. It can be translated offline after downloading the language data required.
Using GPS navigation apps on smartphones may be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when traveling abroad.
It's a much safer way to buy a map with GPS or an independent GPS device or rent one from a car rental company.
If your phone is not connected to data or not in service, it may be limited in performance or unable to use the phone.
Every street has a row of stunning prepaid phone cards that can be used for both public and ordinary pay phones.
Although most phone cards are suitable for calling anywhere, some cards have special advantages when calling in certain countries.
These services are usually available by dialing a telephone number, which is available for free on most phones.
The rules of regular photography also apply to video, and possibly even more.
If you don't even allow photography, you don't want to make videos.
If you are using a drone, please confirm in advance what you can shoot and what licenses or additional licenses are required.
Operating drones near airports or crowded places is a fool's errand, even if it's not illegal in your area.
Today, few people do not search and compare prices first and book tickets directly through airlines.
Sometimes, the same flight may be priced very differently on different information gathering websites, and it is advantageous to compare search results before booking while also looking at the airline's own website.
Although short-term visits to certain countries do not require a visa for tourism or business, travel for international students is usually longer than for leisure tourists.
In general, a visa is required for longer periods of stay abroad.
Student visas usually have different requirements and application procedures than ordinary tourist or business visas.
In most countries, you need an admission notice from the school you want to attend and proof that you have at least the funds needed for your first year of study.
Consult the school and the Immigration Office of the country where you wish to study for details.
Unless you are a diplomat, you are generally required to pay income tax to your country/region for work abroad.
The structure of income tax varies from country to country, and the tax rate and tax rate levels vary widely.
Some federal states, such as the United States and Canada, impose federal and local income taxes, so rates and grades may vary by region.
It is not usually necessary to carry out an entry check or simply walk-in form when returning home, but crossing customs can be a problem.
Ensure that you know what you can and cannot carry and declare any objects that go beyond the law.
The easiest way to start travel writing is to hone your skills on a senior travel blog site.
After you get acquainted with online editing and editing, you can create your own website.
Volunteering on a journey is a different and better way to travel, but it's not just about giving.
Living abroad and volunteering is a great way to learn about different cultures, meet new people, learn about yourself, exercise your right judgment, and even gain new skills.
This is also a good way to save money and spend more time in a place because many volunteers work to provide lodging and some work with less pay.
The Vikings used the Russian waterways to reach the Black and Riyadh Seas. Some of these routes are still open today. It is difficult to verify whether special permits are required, which can be difficult to apply for.
The Strait of White Rose is connected by Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg to the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea, most of which are connected by rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga River, so it is possible to reach it from the Caspian Sea via Russia.
Please be assured that everything will be fine once you arrive at the dock. You will meet other people to take the boat and they will share information with you.
Basically, you can post a notice telling others you can help, come and go around the pier, contact people cleaning yachts or sailors in the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will know you and they will tell you which boat you are looking for someone.
You must be careful in choosing the airline that flies the regular passengers from the alliance.
While you may think it's natural for members of which airline to join the most frequent flights, you should know that the benefits offered by airlines are often different and that other airlines in the same league may get more regular passenger points.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their services to Africa, providing routes to many major cities in Africa and offering more competitive prices than other European airlines.
As of 2014, Turkish Airlines has reached 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have plenty of time to travel, check out the total fare for Africa and the global fare comparison.
For all areas outside Africa, don't forget to add additional visa fees, exit taxes, ground transportation and more.
If you want to fly around the world in the Southern Hemisphere, there are very few options for flights and destinations, as there are few transatlantic routes.
The Southern Hemisphere has no airline that can cross all three oceans (the Skyline has no trans-ocean route).
However, the Star Alliance covers all routes worldwide except for the southeastern Pacific route from Santiago, Chile to Tahiti, which is operated by LATAM, a South American Airlines subsidiary of NEU.
If you don't want to cross the South Pacific and the west coast of South America, there is no other option besides this flight.
In 1994, the Armenian community of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan started a war against the Azerbaijanis.
A new republic was born with the support of Armenia. However, it was not officially recognized by any country (including Armenia).
Diplomatic disputes in the region continue to worsen relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The canal district (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is a famous 17th-century old town district around Binnenstad in Amsterdam.
The entire region is a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its unique cultural and historical value, and the property value in the region is among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, originally called Cinque Terre, is a five-acre area of land comprising five small coastal villages in the Liguria region of Italy: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso.
They are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
For centuries, people have built terraced terraces on rough terrain, which stretch to the cliff wall overlooking the sea.
Part of its charm is the lack of obvious business development. The villages are connected by roads, trains and boats, and drivers cannot reach them from outside.
The French language used in Belgium and Switzerland is quite similar to French, but it is somewhat different.
Specifically, the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland have some subtle peculiarities in the digital system, and in contrast to the French spoken, some words are spoken slightly differently.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss learn standard French in school, so they can understand it even if you use the standard French measurement system.
In many parts of the world, a wave is a friendly expression that means "hello".
However, in Malaysia, at least in rural areas, the gesture is similar to the way the finger is moved to the body in some Western countries, to indicate a curve, and is used only to express this meaning.
Similarly, British tourists in Spain may mistakenly think that this is a return gesture if the waving is directed to the waving person himself (rather than the waving person).
Assisted language is the creation of artificial languages or constructed languages to facilitate communication between non-linguistic groups.
They differ from the common language. A common language is a natural or gradual language that, for various reasons, becomes the primary means of communication between users of other languages.
During the hottest part of the day, travelers can experience the illusion of the Shanghai Market Tower being formed by water (or something else).
Travelers chasing the seafront towers can be dangerous, as they waste their precious energy and remaining water.
Even the hottest deserts can get extremely cold at night. Without warm clothes, low body temperature is a real risk.
If you decide to walk through the rainforest, especially in summer, you need to be careful with mosquitoes.
If you are driving through subtropical rainforests, the few seconds you enter the car when the door opens are enough to get mosquitoes to come into the car with you.
Avian influenza, or more formally known as the avian influenza pandemic, can infect both birds and mammals.
There are fewer than 1,000 reported cases of human avian influenza, but some cases are fatal.
Most cases are from people who have had contact with poultry, but there is a risk for bird watchers.
The typical landscape of Norway is the steep canyon and valley that suddenly become a high, more or less unstable plateau.
These plateaus are often called the "vidde plains", which means a wide, open, tree-free area, a region without a plateau.
In Rokan and Agder, they are known as the "hei-shins", meaning desert without trees, usually full of rocks.
Glaciers are not stable and flow from the mountains. This can lead to cracks and ice crevices, which may be covered by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of the ice holes could collapse, and the cracks could close.
On the edge of the glacier, huge ice sheets will loosen, fall, and perhaps jump or roll further away from the edge.
The tourist season of summer destinations in the mountains is usually in the summer of India.
However, winter has a different beauty and charm, and many mountain summer resorts are well served by snow. These places offer activities such as skiing and skating.
Only a handful of airlines offered tickets for the dead, which was slightly cheaper than a temporary trip to a funeral.
Airlines offering such tickets include Canadian Airlines, DAMA, German Hansa Airlines (for flights departing from the United States or Canada) and Seagate Airlines.
In any case, you must call the airline directly to book your tickets.

On Monday, the Permanent Secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature of the Swedish Academy, Sarah Daniels, announced to the public in a program on Swedish Radio that the committee had abandoned the attempt to contact Bob Dylan, who was awarded the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature, because it could not contact him directly.
Daniels said: "We are still in the military. I called and emailed the best partners in his relationship and they responded very friendly.
Earlier, Ring CEO Jamie Siminoff said that he had not heard the doorbell ringing in his garage studio since the company was founded.
He said he had created a WiFi threshold.
Seminoff said that the company's sales increased after he appeared on the winning anime show "Snow White" in 2013, when the show's cast refused to invest in the startup.
At the end of 2017, Seminoff appeared on QVC's TV sales channel.
Ring also reached an out-of-court settlement in court with rival ADT Security.
While an experimental vaccine appears to reduce Ebola mortality, no drug has been proven to be suitable for existing infections so far.
A cocktail strain called ZMapp (poly-antibody compound) was initially expected to play a role in this area, but official studies suggest that its effects on preventing death are somewhat uncommon.
In PALM experiments, ZMapp is used as a reference, i.e. scientists use it as a baseline to compare three other therapies.
The American Gymnastics Association supports the letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee and accepts the strict requirement of the Olympic family to create a safe training environment for all athletes.
We agree with the statement of the U.S. Olympic Committee that, rather than revoking the license, we should continue to promote meaningful changes within our organization that may be more beneficial to the interests of athletes and clubs and their movements.
According to an independent investigation supported by the American Gymnastics Association, we may be able to find out why Larry Nasser's massive sexual assault, which survivors bravely exposed, was not discovered for so long.
The American Gymnastics Association and the American Olympic Committee share a common goal: to ensure the safety of gymnastics and other sports as much as possible, and to allow athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, active and supportive environment.
In the 1960s, Brejinski worked as an advisor to John F. Kennedy and later for the Lyndon Baines Johnson administration.
During the 1976 presidential election, he provided foreign policy advice to Carter, and then took over as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981 to replace Henry Kissinger.
As a national security adviser, he assisted Carter in many international affairs, such as the signing of the Camp David Accords in 1978, the normalization of U.S.-China relations in the late 1970s, the Iranian Revolution in 1979 that led to the Iranian hostage crisis, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

Later on Sunday, US President Donald Trump issued a statement through his press secretary announcing the withdrawal of US troops from Syria.
Trump issued a statement after a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The statement said Turkey would also take over the custody of captured Islamic State militants; European countries refused to deport them.
This not only confirms that the theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathered fins is already widely circulated, but also provides details that fossils would not normally provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the feathers are chestnut brown at the top and light or carrot-colored at the bottom.
The discovery also helps to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Dinosaurs' feathers do not have a well-developed main stem, known as the feathered feathered feather, but they do have other feathered features, such as feathers and feathered twigs, which researchers have suggested may have evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they are not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or showing off. The researchers believe that although this is a tail of a young dinosaur, the samples show mature feathers, not the feathers of younger dinosaurs.
Researchers believe that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult feathers, not the tail of a rhinoceros.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two policemen and injuring more than 20 others.
The governor's office said 19 of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected that an Islamic State militant (ISIL) was behind the attack.
They found that the Sun and other stars functioned in the same way: the activity of all stars in the galaxy was entirely determined by their luminosity and spin.
The Rosebud number of a star is determined by its luminosity and rotation, and is related to the flow of the plasma.
The smaller the Rosebery, the less active the stars are in the reverse of the magnetic field.
In the course of his journey, he encountered problems on many occasions.
He was robbed by pirates, attacked by mad dogs in Tibet, escaped from Nepal, and was arrested in India.
The 802.11n standard is available on both 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies.
It is backwards compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided the base station has dual radio.
802.11n speeds up much faster than its predecessor, with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600Mbit/s.
Duval is married with two grown children and he has not left much impression on Miller, the narrator of the story.
When asked to comment, Miller said: "Bum Mike said a lot at the hearing... I was preparing at the time, so I didn't understand what he was saying".
By 2020, we will be working to make the GDP of the country's CO2 emissions significantly lower than in 2005, Liu said.

Hu Jinping encouraged the young people in developing countries not to go back to the old ways of governance after pollution.
He added, "However, they should not be asked to assume obligations beyond their developmental stage, responsibilities and capabilities".
The Iraqi research team submitted its report today at 12 pm GMT.
The report warns that no one can guarantee that any action currently taken in Iraq will prevent sectarian war, rising violence or chaos.
The report opens with a call for the United States to openly debate and build consensus on Middle East policy.
The report strongly criticizes the administration for almost every aspect of its current policy in Iraq and urges an immediate change of direction.
The first of the 78 recommendations in the report is that new diplomatic operations be launched before the end of the year to protect Iraq's borders from hostile forces and rebuild diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries.
Current Senator, First Lady Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced her candidacy for the presidency last night in the city of La Plata, 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.
Ms. Kishner announced her intention to run for president in the Grand Theatre of Argentina, and it was here in 2005 that she began her run for senator representing the province of Buenos Aires.
The debate began as a result of the controversy over relief and reconstruction spending after Hurricane Katrina; some fiscal conservatives have humorously called it Bush's new Orleans administration.
Criticism of the reconstruction work by the Liberals has focused on the practice of awarding reconstruction contracts to Washington insiders.
More than four million people visited Rome for the funeral.
It was too crowded for everyone to enter the funeral service in St. Peter's Square.
A number of large TV screens were installed throughout Rome to allow people to watch the ceremony.
Similar facilities are being set up in many other cities in Italy and other parts of the world, especially in Poland, for large crowds to watch.
Historians have criticized the FBI's past policy of focusing resources on cases that are easily broken, particularly car theft, with the sole purpose of improving the agency's failure rate.

The work was largely theoretical, but the purpose of the program was to simulate observations of the constellation Humphrey.
The effect the team is looking for may be caused by tidal forces between galactic dark matter and galactic dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts its gravitational pull on Earth to cause tides, the galaxy exerts its influence on the constellation of Horus.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
The theory holds that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a certain type of light circle around a galaxy, made up of many small particles.
Television reports show that white smoke is coming out of the factory.
Local authorities warn residents near the nuclear power plant to stay indoors, turn off the air conditioning and avoid drinking tap water.

Dr. Tony Moore has discovered the widespread drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant of the virus is very disturbing and worrying because of its high mortality rate.
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have been infected with the virus in the hospital, and that at least two patients are hospital staff.
Within a year, an infected person may infect 10 to 15 people in close contact.
However, the proportion of TB that is widely resistant to drugs in the entire TB population seems to be still low; in South Africa, at any given time, only 6,000 people are infected out of a total of 330,000.
Both of these satellites, weighing over 1,000 pounds, flew at 17,500 miles per hour and collided 491 miles above Earth.

Police said the body appeared to have been left there for about a day.
The first cases of the season were reported in late July.
The disease is transmitted by pigs and transmitted to humans through mosquitoes.
The outbreak prompted the Indian government to take measures such as placing pig traps in heavily infected areas, sending thousands of mosquito nets and spraying pesticides.
The government also pledged to provide millions of doses of the hepatitis C vaccine, which will help medical institutions prepare for next year.
Due to lack of funding and low priority compared to other diseases, the plan to deliver vaccines to the worst-affected regions in history was delayed this year.
In 1956, Słania moved to Sweden. Three years later he started working for the Swedish Post Office as chief stamp engraver.
He has produced over 1000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries/regions.
His work is highly recognizable, high quality and rich in detail, which makes him one of the few people known to collectors.
The 1000th stamp he produced in 2000 was based on the famous painting by David Klok Ehrnstral, which was a tribute to the great achievements of the King of Sweden and was selected for the Guinness World Records.
He has also been involved in the production of banknotes in many countries, and his recent work includes a portrait of the Prime Minister on the new Canadian 5 yuan and 100 yuan coins.

After the dam was completed in 1963, seasonal flooding was controlled and the sediment was no longer dispersed into the river.
This deposition is a necessary condition for the formation of sand dunes and beaches, whereas sand dunes and beaches are habitat for wildlife.
As a result, two fish species became extinct, and two more are threatened with extinction, including the bow-backed catfish.
Although the water level will rise only a few feet after the flood, officials hope it will be enough to restore the eroded sandy beaches downstream.
According to the Jakarta Geological Survey, no tsunami warning has been issued as of yet, as the quake was not at 6.5 degrees.
Despite the threat of beaches, the locals were restless and left their homes and businesses.

All the entrances to the caves (known as the Seven Sisters' Caves) are at least 100 to 250 metres (328 to 820 ft) in diameter.
Infrared images show that changes in day and night temperatures indicate that the sites are likely caves.
They are cooler during the day than their surroundings and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caves on Earth, which usually maintain fairly constant temperatures, but they are similar to deep underground caves, according to the USGS space geology team and Glenn Kuhn of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a less technical experience: voters enter a small room and put a pre-printed piece of paper showing the candidate's choice in an envelope.
After the official verifies the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs it on the ballot.
French electoral law has made fairly strict regulations for electoral procedures.
Since 1988, the ballot box has had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelope was in the box when the vote began, and that no one else was in the box except those voters who were able to vote in a timely manner.
Candidates can send representatives to the site to inspect every aspect of the election process. In the evening, volunteers are counted according to specific procedures under strict supervision.

Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be bent into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into thin silk, used for wrapping and knitting. It can also be knitted or sliced.
It can be made very thin and sticky on other metals, and because of its thinness, it can sometimes be used to decorate hand-drawn drawings in books called hand-drawn hand-drawn manuscripts.
This is known as the pH of a chemical. You can use indicators to make red and blueberry juice.
The color of the curdled grapefruit juice will change depending on the acidity of the chemical.

Below them are more medium-sized cat species, which eat medium-sized prey, from ducks, goats to deer.
Finally, there are many small cat species (including the domesticated cat) that feed on a much larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, seals and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the Reiki, where each cat is responsible for a special task to prevent them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most distinctive cats in the family, living in large groups called lion clusters.
The lion family consists of 1 to 3 adult males with only relative relations, and up to 30 females and young.
As sisters and daughters in large families, females are usually closely related to one another.
Lions behave very similarly to wolves or dogs. These animals behave remarkably similarly to lions (but different from other large cat species) and are extremely lethal to their prey.
Tiger is an all-around athlete, and it crawls (although its crawling ability is not very strong), swims, jumps, and has a pull that is five times that of a human powerhouse.
The tiger and lion, the fox and the jaguar belong to the same species of the genus. These four large cats are the only cats in the family that are known to bark.
The mouth of a tiger is not as deep as the mouth of a lion, but rather as a word that is angry.
Catfish like to eat small animals. If conditions permit, they will catch rabbits, snakes, rodents and birds. Catfish prey is almost all much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that the American cats are used to track and search for prey by sniffing and sniffing their prey on the ground.
They have a strong night vision, can see clearly in the dark, and are also very secretive. They feed on their environment and then attack prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from their main population (e.g. they cross mountains and rivers, or they arrive on a new island so that it is not easy to return), they often find their environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new populations will need different characteristics or adaptability to become a strong competitor, rather than the ones they previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all and they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
Over time, new populations began to adapt to new environments, and they began to become increasingly unlike other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will eventually appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process the formation of a new species, or the formation of a new species.
Plants can produce oxygen for humans to inhale and carbon dioxide for humans to exhale.
Plants can also provide cooling through photosynthesis to obtain nutrients from sunlight.
We make houses with plants and make clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat is plant. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The dragon was the top predator of the time, and it was not afraid of anything except its kind.
Its long underside is filled with more than 70 razor-like teeth, and a row of teeth on its upper surface.
Its tongue may be forked, but we are not sure about this. Its food includes sea turtles, large fish, other reptiles, and even humans.
It attacks anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like the Dragon Ball are not its opponents.
Although most of the food of the Romans was common to us, they did have some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boars, sparrows, cows and a rodent called the sleeping mouse.
The difference between the poor and the women is that they sit down at the table, while the rich enjoy feasting together and lying down on their sides.
Food that was introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later was not present in the diet of the ancient Romans.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes and cocoa, and no ancient Romans had ever eaten turkey.
And the Babylonians built a house for themselves, and a house for the house of Jehovah, for every house of God.
The people offer sacrifices to God, and the priests meet God's needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an outer courtyard, and the inner one, into which only the priests entered.
Some special pyramid-shaped towers, known as pyramid-shaped towers, were built as part of the temple.
The tower is the special sanctuary of God.

If you've seen the National Treasure Trove of the Tibetan people, you might think that the Tibetan Declaration of Independence is painted on the back of the statue.
However, this is not the case. Although the document has something written on the back, it is not a Tibetan painting.
The original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776 (original text of Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776) was written in the form of a letter.
Although no one can determine the author, this large leather-bound document (sized 293⁄4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) was purportedly wrapped up when it was written.
It is therefore likely that the symbol was added as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the French, who in 1940 reached a peace agreement with the Germans, not to resist the invaders, but to cooperate with them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, known as Operation Longhorn.
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a community of people who live and work together.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin word civilis, meaning civilization, and is related to the Latin words civis, meaning civilization, and civitas, meaning civilization, which in some ways defines the size of society.
Civilized culture means that knowledge is passed down through generations, cultural footprints are preserved, and culture can be spread equally.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not considered to be a civilization.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the auspices of the Commonwealth of Virginia (the Congress was its only component).
Congress has no power to impose taxes, and because there is no national executive or judicial branch, Congress relies solely on the state government to enforce all laws, which often fails to cooperate.
It also has no power to overturn the tax laws and tariffs between the states.
These provisions must be approved unanimously by all states to be amended, and states are so slow to treat the central government that their state representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are the second most successful teams in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.

Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Benzhou), making it the seventh largest island nation in the world!
Due to the large number of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to geologically as the "Crimea".
Western knowledge of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century. European sailors who passed through the island named it the Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern Taiwan region, began to change the way indigenous people produce food and hired Chinese workers to work on their sugarcane and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), forces controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, the Qing Empire declared a province in Taiwan.
In 1895, after the defeat in the Battle of Midway (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Pyongyang, ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The ancient city of Machu Picchu is made up of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Window House.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give visitors a better understanding of the original layout.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static image photography format in the world is the 35mm format, which was the dominant film size in the late silent film era.
It is still in production today, but more importantly its length and width are applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual size of the 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm high, so the format is a bit confusing.
Thus, the width-to-height ratio of this format (the simplest integer ratio of 12 minus) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS series) are the same or fairly close to this length.
The often-abused and derided Law of Three is a simple guiding principle that is not lost in the creation of dynamics, but also helps to keep images in order.
It notes that the most effective position for the subject is to cross the line dividing the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see examples).
During this period of European history, the already rich and powerful Catholic Church was closely monitored.
Despite the differences in European languages and customs, Christianity has linked them together for over a thousand years.
From the king to the civilian, it has ten different forces that affect everyone.
One of the main Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's money fund was created specifically for this purpose.
The centralized church system in Rome has existed for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they adhere to this belief.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began to impose a sea blockade on Germany.
They cut off the supply of military and civilian goods that were life-threatening. This strategy proved effective, despite the fact that such blockades violated the generally accepted international law established under several international agreements over the past two centuries.
The British are in international waters off Bray, preventing any vessel from entering the whole of the sea, and even pose a threat to neutral vessels.
Because the response to this strategy is limited, Germany expects its unrestricted submarine warfare to be similar.
In the 1920s, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was pacifist, separatist.
After witnessing the atrocities of World War I, countries are eager to avoid repeating the atrocity.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former manager, to Thomas Edison.
Different periods of ancient China have their own characteristics; each period or underground family in China is a distinct dynasty.
Similarly, the Chang'an period was a period of instability in which a small nation was divided. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period of 60 years, which was between the Chang'an and the Chang'an dynasties.
During these turbulent times, the princes of various streets fought fierce battles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for supreme power in the Xi'an Palace.
There are also many social and political influences, such as the use of units of measurement, the transition from authoritarianism to republicanism, nationalism, the belief that the state does not belong to the sole ruler but to the people.
In addition, after the revolution, the office was open to all men, which gave the most ambitious and successful people the opportunity to fly the Yellow Dragon.
The military is also a military rank, because the rank and rank of the army are no longer based on rank but on skill.
The French Revolution also encouraged the oppressed working class of many other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was interested in life beyond the earth. He used to meditate in a cave called the Peshiravan in the Khunuur (Light Mountain) in the past.
The cave itself has not only withstood the test of time but also gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
The cave is located on a hilltop north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even if it is known to exist, it is not easy to find. Once it enters a cave, it is completely isolated from the world.
In the cave, there is almost no sight or sound of the outside world except the clear sky and the surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands.
The Great Pyramid is a 3rd-century BC Egyptian masterpiece and one of many great pyramids to pay homage to the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt (the Giza Pyramid) includes several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples and large lion statues.
The Great Pyramid was built in memory of the Khufu Pharaoh and several smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in memory of Khufu's wife and family members.
The bow-and-mouth symbols are like the letter V on the top, and the bow-and-mouth symbols are like the nail or the missing square at the bottom.
The upper part of the bow is the beginning of the bow from the top, and the lower part is the beginning of the bow from the bow's root (i.e. the place where the bow is held).
The upper bow usually makes a softer sound, while the lower bow makes a stronger, more firm sound.
Please use your own pencil to mark your notes, but remember that the notes printed are of musical significance and should generally be respected.
On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antoinette and their two children (Mary Theresa, 11, and Louis Charles, 4,), and the King's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were driven back from Versailles by a group of urban women.
So they returned to their chariots, and the crowd surrounded them, threatening the king and the queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of the chariot completely.
In the face of the frightened queen, a mob once waved the title of a Royal Guard, who was killed at the Palace of Versailles.
The cost of the war for the American imperialists during their conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial government of the United States to pay the bulk of their expenses and interest on bonds issued through the Wall Street Bank in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the high profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people became a fundamental benefit of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights of the Temple, one must understand the background that led to the formation of the Knights of the Temple.
The period of events is commonly referred to as the Middle Ages, the period of European history, i.e. the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The late Middle Ages were preceded by the early Middle Ages and followed by the late Middle Ages, and are generally considered to have ended around 1500 BC.
Technical determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, including the theory of technological advancement, the theory of technological necessity, and a strict definition of the fate of human beings, which is driven by the logic behind scientific laws and their performance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism include two broad concepts: one is that the development of technology itself has largely transcended cultural or political influences; and the other is that technology in turn will have an intrinsic, unrestricted effect on society.
For example, some might say that cars will inevitably promote the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically feasible for only a few cars, so new production methods should be introduced to reduce the cost of ownership of cars.
The higher holdings of Volkswagen vehicles will also lead to higher road traffic accidents, which will drive the invention of new medical technologies to repair injuries.
Romanticism has a strong cultural deterministic tone, which has been echoed by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlagger.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time, customs and cultures associated with geography emerged, which were far better than arbitrarily enforced laws because of their harmony with the places in which they lived.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of the European feudal era.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned gifts such as silk and spices more valuable than the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the style was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slow pace of cultural exchange, Western fashion may be 25 to 30 years behind.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, Western Europeans gradually developed their own style. One of the greatest advances was the use of buttons to dress after the Crusades.
Self-sustaining agriculture is an agricultural activity that is conducted to produce food that is sufficient for the farmers and their families.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses local seeds stored within the ecological zone, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize production.
Historically, the majority of farmers have been engaged in self-sufficient agricultural production. Today, this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together gay people who feel they are ignored by social norms and subculture cultivates a sense of identity among them.
Subcultures may vary depending on the age, race, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The subculture is characterized by a combination of different factors, including language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or more.
Members of subcultural groups often use symbolically unique styles of behavior to express their membership, including fashionable clothing, behavior and black language.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use the case of a small number of unfortunate children. These children are not socialized by adults as they grow up due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse.
Some wild children are held captive by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because parents refuse to accept their children with serious intellectual or physical defects.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or left home.
Some were raised by animals; others lived alone in the wild.
If raised entirely by non-human animals, the wolf's behavior (to the extent permitted by physical conditions) would be very similar to that of the animal, such as showing fear or indifference to humans.
While project learning should make learning easier and more fun, supporting learning goes further.
Supported teaching is not a learning method but a means of assisting those who are just learning to use new computer programs or start new projects.
Supported teaching can be done online or offline, in other words, teachers are a form of supporting teaching, like the reverse-wire assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is embedded in software to question, tip, and explain programs that may be difficult for students to handle alone.
Children are adopted for all kinds of reasons, including neglect, abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment without education, without care, without education, but it is against their will.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
The foster system should provide all the necessities that its native families lack.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet add an additional dimension to its use and fulfillment.
For example, learning to chat and chat is considered an important motivator for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
In their study of audience responses to websites, Amy and McDermott (1998) also cited the involvement of gay individuals in gay and lesbian relationships as a new motivating factor.
The use of video to explain micro-expressions (a few milliseconds of facial movement) has led to significant discoveries.
Specifically, it is said that one can judge whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting a micro-facial expression.
In his paper, Oliver Sacks, in the speech of President Bush, noted that those who cannot understand language because of brain injury can still accurately judge whether the speaker is sincere.
He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior may be a common theme in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two libraries of gene variation: manifest and implicit.
Mutations add new gene variations, while selection removes the variation from the expressed gene variation pool.
Due to separation and reorganization, variations have been repeatedly varied between the two libraries of each generation.
In tropical meadows, primates have a human-like digestive system, and existing plant resources are difficult to meet primates' amino acid needs.
In addition, failure to do so would have serious consequences: growth suppression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources should be proteins from leaves and soybeans, but primates like us have difficulty digesting these proteins unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (corn, egg, egg) are not only easily digested, but also provide a large amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In summary, we should not be surprised if our ancestors' methods of solving the protein problem of the zinc were different from those used by the chimpanzees in the tropical prairies today.
Sleep disruption refers to the process of consciously waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep after a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This is easy to do with relatively quiet clocks that wake you up without being fully awake.
If you find yourself re-positioning your alarm clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room and force yourself to go to bed and turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea that is known to be beneficial to the urine population) and forcing yourself to urinate.
The degree to which a person is at peace is the opposite of the degree to which a person is physically and mentally tense.
The less stress, the more active the life force. Everyone can find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach the level of enlightenment, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own feelings of tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded through the universal love of Buddhism and many of the techniques of Hinduism.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes methods of Kundalini, meditation and universal love.
In Kundalini, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through the posture of the breath, breathing exercises, reading and visual imagery.
The central activity of Tibetan meditation is the sky. It achieves enlightenment by symbolizing different gods, purifying energy channels, and activating the holes in the sphere.
Germany was a common enemy of the countries of World War II, which promoted cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. As the war ended, the conflict over institutions, procedures and cultures further divided the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began immediately.
The war lasted for 40 years and proxy forces fought fiercely on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense line had been broken, and the only hope left was to retreat and retrieve troops along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were abandoned almost overnight, with more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entering the eastern part of Poland in violation of the terms of the Treaty of Riga, the Treaty of Non-Violence between the Soviet Union and Poland and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, and establishing positions in Belarus and Ukraine.
To date, shipping is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the sea.
In the traditional sense, the Navy's task is to ensure that the nation maintains its ability to transport people and goods while disrupting the ability of the enemy to transport its people and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy, powered by U-boats, tried to intercept the shipment.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have been as likely to conquer Britain as the rest of Europe.
The goat appears to have been first bred in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to feed them, eat and use their milk, meat, fur and skin.
The domestic goats are usually kept in herds in the mountains or other pastures, and are usually tended by herdsmen (mostly children or adolescents), similar to the more widely known herdsmen. These methods of grazing are still used today.
The British built a freight line in the 16th century.
Although the Mara track was made of parallel wooden planks, at the time, the cars made the horses that pulled the car faster and pulled more for the slightly bumpy roads.
Early rail pillows were introduced to be used to secure railings. However, it was gradually realized that railings would be more stable if iron pieces were placed on the railings.
This is common practice, but iron chips can cause more severe wear on wooden carriage wheels.
In 1767, the first full-line railway was built.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Two million years ago, with the advent of Homo erectus, humans began to walk upright.
The ancient ape-like people of the south were not used to walking upright.
Two-legged fossils have been found in the Southern ape fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus, a tribe of the Sahel, may have walked on both legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, join environmental movements, and even become environmental activists, to some extent reducing future disasters.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic therapy. But if we want more than just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and eliminate it completely.
It is clear that the world has changed dramatically as a result of human scientific and technological progress, and that overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of mankind have made the problem more serious.
The draft handwritten by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary-General Charles Thompson was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4 and was then sent to John Mullap Printing Plant in several blocks outside the city.
One night, 150 to 200 copies were printed, the now-known Dunlap broadsides edition.
On July 8, John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of the letters was sent to George Washington on July 6, Washington read it to his army in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 remaining copies of the single-page printed edition of Dunlap broadsides are the earliest extant versions of the document. The manuscript is not preserved.
Many archaeologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and have survived to the present day, the so-called "bird-of-age bats".
Many people think they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have many similarities to dinosaurs.
They have claws and claws on their feet, and they lay eggs. They walk on their hind legs like dragons.
Today, almost all computers in use are based on processing binary coded information.
A binary number can only represent one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and such a number is called a binary number, i.e. a space cube in computer terms.
In the body, intoxication may not appear immediately, and symptoms such as vomiting are so common that no immediate diagnosis can be made.
The most powerful indicator of toxicity may be a container that is opened on the spot containing medicines or household toxic chemicals.
Check the labels for specific emergency directions.
Insectologists use the word bug to describe this species.
The term is derived from the familiarity with the bug, which is a highly adapted insect that is parasitic to humans.
Falcons and geese are nesting insects that adapt to live in their host's nest or in their home.
In the United States, there are more than 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in various regions, and the disease has become a major neurological disorder in middle-aged youth.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis (MS).
A couple may decide not to have children for their own sake or for the sake of their children.
The couple may have a plan for adopting their children.
In the process of adoption, the biological parents terminate their rights as parents so that another couple can raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to discover how the world works through scientific methods. In fact, this method provides guidance for most scientific research.
An experiment is an experiment that eliminates one or more possible assumptions, but it is not the only way. Questions and observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have been interested in classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on all aspects of science (including psychology) were widely accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West broke away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the physiological and behavioral patterns observed by researchers are largely dependent on the innate life cycle and its existence produced by the biological clock.
Cyclical rhythm is not simply a response to external cyclical signals. This rhythm is recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillating device that can continue to function freely for a period of time even without external input.
The experiments of Hershey and Chase show that DNA is one of the main evidence for genetic material.
Helchi and Jones used a fungus or virus to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one on DNA that was labelled with radioactive sulfur and one on proteins that were labelled with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations have a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells are inherited to children, whereas mutations in other cells lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural landscape tourism attracts visitors interested in natural areas to see natural landscapes, including wildlife and plants.
The activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and ecosystem research.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about the red gorillas in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small towns to work, and the workplace of people who walk by their shoulders is where they leave.
In this dynamic transportation loop, everyone is connected and supported in some way with the transport system based on private cars.
Today, science shows that such a massive carbon economy will no longer be able to keep the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past two million years stable.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transport system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the similar level of water quality or bridge collapse.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints? Why do they fail every day? Is it because transport engineers are not qualified? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic traffic studies the movement of the driver and vehicle between two points and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because it is not possible to make a 100% accurate prediction of the driver's behavior.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers is often within a reasonable consistency range; therefore, traffic flow is often in a reasonable consistency that can be expressed roughly mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship is established between the following three main characteristics: 1) traffic, 2) density and 3) speed.
These relationships are helpful in planning, designing and operating road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly made them easier to avoid enemies and more efficient at finding food and a mate.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back and forth along the body.
This gives them more small space to escape predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are the ants and the ants.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many people think otherwise; they think the solar system revolves around the Earth, and the sun is also (and even other stars are) too.
It seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel itself moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. Its water volume is more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the largest river on Earth, with some stretches up to six miles wide.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of the world's rivers flowing into the sea.
The Amazon River drains 6,387 km (3,980 miles) of water from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the magnificent scale and superior construction techniques of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the more than 1,000-year-old monument of their ancestors.
Vatican City has a population of about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legal and official communications.
Italian is also the language of most of the people working in the country, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The Vatican City is a Roman Catholic city.
The basic chemical elements of gold, silver, and copper have been known since ancient times because they are found in nature and are easier to extract using raw tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that anything is made up of one or more of the four elements of earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also proposed the theory that they would transform into new matter to make up what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table of elements.
The elements of zinc, zinc, and zinc are also metals, and of course, silver and gold are also metals.
The same is true for alloys containing a small amount of non-metallic elements (e.g. carbon).
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atom is so small that the last sentence of this sentence can contain trillions of atoms.
And when the pen came, it was a favor to many.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerge, pencils are becoming less popular and less used.
People now write messages on computer screens, never having to touch a pencil knife.
One can only guess what the end of the keyboard will be like when the updated product comes out.
The principle of fission bombs is as follows: it takes energy to bring an atomic nucleus and many protons and neutrons together.
It's like pushing a heavy truck up a mountain. It splits the atomic nucleus again and releases some energy.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means they are likely to split with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the Earth's crust.
The earth's surface is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
The ground below the dark is a little thinner, and the ground above is a little thicker.
Because the terrain is thinner, there may be more darker parts on the near side, and the rocks are easier to climb to the surface.
The core of motivational content theory is the search for identifying or interesting factors.
These theories suggest that certain needs and/or desires are internalized as people mature to a certain degree into adulthood.
These theories study why people want to do what they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do something.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's demand-level theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two behaviors that occur when managers begin to lead past colleagues. One is that they try to maintain a close relationship with team members.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, and has difficulty implementing disciplinary measures, performance evaluations, allocating responsibility and accountability.
In another extreme case, the person becomes a completely different individual, feeling that he/she must change everything the team has done and take the results for granted.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leadership and other members of the team.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for the corresponding sub-teams.
They tend to have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams may schedule meetings for different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The existence of a truly virtual inert team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is a management team that reports to each member. It sets standards for all members.
Why does an organization take so long to build a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
Creativity and creativity occur when all available resources are effectively utilized between the functional sectors of an organization.
As a result, an organization often brings new innovation processes to meet the needs of its customers in a joint effort to overcome barriers.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge and conduct organized learning.
The series was described by Angelina Jolie in 2006 as a way to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research. It therefore narrows the scope of research and makes it more accurate.
The link between brain pathology and behavior can provide support for scientific research.
We know from a very early age that different types of brain injury, trauma, illness and tumor can affect people's behavior and cause some changes in their mental functioning.
The rise of new technologies has allowed us to see and study the structure and workings of the brain, which we have never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to help us understand how the brain works.
AI has a strong science fiction flair, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research in artificial intelligence (AI) involves making machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and customer problems, and handwriting recognition, voice and facial function.
All of these have become independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, and some home computer and video game software applications already have built-in AI systems.
Field trips are an important part of any teaching activity. Teachers are usually happy to take students to places that cannot be reached by buses.
Virtual field trips are a high-tech solution. Students can see artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire fine art in classrooms.
Virtual sharing of field trips is also a good way to review the journey and share experiences with subsequent classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their state visit each year. The website is redesigned each year, but the old version is kept online and used as a book clip.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although grammar and spelling are often very poor when students start blogging, the appearance of readers usually changes this situation.
Students are often the most provocative readers, so bloggers start working to improve their writing skills to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging is also a powerful tool for students to gain more insight into the world around them. To meet the audience's interest, students are encouraged to become smart and interesting.
Blogging is a tool that can inspire collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond traditional school curriculum.
"The proper use of blogs" can help students become better analysts and thinkers; by responding actively to web materials, students can find their own positions in the context of their articles and be able to present their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, with a charming bilingual architecture, and the highlight of the exhibition is a series of art galleries and museums from Canada's past and present.
The city is bordered by Niagara Falls to the south and the Muskoka River to the north and the uninhabited natural landscape opposite the river.
All of these factors have made Ontario a typical example of Canada for foreigners.
The vast areas of the north are sparsely populated, and some areas are smoke-free wilderness.
A surprising set of demographic data compares the number of African Americans living in the United States to the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island by far and an independent continent for wildlife.
The smaller islands, mostly independent states or part of France, are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, a doctrine prevalent in the Comoros and the Mayotte countries.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route from Europe to Cape Town in India.
It is bordered by the Sahel to the north; the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female tourists should say they are married, regardless of the actual marital situation.
Wearing a ring can also help, but don't wear a ring that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider to be harassment; and it is not uncommon for people to be followed, crawled, and so on.
When rejecting a man, be firm, and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (no matter what the culture is, you will be decisive!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merenids, who called the port Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt the city, renaming it Casa Branca, until it was abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
Morocco's Sudanese rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish merchants established a trading base here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting shopping destinations in Morocco.
Near the old town of Medina, there are shops selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tajik tea, ceramics, leather, water smoke and various small toys, but these shops are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the easternmost part of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the eruption of the Nearagongo volcano. The volcanic lava has buried most of the city's streets, especially the town centre.
Although it is still safe, any place outside of Goma should be investigated in advance to see if the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province has eased.
The city is also the base of the Nyaragongo Volcano and the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking project in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (a motorcycle rented) to visit Goma. The normal local short distance is 500 Congolese francs.
Because of its relative bias, the Pinting Bacturian is used as a metaphor for a distant foreign country.
Today, although Tinbactú is famous for being a tourist destination and has an airport, it is a poor town.
In 1990, it was added to the World Heritage List in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
This is a major stop on the Henry Louis Gates special on the ABC's Wonderful World of Africa.
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it is more of an Arab style than an African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeast South Africa, bordered by Mozambique on the east, Zimbabwe on the north and the Crocodile River on the south.
The park covers an area of 19500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, supporting different wildlife and plants.
It is one of the major attractions in South Africa and is considered the main attraction of the South African National Parks system (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges maintenance and tickets daily.
The Wild Card is also a great way to get into some of South Africa's national parks or even the entire national park.
Hong Kong Island is a synonym for the Hong Kong region and is a major tourist attraction.

The Sundarbans is the world's largest strip of pine forests, stretching for 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the coast to Bangladesh and the Indian mainland.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This part of the forest in India is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not only redwood swamps, but also the remains of huge jungles that once covered the Thang River Plain.
The area of the Sundbunnels is 3,850 km2, of which about a third is water/swamp area.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that the area is currently home to 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 peacocks.

There is no specific monsoon season and dry season: the rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are familiar to humans, wild animals are wild animals after all, and we should not feed or disturb them.
The park administrator said that a distance of at least 100 yards per meter with bears and wolves should be maintained, while a distance of 25 yards per meter with all other wildlife is required.
No matter how mild it may seem, almost all large animals such as cattle, deer, camels, bears and so on are capable of attacking humans.
Dozens of tourists are injured each year because of their inability to maintain a proper distance. These animals are huge, wild and potentially dangerous, so please leave some space for them.
Also, be aware that the smell can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or scattering food that smells and keep the camp clean.

The most challenging conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway are the route between Point Marion and Fairmont, which often travels to remote areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, keep your mind clear: it is all over the slopes, narrow lanes and swift turns.
The speed limits are significantly lower than before and after the route, with a common speed limit of 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and the importance of strictly complying with speed limits is greater than other routes.
But, surprisingly, mobile phone service is much stronger than many other routes along the way - such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.

The horses were suspended on either side of the horse's body, which was used to support the rider's legs.
They provide better stability for riders, but also have safety hazards, as riders' feet may get stuck.
If a rider is thrown from the horse but there is a footprint on the horse's body, the horse may be dragged away while running. To minimize this risk, some precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear their belt and boots, and the bottom of the shoes is smooth and quite narrow.
Second, some horses, especially British ones, have safety belts, which will cause the belt to fall off the horse if the rider pulls back.

Free skiing: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski tourism or ski hiking.
The event is related to skiing trips or alpine climbing, but is not usually held in both. Both events are held on rough terrain and require tougher skis and boots.
Imagine a ski route as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you can walk farther than on foot, but only in a very limited number of cases can you achieve the same speed as skiing on a flat track without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. In general, travelling across multiple countries means having to go through multiple visa applications and passport checks.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area is a bit like a country.
As long as you are staying in the area, you can usually go directly across the border without having to be checked again at a passport checkpoint.

Transgender people who have not had surgery must disclose their privacy and their dignity when they are through the scanner.
Offshore flow is the rapid retreat of waves from beaches to the sea, usually on shallow reefs or similar places.
The underwater terrain causes the backflow to be concentrated in some deeper areas, where it may form a rush flowing into the deep water.
Most deaths are due to reverse flow, a physical force that is unlikely to succeed in swimming against the current.
After getting rid of the high tide, swimming back is not so difficult.

Norway, Sweden and New Zealand have similar situations, but in other respects they are unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the figure is 40).
Most typical Baltic cruise ships will stay longer in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can spend a few days visiting the historic city and then go back to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only arrive on shore for a boat tour, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise ships have been highlighted in promotional manuals as Berlin, Germany. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, and cruise ships are not included in the price of the tour.
For people of all ages and backgrounds, flying can be a terrifying experience, especially if you have never been on an airplane before or have had a painful experience.

Generally speaking, it is not necessary to fly directly from A to B to find a commercial ticket or a first-class discount ticket.
Airlines are very clear that there are some core passengers who are willing to spend high prices on the privilege of a quick, comfortable trip, so they will charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Kirghizistan. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
