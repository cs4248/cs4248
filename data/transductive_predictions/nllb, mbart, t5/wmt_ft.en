The results of the student singing at the Zhejiang Academic Annual Meeting opened the brain hole - Xinhua Net
Using air to wash hands, judge disease, accurately search for the sources of fog and haze, last night, at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 academic year, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these results are students, who cover various major fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities and education, and students start with a curious idea to create many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won international awards at home.
Biosensors: Your Family Medical Doctor
Zhang Diming, a doctoral student at the College of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor at the end of a smartphone, only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to breathe lightly, and this instrument can test your health from the gas you breathe."
Zhang Dian said that the sensor is connected to smartphones, and after breathing gas, the health report will be shown on the phone.
Smart bracelets that can detect health status in the market, generally detecting physical parameters such as temperature, pulse, etc.
This biosensor uses the new material of graphene, whose target is chemical elements, and its sensitive "smell" enables it to reflect the health condition more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical lamps: doctors' high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lamps are also used in the operating room.
The invention won a silver prize at the 44th Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions in Switzerland this year.
Zhu Linqing, a master student at the College of Photoelectric Science and Engineering, and Shen Junfei's team opened a new line of thought in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
Many diseases are not detected and removed early, and are related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room.
Shen Junfei said, for example, when cancer is examined early, doctors can not see all tumor tissue in time, then cancer cells will spread later.
This smart surgical lamp has four lamps, which enhance the difference between different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color homogeneity and shadowlessness of the spot at any time according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This smart surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Zhejiang University Medical School's Zhejiang University Medical School's Zhejiang University Medical School's Children's Hospital, and has received better feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: saving water and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, rub a lot of soap at the top, squeeze a lot of handwashing fluid, and students like Li Qingxia invented a set of "air handwashing devices".
As long as we stand on the device's washroom, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a gas cylinder.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the water tap and combines with water.
So we can clean our hands!"
The colorful reaction and bacterial residue experiment proved that the effect of handwashing through this method is the same as the normal method of handwashing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driver, can guarantee cleanliness and save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, the invention was the only gold prize awarded to many of the world's top universities.
Please arrange to return to me as soon as possible, thx
Please cancel the order and return the cash, do not count, no more use of #PRS_ORG#!
Bones and hot pickles are not suitable for kids to eat.
If so, please order as soon as possible.
Not for a while, thank you.
He asked me to tell you where he was #PRS_ORG#
I don't wait to cancel the order
I bought #PRS_ORG#, but I wrote the wrong address
Can I change it?
Or cancel orders
Okay, it's trouble.
A certificate that feels meaningful - emergency certificate
This is one of the skills certificates I think important in addition to my driver's license!
Popularize: Emergency measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, i.e. rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that the ambulance came for a while after the accident, and this time is the most critical.
This is the time when emergency care is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, brain spilling blood and breathing abruptly, then our window of life was only four minutes, gold four minutes!
So the people around you know how important emergency is!
When someone falls around us, we can save him with professional knowledge instead of standing there and doing nothing, and this feeling of helplessness is terrible.
"In China, our official data is that three million people die accidentally each year, the most dangerous being a heart attack.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
Seventy-eight percent of casino hotels in Las Vegas can be rescued, and Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%.
This is what the founder of the first reaction, Lu Lu, said.
If a person has a heart attack, no breathing, no heartbeat, you don't have any effect on the person.
It is necessary to breathe artificially and press external pressure to save people.
I found that very few of us now have this consciousness to learn first aid, but when things happen it's too late, so I still appeal to everyone to learn this skill so that we can react in time to sudden situations.
It's possible to save a person's life!
The emergency certificate can be registered at your local Red Cross training centre, and I registered at the Red Cross training centre in Zhuhai, and the students have a discount.
PS: The last diagram is to record the goals you need to accomplish before 25 years of age, adding the emergency certificate to the target list is also a few months ago, but it is indeed done!
Then I'm going to take another certificate I want to test, and I'm going to test a dive certificate, and before I saw a dive emergency certificate in the little red book, I thought I had to have a first aid certificate to check, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#
One of the 13 yuan shrimp dumplings!
I haven't tried.
Why don't you write #NAME# and understand?
One for $13?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# leaked food, this time a shrimp dumpling for me!
Because it's clear that I saw it effective when I entered code before.
First of all, to conclude, I personally think that the Four Seas is a whole-scale piece of crap, in various senses.
But if you say that the film is not a bright spot or not, it's not at least a good choice of music.
There are many kinds of bad films that make you sleep well in the cinema, and one that makes you look angry after seeing, and the Four Seas is like a monkey on Ximiaoshan for the audience, and it can light your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience, Han's cold is truly a gift.
The most painful thing about this film is that it's as if it were a creation in a novel, difficult to name, and a lot of holes like the windcoat on Little Marco.
Even after seeing it, you will doubt whether there is an implicit metaphor in this director, but when you think about it carefully, you find that it is actually a piece of shit.
Let me start by saying some of the plot that I find difficult to understand.
The man's residence should be on a small island in the south, and his grandmother's life depends on it.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for a big man in the neighborhood to drive a small bread truck to send her to the northeast to see the snow.
Old people sitting in a van from the south to the northeast looking at snow?
He and his father are very reassured about this.
Then the old man has no background.
How did his wife and brother get a business license when he opened a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the island's flying car party mix up lightly and loosely seal a mountain road?
Then the truck that delivered steel in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and the truck driver couldn't find it around.
This feeling is too obvious.
Why would a small mixed flying car party that is not capable of sending letters and suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
Faced with why not call the police, the police in the movie also specifically asked if there was a problem?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but does not know how to open a door with a room card in a hotel, then forcibly arrange to find no hotel owner and sit outside the door and sleep for a night?
This inexplicable plot is rife throughout the film, and it pains me when I remember it because it's too far apart.
In addition to the plot, worse is the subject matter of the film, or that the film has no theme at all, is a hateful sewn.
At the beginning of the film, you think he wants to make a comedy movie, and more than 20 minutes later you guess it may be an inspiration film, and half of the time you look at it, you think it may be a drama film that reflects the fact that young people in small towns live hard to live.
For most people, in fact, are very familiar with the set of films, such as if you want to shoot a motorcycle driver, then encourage + comedy and tell the audience how a gifted rookie moves forward to success.
If you want to make a love film, you can tell the truth about the grievances between young people and waitresses in small towns who like to ride motorcycles.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot can't appear contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yin is playing has just been burned, and then can sing), it is impossible to open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't see.
As for the woman's head, it's clear that she is not retarded in some ways and can act like a 5-year-old child, I really don't know whether this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
And one thing I don't understand is why Han Xian, as a racer, is so passionate about adding crash plot to his own movie.
Is such a film arranged for the Spring Festival, is it intended to add to the audience?

Inspection of well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment introduction:
Zhengzhou Yijin is a domestic concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, inspection well block machinery, well wall wall module mechanical professional producer, from semi-automatic to fully automated production line.
Through years of practice and development, we now have too hard quality, mainly producing hydraulic, mobile, fully automated inspection well series equipment and supporting devices.
Inspection of well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Checking the production and processing equipment of well concrete module Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment characteristics and advantages:
Yi-Hin inspects the well block brick machine equipment widely applicable to new construction materials of coal, heat, water, electricity, gas and other municipal underground structures.
For example: various types of inspection wells for drainage, water storage facilities, rainwater vents, trenches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to construct inspection wells is that the upper or lower perimeter of the module is a convex structure, and the combined construction forms a chain lock.
The resistance of the well wall body is much better than the construction form of the flat friction structure.
The module is a mid-air structure, combined with the construction of vertical pore connection, horizontal pore overlap, and the pore core is pumped into the hole, forming the concrete mesh structure, which plays a secondary reinforcement and waterproof role.
The module has a plug-in chute, both horizontal and vertical, which increases the overall strength of the structure accordingly.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells constructed using concrete inspection well modules are not easily collapsing, sinking, leaking, etc. The mechanical performance of the well wall module is stable, simple to operate, and the standard of shape size.
Concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment smart control equipped with data entry, output device one key touch LCD display monitors the entire process of mechanical operation, achieving ideal human machine dialogue, automatic analysis comparison, density operation, security logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall module uses single tank hydraulic, conveyor, double tank hydraulic, conveyor.
Independent hydraulic integration stations avoid the impact of host vibration on hydraulic systems, thus ensuring the reliability of hydraulic systems.
Concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment fabric box goes into the mold box demolding up, storage box door closed, automatic conveyor board, all done independently by hydraulic system, thus achieving reduced mechanical wear and maintenance.
Concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment uses imported computers, electrical appliances, sealing hydraulic parts, and the comprehensive performance of quasi-secure equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical vibration platform of the well wall module uses a whole plate steel, and the surface line cutting joint mold has no welding point, making the filling box free swing direction, fully reducing mechanical wear.
To reduce the weight of the mold, filler and double-fold encrypted amplitude, use integration, full synchronization, stage vibration and molding to ensure that the vibration effect is achieved.
The mechanical vibration machine of the well wall module, computer automatic control amplitude adjusted according to the price of raw materials, no wear and brake, thus extending the useful life and reducing costs.
The well wall module has dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing Secondary School Pilot Modern Apprenticeship Enrolment is an enterprise associate employee - Xinhua Network
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the City Council that starting this year, my city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary schools, students who receive the pilot training will also have apprenticeship status, and after admission will be recorded by the pilot enterprise.
The Municipal Education Commission requested that the procedure for admission to secondary schools and enterprise employment be regulated, and that the dual status of students and associate employees of secondary schools and enterprises be clarified. In accordance with the principle of two-way choice, apprentices, schools and enterprises signed a tripartite agreement, and that apprentices who have reached the age of 16 and who have not reached the age of 18
Pilot schools are encouraged to use modern apprenticeship forms and jointly conduct pre-service training and retraining of enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
The pilot school needs to reform the talent training model.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programmes, jointly develop professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation programmes.
The pilot is developed as a pilot cycle, and the student's internship time at the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training programme, and the top-level internship is generally six months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise group management model should be implemented, according to the characteristics of different professions, one teacher can bring 2 to 5 apprentices and form a learning group to ensure that students are skilled in the skills required for each rotational job.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, three batches of 60 city-level modern apprenticeship pilots were identified, each pilot numbering around 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) were trained.
In accordance with the principle of first pilot implementation, step by step from point to point, explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint admission, joint training and integration of students in schools and enterprises, effectively improve student job skills, improve student peer employment rate and quality of employment.

South African doctor: Omicron's spread is strong, but it's mostly mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the new coronavirus Omicron variant is lighter than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, a group of doctors consisting of more than 5,000 doctors in Hoden Province, South Africa, reported that the symptoms of the new coronary patients they are currently treating are mild, such as physical pain and cough similar to influenza.
Dr. Unben Pillay, director of the organization, said he looked at dozens of patients every day, but no patients needed hospitalization.
"They can control disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said.
He said this included elderly patients and those with health problems, who were more likely to be seriously affected by coronary virus infection.
In contrast, he said, during the previous wave of Delta outbreaks, he treated new crown patients with "difficult breathing and low blood oxygen levels".
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days."
Within two weeks after Southern Africa first reported the Omicron variant strain, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it takes weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of new crown patients who have been hospitalized in recent weeks are seriously ill, half the proportion of the previous wave of epidemic; the average hospitalization time has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; of recent new crown patients, only 3% have died
William Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports: "At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a milder disease."
He also said: "It's early, and we need to get later data.
Normally, hospitalization and death occur later, and we only entered the epidemic for two weeks."
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta remains the world's leading new coronavirus strain, the case of Omicron is emerging in dozens of countries, South Africa being the centre of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in Haoden province in the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests showed that over 90% of cases of Omicron variants were recorded.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Review: What is the basis for saving abducted children?
If the analogy of the famous public welfare advertising words that "does not sell without killing", then, in a good environment where there is no "kidnapping" demand, group control, popular anti-kidnapping, makes the act of trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly, such crimes will not happen repeatedly.
Recently, the information on the disappearance of children developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has been released urgently.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for publishing information on children missing and to find abducted children in a timely manner.
I heard that the app was called "community," and it was warm.
The new technology means are not only the name of the art, full of feelings, but also properly used, practical and effective.
The primary objective of kidnapping law enforcement is to find the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed in many large words.
However, priority should be given to the safety of victims before trafficking cases are solved.
The matter is prioritized, and under the urgent "resort" purpose, such as "whether trafficking in children should be subject to the death penalty" and other controversial topics, they can be temporarily set aside and carefully discussed; but it is necessary to save abducted children.
Based on the experience of detecting such cases, traffickers are used to staying away from the crime scene as soon as they can.
If the abduction operation delays a minute, the child may be more away from the parents' step, and the difficulty of detecting the case increases by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic move to come up with an effective method that can directly help detect cases and find children.
After all, "kidnapping" is a big task that needs to be done by operating the entire legal system.
Combating crime, safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to judicial guarantees, as well as strict law enforcement, do not need to implement "child care and weak care".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be done better, from the family to society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three is resting at a train station, and the parents are asleep and wake up to find the child missing.
It is not possible to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, it should have at least a considerable sense of protection.
The rotational rest of the parents, or placing the child under secure protection, are the minimum means of preventing the abduction of children.
From the other side of the police's fight against trafficking crimes, the buying of abducted children should also be noted and punished.
Individual wrongdoing is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the Penal Code of China, the statutory starting point for the crime of abduction and trafficking of children is five years; especially serious circumstances can lead to the death penalty and confiscation of property.
The starting point is high and the maximum penalty is heavy, and the crime of trafficking in children is clearly a more severe crime under the large trend of "light punishment".
But there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people are backward in their ideas about raising children and that the legal awareness is weak.
The legal education of this part of the population should be followed simultaneously.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, it is not possible to rely solely on strict official law enforcement.
If the "market" of kidnapping is widespread, the traffickers are willing to smoke, constantly innovate methods of trafficking, and create a situation of "fighting with law" with law enforcement, the kidnapping operation will inevitably fall into an inefficient mud.
Therefore, breaking the concept of backwardness and popularizing legal common sense also help root out the crime of trafficking and buying children.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two major categories, namely Virgin Olive Oil and Refined Olive Oil, at five levels.
Primary olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruit after mechanical cold presses, filters, etc.
Depending on the difference in acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin: The highest quality olive oil, the highest quality, is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, there is a mildly elegant plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
Fine Virgin: The acidity is slightly higher, but not more than 2%, the taste is pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin: The taste and taste are still good, the acidity is not more than 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil obtained after refining primary olive oil with a acidity of more than 3.3%, or becomes "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of primary olive oil to reconcile the taste and color, its acidity is less than 1.5%, with transparent light gold yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil extracted from oil residue and refined through dissolution.
You should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olive fruits are like grapes made of wine, and olives from different regions and varieties of olives will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for olive oil growth, such as temperature, sunlight, air moisture and precipitation.
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only grow sporadically in suitable areas.
The main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc.
The month of oil olive harvest:
Every year from March to June, it is the time for oil olive trees to flower, and from July to October the fruit began to grow and mature, and the fruit transitioned from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the harvest season (the freshness of olive oil is important).
Nutritional ingredients of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, i.e. oilic acid and oilic acids, noric acids, but also vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the best oil for human nutrition found so far.
At the end of the democratic summit, Biden said that the fire of freedom will never be extinguished
The online summit on democracy for democracy, convened by President Biden and attended by government as well as civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, closed on Friday (December 10).
Biden said in his closing remarks that the fire of freedom burns in everyone's heart and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that the second global summit on democracy is planned for next year.
Taiwan's government representative, the government commissioner, Tang Feng, and Hong Kong's democratic human rights activist Rocong, who is currently exiled in the UK, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work before us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because I said before, as this summit showed, the democratic world is everywhere.
The authoritarian regime can never extinguish the microfire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people around the world and around the world."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires a common effort on the part of society as a whole.
"As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the shield of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, be more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to pursue power naked before the public interest," he said.
The theme of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" was to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and confront authoritarianism, as well as counter digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values.
This day coincides with the International Human Rights Day.
UN Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening speech on the same day that the democratic cause faces challenges globally, especially emerging digital technologies.
"It's time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, endogenousism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong's democratic human rights activist Rochong delivered a pre-recorded video speech to the summit, reminding participants of the continuing concern for the human rights situation of Chinese minorities such as Hong Kong and Uyghurs and Tibetans.
"The world has long accepted the rise of China, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use all the resources we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Rocong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Communist Party of China.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't realize the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change."
Tang Feng, a political member of the Taiwan Administrative Council, attended a round table discussion on "Combating Digital dictatorship and affirming democratic values", and released the State Statement via video, stressing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience of how to fight the new coronary epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At a time when Taiwan's democratic side is rising, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, powerful governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to seal the city to control the epidemic, and we don't need to go down to fight fake information."
Just as the next day of the Democratic Summit took place, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to be serious human rights violations, while imposing investment restrictions on a Chinese company found to be using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I've taken pictures and uploaded them to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying delivery times
It turns out #NUMBER#

Why not cancel
Hello, the mouthwater chicken sent by the restaurant is alive.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't stick to it, so I want to find a player at a similar price first.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices are often proportional to the level of friendship, and if you can't tell, then the normal situation will be more expensive than cheap shoots are friendly.
They are very low in strength, the ball hits on the beat, the vibration is very large, the hard ball cannot stand up, and the high-ranking are difficult to handle.
The logic and subtexts of their existence are-- tennis is so hard to know that you can't learn, and also know that you don't want to buy expensive, make a cheap deal to mess with you, you play twice, you won't play again, so this beat is cheap, you don't
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you've made progress, and then I'll come back to buy expensive ones, and I'll make two money.
It is recommended to spend similar prices, buy a second-hand better shot, choose Prince, or Dunlop, the two brands are not famous enough, so good bats can not be sold for the price, new shoots 500, 600 are good, second-hand
It's kind of friendly to newcomers, but once you're newcomers, it's chicken ribs, but most people, especially girls, can't pass the newcomers stage.

Girls raise money for their sisters when arrow targets: "It's good to think it's a skin injury." - Xinhua Net
A girl standing in front of a large wooden board with the words "human meat target, ten yuan one arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a Hangzhou girl who donated "arrow target" to her sister blew the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in Hangzhou in front of a slightly taller wooden board with "human meat target, ten yuan one arrow" written on the board, indicating that passers-by can shoot with bows and arrows after paying.
The act triggered a lively debate among netizens.
Last night, the head of propaganda in Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau's Lower Town Branch confirmed to Xinjing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl raised money for her sister before making such an extreme move, but this behaviour is not worth promoting, after warning, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
The girl's street arrow target collection was warned
In an online photo, a long-haired girl standing in front of a large wooden board with a black ink with a "human meat target, ten yuan one arrow" in front of another wooden board with her bank account and WeChat
The photo was controversial after it was online.
Some netizens believe that this move is "the begging behaviour of the eye of the eye", and many netizens feel sympathy for it.
"We found the situation when we patrolled the side of the square around 10 a.m. on the 23rd, when the crowd was already surrounded."
In an interview with the local media, the civilian police of the Tianhua police station near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls in the stand, all about 20 years old, dressed in youthful fashion.
Among them, the girl who was a "human meat target" has been crying, asking the passers-by to play this game; another girl on the side is helping to drink, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia, and now urgently needs surgery.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the head of propaganda in Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau's Lower Town Branch told Xinjing newspaper reporters that the girl, named Ji Jia Li, raised funds for her sister Jia Yan.
But because the treatment still requires more than 300,000 fees, this behaviour was done at a time when there was no good way to raise funds.
He said that during the whole process, two girls one was a target, one was responsible for the hand-to-hand, but did not participate in it, no arrows were found during the whole process, only someone surrounded and took pictures and sent them to Weibo.
After being certified by the security department, the bow and arrow used by the police is not under control.
The head of the agency said that "it does not promote this kind of eye-to-eye fund-raising."
After warning the police station civilian police, she has left the police station.

What's the hottest in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win prizes?
In the previous period, there was a article on the Olympic project where project managers can hit gold medals. It was very hot, and it mentioned project managers on many projects, absolutely can be a horse first, no one can match: moving bricks, travelling, staying up at night is the daily work of project managers,
An article that seems to be a joke, but also shows the daily bitterness of project managers, behind it is the strength of the current project management work.
People who work in project management are also gradually choosing to get out of the difficult situation at work through some actions.
From the annual increase in the number of PMP (International Certified Project Management Professional Qualifications) registrations, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management skills through learning.
According to the China Project Management Twenty-Year Development Report (1999-2019): As of September 2019, the total number of PMP posts nationwide was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP certifications was about 420,000, the number of valid holders was about 300,000, accounting for the total number of PMP
The increase in the number of PMP holders over the past decade shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to follow the past "old experience" and that the changing working environment allows us to know a way forward by standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
However, can the PMP test ensure that project management work is smooth?
Many starters in project management say that by learning relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the relevant knowledge points such as the ten areas of project management and the five process groups, but when really doing project management work, it is still a fog.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following issues: project management is not recognized, relies solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, and does not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, cannot land at work, project estimation is not possible,
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management has helped many excellent enterprises to train a large number of R&D key talent such as product managers and project managers, and has won such honorary titles as the China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base.
The R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp online course is an online fragmented learning method that combines practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and take the path of their own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less investment, promote the training process of project managers, and bring efficient operating results to the enterprise.
It's impossible to say, first of all, to see how other students evaluate the course: this course is not only conducted by a team of experts from China Tianhuaxia (formerly Huahua R&D management team), combined with advanced international project management methodology and many well-known enterprises' real business scenes.
It will also provide scientific practical management tools and methods, rich template forms to help students translate the content of learning into specific work after class.

On the eve of the 12th of July, Jixin advocated rational consumption with consumers - Economic Watch Network - Professional Financial News website
The value of transactions in the national network payment business this year reached 1.77 trillion yuan, which is higher than in previous years.
The wide variety of full red bags, the live broadcasting of people's eyes with goods once again benefits consumers, this consumption hot tide on one hand exemplifies the strength of national consumption, and on the other hand, has to calm down to think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of the "Double Twelve," Jixin Consumer Finance Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Jixin") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, rejecting blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report published this year by the People's Bank, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, our residents perform well at the level of financial consumption, but different aspects of financial behavior and skills reflect greater differences, and there is a need to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The level of financial literacy among older people and adolescents is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of continued attention in financial education; the report on the debt situation of young people in China issued by Nielsen and the report on youth debt in China issued by China Finance 2019-2020 showed that the younger generation
As a licensed consumer financial institution, JT has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with quality and careful services, advocating for consumers to establish a good and correct consumption view, and actively responding to the call of regulation to improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young groups, by taking practical action.
Over the past few years, JT has continued to carry out a comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge dissemination campaign for young groups, including university students, and through various forms of latentization such as launching innovation practice competitions in cooperation with top institutions in the country.
On the occasion of the arrival of the 12th, JT reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and the correct monetary view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid consumer borrowing errors, so as not to affect personal letters and future economic life.
When consuming, it is necessary to plan ahead and pay back on time.
If overdue, overdue records will be recorded in personal credit reports, which may have a negative impact on future economic life such as buying cars and buying houses.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether relevant institutions have operational qualifications.
In the future, Jixin will as always bring more demand-friendly and diversified services to consumers through its mature, reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated iterative financial products, constantly helping the public to raise the level of financial knowledge, help consumers nurture rational consumption, moderate borrowing concepts, and be a consumer's lifetime trusted consumer financial partner.
I'm not going.
I'm on the order.
No one ever contacted me for an hour, it's basically online fraud.
You think I called out for the first time?
After the investigation, you said the same thing! I checked the address several times before I ordered it.
Okay, thank you! How many days was that?
Vietnam People's News Network - Gulf Cooperation Council addresses common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stopovers include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations while having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when Gulf states signed an agreement to move towards solidarity and stability under the mediation of the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab States resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar from the demand that they must unite for the interests of each country and regional stability, aimed at meeting common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
The 725 km long corridor linking the two countries will facilitate the travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two companies signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and the world's major powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – an agreement condemned by the Gulf Arab states for their failure to resolve the missile problem with Iran.
The Gulf states have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that failure to solve Iran's missile problem and to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
Saudi Arabia engaged in direct negotiations with Iran in the context of the failure of the major powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf states.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming summit of the GCC will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic results of its contribution to promoting the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.
From 7:00 to 9:30, it has not yet been delivered, and it is necessary to return the deposit and cancel the order.

There's no need to say too much about the description of the car, google yourself just a little bit, sort out some explanations that Google doesn't necessarily give!
Too much attention, go wherever everyone is looking, very uncomfortable!

Let the spirit of the university coincide with the spirit of the times - Xinhua Net
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school concepts and value pursuits formed by a university in the course of its development for a long time, and is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to present, the spirit of universities is essential for the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the world's first university in a modern sense, the university has had a unique mission different from that of other social organizations. For our university, it emerged in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changing times, advocating the values of
At present, the trend of informationization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly evident, global education competition, science and technology competition, talent competition is increasing, higher education as an important supply side, and its structural reforms are facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the General Programme for the Integrated Promotion of the Construction of World-class Universities and First Class Subjects shows the confidence and determination of our country to move from a higher education power to a higher education power.
How can we strive to become a world-class player in a relatively short period of time and accelerate the construction of a number of world-class universities and a group of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap?
In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, universities should also take full advantage of three advantages: first, post-emerging advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding academic talent abroad, learning to draw on the advanced experience of world-class universities, achieving a significant improvement in academic level and quality of
In particular, it is important to realize that building world-class universities cannot be one side of the school, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while playing its advantage.
The characteristics of the operation should be both common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique targeting, school traditions and resource endowments.
In the case of Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three aspects of our operation: first, highlighting the characteristics of innovation and entrepreneurial talent development, building an integrated environment for science and teaching integration and school enterprises integration, and forming an ecosystem for entrepreneurial education across the chain; second, highlighting the characteristics of cross-cutting
In this process, it is especially important to maintain the spirit of the university at all times and to allow the spirit of the university to coincide with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the common values of the "innovation" school training, the "industrious learning, ethics, clarity, certainty" and the common values of the "Heina River, Enlightenment, Enlightenment, People Before Opening, Tree My State" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang
This is an important guarantee that the school adheres to the right direction of running the school, constantly accumulates cultural height and condensate spiritual power, rich in content and far-reaching in meaning.
Among them, "Heina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, reflecting the heart of "the talent of the world for me", and manifests itself in drawing on the quality of teaching and raising people in world-renowned schools; "Initiation and virtue" emphasizes the spirit of truth and good
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year school.
"The deaf listen to the silent, and the bright see the unformed."
China's universities should further build on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the historical mission of the age and responsibility of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adherence to human care and independent freedom, allowing the spirit of the university to interact with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, thus providing an inexhaustible impetus for achieving the country's wealth and national revitalization, and achieving the common ideals of humanity.

At the time of NFT fire, the encryption community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents losing jobs due to the epidemic starting to earn steady income from the game.
Axie Infinity is a bottom-up pet breeding game with blockchain technology, which brings together a variety of games, including NFTs, and is currently the highest transactional NFT project, to date it has reached more than $3 billion.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity earned more than $8.2 million a day, directly forcing King's Glory.
On August 6, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily users have exceeded 1 million.
The heat of Axie Infinity passes a new "palytoearn" model to more people, and through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role, in addition to getting fun from the game and economic benefits, can participate in the governance of the game ecology
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about the share price of friends, my biggest feeling is the choice of enterprises in the race, that is, the choice of industries that point to investment targets, first of all to choose industries with large growth space, at least more than 10 billion market size; second, to choose future growth
How wide the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the development stage of the industry, whether the track is flat or rough refers to the competition pattern of the industry.
Let's cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to do the things right.
The strategy is to do the right thing, that is, do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about landing, and there is space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether it is continuous deepening in the current field or horizontal extension (strategic thinking); for example, how to increase customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to increase core and high-value customer retention rate (strategic thinking);
Bitcoin, born 12 years ago, had several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small Central American country, defined Bitcoin as the legal currency, the first time Bitcoin has become a legal currency in a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities Commission approved ProShares' introduction of Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to enter the U.S. capital market and encrypt currency investment exposure.
Bitcoin is not the main player from the point of view of blockchain technology development.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin conducted a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American groups complain about discrimination in admission to three Ivy Colleges, including Yale - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency Washington, May 23 (reporter Xu Chingmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education and Justice on May 23, protesting discrimination against students applying for admission to three Ivy schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The group's chairman, Zhao Yuqiang, said at the press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the conditions for admission to American universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asian applicants in these three American universities has remained essentially at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have "long-term sustainability and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants" during the so-called "comprehensive consideration" admission process.
According to Zhao Yuqiang, research by scholars such as Sanders in 2014 showed that among these three universities, Asians have the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups compared to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale and Brown universities have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yuong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they expect the U.S. Department of Education and Justice to investigate after filing the complaint and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions.
They also expect the complained universities to take this issue seriously and change their admission policy towards Asians.
At present, the three universities complained about have not responded.
The Asian Education Alliance was founded in 2015 when it complained about discrimination in admission to Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education was not accepted on procedural grounds.
In addition to U.S. Chinese-American groups, the complaints included American Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani education groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the house intermediary about a factory located in Yu Yao Qing Town in Zhejiang, and after looking at the house several times on the spot, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory house with the family of the owner of the house, Mr. Lin, and made a deposit of 200,000 yuan through bank transfers on the same day.
Lin was signed as a payee in the Payment Order for the Purchase and Sale of Factory, which states that if the buyer does not want to buy this factory house, this deposit will be returned to the seller, if the seller does not want to sell this factory house, the deposit will be returned double to the seller.
However, after that, the parties failed to reach agreement on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of sale of the factory, the method of payment, which resulted in the delay in signing the contract for the sale of the house.
Considering the failure of the parties to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, Lin returned $200,000 to Mr. Lu after a few days.
The house that was not easy to see, the deposit was paid, the house was ready, and the contract was signed "to the door and foot," but the seller did not sell, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the People's Court of Yuyao City.
The court considered that the parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract and could not be blamed solely on the defendant, and should reasonably be presumed that the consultation was not possible, so the fine should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not be required to bear double the default liability for returning the deposit.
After the first instance judgement, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original decision.
[Counsel reminds] In the course of the transaction, it is necessary to pay due attention to the obligation.
When signing the contract, as a buyer, should do everything necessary to pay careful attention to the obligation, for example, verify information about the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, etc., and clarify in the contract the specific time and place of delivery, so as not to
(German Voice Chinese Network) After the "Democracy Summit" on Friday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Saturday (December 11) that the "Leader Democracy Summit" held by the United States was "ideologically pointed out, instrumentalizing and weaponizing democracy,
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on people, promoted 'democratic transformation', arbitrarily imposed unilateral sanctions, and initiated the 'color revolution', with disastrous consequences."
Democracy has long become a weapon of mass destruction in which the United States intervenes in other countries.
The summit was a move by Biden to honour his campaign commitments.
The two-day meeting was held via video, and leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited to attend, including Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for having problems with its own democracy, saying that the United States was not eligible to host such a summit.
There are also voices of questioning at the international and domestic levels, such as criticizing those invited to attend, including leaders of authoritarian tendencies, such as those in the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, who suspect that Biden's government's real intention is not to organize this summit for democratic geopolitical purposes.
German Prime Minister Scholtz, who has just taken office, also participated in the Video Democracy Summit
China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday, "Today's American democracy is becoming more and more ill, with issues such as money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, ethnic contradictions, and the division of rich and poor," U.S. democracy is based on capital
President Biden said in a speech: "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, better resist the buffers and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public interest."
He stressed that democracy is not automatic, "We must constantly update it among every generation, and in my opinion this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of persistent and worrying challenges."
The U.S. is committed to launching a one-year initiative following this democracy summit, which includes a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the substantive democracy summit planned for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all of us implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.

What is the method of drinking red card whiskey?
Everyone's hobby is different, some people like to collect, some people like food, and of course some people like wine. Red card whiskey is one of the best-selling Scottish whiskey in various countries at present, and red card whiskey has won an international wine competition.
Every bottle of red card whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, don't spoil its alcohol.
So how do you drink red card whiskey?
The small editor will briefly introduce you.
Red card whiskey drink:
Junni's red-plated whiskey is made up of about 35 types of Scottish whiskey, with the characteristics of strong fragrance and traditional Scottish whiskey, with sweet and smoked flavour in the thick fragrance.
The entrance is fresh in alcohol, slightly with herbs and a strong smell of smoked wheat.
The wine can be consumed directly with ice or mixed with its favorite drink.
Red card whiskey entered the country and, in order to adapt to the taste of the people of the country, bubble drinks such as red card whiskey + coke or snowflake or new wonders became a long-standing fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to being medium and acidic, can bring pleasure to people in visual terms, add to the drink, and have the effect of changing the taste of the refreshing wine.
Red brand whiskey + sliced lemon + sugar (sugar can also be), the most authentic and traditional drink.
The authentic red square taste is a bit acidic, adding sugar to the acidity of the sugar, lemons will bring fresh flavor to the wine, of course, sweet acidity can be adjusted according to personal tastes.
The three above are the best way to drink red card whiskey, and you can try it as a reference, hoping that the introduction of the editor will help everyone.
Education Thinking: How University Examinations Can Make "Teachers" "Teachers" and "Teachers Scumbuses"
Three students from Lanzhou Transport University wrote letters to the school leadership, reflecting confusion about the university exam, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the examination, change the test subject type, so that the examination truly reflects the student's actual level of demand.
Indeed, university exams have long been a "hot topic."
On the university campus, students come from the five lakes and four seas, and the level of competence varies, plus the degree of learning is different.
There are different feelings about the evaluation of groups with such diverse characteristics, and it is inevitable.
Of course, if the test topic type is single, the repetition rate is high, the topic is too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who do not need to work may be able to achieve the goal of concentrating on the attack before the exam, and if they think of other ways, it is possible to achieve the effect of doing more.
In this way, there is a "learning slag" that can normally not be invested and even high score; "learning master" usually never drops out of school, works and notes look good, and the examination is not much higher than the "odd status quo."
In this way, it seems that students in Lanzhou's university exams reflect the problems that exist in university exams. It is not without reason to believe that this situation exists not only in Lanzhou's university exams.
In this sense, I would like to commend these three students who wrote directly to Chen.
In fact, all those who have attended the university know that it is not unusual to strike to prepare for the exam, think of various ways to "take" from the teacher, try to draw the scope of the examination, seek to get "focus counselling" before the exam, even with a small copy of the exam,
In my view, as a guide for assessing the quality of teaching, measuring the qualification of a university exam or not is more about teachers' full control over teaching and learning, and scientific propositions based on it.
In the undergraduate phase of university, the specialization started to be broken down, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that full knowledge of the basic knowledge of a discipline is the content of the university exam.
And undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the discipline, and from the point of view of knowledge, the space for change is not large, basically fixed.
As the teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics at university 20 years ago is still in school, and it's still the focus."
But the knowledge point is basically unchanged, does not represent a single test topic type and repeated test questions.
In many universities, the examination will generally form a group of questions, and then the examination papers will be made up by senior teachers in the discipline, and the examination papers will also be attended by all teachers who are responsible for the department, so that the repetition of the test can be overcome to some extent.
But to develop a set of tests that are consistent with teaching and learning practice, the subjects are difficult to distribute properly according to the overall situation of students' learning, and there is also a need to master the teaching situation in a comprehensive manner, to analyse the degree of student learning in a comprehensive manner, so that the test propositions are difficult and
The exam is the command bar of university education, and what kind of examination, students will have a corresponding preparation program, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long term.
With regard to the student's letter of recommendation, Lanzhou has given high priority to the university and has deployed a restructuring programme throughout the school.
The teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct a self-examination of the examination and course completion examination, develop test paper propositions and related systems, at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of test papers propositions and audit links, refine the performance evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive evaluation of all stages of course teaching.
The solution of problems such as the single type of test, repetition of the topic and so on from the mechanism is the subject that university examinations need to face, of course, the corresponding system needs to be put in place, but kung fu is expensive in everyday life, the teacher needs to have full knowledge of the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content,
If I can't change the location of the branch for me, can I change it to an outlet?
So I don't have to give you more money?
The orders of the colleague have been delivered.
It's not finished.
What about GPS? It's not here.
Mrs. Kim's wedding photography (South Street store) There is no branch for the time being
Before taking pictures, because we didn't have a good time, we changed the time twice, and consultant Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, I chose a nice weekend shoot.
Mrs. Kim's staff, whether consultants, make-up artists or photographers, are superb.
It was my first formal makeup in my life, and I can't believe it. I'll be so good-looking one day, haha.
Xiaojie and another sister (I'm sorry I can't remember the name) make-up is super patient and natural.
The scenery was taken in Jiang Bay City, thanks to the good weather that day, it didn't feel very cold, while taking pictures, make-up artists from time to time paid attention to our clothes, headdresses, a little bit of badness immediately helped us sort.
The photographer was also very humorous and happy to take pictures one day later.
When choosing pictures, because I see many cases online, I don't want to let guests delete too many photos, but when we choose pictures, really, there's nothing to mean that we add pictures, 24 of them in the direct package, none of them have been added.
Today's photo was repaired, Lanlan sent it to me, and I saw two that didn't feel good, and they immediately helped me repair it.
To compare the photos our sister took before, I think our photos are really very satisfactory, simple and fresh, that's the style I want.
I really recommend that you go and announce Mrs. Hankin's wedding photo!
The price of the set is 3999 yuan.
Mrs. Kim is grateful for your sincere wishes for your happiness and great future!
How much is this set?
What conditions do you need to meet for $32?
That's good, there's no refund.
Your rider said he couldn't find it.

You walked down the street and suddenly found someone following you, and you were afraid to walk faster and faster and ran away.
The man chased after you: "Miss! Please wait!" (whole Japanese dialogue) You stopped at the convenience store door.
"Miss... I'm a director, I see you look beautiful and interested in participating in the reality show?"
You're confused and afraid it's a scam.

Sabah 3,200 newborn babies have no birth certificate due to special anti-counterfeiting paper
The Shaba National Registration Office said that since the beginning of October, it has been impossible to issue birth certificates to newborn babies due to the use of light for special anti-counterfeiting paper stocks, and to date 3,200 people have accumulated affected.
However, Keru Aminus, Director of the Bureau, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificate have been recorded in the system and will be replenished when anti-counterfeiting paper arrives next week.
At a press conference, he explained a 10-month-long story about the problem of printing paper in Sabah newspaper.
He said that the problem had arisen two months ago, and Sarawak faced the same problem.
One of the reasons for this is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in China.
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Saba newspaper is different from other regions, so it is not possible to borrow inventory from other states.
Keru Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on 8th to do some printing work.
"The Bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and return to Shaba immediately for the final stage of printing, estimated that two more working days (20 December) can be handed over to the applicant."
"We will notify applicants to go to every branch to pick up the paper."
He added that Saba has issued a total of 24,801 papers so far this year.
From 7 o'clock until now
Isn't that coming soon?
I mean food.
I'm in front of #PRS_ORG# and so on.
Well, thank you, because the restaurant says it's ready.

Education Information: Beijing compresses the proportion of special students enrolled in high school at the beginning of 2016 - Xinhua Net
On the 21st and 22nd of the day, the examination of special students enrolled in Beijing's junior high school was carried out by the unified organization of the regional religious committees.
This year, all regions of Beijing have reduced the proportion of admissions to special long-term students, and competition for special long-term students is more intense.
Take the East City district as an example, this year the proportion of primary and secondary school special students enrolled in the district does not exceed 5% of the total number of district admission plans, the number of planned admissions is 380, and the proportion of school admissions does not exceed 10% of the school admission plan.
Students with sports, art, technology and online registration are eligible to participate in the Special Student Admission Examination.
In order to facilitate students' near participation in the examination, the East City district continued last year's examination arrangement by setting up 1 to 2 examination sites in each school district, a total of 13 examination places.
The examination points are divided by the examination area, divided by the hour unit, and the examination day students will enter the examination point in different examination areas on time.

48 hours of nuclear acid negative, setting up "buffer zone" The State Council's joint anti-cooperative control mechanism issued a request to strengthen port city epidemic prevention and control - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 11th (Reporter Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tianqing) The State Council's joint anti-terrorism control mechanism issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring that personnel should leave land border port cities in the near future (except for
According to the notification, the time frame for the above request is from the date of determination and announcement of the port city scope by provincial and district municipalities until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notification also suggested that conditional port cities can study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within the jurisdiction.
The relevant head of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy, and people on both sides interact frequently.
Implementation of the differentiated management policy for the subregion, from one control of the spill line to two lines of defence, it is hoped to achieve the move ahead of the gate, compress the spill risk, achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with minimum social impact and minimum social cost.
In recent years, many indigenous concentrated epidemics have occurred in China, all of which have been imported through port cities outside China.
The above-mentioned notification noted that this exposed some problems such as the late warning of local epidemic monitoring, the failure to implement closed ring management by high-risk positions, the regular flow of nucleic acid detection into form, the lack of killing of cold chain items at all stages, the management of centralized isolation sites
The notification requires that work be done in nine areas, including improving the control mechanism of the epidemic in port cities, improving the early warning system for the monitoring of the epidemic, implementing border control measures, accelerating the completion of the short-board weakness of the port city, without relaxing, scientific precision to do control work,
The notification stressed that each port city should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control in parallel with the work of protecting people's lives, publish and freely communicate a hotline for protecting people's lives, regularly check the risks of supply of basic living materials, prices, etc., and promptly resolve and proactively respond to outstanding problems
According to the notification, the port cities referred to therein include open land, water and air ports in counties (city, district, flag), cities (state, state, union) and municipalities directly under the jurisdiction, the specific scope of which is determined and determined by provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the jurisdiction) according to

Oil pipeline video begins with the truth of 20 years of bloodthirsty killing by the U.S. Army - Xinhua Net
(Video Source: Oil Pipe)
On December 11, a microdocumentary called "The Killing Machine" from the oil pipeline platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the war in Afghanistan under the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American democracy through the war, 20 years of poor soldiers fighting, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and committing various crimes against humanity.
Misuse of drones to air attacks on civilian sites such as hospitals, schools, etc. distorts the humanity and establishes a killing group.
For 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military has set up a "black prison" to inflict torture and physical humiliation on the "suspect".
A single crime against humanity incites hatred among more Afghans.
As the video says, the American war against terrorism is becoming more and more counterproductive.
The war did not bring peaceful democracy and hope for prosperity to the Afghan people, only a country full of tears and countless killings and destruction.
Let's expose the truth about the bloodthirsty killing in the name of "anti-terrorism" in the United States, and the false face of American democracy!
I didn't want to see the following article, from a commercial point of view and from a preservation point of view, about why this customer's logistics company in the tax area helps to make cans, although canning belongs to deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of the tax logistics company, here
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, bags are the same raw materials as milk powder that listens to them, and there is no difference.
So everyone will certainly ask: Why is the shelf life of bags one year, and the shelf life of listening to bags is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bags so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers or mothers believe that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, like raw materials, it's just that everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who respond after eating out of this mentality and say that the taste or taste of listening is different!
Now let me tell you why it's expensive to listen to. Where is it?
Why is the difference in the price of their raw materials the same?
Because the majority of manufacturers when pricing consider that if the price of bags is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are very low, or that there is no profit, what does the manufacturer depend on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the price of hearing clothing to guarantee their profit space.
So most manufacturers are pushing for listening instead of bags.
And you want so many manufacturers to spend tens of millions or even billions of dollars on advertising each year, what is the cost?
You can think of it.
So, with the development of society, the marketing costs of the market, such as promotion staff in the mall, display costs in the mall, gift costs of products, advertising costs, etc. are also increasing.
So manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and they are listening, and their prices are constantly rising, in fact this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact their raw materials will not increase at most more than $3 or $4.
There is also a part of the brand, in order to promote their own products, regardless of means, link to doctors in hospitals, and they assist in the promotion of the products by drawing profits ranging from $30 to $80 from one listen.
The relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such methods of operation, in fact this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy bags of milk powder in the can at home, so that it saves costs, and increases the preservation and sealing of milk powder, which has no impact on children.
And don't think that the shelf life of the bag is longer than the bag, if the shelf life of the bag is the same as that of the bag after opening the bag, just say that the bag is not easy to save after opening the bag, it is easy to be mutated by the tide.

Don't scare people down on the starting line - Xinhua Net
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the fire of successful school books.
Many of today’s successful books promote the “best principles” – first assume or suggest that you can do it, and then tell you what you need to do.
It's like saying that it's really the most important and fundamental link across how to do it.
That's why these books have a common feature — either to do the best with the drum, or simply not doing anything; 100, or 0; or you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This is the best principle, and anyone who sees it will admit that it is the right thing to do, but 99% of people will be scared before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make a painful determination to be human again, to come to a 180 degree big transformation", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who follow the rules, follow the old and refuse to change, you prefer to shout "You want to change" in his ears, no doubt it is self-deception and self-deception.
The vast majority of people will be timid in the face of the word "transformation", wrapped up in their feet, difficult to resolve; or by the impulse of a moment pained the determination of "transformation" and courageously took the first step, but often the good scene is not long,
The sound of Mr. Martin's famous "From Tomorrow" is the most magical expression of this universal humanity.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's ability to "look at the door."
Perhaps, the "second best principle" is a way to make more ordinary people on the relatively successful path.
The core of the "goodness" principle is to lower the threshold - it encourages a theory that if you can't do 100, only 1 can be done: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, only small sand dunes on your door.
In short, as long as you do something, it's always stronger than not doing it.
Because the threshold has been significantly lowered, there is a greater chance that ordinary people will stick to it, and the probability of success will increase as long as everything persists.
It's just a little longer to follow the best principle of success.
In short, the "best principle" despite its appearance as a flag of success for all, it can ultimately inspire, in fact remains a minority; and the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

The reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency Xinin on December 11 (reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) reported from the Agriculture and Rural Office of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the stock of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared to last year, reaching 10.85 million tons
The popular name of the naked carp of the Qinghai Lake, the "single fish", is a unique and precious fish species in the Qinghai Lake, which plays a significant role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the ecological chain of water-fish-birds in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake fell sharply due to factors such as the large number of huntings and the increasing degradation of the environment in the breeding waters of naked carp, and in 2002 the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Red List of Chinese Species listed the naked carp of Qinghai Lake as an endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the sealing of lake fish, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing naked carp in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and Lake Area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, measures such as artificial breeding and release flows and cleaning of Qinghai Lake's main riverway into the lake, designing scientifically reasonable "fish lanes" have continued to increase the protection effort, and the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year after year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Qinghai Province, said that to date, Qinghai Lake Naked Carps have cumulatively implemented almost 180 million artificial breeding and release streams, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Qinghai Three River Source Area is an important ecological barrier and water resource area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification to the east in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Yangtze River region and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife and preserve the biodiversity of the Qinghai Plateau, Qinghai has issued a ban on fishing notice in key waters of Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since this year.

The restaurant only gave me one bag, to be packed in the bag, and the weather was cold.
Would you like to ask if the sale is in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I want to know if it's leaked or if someone took it away, thanks.
It's been an hour, and it hasn't been sent yet.
It's too long to see a fake article.
Give the unknown man a copy.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first leave at some point between the ages of 13-15, closing at about 50 years of age.
After that, it will be more regular every month under the condition of physical health.
But it's not regular to be able to accurately predict, about a week or so difference, it needs to be prepared in advance, sometimes bad luck will turn over the car (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, the amount of blood and the degree of pain varies from person to person, some three days, some one week; some less flow, some large blood collapse; some have no reaction, some have pain to move to the ambulance, pain will change over time, before pain does not mean
Menstruation cannot be controlled, bleeding 24 hours a day in the days starting and ending, and can only be done with sanitary towels or sanitary cotton bars to prevent blood from flowing into clothing chairs.
Painful menstruation is mainly due to the secretion of prostate glands, and the physiology period has not yet reached the onset of pain. Eating Broven can effectively relieve pain in that month, and eating after the beginning of pain can be of little use.
Before the physiology period, it is easy to pull the stomach because of the excessive release of uterus blood and prostate gland.
If it's about to come to the cycle, it's impossible to pull the stomach, basically in two days.
The sanitary towel should be replaced once every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, remove sleep time, the worst case is to replace six times a day, seven days a month, that is 42 pieces, if you add 50 pieces prepared in advance, it is not a piece per month.
(Mod here, sanitary cotton bars don't have to be changed regularly, about five or six hours can be changed once, up to eight hours)
The period of menstruation hormones may be more violent, the ovulation period will also be unstable due to hormonal changes in the body, which is very unfortunate, and the body gives itself a trip.
But official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control emotions is still high, and will not use emotional problems as an excuse.
The flow is not just blood, which contains the fall of the uterus.
After the end of the menstrual period, the uterine membrane is thinner, and then slowly thicken, it can be understood that the uterus is a house, every month build a house (the inner membrane thickens) ready to welcome guests, guests did not come,
Menstruation is not convenient, for decades to come, 24 hours of bleeding every month, and there will be pain in the stomach and waist, who wants to?
But a man can be born because his mother comes through menstruation, menstruation to prepare you for the first time in the world to live in a house for 10 months, and everyone should thank their mother for her healthy coming through menstruation.
Many things have been suppressed for women before, society has said that brainwashing women is dirty, shameful, everyone thinks that's what it is, but the times have changed.
If someone feels nausea about menstruation, thinks that women's bodies are disgusting about preparing for life, it should not be said in the public court, girls stand up, don't think this again, never experienced, never experienced, never understood men, don't forget
Finally, sisters, try the sanitary cotton strip, it's really good.
Today is winter and holiday, and it's more disappointing to send mistakes.
To order another meal for the children
I hope that the store will be busy and check the product.
Is the foot bath tub bubble foot mahjong leaked electricity?
Choosing the right foot bath basin can play a good foot therapy health role, and today the U.S. editor will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
As people's health awareness increases, the foot bath basin is increasingly popular with consumers, and a large number of different products have emerged in the market, ranging from more than 100 to thousands of yuan.
On the relevant data surface, compared to traditional household electricity, health-care household electricity sales such as foot bath basins explode, but foot bath basins do not have specialized industry standards, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!"
Mr. Li told reporters recently that he bought a foot bath for his father to make a birthday present, but his father felt numbness when he soaked his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath basin, didn't think about turning off the vibration function, and the father felt numbness in the bottom of his feet.
Mr. Li tried with an electric pen, and the pen was brightened, and Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was electric.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the businessman's attitude was good, although Mr. Li was still upset despite dropping his foot bath.
Because he found that this long-established foot bath now has no clear and detailed industry regulations on setting the highest temperature, which people to apply to, what materials to guarantee harmless.
But in general, the foot bath basin will not have electricity problems, but it does not exclude a few products that are not strictly closed when leaving the factory.
So when buying, choose a separate foot bath.
Water and electricity are separated, and there are no security risks.
At the same time, you can take an electric pen test at will.

So if these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want to, because he can't park down there, he can't send it up.

Ding: To friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all my friends for the humanitarian relief they have given during the long period of more than 30 years since our loved ones were killed, especially the relief that has not been interrupted so far since I personally appealed to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Today, the vast majority of the victims' parents have died, and the orphans have grown up into domestic employment.
It's your righteousness to help these troubled families through the most difficult times.
Currently, the new crown epidemic is raging around the world, and most donors have retired year after year.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to suspend the humanitarian contribution of the Tiananmen Mothers' Group, which should have been the perfect end of this humanitarian rescue campaign.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please friends understand!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
pottery industry: Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian relief undertaken by the All-American Learning Association (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of carrying out humanitarian relief, the All-American Institute of Learning and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project's implementers often intersect with each other.
(Apple Daily Map: Tiananmen Mother's website is handled by the pottery industry.)pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Rescue funds are often not delivered successfully to the hands of six or four difficulties.
In 1994, the teacher recommended that a special group be set up by the mother of Tiananmen to coordinate and distribute the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "64 Orphan Education Fund", which was implemented 11 years later, and in 2009, after graduating from the university of all 64 orphans, the MCDF established the "64 Orphaned Old People's Special Rescue Fund" and has been implemented to date.
Funding for these projects came mainly from campus and social donations in the 64th year, generous donations from individuals, and support from the Brothers University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Foundation for Labour Reform Research.
Until last year, 31 years later, 64 people finally received a partial contribution from Hong Kong in the name of 64 years.
During this period, China's Human Rights are also implementing their humanitarian relief projects independently.
We understand that Mr. Ding's call to stop the 64 donations is for donors to consider, and we are indeed some retired old people, whose income is not as good as before retirement, and we would like to thank Mr. Ding for his letter.
We will respect the decision of the refugees to terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if necessary.
Thank you and pay tribute to those who have been so generous for years and risk delivering humanitarian aid.

Thank you for the rabbit's review, it was also said that rejection of the ancient wind is not suitable for the ancient wind, and I didn't expect the finished product to come out too beautiful.
Thanks to Dandan's approval, your satisfaction will keep us full of electricity forward, and we will continue to refuel!
This photography studio is really great and strongly recommended to all the little partners!
From reception, make-up, clothing, lighting, photography to later.
Make-up artists are especially delicate, will match your style with suitable makeup, and cosmetics are also the first line of large brands.
Not to mention Mr. Tan Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and two kittens are playing with them.
We work in Beijing, and the good movie buildings in Beijing need to line up for six months in advance, and our colleagues have taken pictures in Beijing, and they feel just so so so.
I specifically sought this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, and it feels that this is also the short version of most people, the photographer's brother will capture and record the natural wonderful moment.
Make-up artist, photographer, late design, a good team.
We and everyone around us are applauding the film.
My girlfriend has been recommended for the past, and her girlfriend just saw the film is equally happy.
I hope that such a studio is not buried, more people find ta and shoot it in their own style, rather than a thousand articles.
Thank you very much for the five star reviews, both of you are very thoughtful and creative newcomers, we are creative studios, as long as customers like us to do our best to complete, thank you for meeting each other.
Sweet and thoughtful assistants, as well as lively photographer teachers, everyone in the team is super nice. It's a wonderful shot, hard to forget an experience, and the effect of shooting is much better than I imagined. Everyone has worked hard, thank you very much.
Thank you Xiaoyu for your comments. It's also a reason to know you from Ho and Hut to Qinjiang Island. Trust in us is thousands of kilometers away. I am happy to know you.
How do I give money?
The food that was sent back has already been delivered.
No rider receives
Now the restaurant staff called me.
A programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you want to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't think about it, it's better to learn on your own, after all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes six months to learn.
But if it is intended to enter the industry, training is really a very good choice, especially for those who are self-control and weak.
If you have more self-control, you can choose to learn yourself, but it will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, look at the teacher strength of this institution, if the teacher power is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning, of course some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing this training institution, it is best to check out the students from this institution, after all, only students from the institution know what the institution is like, and the course is good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer the question you asked, because there is no certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, the profession, the age, the language you want to learn, and even the city, will have to do with the industry you study or want to engage in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you have graduated from computer science, then if there is enough time I personally recommend self-study, which is the least efficient and cost-effective, now many offline training institutions are actually very good, but one study costs high, two investment time more, basic needs focus training
But if I say these things, self-study is easy, now many learning resources on the network are free, or go to station b also has many training resources, if you don't find resources, you can also contact me through a profile, get free resources, or detailed advice.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, it is recommended to go to training institutions to learn, so that learning does not take a lot of effort, the teacher explains in detail, there are questions and people to answer, and there is also
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal quotas, recommend to the company after studying, so that the interview link for finding work can save a lot.

The first biennial exhibition of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News Agency
Saudi Arabia's first biennial exhibition of contemporary art - the two-year exhibition of contemporary art - was officially opened to the public on 11 December in the Dirije JAX Art District, northwest of Saudi capital Riyadh.
The biennial exhibition was jointly planned by the Saudi Dirie Biennial Exhibition Foundation and the UCCA Yurens Center for Contemporary Art in China, and the director of the UCCA Yulens Center for Contemporary Art in China.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "touching stones across the river", implying the reform strategy adopted during the period of socio-economic transformation, and also reflecting the current situation of socio-cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The exhibition covers nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: Touching the Stone across the River, Passage as an experiment, Thinking on the Edge, Walking to the Public, Beautiful New World, and
Of these, the number of works by 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibition, covering various forms such as painting, installation art and performing art; 12 Chinese artists also received attention, some artists used recycled materials in innovative ways to create, such as Xu Ice's
Buckley, Chief Executive Officer of the Dirije Biennial Exhibition Foundation, said he hoped that the biennial exhibition would establish an international dialogue that would give global audiences an opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's vibrant cultural industry and creative community and strengthen interaction.
"The goal of the biennial exhibition is dual, both to engage Saudi contemporary art in global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art," Tan Yu said.
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the biennial opening week, and artists, exhibitors and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary artistic development.

Yunnan: Integrated regulation of rural public service job management - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency Kunming on December 12th (reporter Lin Bingfeng) to continue to do good job support for the poor and consolidate the expansion of the achievements of the fight against poverty, Yunnan Province has recently put in place policies related to promoting rural revitalization of rural public welfare jobs
The relevant head of the Yunnan People's Society Office introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 44.83 million rural public welfare jobs for employment in rural difficult groups such as the poverty-free labour force, which plays an important role in helping people out of poverty achieve employment gains, consolidate the gains of poverty
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments such as Yunnan People's Association, Rural Revitalization, Finance, and mainly unified norms on the target range, fund management, job development, job management and other aspects of recruitment of rural public service personnel at the grass-roots level.
In terms of job development settings, the new regulations clearly define the setting according to the principles of "placed on demand, staffed by people, dynamic management, total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible for it" and "one person on one job, voluntary open, unified management".
The recruitment process must be conducted in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, audit, publicity, recruitment, pre-service training and placement.
In addition, the new regulations clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development department of rural public service posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy modalities for rural public service jobs, provide that each rural public service job development department should purchase accident injury commercial insurance for persons placed in rural public service posts; require relevant departments to regularly monitor
The address is wrong.
Hello.
Can orders be cancelled
I reordered
Has it been cancelled?
Secondly, although the right has a long time in history, but not long, so short because giving a little sunshine will shine, drinking a little water will sweat; a little ambition will have to look at a little hair and be struck will be attached.
But the truth is that the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right should not be denied in terms of ending the cultural revolution by defining the standards of truth, developing the economy to improve technology and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights guarantees.
Third, as far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about him and respect him; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is serious about China's social problems.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, and I think that revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's lives, political groups are mixed with mud, and foreign countries take advantage of it.
Fourthly, change or improve China's attitude of patience and responsibility for the country's people, and political speculation attempts to take a chill in the fire, which is not the right, it is an asshole.
Talk to the left again.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of times and politics abandoned.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right words and analyse their ideas when needed, then the left does not make this up, because what the left wants is precisely the bad things that the Communist Party throws away!
Five, recently I saw some friends anti-thiefs and left-wings, and it was quite real, and I didn't think it was necessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitors and left epilepsy, it's a one-size-fits-all, and it's unreasonable.
And don't try to prove that we are right, and don't think about making anti-thief and leftist admissions.
I told my friends this way: when anti-thief curses you five hairs, when left curses your right dog, it is precisely proof that our middle road is right!
Many people have ideals when they are young, and when they are old, they forget the ideals, or pursue them, but become paranoid.
And the ideal is moving away, and even the dragon's youth eventually becomes a vicious dragon.
On the one hand, I think that generally refers to restraint and freedom, and China's genes from historical culture lead to China as a whole should be left.
The right side of the country is free, focused on efficiency and development, the left side strengthens regulation, and focuses more on fairness and security.
Now society as a whole wants to focus more on equity, while China and the United States compete, the left side is positive, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, the praise is over.
I didn't say anything. Flowers are so noble.
During the past two years, the blockade and siege of Huahua chips by the U.S. Emperor has not only put Huauan in an unprecedented dilemma, but also caused huge losses to "American family" enterprises.
The direct consequence of the U.S.'s pressure on China's chip industry is that its own enterprises and allied enterprises simultaneously block China's chip industry, and the direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, causing chip production enterprises to lose their R&D investment
Today, the lack of core has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies, mobile phones, and almost all industries that use chips have suffered from it.
In order to master the autonomy of the chip, the technology giants of more and more countries have started to move towards the path of "beautiful".
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control, control the development of China's semiconductor industry, recent old U.S. moves are frequent, and host the "chip summit"; and invite 64 giants to form a semiconductor alliance and allocate funds to support the U.S.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on the station's electricity, and it was likely that it would take away the table's job.
This is so certain because Intel, as the old technology giant of the U.S., has been farming for decades in the semiconductor field, with a large pool of talent and technological reserves, must rise quickly in the short term to defeat Tai Po power.
However, the decision by Intel was not taken care of by the founder of Tai Jing Electric Zhang.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Chung said amazingly, and he said nothing about Intel's move to invest in the construction of a crystal factory: Intel's chip substitution factory is quite ironic.
Zhang's concern about Intel's entry into the crystal circle field is due to Zhang's ongoing grievances with Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has been a bead in the manufacturing industry of the U.S. Empire, and has been at the top of the world.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been held by a few powerful people.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips were designed, manufactured and sealed by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has left some small enterprises overburdened, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face huge production line construction costs.
At the invitation of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show division of labour and cooperation. In 1984 Zhang knew that there were companies specializing in chip design, he thought that since there was a special design, then it could be established a factory dedicated to crystal manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang's vision became reality, and the electricity was born.
Taik Electric has targeted the main business at the single link of "crystalgy processing", not designing, but providing substitute services for crystal manufacturing.
The station electricity that was just created at the time was small in front of Intel's giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang was looking for Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that TCC electricity was only a manufacturing link in the chip industry, it was clear that some self-esteem was high, could not see TCC electricity, and determinedly refused to invest in TCC electricity.
Zhang also decided that Intel was unable to see the crystal process service at the time.
I didn't expect to see the giants of crystal manufacturing services in that year, but now I want to start doing crystal substitute work.
Therefore, Zhang Chung feels that Intel's entry into the crystal replacement is ironic.
Today, the market value of the electricity is more than Intel.
In the face of the powerful attack of the buildup of electricity, Intel naturally dares not to stand firm.
Today, the station's electricity has hit the 3nm chip, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
It's not waiting.

Today I came to see some strange hot searches.
What is normal love?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: February, the rise of the Dragon, the price increase of the Good Li's friend, the freight drop event, the spread of the mood formed a wave peak, and then [index decline] (sliding curve) eventually dissipated, if secondary
They seem to be no different from the model of the evolution of the web.
What is an abnormal passion?
The random selection of six hot searches in the same event presented [single peak], [saw teeth], and [break cliff].
[single peak] means people heat up, quickly rushing the hot search list, attracting public attention; [saw teeth] means periodic heating, ensuring that the topic is hot; [break cliff] means collective evacuation, which performs the "functionality" of the hot search, received new tasks,
In Figure 9, the heat wave peak of one event coincides with another event's wave valley, the time is not bad in seconds, it must be a unified batch of marines received the task and opened a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations is visible: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attracts attention, which is responsible for Kop, which leads to war, which shifts eyes, which affects perceptions, which misleads judgment, which incites emotions, which holds decisions,
Dissemination is a science that leaves aside all subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will be nowhere to lose.
Anyone who walks through must leave traces, such marks, we dig together.

For the first time, countries such as Mauritius have found cases of infection with the Omicron strain - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 12, integrated Xinhua News Agency foreign journalists reported that Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi reported for the first time recent cases of infection with the new crown virus Omicron strain.
Mauritius reported for the first time two cases of infection with the Omicron strain in the country on 10th.
According to Mao Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpar, one infected person arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa; another infected person was a local resident of Mauritius who contacted a person who had recently returned to South Africa and tested positive for nuclear acid on November 30
After hospital isolation treatment, the results of both infected people's nucleic acid tests changed negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on 10th that three cases of infection with the Omicron strain were confirmed for the first time in the country.
All three were students who returned from abroad earlier this month and were not admitted to hospital due to their mild condition.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Government of Serbia has constantly increased its anti-control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter by plane will be required to undergo a nuclear acid test at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health also announced on 10th that it will begin vaccination of the new crown vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 years in the country.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Kunbize Chibunda, said on 9th that three cases of Omicron strain infection were detected for the first time in the country.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing of 12 new crown positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found these three cases of infection.

At first, it was introduced by friends because of trust, so I chose to look at my budget at the beginning of 70,000 for a basic renovation.
Come to the store and start a series of tricks.
I first came to the store to show them my family chart, they didn't go to the field to measure the house, they could offer me that my 135 house 70,000 can be handled, probably to show me their materials and don't know what brand material they are.
Their second trick is that as soon as you get to the store, you'll drag you back the deposit (and once you get the money, you'll never get out unless you have enough experience to fight them theoretically).
When I hesitate to pay the deposit, they invite their so-called managers to tell you how much discount we can give you if you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit, and I am an example of living being deceived, when the mind is impulsive, to pay more than 10,000 deposits.
He offered me a lot of questions 70,000 not including electricity and water modifications, not including any doors and cabinets and bathrooms, and these three are the cost of the base.
In addition to these, their service point fees are higher than those of other companies.
I lost my trust in this company and didn't say anything clearly at the beginning to let me sign the contract.
When I went to find them and refunded their money, they showed a very experienced look, and there was a special small team to deal with you.
Whatever happens, it's a customer's problem to bite to death. They're completely irresponsible.
All kinds of discharge responsibility, there are many details, don't want to say all kinds of tears, anyway don't choose them, because my friends find their decorated house is also bad quality, and later I will give you various costs.
Father, they were the dragon head decorations that were lied to, and now they have become great beauty, as if they were closed again and changed to other things.
So don't choose this kind of father's renovation company.
Later, when you choose, you will take a hundred degrees to look at these inquiries because the renovation is not small money.
If you want to ask the merchants, please log in or register first
It is strictly forbidden to publish various forms of business reviews, please see the details of the business register statement
The People's Review Kunming Renovation Design Channel provides you with the latest business information such as the Grand American 360 integrated home fitting address, telephone, business hours, find the Renovation Company, and get a public comment
It's so horrible, please cancel the order in less than 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
Well, then don't cancel this conversation, and if I don't return my money in 5 to 10 days, you will be pursued.
I asked if it could be cancelled in less than 15 minutes.
The mouthwater chicken should be ripe, but it's raw meat and can't eat.
The sky is about 14 years old - Xinhua Net - and the meteor shower is about 14 days ago.
As the last large meteor shower this year, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, the twin meteor showers, one of the three meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will be huge on December 14,
On December 13, 2018, the twin meteor shower was shot in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers are periodic comets, but the twin meteor showers are asteroid Fahrenheit No. 3200, an Apollo asteroid.
The twin meteor shower is also currently known as the second meteor shower not "bred" by comets.
The board member of the Astronomy Society of Tianjin City and an expert in AstronomyCorp said that, as in the case of the big film of the Year, the twin meteor showers generally appear at the end of the year, "the screening period" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, together with the meteor shower and the meteor showers of the Genius are known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
A notable feature of the meteor shower is that the meteor body is slower, rich in color, and there are a lot of meteors, which are suitable for both eyesight and astronomy photography beginners to shoot.
The twin meteor shower was shot in Tianjin State on December 13, 2020.
Astronomy forecasts show that this year's meteor shower will be huge, at around 1500 hours on December 14, when ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, the number of meteors that can be seen every hour when radiation points are right above the top of the head) is 150.
The indicator chart of the Meteor Rain is recommended.
"At last year, the twin meteor showers that fell in the dark last year impressed people, but this year's twin meteor showers will be disturbed by moonlight and a little discounted.
On November 11, the moon is full of moons, bright moons will interfere with observations, so that the moon will fall in the middle of the night, and the radiation point of the meteor shower will rise relatively high at this time.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the hours behind the end of the night, but be careful to keep warm."
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a high altitude, small light, open view in the northeast direction in suburban or rural areas, and wait patiently until the moon sets down.
It should be noted that the flow of meteor showers in all directions is large, and it is not necessary to keep an eye on the radiation point of meteor showers.
Friends who like photography want to shoot beautiful meteor showers, it is best to choose wide angles and large lenses, using high ISO and maximum halo when shooting.
Based on stability and sustainability considerations, tripods, back-up batteries and fast gate lines are also essential.
Shu Li Peng reminded me.
What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the subject should refer to LCD TV, while laser TV and LCD TV differ in market positioning, mainly the following two points:
First, laser TV focuses more on the large screen market.
Compared to the market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV clearly focuses more on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is the product of the large screen.
Currently, the mainstream LCD TV size is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while laser TV size is generally more than 75 inches, the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meeting users' demand for large screen color power.
In recent years, laser TV has been increasing in volume and sales worldwide, accounting for more than 60% of total television sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Chu Yikang's forecast, the laser TV market will grow by more than 140% in 2020 and continue to grow at a high rate.
The reason for such good performance in the big screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye care.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV wide reflection, the light from the laser light source does not directly enter the eye, compared to the LCD TV backlight source, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation of the eye is smaller.
The Saixi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and the ophthalmology specialists at the Beijing Association Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through strict comparison tests of laser TV and LCD TV watching under the same conditions as the population.
The data confirms that laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
In a time when vision health is increasingly valued, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color electricity market.
Secondly, laser TV focuses more on the high-end market.
Contrary to the constant downward price of LCD TV, the price of laser TVs sold in the market is currently more than 10,000 yuan, and with the upgrading of size and light sources, the price gradually rises.
Why is laser TV sold so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
With the constant development of light sources and technological levels, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, laser TV's projection distance is shorter than traditional projection equipment, can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience within a short distance, the space required is small, and the host is small, and the space is small.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 brightness.
In addition, the heat is lower, the equipment is less lost, and the television service life is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser television models carry real 4K super high-quality painting quality, artificial intelligence systems, imitation screens and other cutting-edge technologies that can bring more shock to users.
It's not about false demand, it's about products that are broken down by demand, about the quality of the picture and the ratio of input to output, laser TV is not a dish for video and audio players, want to balance the big screen with insufficient viewing environment, can try, everything is good and bad,
Simply put, the ultra-wide angle close focus projector, laser TV, has to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors in order to close to the screen, which is not the best optical design.
In order to shield some of the ambient light, the use of a microstructure Fneer screen is costly, and the price of 80 inch can basically replace a 65 inch liquid crystal.
And one thing I especially hate about projectors is that the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes, you reflect to the ceiling, the eyes can't see, not to be more real LCD TV.
And if the projection screen is not a broad reflection, it can't be like it at all.
It is really hard to ignore the heat spot (light spot) effect of high gain curtains, which reflects a large amount of light into the eyes at some angle.
There is no branch for the time being.
With the date of the appointment, the younger sister sent me a choice of schedule, and the reply information was more timely ~
Before going to see the shooting work in the store, more are outdoor wedding dress, the shooting is beautiful, and there is a lot of shooting style involved.
After that day, I briefly shared my thoughts with my sister, very patiently helped me try two sets of style clothes I fixed up, finally finalized the make-up pattern ~ the photographer will put some props before shooting, will guide the movement, and more refined on each detail.
But maybe because I didn't share specific shooting ideas with you, it wasn't the style I wanted, but it should be nice.
After shooting, the photographer will help to select the photos, communicate the style of the later, and feel very careful.
It takes about half a month to fix the film and wait for the effect ~
The second time, the real type of king's meal event - most of the clothes in the whole field can choose one shot.
Finally, I chose a black dress and experienced different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about two hours, makeup + shooting, and the photographer responsible for shooting is the younger brother after 95, feeling a little bit green, hoping to give more advice after the customer shoot action guidance.
Selecting Quality Shops at the Visual and Artistic Photography Gallery
It's on the front page, and look at Queenie.
It's very patient to go to the store first to fill out the name phone and then choose clothing, wedding dress can be chosen, change three or four sets of clothes is very patient, choose after makeup for a long time, service attitude is good, after shooting will teach you how to make up, it is
The environment is good overall.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are almost three make-up locations, and inside there is a studio.
[Service] Very passionate and careful.
The stylist is patient.
The photographer will also teach you how to move seriously.
Unsatisfactory, the photographer will also take the initiative to provide a supplement.
[Experience] It may be a little too much modeling, and the original eyelids were sticked out with three eyelids.
The eyebrows have also been shaved, and it is a little embarrassing not to draw eyebrows on a daily basis.
The photo was given for 10 days, but the effect of the P chart is not very satisfactory, and it feels that the eyelids are still obvious.
Because it's not clear what style to try two sets of results to pick, or choose a black dress.
After choosing the clothes, I started to make makeup hair. The hairdresser and the makeup artist's little sister were super patient in helping me to get the effect very satisfied.
After making up my makeup hair, I started to take pictures. The photographers throughout the process directed me to position, and the process was easy and harmonious.
After shooting, he carefully selected four of his favorites as a fixer, and the younger brother said that the 15 pieces were finished and the ending was very satisfactory.
I haven't replied for 3 days... because your system can't recognize my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay.
I'm going to pay freight every time.
Can you excuse me first and collect my monthly fee after you investigate?
Small umbrellas for insurance, is it reliable?
The umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the setting conditions: According to the instructions of the Regulation of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised 2015), becoming an insurance brokerage company must meet three key words: shareholders, sponsors have no significant illegal records in the last three years, a minimum limit of RMB 50 million can be established and must be agreed by the Chinese Insurance Supervisory Board.
These three articles are actually very demanding, and to sum up it is necessary to have the strength to pass the approval of the national authority of the silver insurance supervisory board (supervising insurance companies and banks in the country), shareholders should have a good way of doing things, as an insurance brokerage small umbrella insurance, insurers
At this point, it's good and trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star serious disease insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest and Tai Super Mary 5 serious disease insurance, the claimant and insurer are both Thai life, small umbrella insurance is only a third party intermediary
From the point of view of the payment model: Internet platform products, because there are fewer operating costs of business networks, and the cost of operating employees' salaries, so Internet products are generally higher in prices, and the payment method is flexible, supports monthly payments, reduces the payment pressure of insured persons, and can
This is still very good.
It can be considered.
From the point of view of the professionalism of the operator: this is particularly important, because insurance is a very demanding industry, many Internet products customers can insure themselves, there are many misunderstandings, in health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective consciousness when insured, feel healthy or
I myself have done insurance phone sales in "Tong Microinsurance" (as in the case of small umbrellas, which is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is true, also reliable, not based on people, there are no professional practitioners in the Internet channel, and there are many sales misleading.
For example: 1 yuan insurance insurance, 6 million yuan insurance insurance, buy insurance to send mobile phones, receive 60,000 health insurance free of charge, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid heavyness is light, and will not tell the insurer that 1 yuan in the first month, the next month is required according to normal fees, ranging from dozens to 200
I thought it could cost one dollar and the insurance company paid $6 million (the pie fell out of the sky).
Free delivery of mobile phones is the last number of insurance policies such as 6666,8888, and if the winning text message is sent, they do not convert themselves and no one reminds them.
(This is another pit for insurers) to receive 60,000 free health insurance, which is short-term, if only on this, there are no other business risks, if there is serious illness, 60,000 can do what, can't solve the problem, and later life begins to run naked.
Currently, the country is also severely combating misleading Internet insurance sales.
So overall, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, and the problem is the professionalism and professional conduct of business people.
In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have wider products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products have better cost-effectiveness than Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers, insured products under the line, saving 2000-3000 yuan per year for each person.
If you have any questions, please communicate and communicate with me.
I: Mingya Insurance Broker, has three years of enterprise management training experience, serves nearly 1,000 enterprise users, cooperates with more than 100 insurance companies, before insuring, I will start from the customer's needs, customize insurance products for customers, in insurance, for customers' goods more than three,
Growing up with every customer for life.
I hope my answer will help the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is the insurance business where the insurer can independently complete all insurance processes after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all steps can be done by the insurer independently.
Although Internet insurance insurance does not have a "ceremonial sense" or even printed paper contracts, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of electronic contracts at all.
This model is somewhat similar to the "telephone sales" of the flow line operation, but this purchase insurance will also have a fatal problem, which is that the follow-up service may not keep up with.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract for decades, and when we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether this "intermediate" we choose is a "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and will also provide us with services many years later?

It'll be enough to replenish the discount code.
No problem, remember that there is no need to arrange a return, I have bought another one and don't want to waste it
Thank you for your help.
From before to now, I have opposed any form of slander and verbal abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can embrace everything, but it is to eliminate this villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it's this uncivilized style to resist first.
I have taken a non-response attitude since you started sending Facebook and friends requests, and then published ads, and until you tried to publish the so-called place of my home and father's name on social media.
You have intensified your efforts not only to continue to feed me at the frequency of six meals a day, but also to continue to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some hidden, humiliating remarks about me, my appearance, my body, my well-being, what kind of strawberries I grow on my bed,
How do you know I later received comments from many friends about your Facebook friend's account that uploaded a picture of you and sexually harassing ingredients.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can't keep quiet anymore.
After I uploaded the news of the alarm, you didn't dissipate at all, but you became more and more aggressive.
I don't care what your political background is, and no matter what status you are, in our society, there is a need for gender respect.
Yes, you can continue to say that you are just caring and paying attention to me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your drawing or you can continue to make all kinds of offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't, and I can't stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you, and my appearance and body don't need you to comment.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to let others humiliate themselves so much in exchange for fame.
Friends ask me, is it okay?
I said good, you wouldn't believe either.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like this.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic qualities will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of people.
I cut out some of the messages for everyone to comment on.
No one can pretend to be you for the post you sent yourself.
I can only say that you are a public enemy of civilization.
I'll laugh with my heart.

Three U.S. carriers gather around China The most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional Pro-China media multi-dimensional coverage: latest news on China-US relations: the latest satellite images show that three U.S. carriers are gathering around China; U.S. media also revealed that the most powerful
According to the Chinese think tank, the Strategic Situation Perception Platform in the South China Sea, on January 9, the satellite discovered the USS Carl Vinson carrier near the Barabak Strait.
The Barabak Strait connects the South Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic point on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform anticipates that the Carl Vincent will be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the aircraft carrier Carl Vincent on board F-35C fighter aircraft and CMV-22 Fish Eagle.
The U.S. military carrier, now operating upstream in the Pacific, in addition to the USS Carl Vincent, has a USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3.
Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier squadron for the first time, which belonged to the 314th Fighter Attack squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in Asia and the Pacific with the USS Ronald Reagan based in Yokohama, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the "Shangplan Lake" missile cruiser, the "Stokdar" missile destroyer, etc.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Strategic Situation Perception Platform" published the latest satellite picture showing three U.S. carriers gathering around China.
Three U.S. carriers gather around China's most powerful weapons rarely visited Guam on January 17, 2022, the U.S. military carrier CMV-22B flight route.
(Webber @South China Strategic Situation Perception) Also reported on January 17 by CNN that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam last weekend.
USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine with 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the United States Navy base in Guam last Saturday (January 15th).
The U.S. three carriers gather around China's most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam Analysis says this sends a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The three U.S. carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam, and China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The figure is China's Long Summer Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit to Guam by Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating America's capabilities, flexibility, readiness and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indian region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarine".
The whereabouts of the 14 thunderstorm submarines in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunderboats the most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad. This system also includes well-launched ballistic missiles located on the mainland of the United States, as well as bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads such as B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta, the market value evaporated by $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded "to face unprecedented competition," why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, whose revenues are mainly derived from advertising, and the advertising company that makes money today has its own channel of traffic.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and so on, whatever function positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance," and many apps externalize Meta's advertising, through Meta's advertising platform is realized.
But the times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta has difficulty getting data information from users, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users, and it will be clear whether users allow App to get their information, and most people's normal reaction is certainly not allowed.
Next, if Google stabs another knife, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (the weight of this factor is not sure how high, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from companies that contribute to China's maritime business.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about hundreds of people, and there are several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is a bypassed advertising channel, and most of the burned money is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the byte TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from the byte in the previous two years.
Every agency in the country is helping bytes to go to Meta for advertising, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't been special about it lately, but I'm sure it won't be better than before.
The stage of large-scale money burning by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not going well.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets look not only at middle income, but more importantly at what the future expects.
It is clear that Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg spoke about the metaspace.
The metaspace should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the realization cycle of the metaspace is longer, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook now, with $10 billion to $20 billion in revenue every year, in fact Facebook is very crisisful, and there is nothing safe to protect the city compared to other Internet enterprises and high-tech companies.
Although some of his social software is now more high in daily life, it is also a mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but face the rapid development of Tiktok, Facebook has no confidence, and subversion is a blinking effort.
In the short term, there is no hope of success, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company and constantly searching for new tracks, but I think his race choice is wrong, it is not going back.
