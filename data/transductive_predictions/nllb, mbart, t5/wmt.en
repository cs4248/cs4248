Is there any way to punish him?
I'm not going to do anything like this again.

Students singing the lead at the Zhejiang Academic Annual Meeting Research results open the mind - Xinhua Network
A series of brain-opening academic achievements were recognized last night at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual conference of Zhejiang University.
The main researchers of these results are students who cover the environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities and other major fields, and students start from a curious idea to create many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won international awards domestically.
Biosensors: Your Family Medical Doctor
Zhang Dixing, a doctoral student at the College of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor at the end of a smartphone, only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to breathe a little bit, and this instrument can test your health from the gas you exhale."
Zhang Dian said that the sensor was connected to smartphones and that health reports would be shown on the phones once the gas was exhaled.
Smart bracelets that can detect health conditions in the market are usually measured by physical parameters such as temperature, pulse and so on.
The biosensor uses graphene as a new material, its target is chemical elements, and its acute sense of smell allows it to reflect physical health more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgery Light: Doctor's High Energy Eye
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lamps are also used in the operating room.
The invention won a silver prize at the 44th Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions in Switzerland this year.
Zhu Linqing, a master student at the Academy of Photoelectric Science and Engineering, Shin Junfeng's team opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamps.
"Many diseases are not detected and removed early, and are related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
Shen Junfei said that if doctors can't see all the tumor tissues in time, for example, when cancer is examined early, then cancer cells will spread.
This smart surgical lamp has four disks, which enhance the difference between different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color homogeneity and shadowlessness of the spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This smart surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Zhejiang University Medical School, the Zhejiang University Medical School, and the Children's Hospital, which is affiliated with Zhejiang University, for better feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: saving water and coolness
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, wipe a lot of soap, squeeze a bit of handwashing fluid, and students like Li Xiangxiang invent a set of air handwashing devices.
As long as we stand on the washing table of the device, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a gas cylinder.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the water tap and combines with the water.
So we can wash our hands!
The colorful reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of handwashing through this method is the same as ordinary handwashing methods.
The device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driver, can guarantee the level of cleanliness and save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Summit of Major Challenges, the invention was the only gold prize in many of the world's top universities.
Please arrange to be restored to me as soon as possible, thx
Please cancel the order and return the cash, don't score, and don't use #PRS_ORG# anymore!
Bones and hot pickles are not suitable for children to eat
If so, please order as soon as possible
Not for a while, thank you.
He told me to tell you where he was.
I'm not waiting to cancel the order.
I bought #PRS_ORG#, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can I change it?
Or cancel the order
Okay, I'm in trouble.
I think it makes sense to have a certificate - an emergency certificate
This is one of the skills I feel important in addition to the driving license!
To popularize: First aid measures are actually emergency relief in the event of an emergency, i.e. prior to the arrival of an ambulance.
It is well known that there is still a period of time in the process of arriving the ambulance after the accident, and it is this time that is the most crucial.
This time is when emergency care is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, brain bleeding, breathing stoppage, then our window of life would only be four minutes, gold four minutes!
So the people around you know how important emergency is!
When someone falls next to us, we can save him through professional knowledge, rather than standing there stupidly and without moving and doing nothing, this feeling of helplessness is terrible.
"In China, our official data indicates that three million people die unexpectedly each year, the most dangerous being cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
Seventy-eight per cent of casino hotels in Las Vegas can be saved, and less than 1 per cent in Shanghai and Beijing."
This is what the first reaction founder Lu said.
If a person has a heart attack, no breathing, no heartbeat, you don't have any effect on the person.
It is necessary to breathe artificially and press the chest to save people.
I found that very few of us now have this awareness to learn first aid, but when things happen they can't come in time, so we're still calling on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in a timely manner in the face of sudden situations.
It's possible to save a person's life!
The emergency certificate can be registered at your local Red Cross Training Centre, I'm registered at the Red Cross Training Centre in Zhuhai, and students have preferential treatment.
PS: The last picture is a record of what you're going to do before 25 years old, adding an emergency certificate to the target list a few months ago, but it's really done!
I'm going to go to another certificate I want to take, I'm going to go to a dive certificate, before I see in the little red book a dive emergency certificate, this certificate seems to have to have an emergency certificate to get to the test, so in fact, the emergency certificate is still useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#
One of the 13-dollar shrimp dumplings!
I didn't try.
Why don't you write #NAME#?
One for $13?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# leaked meals, this time just a shrimp dumpling for me!
Because it's clear that I saw it working when I entered the code earlier.
First of all, I personally think that the Four Seas is a whole-scale piece of crap, in all senses.
But if you want to say that the film is not a bright spot or not, it's not at least a good match.
There are many kinds of bad films, so that you can sleep in the cinema, and so that you can look after the angry ones, and so that you can look like a monkey on the mountain, and it can light your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience on this point, Han Xian is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it's as if it were a creation in a jacket novel, difficult to name, and there's a lot of holes like a windcoat on little Marco.
Even when you look at it, you'll wonder if there's a metaphor implicit in it, but when you think about it, you find that it's actually a piece of shit.
Let me just say a few things that I can't understand.
The man's residence should be on a small island in the south, dependent on his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for a neighboring man to drive a small bread truck to send her northeast to see the snow.
The old man was sitting in a van looking at snow from the south to the northeast?
He and his father were very reassured about it.
Then the old man was gone.
How did the wife and brother get a business license when they opened a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the small mix of the island flying car party lightly and loosely seal a mountain road?
Then the truck that sent the steel cord in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and the truck driver couldn't find it anywhere.
This feeling of props is too obvious.
Why would a small mixed party with no letters and suspected violations of the law become a auxiliary police officer?
Why don't you call the police in the face of high-interest loans, the police in the film also specifically asked if there are difficulties?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to open a hotel door with a room card, and then forcibly arranges to find no hotel owner and sit outside the door for a night?
This inexplicable plot is rife throughout the film, because the plot is so far out of line that it pains me when I remember them.
In addition to the plot, the worse is the main theme of the film, or that the film has no main theme at all, is an abhorrent suture.
At the beginning of the film you think he wants to make a comedy, and more than 20 minutes later you guess it may be an inspirational film, and half a time you think it may be a drama film that wants to reflect the small town's youth's hard to survive, and after watching, you don't know exactly
For most people, you're actually very familiar with the set of movies, for example, if you want to shoot a motorcycle rider, you're motivated + comedy and you tell the audience how a gifted bird can move step by step towards success.
If you want to make a love film, you'll be honest about the grievances between young people and sisters who like to ride motorcycles in small towns.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot can't come up with something that is contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yin is playing has just burned, and then can sing), can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't see.
As for the fact that the woman is not weak in some ways can act like a 5-year-old child, I really don't know whether this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
There's another thing I don't really understand. Why is Han Xiao, as a racer, so keen to add crash plot to his own movie?
Is this kind of film scheduled for spring festivals, in order to add a block to the audience?

South African Doctor: The spread of Omicron is strong, but it's mostly mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the new crown virus Omicron variant is milder than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, more than 5,000 doctors in Hoden Province, South Africa, together with a medical organization, reported that they are currently treating new coronary patients with mild symptoms, such as physical pain and coughing similar to influenza.
Dr. Unben Pillay, head of the organization, said he looked at dozens of patients every day, but no patient needed to be hospitalized.
"They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said.
He said this included elderly patients and those with health problems, who would have been more likely to be seriously affected by coronary virus infection.
In contrast, he said, during the previous wave of Delta epidemics, he treated new coronary patients with difficulties breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days."
In the two weeks following the first report of the Omicron mutation strain in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it takes several weeks to collect enough data, doctor observation and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30 per cent of new crown patients hospitalized in recent weeks were seriously ill, half the rate of the previous wave of epidemics; the average stay was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3 per cent of recent new crown patients died, and
William Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports: "At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a milder disease."
He also said: "It's still early, we need to get later data.
Normally, hospitalization and death occur late, and we only have two weeks to enter this wave of epidemics."
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's leading new coronavirus strain, cases of Omicron are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the centre of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in Hoden Province in the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests showed that more than 90% of cases of the Omicron variant were recorded.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes are all out!

Education Review: What is it to save abducted children?
If it were to be compared to the famous public service advertisement that "no sale kills" , then, in a good environment without the need for "kidnapping", group control, popular anti-kidnapping, making trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly, such crimes would not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has launched a platform for urgent dissemination of information on the abduction and development of missing children.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the publication of missing children's information and timely recovery of abducted children.
Listening to this app called "Commonisation", the heart is very warm.
The new technology means not only that the name of the art is full, but also that the information is used properly, practical and effective.
The primary objective of kidnapping law enforcement is to find the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
However, priority should be given to the safety of victims before cases of trafficking are reported.
Priority, in the context of the urgent goal of rescue, such as whether the abduction of children should be subject to the death penalty, and more controversial topics, can be set aside and discussed carefully; but it is impossible to save abducted children.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are used to staying away from the scene as soon as possible after they have been able to do so.
One minute of delay in the abduction operation, the child may be more away from the parents, and the difficulty of detection of the case increases by one point.
In this case, it is indeed practical to come up with an effective method such as the "reunification" platform that directly contributes to the detection of cases and the recovery of children.
After all, "kidnapping" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire rule-of-law system to do.
The fight against crime, the protection of the rights of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation to the guarantee of justice, and the closeness of law enforcement, does not need to follow the care of "child care and weakness".
In addition, prevention of child trafficking can be done better from home to society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at a train station, parents slept and woke up to find their children missing.
It is not possible to expect a two-year-old to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, should have at least a considerable sense of protection.
The minimum means of preventing the abduction of children is for both parents to take turns to rest or place the child under sound protection.
From the other side of the police fight against the crime of trafficking, the purchase of abducted children should also be noted and punished.
Individual wrongdoing is often just a link in the long chain.
According to our country's Penal Code, the statutory penalty for child trafficking is five years; the circumstances are particularly serious, and can lead to the death penalty and confiscation of property.
The starting point is high and the maximum penalty is heavy, and in the light of the trend towards "light penalization", it is clear that the crime of child trafficking is a more punitive crime.
But there are still a lot of cases of trafficking every year.
It can be seen that some people lag behind in raising their children and that legal awareness is weak.
The legal education of this part of the population should be followed simultaneously.
In order to effectively control the crime of trafficking, it is not possible to rely solely on strict official law enforcement.
If the "market" of kidnapping is widespread, the traffickers are motivated, constantly innovating the means of trafficking, and forming a situation of "fighting" with law enforcement, the kidnapping operation will inevitably fall into an inefficient mud.
Therefore, breaking down backward ideas and popularizing legal common sense also helps to root out child trafficking and child trafficking.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two major categories: Virgin Olive Oil and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil), with five levels.
Primary olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruit through mechanical cold presses, filters and other treatments after removing the foreign oil.
Depending on the difference in acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin: is the highest quality and highest quality olive oil and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a mildly elegant plant fragrance, with no more than 1% acidity.
Fine Virgin: slightly higher acidity, but not more than 2%, pure taste, aroma.
Ordinary Virgin olive oil: taste and taste are good, with no more than 3.3% acidity.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil obtained after refining the first olive oil with a acidity of more than 3.3%, or becomes "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of primary olive oil to reconcile the taste and color, with a acidity of less than 1.5%, transparent light gold yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil extracted and refined from oilseeds through dissolving.
You should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olive fruit is like grapes made of wine, and olive fruit from different regions and different varieties of olive fruit produces different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for olive oil growth, such as temperature, sunlight, air moisture and precipitation.
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be cultivated sporadically in suitable areas.
The main production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc.
The month of harvesting olive oil:
From March to June of each year, it is the time when olive trees bloom and fruit begins to grow and mature in July to October, and the fruit transitions from green to red, purple, and eventually black.
The harvest season is November to February of the following year (the freshness of olive oil is important).
Nutritional composition of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, i.e. oilic acids and acidic acids, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most nutritious oil found so far.
The Democratic Summit ended when Biden called the fire of freedom never extinguished
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by US President Biden and attended by government and civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, will close on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burned in the hearts of everyone in the world and that authoritarian regimes could never extinguish it.
He also said that the second global summit on democracy was planned for next year.
The government representative of Taiwan, the government commissioner, Tang Feng, and Hong Kong's democratic human rights activist who is currently in exile in the UK, Romang-chung, also spoke at the summit the following day.
“We know how difficult the work before us is,” Biden said.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
The authoritarian regime can never extinguish the microfire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world.”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires a concerted effort by society as a whole.
"As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, promote reform, achieve accountable governance that is transparent, more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public interest," he said.
The second day of the Democratic Summit was devoted to the defence of human rights, the consolidation of democracy and the fight against authoritarianism, as well as the fight against digital authoritarianism and the affirmation of democratic values.
This day coincides with the International Day of Human Rights.
In his opening remarks, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Guterres, also said that democracy faces challenges globally, especially emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, endogenousism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong's democratic human rights activist, Rochang, addressed the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding participants of the continuing concern over the human rights situation of Chinese minorities such as Hong Kong and Uyghurs and Tibetans.
"The world has long accepted China's rise, but there is no mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use all the resources we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our first priority.”
The free world is also called upon to unite against the threats of the Communist Party of China.
"Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy Secretary-General Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat (CCP) to our democratic values," he said.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change."
In a round-table discussion on combating digital dictatorship and affirming democratic values, Taiwan's Executive Council member, Tang Feng, issued a State Statement via video, highlighting Taiwan's standing at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience of how to combat the new coronavirus epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"As Taiwan's democratic party flourishes, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we don’t have to seal the city to control the epidemic, and we don’t have to go down the shelf to overcome fake information.”
Just as the Democratic Summit was scheduled for the next day, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to be committing serious human rights violations, while imposing investment restrictions on a Chinese company found using surveillance technology to help

Hello, the water chickens from the restaurant are alive.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't stick to it, so I want to find a similar price trainer first.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices are often proportional to the degree of friendship, and if you can't tell, then expensive normal conditions will be more friendly than cheap shoots, which are actually industrial garbage.
They are very low in strength, the ball is hit on the beat, the vibration is very large, the hard ball cannot hold, and it is difficult for high-ranking men to drive.
The logic and subterfuge of their existence is - tennis is so hard, knowing that you won't learn, knowing that you can't afford to buy expensive, making cheap goods to fool you, you play twice, you won't play again, so this shoot is cheap, you don't
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, show that you've progressed, and then come back and buy me expensive, I'll make twice as much money.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better shot, choose Prince or Dunlop, both brands are not famous enough, so good shots can not sell the price, new 500, 600 are good, second-hand 200 pieces, have thousands of yuan
It's kind of friendly to newcomers, but once you've gone through the newcomer stage, you've got to go through the newcomer phase, but most people, especially girls, can't go through the newcomer phase.

The girl is raising funds for her sister as an arrow target: "It's good to think it's skin injury." - Xinhua Net
A girl standing in front of a large wooden board with the words "human meat target, ten yuan one arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a Hangzhou girl named Kandang's "arrow target" for her sister raised money to blow the circle of friends.
Photos show that a girl standing in Hangzhou Wulin Square in front of a slightly higher wooden board with a "human flesh target, ten yuan one arrow" written on the board, indicating that passers-by can shoot with a bow after payment.
The act triggered a lively debate among netizens.
Last night, the head of the Public Security Bureau of the Lower Town of Hangzhou confirmed to the New York Times that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an extreme move for her sister, but that it was not worth promoting, after warning, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
The girl's street "arrow target" collection was warned
In the photo, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board with black ink written on it with "human meat target, ten yuan one arrow" words, and another wooden board in front of her has her bank account and WeChat account
The photo was controversial after it was online.
Some netizens believe that this move is "the begging behavior of the eyes of the eye", and many netizens sympathize with it.
"We found the situation when we patrolled the square around 10 a.m. on the 23rd, when there were already a lot of crowds."
In an interview with the local media, the civilian police at the Tianhai Police Station near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls in the stand, all about 20 years old, dressed in youthful clothes.
Among them, the girl who was a "human meat target" was crying and asking the passer-by to play this game; the other girl was helping her drink, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia, and she was in urgent need of surgery, please help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou to learn that the girl was raising funds for the treatment of her sister's leukemia."
Last night, the head of propaganda at the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau's Lower Town Bureau told the New York Times that the girl, named Ji Jiali, raised funds for her sister Ji Jia Yan.
However, because treatment still costs more than 300,000 dollars, it was not possible to find a good way to raise funds to do so.
He said that during the whole process, two girls, one as a target, one as a hand-to-hand, but not involved in it, no arrow was found during the whole process, but someone was surrounded and photographed and sent to Weibo.
The police subsequently identified the use of bows and arrows as not regulated.
The head of the organization said that "it is not recommended to take this kind of eye-to-eye fund-raising."
After warning by the police station, she left the station.
Heat dissipation effect: good lightness: convenient appearance material: satisfactory Hong Xiao has always been very cost-effective.
The new machine is very good.

The price of the Shadow Knight Dragon is still not expensive.
Personally, I think Hong Xian Shadow Knight Dragon is really good, game effect: the game effect is comfortable, can play most games, my chicken is all high** frame rate stable, very smooth, lol is even less spoken, CSgo is also easy to play, most threea games can play

Appearance Material: The appearance is pretty cool, the game's original winding Display effect: the screen is clear, playing the game 1080 is enough
It's really good to buy a notebook, mainly designed for a high cost-effectiveness, lighter than you think, and better than you think, and the red on your ass is a very good looking wine color, not so colorful, overall much higher than expected value, very valuable purchase
Two years ago, I started contacting the night rider of Hongji, used for two years, cost-effectiveness is higher, quality is too hard!
Friends around me also recommend them to buy this product!
I've already bought three machines in this series!
It looks beautiful, and it's well configured.
For his nephew, he wanted to wait for 418 banking activities, and as a result he used them in a hurry, so he bought them in advance, so it was kind of regrettable that he didn't catch up with the big bank activities.
But the cost-effectiveness is very high, and the logistics are very fast, so let's get back to it for a while.
The new, cost-effective game laptop, the design style is very good, and the Windows 11 and office 2019 have been installed.
Display effect: Buyed a 3D renderer for a child, software self-assembled, a child said that you can use no problem, this computer can do 3D design work performance.
Buying it to his son, he said it was good.
Computers are good, especially customer service attitude is good, I don't know what to ask, recommend buying
It's good, the quality of the game is really good.
What's the hottest in 2021?
There is no doubt about the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympics can win prizes?
The article on the Olympic project where the project manager can shock the gold medal is very hot, which mentions that in many projects, the project manager can absolutely be in the first place, no one can: moving bricks, travelling, staying up at night is the daily life of the project manager, saving fire, back
An article that seems to be a joke, but also shows the daily bitterness of project managers, behind the representation of the current project management work.
And the people who work in project management are also gradually choosing to get themselves out of the difficult situation at work through some actions.
From the annual increase in the number of PMPs (international certified project management professional qualifications) registered, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management capacity through learning.
According to the China Project Management Twenty-Year Development Report (1999-2019): As of September 2019, the total number of PMPs in the country was nearly 600,000, with about 420,000 certified PMPs, and about 300,000 valid holders, accounting for the total number of PMPs in the world
The number of PMP holders over the past decade has increased year after year, which means that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply follow past "old experience," and that the changing work environment allows us to know a way forward to learn and stand on the shoulders of scientific giants
However, can the PMP test ensure that project management is smooth?
Many project management beginners say that by studying relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, you can systematically master the 10 areas of project management and the five process groups, etc., but when you really do project management work, it's still a fog.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following questions: project management is not recognized, relies solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, does not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process system support, cannot land at work, projects are unpredictable, poor control sensitivity, project drag
Therefore, focusing more than ten years on product innovation and R&D management has helped many excellent enterprises to train a large number of R&D key talent such as product managers, project managers, and obtained the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Model Base" China Tianhua Consulting with the R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp
The R&D Project Manager Training Course is an online fragmented learning method that combines practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D-type enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and take the progressive path of their own project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less input, promote the training process of project managers, and bring efficient operating results to the enterprise.
It is not only a team of experts from China Tianhuaxia (formerly Huahua R&D management team), combined with advanced international project management methodology and the real business landscape of many well-known enterprises, to evaluate the course.
More importantly, it will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, and help participants translate the learning content after class into specific work.
A shrimp dumpling order only one?

On the eve of the 12th, the consumer advocated rational consumption with consumers - economic observation network - professional financial news website
The transaction value of this year's "Double Eleven" Carnival National Network Payment Service reached 1.77 trillion yuan, which is higher than in previous years.
Once again, consumers have benefited from the abundance of red bags, live-laying goods caught in the eye, and this consumption boom on one hand exemplifies the growing strength of national consumption, on the other hand, it has had to calm down thinking about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the arrival of the "Double Twelve", JCE Consumer Finance Co. Ltd (hereinafter referred to as JCE) issued rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to develop good consumer awareness and consumption habits, and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released this year by the People's Bank, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
In general, our residents perform well at the level of financial consumption, but different aspects of financial behaviour and skills show greater differences, and there is a need to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, "one year old and one year old" will continue to be the focus of continued attention in financial education; Nielsen's China Youth Debt Report and the China Youth Consumption Report 2019-2020 published by Yan Xiang Xian Xian Xian Xian Xian Xian Xian Xian Xian Xian Xian Xian
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Jixin has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with quality and careful services, advocating for consumers to establish a good and correct consumption perspective, and actively responding to the call of regulation to raise consumer, especially young groups, rational consumption awareness through practical action.
Over the past few years, Jesen has been conducting a comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge outreach campaign targeting youth groups, including university students, and has been providing reasonable guidance to young people's consumption needs through various forms of latent migration such as innovative practice competitions in cooperation with top universities in the country, helping them
On the occasion of the arrival of the two 12th, JF reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and correct monetary view, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid consumer borrowing misperceptions, so as not to affect personal letters and future economic life.
Consumption must be planned in advance, and the measure must be paid on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic life such as buying cars and buying houses.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, formal institutions and channels should also be chosen, and care should be taken to verify whether relevant institutions have operational qualifications.
In the future, JFW will continue to provide consumers with its mature, reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated iterative financial products, bringing more demand-friendly and diversified services, continuously helping the public raise the level of financial knowledge, helping consumers develop rational consumption, moderate borrowing concepts, and being a consumer's lifetime trusted consumer financial partner.

Vietnam People's News - Gulf Cooperation Council to Address Common Challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a Gulf diplomatic crisis.
During this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations while having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement to move towards "unity and stability" brokered by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in restoring relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Arab States of the Gulf resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar, based on the requirements of unity for the interests of each country and regional stability, aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between two Gulf neighbours.
The 725 km long corridor linking the two countries will facilitate the travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two enterprises signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincided with negotiations between Iran and the world's major powers on the rescue of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) Iran's nuclear deal, a deal condemned by the Gulf Arab States for their failure to resolve the Iranian missile problem.
The Gulf states have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that failure to resolve Iran's missile problem and to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
Saudi Arabia has engaged in direct negotiations with Iran in the context of the failure of the major powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf states.
The aim is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The forthcoming GCC summit will be the first since the end of the dispute between some member States and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements contributing to the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.
From 7:00 until 9:30, no order has been sent, and it must be refunded and cancelled.
Okay.
It's called the new mountain superrun exhaust with the largest sound!
This time, our team brought this car to everyone, is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship superrun, Murcielago's replacement model - Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the horse is nearly two million dollars, a year's road tax is ten thousand, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is to have 700 horses?
The data says that 0-100km/h acceleration takes only 2.9 seconds, and it's probably myvi who gets to 30km/h when people get to 100km/h, um.
The low body, the scissors door, the huge gas vents all around the body, and the glass's next endless 6.5 v12 engine perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
There's no need to say too much about the description of the car, Google itself would be fine, minor compilations some explanation that Google does not necessarily give!

Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonance with frequency - Xinhua Network
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of operating ideas and values developed by a university in the course of its development, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to now, the spirit of the university has been essential for political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological development, and even for the progress of a people.
From the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has had a unique mission unlike other social organizations, for our university, to rise in the autumn of national crisis, its spirit is more deeply affected by traditional culture and the evolution of times, advocating the values of "Ming Dezi
At present, higher education informationization and internationalization trends are becoming increasingly evident, global education competition, technology competition, talent competition is increasing, higher education career as an important "supply side", its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the overall programme to promote the construction of world-class universities and first-class disciplines, while demonstrating our country's confidence and determination to move from higher-education to higher-education countries, has raised higher updated requirements for university development.
How can we strive to become the world's most popular class in a short time, and on the basis of some gaps, accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a group of world-class disciplines, and achieve a " turn supercar?"
In addition to firm target confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, universities should also take full advantage of three advantages: first, after-effect advantage, learning to learn from the advanced experience of world-class universities by continuously bringing outstanding academic talent abroad, achieving significant improvement in academic level and quality of operation; second, cultural advantage, inheriting Chinese civilization
In particular, it is important to realize that the construction of world-class universities cannot be one side, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while playing an advantage.
The characteristics of the school must be both common Chinese characteristics and reflect their unique targeting, tradition and resource endowments.
In the case of Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three aspects of the characteristics of the university: firstly, highlighting the characteristics of innovative entrepreneurial talent development, building an integrated parenting environment that integrates teaching and school enterprises, forming a whole-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; secondly, highlighting the characteristics of cross-disciplinary
In this process, it is particularly important to maintain the spirit of the university at all times, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times coincide with the frequency.
For Zhejiang University, the newest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University, which is known as "the River of Henan, the River of Enlightenment, the People of the Kingdom of China, the State of Trees, the University of Zhejiang, the University of Zhejiang, the University of
This is an important guarantee that the school adheres to the right direction of running the school, constantly accumulates a high level of culture and condensation of spiritual power, rich in content and far-reaching meaning.
Among them, the "Heinar River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, reflects the heart of "the world's talent for me", manifests in drawing on the high-quality philosophy of teaching and raising people in world-renowned schools; the "initiation and virtue" emphasizes the spirit of truth and good
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is precisely where the soul of Zhejiang University has been operating for 120 years.
"The deaf hear the silence, and the visible see the unformed."
As China's universities further build on the overall state of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the historical mission of the age and responsibility of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, upholding human care and independent freedom, allowing the spirit of the university to interact with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, so as to provide an inexhaustible impetus for the achievement of national prosperity and national revitalization and the realization of the common ideals of humanity.

At the time of the NFT fire, the encryption community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn stable income from the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-based game based on blockchain technology, which brings together a variety of games, including NFT, and is the highest transaction value of NFT projects to date, with more than $3 billion.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, directly pushing the King's Glory.
On August 6, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily users had exceeded 1 million.
The heat of Axie Infinity sends a new "palytoearn" model to more people, through blockchains and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role, in addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, can also participate in the governance of game ecology
This subjectivity is not granted by game makers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about the share price of friends, my biggest touch is the choice of the enterprise in the race, that is, the choice of the industry that points to the investment target, first of all to choose the industry that has a large growth space, at least more than 100 billion market size; second, to choose the industry that has a good growth
How wide the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the development stage of the industry, whether the track is flat or bumpy refers to the competitive pattern of the industry.
Let's go to the right track!
The first thing in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
The tactic is to do the things right, that is, to do the right thing.
The strategy is to do the right thing, that is, do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about landing, and above most tactical thinking, there is space for strategic thinking.
For example, on how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), it is possible to think about whether the current field continues to deepen or extend horizontally (tactical thinking); for example, on how to increase the customer retention rate (tactical thinking), it is possible to think about how to increase the customer retention rate (tactical thinking)
In the 12 years of birth, Bitcoin reached several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small country in Central America, defined Bitcoin as the legal currency, which was the first time that Bitcoin had become a legal currency in a country or region.
On October 12, the SEC approved ProShares' launch of Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the re-expansion of the cryptocurrency investment opening, the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF landing in the U.S. capital market.
From the point of view of blockchain technology development, bitcoin is not the main player.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin conducted a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American groups complain about discrimination in admission to three Ivy schools, including Yale - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Chengmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting the discrimination against students applying for admissions at three Ivy Colleges - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College
The Asian-American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The group's chairman, Zhao Woo-won, said at the press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to U.S. universities has doubled, but among these three U.S. universities, the proportion of Asians has remained essentially at the same level.
Many studies show that these universities, in the process of admission to so-called "composite considerations", "long-term sustainability and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants".
According to Zhao Woo-won, research by scholars such as Sanders in 2014 showed that Asians had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants in these three universities.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest rates of admission to Asian students, and Yale and Brown universities have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they expect the U.S. Department of Education and Justice to investigate the complaint and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after finding the facts.
They also expect the complained universities to take the issue seriously and change their admission policy towards Asians.
At present, the three universities complained of have not responded.
The Asian Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it complained about the discrimination of admissions to Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education failed to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to U.S. Chinese-American groups, the complaint includes American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani education groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the housing intermediary that a factory located in Zhejiang Yu Yao Jing Town, after looking at the house several times, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory building.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu, after consulting with the family of the owner of the house, Mr. Lin, on the details of the purchase of the factory, made a deposit of 200,000 yuan through bank transfers on the same day.
Lin Yi signed the order for the sale of the factory as the payee, which states that if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, the parties agreed to sign a contract for the sale of the factory within one week
However, the two parties subsequently failed to reach agreement on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of the sale of the factory, the method of payment, which resulted in a delay in signing the contract for the sale of the house.
Considering the failure of the two sides to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned 200,000 yuan in deposits to Mr. Lu.
The house was not easy to see, the money was paid, the house was ready, and the contract was signed "on the doorstep", but the seller did not sell, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu prosecuted Lin to the People's Court of Yuyao City.
The court considered that the parties ultimately failed to conclude a formal contract and could not be held solely responsible for the defendant, which should reasonably be presumed to have failed to negotiate, so that the penalty should not apply in this case, and the defendant should not bear double the liability for breach of the deposit.
After the first instance judgement, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original sentence.

After the end of the Democratic Summit on Friday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Saturday (December 11) that the "leader democracy summit" held in the United States was an "ideological line-up, instrumentalization and weaponization of democracy, anti-democratic actions in the name of fake democracy
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on people, promoting 'democratic transformation', indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and promoting the 'colour revolution' with catastrophic consequences."
Democracy has long been a weapon of mass destruction in which the United States intervenes in other countries.
The summit was a move by Biden to honour his campaign commitments.
The two-day conference took place via video, with 111 leaders from around the world, including Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States on the issue of its own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also questions at the international level and within the United States, such as criticism of some authoritarian leaders invited to the summit, such as those from the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, who doubt that the real intention of the Biden government was to organize this summit for geopolitical purposes rather than for democracy.
The newly appointed German Prime Minister Scholtz also participated in the Video Democracy Summit
China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday that "the disease of today's American democracy is manifest, and the problems of monetary politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflict, rich-and-poor division are growing.
“As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fences of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, be more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public interest,” United States President President President
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must constantly update it among every generation, which, in my view, is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of persistent and worrying challenges".
The U.S. side pledged to launch a one-year campaign following the Democratic Summit, including an initiative worth $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the substantive democracy summit planned for late 2022.
"Let us all implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year", Biden said.
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.

Education Thinking: How to make university exams "learning" "learning scum" each has its own - Xinhua Network
Three students at Lanzhou Transport University wrote to the school leadership, reflecting confusion about the university exam, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the exam, change the test style, so that the examination truly reflects the students' actual level of demand.
Indeed, university exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time.
On the university campus, students come from five lakes and four seas, with different levels of competence, plus different degrees of learning, and different conditions of learning.
It is inevitable that groups with such diverse characteristics should be evaluated with different feelings.
Of course, if the test topic type is single, high repetition rate, the subject is too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who do not need to work may be able to focus their attacks before the exam, and if they think of other ways, it is possible to achieve half the results.
In this way, there is a "school scum" that can normally be passed without input and even get high marks; "school master" usually never drops out of school, work, note looks good, and the exam is not much higher than the " weird state of affairs".
In this way, it seems that students in Lanzhou reflect the problems that exist in university exams, and believe that this situation does not exist only in Lanzhou.
In this sense, I would like to commend the three students who wrote directly to Chen.
In fact, all those who have gone to university know that the phenomenon of surprise preparation, thinking of various ways to "take" test questions from the teacher, trying to draw the scope of the examination, seeking "focus counselling" before the exam is not uncommon, even in the examination
In my opinion, as a teaching quality assessment guide, measuring the eligibility of a university exam is more about the teachers' overall control over teaching and learning, and the scientific propositions on which it is based.
In the undergraduate stage, the profession started to be broken down, and many courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that full knowledge of the basic knowledge of a discipline is the content of university examinations to be examined.
And undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of discipline, from the point of view of knowledge, the space for change is not large, it is basically fixed.
As the teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics at university 20 years ago is still being studied, or the focus."
But the point of knowledge is essentially the same, does not represent a single test topic type, repeat questions.
In many universities, the exam will normally form a group of questions, then be combined by senior academic teachers to form the test papers, and the examination papers are also attended by all the teachers who are responsible for the division, so that the repetition of the test can be overcome to some extent.
But to develop a set of test questions that are consistent with teaching and learning, the subject according to the overall situation of students' learning, it is difficult to be properly distributed, and it is also necessary to master the teaching situation in a comprehensive way, to analyse the extent of students' learning in a
The exam is the command rod of university education, and what kind of examination students will have a corresponding preparation program, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
For students' letters of recommendation, Lanzhou has given high priority to the university and has deployed rehabilitation programmes throughout the school.
The teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct self-examination of the examination and course completion examinations, develop test papers and related systems, while strengthening supervision and inspection of test papers and audit links, fine-tuning the performance evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive evaluation of all aspects of the course teaching.
From the mechanism to solve the problems of single type of questions and repetition of subjects is the subject that university examinations need to face, of course, the corresponding system needs to be put in place, but kung fu is expensive in everyday life, teachers need to have comprehensive knowledge of the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, more

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah without birth certificate due to special anti-counterfeiting paper breakout
The Sabah National Registration Office said that due to the special anti-counterfeit paper inventory light, it was not possible to issue birth papers to newborn babies since early October, and to date 3,200 affected persons have accumulated.
However, the director of the bureau, Keru Aminus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth paper have been recorded in the system and will be replenished when anti-counterfeiting paper is shipped next week.
At a press conference, he explained a 10-month-long coverage of the problem of printing paper in Sabah newspaper.
He said that the problem had arisen two months ago, and Sarawak faced the same problem.
One of the reasons for this is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in the country.
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah newspapers was different from that used in other regions, so it was not possible to borrow inventory from other states.
Keru Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on 8th to do some printing work.
“The Bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to collect the goods and return to Sabah immediately for the final stage of printing, which is expected to be delivered to the applicant for two more working days (December 20).”
"We will notify the applicants to go to all the stations to get their birth papers."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 papers so far this year.
From 7:00 until now.
Isn't that almost there?
I mean food
I'm on the other side of #PRS_ORG.
Okay, thank you, because the restaurant says it's ready.

48 hours of negative nuclear acid, setting up "buffer zone" State Council Joint Defense and Joint Control Mechanism request strengthening port city epidemic prevention and control - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 11 (Reporter Dong Rufeng, Zhang Tianqian) The State Council Joint Defence and Joint Control Mechanism issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring people to leave land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) for 48 hours
According to the notification, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port city scope by provincial and district municipalities until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notification also suggested that conditional port cities can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within the jurisdiction.
The head of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau said that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy, and people from both sides interact frequently.
The implementation of the differentiated management policy of the region, from one anti-control spill line to two, is expected to achieve the transition ahead of the gate, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with minimum social impact and minimum social costs.
In recent times, there have been several home-grown epidemics in our country, all of which have been imported through port cities from abroad.
The above notification pointed out that this exposed some problems such as late warning of local epidemic monitoring, non-implementation of closed circuit management by high-risk duty personnel, regular flow of nucleic acid detection in form, failure to eliminate the various links of cold chain items, lack of regulation of the management of centralized isolation sites,
The notification requirement is to invest in nine areas, such as improving the control mechanism of port cities, improving the early warning system for disease monitoring, implementing border control measures, accelerating the completion of the short-term weaknesses of port cities control, not relaxing, scientifically accurate and good control work, and
The notification stresses that port cities should study and synchronize the prevention and control of the epidemic with the work of people's livelihood security, publish and freely communicate a hotline for people's livelihood security, regularly check out the potential risks of basic living goods supply, prices, etc., and promptly resolve and proactively respond to outstanding issues
According to the notification, the port cities referred to include open land, water, air ports in the county (city, district, flag), their city (state, state, alliance) and their central city, the specific scope of which is determined by the provinces (Autonomous Region, municipality) according to the epidemic prevention and control needs

The truth of 20 years of bloodthirsty killings by the U.S. military - Xinhua News Agency
(Video Source: Oil Pipe)
On December 11, a micro-documentary entitled "The Killing Machine" on the oil pipeline platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States waging the war in Afghanistan under the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American democracy through the war, 20 years of poor soldiers, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and committing various crimes against humanity.
The misuse of drones to attack civilian sites such as hospitals, schools, and other places, distorts the human nature, and establishes a homicide team.
For 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military has set up a "black prison" to inflict all kinds of torture and physical humiliation on "suspects".
A crime against humanity has provoked more Afghan hatred.
As the video says, the American war on terrorism is becoming more and more scary.
The war did not bring peaceful democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Put a video together to expose the truth of America's bloodthirsty killings in the name of "anti-terrorism", and pierce the false face of American democracy!
I didn't want to see the following article, from a commercial point of view and from a preservation point of view, about why this customer wants to help the logistics company in the tax area to do the canning, although the canning belongs to deep processing and does not fall within the scope of the operation of the tax logistics company, here may explain why
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the bags and the milk powder they listen to are the same raw materials, no difference whatsoever.
So you'll certainly ask: why is the shelf life of bags one year, and the shelf life of listening to bags is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bag so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, believe that this is because raw materials are different so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but people think that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who responded after eating out of this mentality and said that the taste or taste of listening to clothing is different!
Now I'm going to tell you why it's expensive to hear. Where is it expensive?
Why is the price difference between their raw materials being the same?
Because most manufacturers when pricing consider that if bags are priced too high, consumers are difficult to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are low, or no profits, what does the manufacturer depend on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the price of hearing clothing to guarantee their profit space.
Therefore, most manufacturers are pushing for listening, not bags.
And you want so many manufacturers to spend tens of millions or even billions of dollars on advertising every year. What's the cost?
You can think of it.
So, with the development of society, the cost of marketing in the market, for example: marketing staff in the market, the cost of displaying in the market, the cost of gifts for products, the cost of advertising, etc. is also increasing.
So the manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and it's listening, and their prices are constantly rising, in fact this is a new product that comes with the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to gain higher profits, in fact, their raw materials will cost no more than three or four yuan.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, do not choose to link with doctors in hospitals, who help to promote their products, drawing profits ranging from $30 to $80 from one listen.
China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such methods of operation, in fact this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder in a can at home, so as to save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, without any impact on children.
And don't think that the shelf life of listening to the bag is longer than the shelf life of the bag, if after opening the bag listening to the shelf life of the bag is the same, just say that it's not easy to save the bag after opening it, it's easy to

Don't scare people on the starting line - Xinhua Net
When you go to the book market, you can often feel the fire of successful school books.
Many of today’s successful academic books promote the “best principles” – that is, first assume or imply that you can do it, and then tell you what you need to do.
The most important and fundamental link is to say how to do it.
That's why these books have a common feature – either to do the best in a drum or simply don't do anything; either 100, or 0; or you can climb Mount Tai, or you can just stay there.
This "best principle" that anyone looks at will admit is "right and incomparable," but 99% of people will be scared before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to be determined, to be human again, to a 180-degree transformation," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who follow the rules, follow the old, and reject change, you prefer to shout "You want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly a self-deception, an act of bullplay.
The vast majority of people will show cowardice in front of the word "transformation", wrap their feet, difficult to resolve; or on the basis of a moment's impulse pains the determination of "transformation," and courageously took the first step, but often not for a long time,
Mr. Martini's famous "From Tomorrow" sound is the most divine expression of this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's ability to make the vast majority of people look at the door.
Perhaps, the "best principle" is a way to put more ordinary people on a relatively successful path.
The core of the "sub-good principle" is to "reduce the threshold" – it encourages a theory that if you can't do 100, only 1 can be done: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai
In short, as long as you do something, it's always better than not doing it.
As the threshold has been significantly lowered, there is more chance that ordinary people will be able to stick to it, and the probability of success will increase as long as everything is stuck.
The only way to succeed is to follow the "second best principle", which is a little longer.
In short, the "best principle" despite its apparent banner of success for all, it can ultimately inspire, in fact, a minority; and the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.
So do I need to reorder now?

The amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency (Xinhua News Agency) reported on December 11 that the latest monitoring results showed that the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons, compared to the early
The popular name of the naked carp in the Qinghai Lake is a precious fish species unique to the Qinghai Lake, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the water-fish-bird ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carnivorous carnivorous carnivorous carnivores in Qinghai Lake declined sharply due to the increasing degradation of the water environment, and the amount of naked carnivorous in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons in 2002.
In 2004, in the Red List of Chinese Species, the naked carp of the Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the sealing of lake fish, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing for naked carp in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and Lake Area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, measures such as artificial breeding and discharge and cleaning of Qinghai Lake mainly into the lake's river lanes, designing scientifically reasonable "fish passageways" have continued to increase the protection effort, and the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has increased year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, said that to date, Qinghai Lake naked carp has cumulatively implemented artificial breeding and discharge flows close to 180 million tails, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources in Qinghai lake.
The Qinghai Three Rivers is an important ecological barrier and water source area in China and even in Asia, while the Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification to the east in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Yangtze River region and the waters of the Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife and preserve the biodiversity of the Qinghai Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has issued a ban on fishing in the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake

The restaurant only gave me a bag, to be packed in the bag, and the weather was cold.
Would you like to ask if the sale is in a bag?
We only saw one bag.
I wonder if it leaked or if someone took it away, thanks.
It's been an hour and it hasn't been delivered yet.
I just saw a fake article, too long.
Give the unknown man a copy.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first leave on a day between the ages of 13-15, closing around the age of 50.
Thereafter, under the condition of health, it will be more regular every month.
But it's not regular to be able to accurately predict, about a week or so differences, need to be prepared in advance, sometimes bad luck will turn the car (suddenly several days ahead).
The length of time, the amount of blood, the degree of pain varies from person to person, some for three days, some for a week; some for a small flow, some for a massive fall; some for no reaction, some for an ambulance to take, pain will change over time, before pain does not mean
Menstruation cannot be controlled, blood is shed 24 hours from the beginning to the end of a few days, and only with sanitary towels or sanitary cotton bars to prevent blood from flowing to the clothes chair.
Painful menstruation is mainly due to the secretion of prostates, the physiological period has not come at the beginning of pain before eating Broven can effectively alleviate the pain of the month, after the pain begins to eat nothing.
Prior to the physiology period, due to the excessive release of uterine blood and prostates, it is easy to pull the stomach.
If you're about to reach the cycle, it's impossible to pull your stomach, basically within two days to come menstruation.
The sanitary towel is best replaced once every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, remove sleep time, and the worst case scenario is replaced 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces, if you add pre-prepared parts may have 50 pieces, not one per month.
(Modified here, sanitary cotton bars need not be changed regularly, about five or six hours can be changed once, up to eight hours)
The menstrual hormones may be more violent, and the ovulation period will also be unstable because of hormonal changes in the body, which is bad luck, and the body makes itself trippy.
But official crime data show that women are still very capable of controlling emotions, and do not use emotional problems as an excuse.
The flow is not just blood, which contains the released uterine membrane.
The uterine membrane is thinner after the end of the menstrual period, then slowly thickening, it can be understood that the womb is a house, every month a house is built (the membrane becomes thicker) ready to welcome guests, the guests did not come, all dismantled (menstrual discharge)
Menstruation is very difficult, for decades, 24 hours of bleeding every few days per month, and there will be abdominal pain, who will?
But a man can be born because his mother comes through menstruation, menstruation is to prepare you for the first 10 months of living in a house when you come to this world, and everyone should thank their mother for the regular and healthy menstruation.
Many things before women were repressed, society said brainwashing women was dirty, shameful, everyone thought that was the case, but the times have changed.
If someone feels sick of menstruation, feels sick of the preparation of a woman's body for life, shouldn't say it in the public domain, girls stand up, don't think like this, never experienced, never experienced this life, and don't know much about men, don't forget
Finally, the sisters try the sanitary cotton strip, it's really good to use.
Today is winter to holiday, and sending mistakes is more disappointing.
To order another meal for the kids
I hope the store is busy with checking out the products.
Is there a leak of electricity in the foot tub?
The choice of the right foot bath can play a good foot therapy health role, and today's U.S. editor will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
As people's health awareness increases, the foot bath is becoming more popular with consumers, and a large number of different types of products are also emerging in the market, ranging from more than 100 to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the relevant data surface, compared with traditional household electricity, health-care household electricity sales such as foot baths are hot, but foot baths do not have specialized industry standards, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!"
Mr. Li told reporters recently that he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday present, but when his father was soaking his feet, he felt numb.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, did not expect to turn off the vibration function, and the father felt numb on the bottom of his feet.
Mr. Li tried with an electric pen, the electric pen was brightened, and Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the bathtub was electric.
Later, he contacted the merchants, who were very good at it, although Mr. Li was still not happy despite dropping his foot bath.
Because he found that this long-held foot bath today does not have a clear and detailed industry regulation on the setting of the highest temperature, which people are used for, what materials are not harmful.
But in general, there will be no electricity problems in the foot bath, but it is also possible that a few products are not strictly closed when they leave the factory.
Therefore, when buying, choose a separate foot bath.
Water and electricity separation, there are no safety risks.
At the same time, you can take any electric pen to measure it.
Opening of the Thirteenth Provincial Tea Fair - Looking at the Headline - Hunan Daily News Network - Huasong Online
Hunan Daily, December 10th (All Media Reporter Zhang Shanwu Hu Hshu Correspondent Liu Xiaoling Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Red Tea Promotion will be held at Hunan International Exhibition Center to showcase the tea industry

The new red tea is a red, infused with the content of tea culture, popular and trading fire, and the tea industry welcomes the new spring.
So if these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want to, because he can't park down there, he can't send it up.
Metaphysical schooling refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysical schooling is the basic law of philosophy aimed at explaining the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the name "the shape of the school" is taken from the phrase "the form of the form of the form, the form of the form of the form" and translated by Metaphysic for the Japanese people.
The branch of metaphysical education includes the intimacy, natural theology and its extension problems.
Inherited theory is to study which nouns represent real entities and which nouns only represent a concept.
Metaphysical naturalism means denying the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.

It does not examine ethics from the perspective of preconceived theories, but investigates the real choices made and observed by real moral agents, which contribute to all the ethical factors of this choice, and examines the ethical views held by social groups.

The sheep is born in the sheep's year and month, on the sheep's grass, and it's for the sheep, and it's called "the sheep's uncle".
Due to the publication of the foreign domain code series of works such as Thailand's Exonyms, India's Exodus, Japan's Exodus, Korea's Exodus, etc., in the industry there is a "suspicious talent" known as
"Black under the Light," also known as "China Exodus", "Suspenity Stranger" sheep's line with a new work "Black under the Light" takes you deep into the marrow of Chinese national custom, those legends that have been passed so far, how beautiful and moving
The "others" of the south Xiao building, the moon, the moon, once again opened a journey of death, and their lives are about to be revealed.
The sheep's hair is white and accumulated millions of best-selling books are dedicated!
The same author, the same protagonist, continues the unfinished story of the Thai Exodus, the Indian Exodus!
That's the same thing you gave me, and you needed money for a mallet sauce.
You asked the restaurant to come up.
I just don't want to go downstairs and buy things, so I spend so much money on selling.
Ding Zing: To friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance over the long time since the death of our loved ones, especially the humanitarian assistance that has not been interrupted so far since I made a personal appeal to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Today, the vast majority of the victims' parents have died, and the orphans have grown up to be employed at home.
It is your righteousness that has helped our families through their most difficult moments.
The new corona epidemic is currently raging globally, and most donors have retired year after year.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to suspend the humanitarian donation of the Tiananmen Mothers' Group, which should have been the perfect end of this humanitarian relief campaign long ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteousness will be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please forgive my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian relief by the All-American Learning Association (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democratic Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian relief, the All-American Institute of Self-Government and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, often cross-cutting the project's implementers.
(Apple Daily Map: Tiananmen Mother's website is managed by the pottery industry.)pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Relief funds often fail to reach the six or four hard-core hands.
In 1994, the teacher recommended that a special group be set up by the mother of Tiananmen to coordinate and coordinate the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, the MCDF established the Sixty-Four Orphan Education Fund, which was implemented 11 years later, and in 2009, after all six or four orphans graduated from university, the MCDF subsequently established the Sixty-Four Orphaned Old People's Special Hardship Rescue Fund, which has been implemented to date.
These projects are funded mainly by campus and social donations from the 64th year, generous donations from individuals, and supported by the Brothers University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Research Foundation for Labour Reform.
Until last year, 31 years later, the sixty-four victims finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong in the name of sixty-four.
In the meantime, Human Rights in China is also independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's call to stop the 64 donations is for donors to consider, and we are indeed some retired old people, whose income is not as good as before retirement, and would like to thank Mr. Ding's letter to friends.
We will respect the decision of the refugees to terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if necessary.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to all those who have been so generous for years and risk delivering humanitarian aid.

Thanks to Dandan's approval, your satisfaction will keep us full of electricity and we will continue to refuel!
This photo studio is really great and strongly recommended to all the small partners!
From reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to later stages, there is no choice.
Make-up artists are particularly delicate, will match your style to suit your make-up, cosmetics are also used for the first line of big brands.
Not to mention the teacher of Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The entire studio is very artistic, and there are two kittens playing with them.
We work in Beijing, Beijing's good cinemas need to line up six months in advance, colleagues have been shooting in Beijing, looking down and feeling just so so so.
I'm looking for this studio, a place where the soul has an attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, and I think it's also a short version for most people, and the photographer is going to grab and record natural moments.
Make-up artist, photographer, late design, a good team.
We and everyone around us are applauding.
The girl has been recommended for the past, and the girl has just looked at the bottom of the film is equally happy.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, and that more people will find ta and shoot it in their own style, rather than one-size-fits-all.
Thank you very much for the five star reviews, both of you are very thoughtful and creative newcomers, we are creative studios, as long as customers like us we do our best to complete, thank you for meeting each other.
The sweet and sweet assistant, as well as the lively and happy photographer teacher, everyone in the team is super nice, wonderfully shot, unforgettable experience, and the results of the shooting were much better than I imagined.
Thank you for your comments, it's also a reason to recognize you, from Ho and Hote to Qinjiang Island, and trusting us is thousands of kilometres away.
How do I get the money?
The meals have already been delivered.
No riders receiving
Now the restaurant staff called me.
A little programming that wants to share personal experiences.
If you're going to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't think about it, it's better to learn on your own, after all, training costs a lot of money and takes six months to learn.
But if you're going to get into this industry, training is really a good choice, especially for those who are self-control and weak, training is a very good choice.
If your own self-control is stronger, you can choose to learn yourself, but it will be more exhausting.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, look at the teaching power of this institution, if the teaching power is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning, of course some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Second, before choosing to explore this training institution, it is best to explore the students out of this institution, after all, only students in the institution know what the institution is like, explaining courses are good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because there is no certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with the personal situation.
For example, the profession, age, language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will be related to the industry you study or want to engage in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or computer professionals have graduated, then if there is enough time I personally recommend self-study, which is the least efficient and cost-effective, now many offline training institutions are actually very good, but one study cost, two investment time more, basic needs concentrate on training
But if I say these things, self-study is easy, now many learning resources on the network are free, or go to station b also have many training resources, if you don't find resources, you can also contact me through a profile, get free resources, or detailed counselling.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then it is recommended to study in training institutions, so that learning does not have to be very hard, the teacher explains in detail, there are questions and people specifically answer them, and also help with learning planning or supervision
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal quotas, recommend to the company after studying, so that the interview chain behind finding a job can save a lot of things.
These are some of my views, which I said earlier because I don't know your situation, so I'm not going to introduce you in any detail, and if you have other ideas to consult, you can contact me at any time to communicate.
I said it was 1 o'clock, and I saw it all at the app.
What's your name?
I haven't finished yet, what are you doing?
I myself, carry all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall hanger water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove head, oil smoke machine, lighting device, glass cleaning, professional beauty, domestic service
Thank you to those who silently praise me, who strive hard for life and are tired but continue.
Life will not fail every hard-working person, like to pay attention to me, thank those who silently praise me
Life is like this, others only see the result, self-support the process, face life, we have no choice but to be strong, to continue, to have no choice, to look back but not to go back...
Cleanliness is a job, it is also a duty, life is beautiful because of service, service is wonderful because of heart.
While cleaning is the dirtiest thing we do, but we will clean every corner of the customer's house with the most serious manner, see the customer's satisfying smile and raised thumb, that moment all the tired are worth it, pay a final return!

But I've always believed that as long as I'm serious, strong enough, hard enough, I'll be a little better than other people, at least I'm always better than sitting complaining!
The plan of the day is in the morning, and all the good things start early in the morning. I hope you'll start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and good intentions.
When you are a child, happiness is a thing, having it is happiness; when you grow up, happiness is a goal, reaching happiness; when you mature, you find that happiness is a mentality, and when you understand happiness, happiness is happiness.
Be the truest and most kind of yourself, walk according to heart, no regrets in this life; one way of life, walk your own path; two treasures of life: good body, good mood, beautiful life to old age!
At every stage of life, there are different difficulties.
Many times, it is not your ability to bind you, but your courage to face it positively.
Since it is impossible to avoid, it is better to face it openly.
The more scared you are, the more difficult it will be to knock you down; if you face difficulties, the problem will eventually be solved.
China's first biennial exhibition of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou Hucong) Saudi Arabia's first biennial exhibition of contemporary art - Dirije's biennial exhibition of contemporary art, officially opened to the public on December 11 in the Dirije JAX art district northwest of Saudi capital Riyadh,
The two-year exhibition is jointly planned by the Saudi Dirije Biennial Exhibition Foundation and the UCCA Yulens Center for Contemporary Art in China, with the director of the UCCA Yurens Center for Contemporary Art in China.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of this two-year exhibition is "Touching Stones Through the River", implying the reform strategy adopted during the period of socio-economic transformation and reflecting the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The two-year exhibition covers nearly 12,000 square meters and covers six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: Touching the Rocks Through the River, Succession as an Experiment, Marginal Thinking, Walking to the Public, Beautiful New World, and
Of these, 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total exhibition, including painting, installation and performing arts in many forms; 12 Chinese artists also received attention, some using recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Ice's behind the story series
Barclay, CEO of the Dirije Biennial Exhibition Foundation, said he hoped that the biennial exhibition would create an international dialogue that would give global audiences an opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's vibrant cultural industries and creative communities and strengthen interaction.
"The goal of the biennial exhibition is twofold, both to engage Saudi contemporary art in global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the two-year opening week, and artists, exhibitors and creative industry opinion leaders will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Integrated regulation of rural public service jobs management - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Befeng) In order to continue to help people out of poverty with employment, consolidate the achievements of the fight against poverty, Yunnan Province has recently introduced policies related to promoting rural revitalization and rural public welfare jobs management, helping to
According to the relevant head of the Yunnan People's Bureau, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 4,483 million rural public welfare jobs for the placement of rural difficult groups, such as poverty-reduction labour force, which play an important role in helping the people out of poverty achieve employment gains, consolidating the achievements of poverty
The new regulations, jointly issued by seven departments such as Yunnan People's Association, Rural Renewal, Finance and others, mainly provide uniform norms on the scope, funding management, job development, job management and other aspects of grass-roots recruitment of rural public service personnel.
In terms of job development settings, the new regulations clearly state that they are set in accordance with the principles of "placed on demand, staffed, dynamic management, and total control", "who develops, uses, who is responsible" and "one person on one, voluntary open, unified management".
Recruitment procedures must be conducted in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, audit, publicity, hiring, pre-service training and placement.
In addition, the new regulations clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development department of rural public service jobs, the subsidy standards for rural public service jobs and the subsidy modalities, stipulate that each rural public service job development department should buy commercial insurance for the placement of people in rural public service jobs; require relevant departments to regularly monitor
The address is wrong.
Hello.
Whether orders can be cancelled
I reordered.
Has it been cancelled?
Secondly, although the right has a long history of ambition, it is not long, so short because giving a little sunshine, drinking a little water, sweating; a little ambition to look at the hair, and a hit hair will be all over it.
But the truth is that the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right should not be denied in terms of ending the definition of truth standards, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights guarantees.
Third, as far as I'm concerned, although I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about him and respect him; because he's serious, he's serious about China, and he's serious about China's social problems.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, and I think that it is counter-necessary revolution, which inevitably leads to social unrest, damage to people's lives, political groups are mixed with dirt, and foreign countries take advantage of it.
Fourth, to change or improve China's attitude of patience and responsibility for the people of China, political speculation is trying to scare people in the fire, which is not the right, it is an asshole.
Let's talk about left again.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of times and politics abandoned.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some right words and analyse their ideas when needed, then the left does not make it, because what the left wants is the bad stuff that the Communist Party throws away!
Fifthly, I recently saw some friends on the side of anti-thieving and left-wing epilepsy, which was very moving, and I think it was not necessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitor and left epilepsy, it's a cord, and it's unreasonable to say.
Don't try to prove us right, and don't think about letting anti-thieves and left-handedness admit, why not?
I told my friends: When the anti-thieving curses you five hairs, when the left curses your right dog, it is precisely proof that our middle road is right!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they are old, they forget them or pursue them, but become paranoid.
And the ideal is getting away, and even the dragon-slayer teenagers end up as evil dragons.
Left and right, I think generally refers to restraint and freedom, and China's congenital genes from historical culture lead the whole of China should be left-handed.
The right is free in the country, focusing on efficiency and development, the left is strengthening supervision, and the left is focusing more on fairness and security.
Now, society as a whole wants to focus more on fairness, while China and the United States compete, the left side is positive, it is estimated that it will last for many years.
Although I can't understand it, a little praise will be done.
I didn't say anything. Flowers are so fighting.
In recent years, the blockade and blockage of Huawei chips has not only put Huahua in an unprecedented dilemma, but also caused huge losses to "American" enterprises.
The direct consequence is that orders and profits from global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in lower R&D investment and production capacity of chip production enterprises, and thus a global chip supply chain.
Today, the lack of core has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies, mobile phones, and almost all industries that use chips have suffered from it.
In order to master the autonomy of the chip, more and more countries' technological giants are beginning to move towards the path of "beautiful."
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control and hold back the development of China's semiconductor industry, recent old American movements are frequent, and hosted the "chip summit"; and invite 64 national giants to form a semiconductor alliance, and draw funds to support U.S. native technology giants, such as
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on the battery, and it is likely to take away the battery's "dwelling".
The reason for this is that Intel, as an old technology giant in the field of semiconductors for decades, has a large pool of talent and technological reserves, and must be able to rise rapidly in the short term to defeat TSMC power.
However, with regard to Intel's decision, the founder of TSCD Zhang's loyalty was not taken care of.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Chung said amazingly, and did not hesitate to say anything about Intel's efforts to build a crystal factory: Intel built a chip factory, quite ironic.
Zhang's disregard for Intel's entry into the crystalline field is because Zhang's resentment over more than 30 years ago and Intel's anger is still alive.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was always a bead in the manufacturing industry, and it was the world's leading semiconductor.
By the 1980s, the world's semiconductor high-end chips had been held by a few powerful people.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IMM model, and the chips were designed, manufactured and sealed by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overburdened some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face huge production-line construction costs.
In the wake of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show a division of labour and cooperation, and in 1984 Zhang was told that there were companies specializing in chip design, and thought that since there was a specialized design, then a factory specializing in crystal manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang's vision became a reality, and TSMC was born.
The main business is aimed at the single link of crystalworking, not designed, but at providing substitute services for crystal manufacturing.
The station electricity that was just created at the time was small in front of the giant Intel.
In order to get capital support, Zhang Chung was looking for Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that TSMC was only a manufacturing link in the chip industry, clearly some self-esteem was very high, could not look at TSMC electricity, and decided to refuse to invest in TSV power.
Zhang Zhuang also determined that Intel was unable to see the crystal process service at the time.
I didn't expect to see the giant crystal manufacturing service back then, but now I'm going to start working as a crystal replacement.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongxiang feels that Intel's entry into the crystalwork is ironic.
The market value of the battery has now exceeded Intel's.
In the face of the powerful offensive of accumulated electricity, Intel is naturally afraid to stand firm.
Today, TSMC power has hit 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
I'm not waiting.
It's two hours before 19:06.
I'm going to see some weird hot searches today.
What is a normal state of affairs?
The random selection of three hot searches: the second-year rise of the dragon in February, the price increase of the good friend, the cargo salad incident, the spread of the situation formed a wave peak, then [index decline] (sliding curve) eventually dissipated, if there will be a camel peak again.
They appear to be no different from the Internet Evolution Model, which has been shown on the Internet.
What is an unusual mood?
The random selection of six hot searches in the same incident showed a single peak, a sawing, and a cliff.
The single peak is artificial heating, rapidly rushing to heat search, attracting public attention; the single peak is cyclical heating, ensuring that the topic is hot on the list; the single cliff is collective evacuation, and the hot search completes its "functionality", receiving new tasks,
In figure 9, the heat wave peak of one event is exactly the wave valley of another event, the timing is not bad, it must be the unified batch of water forces received the task and opened a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches at the same time on the list, which attracts attention, which is responsible for the power of war, which diverts attention, which influences perception, which misleads judgment, which incites emotion, which holds decisions, black production account
Dissemination is a science that leaves out all the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will be nowhere to hide.
Whoever walks through it will leave a mark, and we will dig it out together.

For the first time, Mauritius and other countries found cases of infection with Omicron strains - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 12, integrated with Xinhua News Agency foreign journalists: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported for the first time the discovery of new cases of infection with the coronavirus Omicron strain.
Mauritius reported for the first time two cases of Omicron strain infection in the country on 10th.
According to Mao Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpar, one infected person arrived in Mauritius on 27 November for tourists travelling from South Africa; another infected person, a local resident of Mauritius, tested positive for nucleic acid on 30 November after contacting a person who had recently returned to South Africa
After hospital isolation treatment, the results of the two infected nucleic acid tests were converted to negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on 10th the first three cases of infection with the Omicron strain in the country.
All three students returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not admitted for treatment because of their mild illness.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Government of Serbia has been increasing its efforts to prevent and control the spread of the Omicron strain.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter the country by plane will be required to undergo a nuclear acid test at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health of Serbia also announced on 10th that it would begin vaccinations for children aged 5 to 11 years in the country.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Kunbize Chiponda, said on 9th that three cases of Omicron strain infection had been detected for the first time in the country.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing of 12 new coronapositive samples collected from 9 November to 2 December, and found three cases of infection.

Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I'm calling your staff to explain.
Your riders told me the address was too far away.
The United States of America 360 integrated domestic costumes
Address: Happiness Home 12th Floor, 156 South Road
At first, it was introduced by friends because of trust, so I chose to see at the beginning my budget was 70,000 for basic renovations.
Come to the store and start a series of tricks.
I went to the store for the first time to just show them my family chart, they didn't go to the field to measure the house, they could offer me a price that my 135 houses 70,000 can be done, probably showed me their materials and they don't know what brand they are.
Their second trick is that you'll drag you to the store as soon as you get to the store (and once you get the money, you'll never return unless you have enough experience to fight them theoretically).
When I hesitate to pay the deposit, they invite their so-called managers to tell you how much discount we can give you today if you just give the deposit.
This is a big pit, and I'm a living example of being deceived, making more than 10,000 deposits when the mind is impulsive.
He offered me a lot of questions, 70,000 not including hydropower, no doors and cabinets, bathrooms, and these three are the cost of basics.
The cost of their service points is also higher than that of other companies.
I lost my trust in this company and didn't say anything clearly at the outset so I signed the contract.
When I went to find them to refund money, they showed a very experienced look, with specialized small teams to deal with you.
In any case, a bite to death is a customer's problem and they are completely irresponsible.
I don't want to say anything about tears, but don't choose them, because my friends are looking for them to decorate the house and it's not good quality, and I'll give you all kinds of fees later.
Father, they were the dragon-headed decorations of the original lie, and now they're beautiful, as if they were closed again and changed to something else.
So don't choose this kind of decorating company.
After all, when you choose to look at these consultations more often, because renovations are not small money.
If you want to ask a businessman, please register or register first
It is strictly forbidden to issue reviews of merchants in all their forms, details of which can be found in the Commercial Record Statement
The Kunming Renovation Design Channel provides you with the latest business information such as 360 integrated home fitting addresses, telephone calls, business hours, etc. in the U.S., and finds a renovation company to renovate
If you don't get your order in 30 minutes, cancel your order!
Is there no other way, for example, to change the address?
Well, don't cancel this conversation, if you haven't refunded my money for 5 to 10 days, you'll have to pay for it.
I asked if it could be cancelled in less than 15 minutes.

As the last large meteor shower of the year, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, the meteor showers in the twin planets, which will be huge on December 14, was introduced by Xinhua News Agency (Xinhua News Agency) Astronomy
Beijing astronomer Anju shot a twin meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most meteor showers are periodic comets, but Gemini's meteor showers are the same asteroid 3200 Fae, an Apollo-type asteroid.
Gemini meteor showers are also currently known as the second meteor shower not to be born by comets.
As a member of the Astronomy Council of Tianjin City, as an astronomer expert, Hu Li Peng said, as with the big film of Hegemon's age, twin meteor showers usually appear at the end of the year, and the "screening period" can last from 4 to 17 December.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and is known as the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere together with the meteor shower and the meteor showers of the Ingenius.
A notable feature of the meteor showers is that the meteoroids are slower, rich in colour, and there are many fire meteors, which are suitable for both viewing and astronomical photography beginners to shoot.
The twin meteor shower was shot in Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomer forecasts indicate that this year's meteor shower will be extremely large on December 14 at around 1500, when ZHR (the number of meteors can be seen per hour when radiation points are right above the top of the head under ideal observation conditions) is 150.
Gemini meteor shower recommended index diagrams.
"Last year, people were impressed by the meteor shower of the twin stars, but this year's meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight and a little discount.
The moon is a full moon on November 11, a bright moon will interfere with observation, so that the moon will fall in the middle of the night, and the radiation point of the meteor shower will rise relatively high at this time.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the hours after midnight, but be careful to keep cold and warm."
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
“It is not recommended to observe in the city, but in the suburbs or villages, you can choose a high altitude, small light, and open view in the northeast direction, and wait patiently until the moon falls, visual observation is sufficient.
It should be noted that the flow of meteor showers in all directions is large, and it is not necessary to keep an eye on the radiation points of meteor showers.
If a friend who likes photography wants to shoot a beautiful meteor shower, it is best to choose wide-angle, large-circle lenses, using high ISO and maximum-circle shots.
Based on stability and sustainability considerations, tripods, spare batteries and fast gate lines are also essential.”
Shu Li Peng reminded me.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, traditional TVs referred to by the head of the subject should refer to LCD TV, while the difference between laser TV and LCD TV in market positioning, mainly there are two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the big screen market.
Compared to the full market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV clearly focuses more on the big screen market, or laser TV itself is a product for the big screen.
Currently, the majority LCD TV sizes range from 55 inches to 65 inches, while laser TV sizes are generally more than 75 inches, the largest being more than 100 inches, fully meeting users' needs for large screen colours.
In recent years, the share of laser TVs in global shipments and sales has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of total television sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the forecast by China, the laser TV market will grow by more than 140% in 2020 and continue to grow at a high rate.
The reason for such good results in the big screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye care.
Based on the principle of laser television reflection, the light from the laser light source does not directly shoot into the eye, compared with the back light from the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulus to the eye is smaller.
The ophthalmologist at the Chinese Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization, Xisi Laboratory and Beijing Association Hospital, obtained 144 sets of test data through a rigorous comparison test of laser and LCD TV watching the same conditions for the population.
Data confirm that laser television does have strong eye protection properties and even has a certain improvement effect in certain areas.
In a time when vision health is increasingly valued, laser television not only attracts more and more users with eye care advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color electricity market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuing search for LCD TV prices, the price of laser TV sales in the market is currently more than 10,000 yuan, and with the upgrading of size and light sources, the price is gradually rising.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal range projection technology, laser TVs are projected at a shorter distance than traditional projection equipment, can achieve a 100 inch screen experience within a short distance, need little space, and host is small, occupying little space.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can reach more than 2,000 light.
Plus, the heat is lower, the equipment is less damaged, and the life of television is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models also carry a number of cutting-edge technologies such as real 4K super-high-resolution painting quality, artificial intelligence systems, imitation screens, which can bring more shocking audio-visual experiences to users.
It's not about false demand, but about the product of the demand breakdown, about the quality of the picture and the ratio of input output, laser TV is not the dish of the video and audio player, trying to balance the big screen and watching the environment is insufficient, can try, everything is good and bad,
In short, the ultra wide-angle near-focal projector, laser television, has to use expensive ultra wide-angle lenses and reflectors to get close to the screen, which is not the best optical design.
In order to shield some of the environmental light, the use of microstructured Finier screens is costly, with an 80-inch price basically changing a 65-inch liquid crystal.
There is also a point, I particularly hate the projector's reflection to the eyes good this when selling point, please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes, you reflect widely to the ceiling, the eyes can't see, not
And if the projection screen is not reflective, it can't be made at all.
It is precisely ignored the heat spot effect of high-growth curtains, a large amount of light reflection into the eyes from one angle, that is really difficult.
The video and aesthetic photography gallery is selected for quality stores and there are no branches for the time being.
With the date of the WeChat appointment, the little sister sent me an optional schedule to respond to the information in a timely manner.
Before going to see the filming work in the store, it's more outdoor wedding dress, it's beautiful, it involves a lot of shooting styles.
After the day arrived, I had a simple exchange of ideas with my little sister, very patiently helped me try out two sets of style clothes that I fixed, and finally finalized the beginning of make-up styles - photographers will set up some tools before shooting, will guide the movement, and
But maybe because I didn't communicate with me specific shooting ideas, so it wasn't the style I wanted, but it should be nice.
After taking a good shot, the photographer will help to select the photo, communicate the later style, feel very careful horn.
It takes about half a month to fix the film and waits for the effect.
The second time, a real-class king's meal event - most of the clothes in the whole field can choose one shot.
In the end, I chose a black dress and experienced a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about two hours, makeup + shooting, the photographer responsible for shooting is the younger brother after 95, feeling a little bit green, hoping to give more advice in customer shooting action guidance later.
Photo and Visual Fine Arts Photography Gallery Selected Quality Shop
I'm on the front page, and I'm going to check on Queenie.
Go to the store first to fill in the name phone and then choose costumes, wedding dress can be chosen, change three or four sets of clothing is very patient, choose after makeup for a long time, service attitude is good, behind shooting will teach you how to look, that's how to shoot
The environment is fine.
There are a lot of clothes to choose from.
The make-up position is almost three, and the inside is a photo studio.

The make-up artist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you very seriously how to move.
Unsatisfactory, the photographer will also offer to supplement the shooting.
The experience is that the skin of the eyes may have been made a little too much, and the skin of the eyes may have been pasted.
The eyebrows are also shaved, a little embarrassed about the daily non-painting eyebrows.
The pictures have been given for ten days, but the P diagram effect is not very satisfactory, and it feels that the eyelids are still obvious.
Because it's not clear what style you want to try two sets of results to pick up or choose a black dress.
The hairdresser and the makeup artist's little sister are very patient in helping me get the effect very satisfactory.
I started taking pictures after I made my makeup hair, and the photographer was all over the place directing me to my position, and the process was easy and harmonious.
After the shoot, I carefully selected four favorites when refining, and the younger brother said that the film was 15 inches, and the ending was very satisfying.
I haven't responded for 3 days... Because your system can't identify my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay.
I'm going to pay for shipping every time.
Can you excuse me first until you investigate and then charge me my monthly fee?
Small umbrellas buy insurance, is it reliable?
The umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the point of view of setting the conditions: According to the Regulations on the Regulation of Insurance Brokerage Agencies (Revised 2015), becoming an insurance brokerage company, it is necessary to meet three key words: shareholders, sponsors have no major illegal records in the last three years, a minimum limit of 50 million yuan can be established,
These three are really very strict, sum up to be strong, subject to the approval of the national authorities of the Banking Supervisory Board (supervising insurance companies and banks throughout the country), shareholders should be good, as a small umbrella insurance company, insurers need not question too much about the formal nature of small umbrella insurance
At this point, it's good, it's trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies are selling star sickness insurance on this platform, such as the latest on the shelf and Thai Super Mary 5 serious disease insurance, claimants and insurers are both Thai life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary
From the point of view of the payment model: Internet platform products, because there is less operating costs of business networks, and the cost of business people's salaries, so Internet products are generally more expensive, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payments, reducing the pressure on insurers to pay, and can
This is still very good.
I can think about it.
From the point of view of professionality of operators: this is particularly important, because insurance is a very demanding industry, many Internet products customers can insure themselves, there are many misunderstandings, in health notification and occupation, non-insured practitioners often add their subjective consciousness when insured, feel healthy or compatible with
I myself have done insurance phone sales in "Tong Microinsurance" (as in the case of small umbrellas, which is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is true, and it's true, and it's not based on people, there are no professional practitioners in Internet channels, and there are many sales misdirections.
For example: 1 yuan insurance insurance for 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, receive 60,000 free sickness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid the weight is light, will not tell the insurer, first month 1 yuan, next month is required to pay according to normal fees, dozens to 200
I thought you could spend $1, and the insurance company paid $6 million (out of the world for pies).
Free mobile phones are sent only after the last number of the policy, such as 6666,8888, and if the winning text message is sent, it does not convert itself, and no one reminds.
(This is another pit for insurers) Free 60,000 sickness insurance, is short-term, if only on this, no other commercial insurance, in case of serious illness, 60,000 can do nothing, can't solve the problem, and later life begins to run naked.
The current misleading Internet insurance sales is also severely combated by the state.
So overall, the platform is no problem, the product is no problem, the problem is the professionalism and professional conduct of the operator.
In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products have a better price than Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers, insured products offline, and everyone saves 2000-3000 yuan per year.
If you have any questions, please communicate and communicate with me.
I: Minya Insurance Broker, have 3 years of enterprise management training experience, serve nearly thousands of enterprise users, cooperate with more than 100 insurance companies, before insuring, I will start from customer needs, customize insurance products for customers, in insurance, for customers' goods
Growing with every customer for life.
I hope my answer will help the question!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business where the insurer can independently complete all the insurance processes after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant, and all steps can be done by the insurer independently.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance is not too "ceremonial" and may not even have printed paper contracts, this does not affect the validity and legal effectiveness of electronic contracts in any way.
This model is somewhat similar to the "telephone sales" of flowline operations generally, but this will also have a fatal problem of purchasing insurance, which is that follow-up services may not be able to keep up with.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades, and when we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediate" we choose is a "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and will provide services to us many years later?
How can I contact the food commissioner?

But my food will have health and safety problems.

No problem, remember that there is no need to arrange re-delivery, I have bought another one, I don't want to waste it
Thank you for your help.
From before to now, I have opposed any form of slander and verbal abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can embrace everything but to put an end to this villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it's this uncivilized style to resist first.
I haven't responded to you since you started sending Facebook and friends requests, and then published ads that are flattering, and until you tried to post my so-called home and father's name on social media.
You've become more and more intense not only at the frequency of six meals a day, but also at Facebook and your so-called friends continue to brazenly discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, appearance, body, well-being, what kind of bed to grow strawberries,
How do I know that later I received statements from many friends about your Facebook friend's account uploading a picture of you and sexually harassing elements.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can't keep quiet anymore.
After I uploaded the news to the police, you didn't patch up at all, but became more and more aggressive.
I don't care what your political background is, and whatever your status is, in our society, it requires respect for both sexes.
Yes, you can continue to say that you just care and care about me, and you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your map or continue to make all kinds of offensive statements.
Yes, I can't, and I can't stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you, and my appearance and body don't need you to comment on your head.
I don't even think that any girl would want someone else to humiliate herself so much in exchange for fame.
Friends ask me, are you okay?
I said good, you won't believe either.
I don't think any girl will be so bullied that she can say she's okay.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who do not have basic virtues will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of the people.
I cut out some of the messages for you to comment on.
No one can pretend to be you with your own post.
I can only say that you are a civilized enemy.
I'll smile.

Three U.S. carriers gather around China The most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam 2022-01-17 PCC media multi-dimensional coverage: latest news on China-US relations: latest satellite images show that three U.S. carriers are gathering around China; U.S. media also revealed that the most powerful
According to the Chinese think tank, the South China Sea Strategic Situation Sensitization Platform, on January 9, satellites found USS Carl Vinson, a USS Carl Vinson carrier near the Barabak Strait.
The Parabak Strait, which connects the South Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic point on the first island chain in the western Pacific.
The platform anticipates that the Carl Vinson will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the Carl Vinson carrier on board F-35C fighter aircraft and CMV-22 Fish Eagle carrier aircraft.
The U.S. military carrier, which is now in the Pacific Ocean, in addition to the Carl Vinson, is also the USS Abraham Lincoln, which started off from the United States on January 3.
Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier squadron for the first time, which belonged to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two carriers, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan, which is based in Yokohama, Japan.
The carrier battle group also includes the "Chopland Lake" missile cruiser, the "Stokdar" missile destroyer, and so on.
On January 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform published the latest satellite images showing three American carriers gathering around China.
The most powerful weapons rarely visited Guam on January 17, 2022, the U.S. military carrier CMV-22B flight route.
(Weibo@South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) Also reported on January 17 by CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal visited Guam rarely over the weekend.
USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US naval base on Saturday (January 15).
The U.S. three carriers gather around China the most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam, analysing it as sending a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first U.S. ballistic missile submarine to visit Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three U.S. carriers gather around China the most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam China has built a large number of military installations in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The map shows China's long-term summer island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit to Guam of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada strengthened cooperation between the U.S. and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, operational readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarine".
The whereabouts of the 14 thunderous submarines in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunderbolt the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad," a system that includes launch well ballistic missiles located on the mainland of the United States, as well as bombers carrying nuclear warheads such as B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta, the market value evaporated $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded "to face unprecedented competition", why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with revenues mainly from advertising, and today's profit-making advertising company has its own flow channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., whatever function positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance," with many apps externalizing Meta ads to realize through Meta's advertising platform.
But the times have changed.
First, because of Apple's privacy policy adjustments, Meta has difficulty obtaining user data information, affecting the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is friendly to users, and it will be clear whether users allow App to access their information, and most people's normal reactions are certainly not allowed.
Next, if Google stabs another knife, the impact on Meta's revenue will be greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous income growth has also weakened (the weight of this factor is uncertain how high, but it does exist).
It is common knowledge that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenues each year come from China, mainly from companies contributing to China's maritime business.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about hundreds of people, and there are several major agents on the mainland.
China's companies want to expand the overseas market, Meta is a bypass advertising channel, and most of the burned money is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the byte TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta has earned a lot of money from the byte for the last two years.
All the agents in the country are helping byte to advertise in Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't been special about it lately, but certainly won't be better than before.
The stage of large-scale offshore burning of money by Chinese companies has passed.
Third, new traffic channels are not expanding smoothly.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets look not only at middle income, but more importantly at what is expected in the future.
Clearly, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg spoke about the metaspace.
The meta-cosm should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the meta-cosm is longer, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be more difficult for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook now very bright, with $100 billion to $200 billion in revenue each year, in fact Facebook now feels very crisisful, compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there's nothing good about safe cities.
Although his social software is now relatively high in daily life, it is also the mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but face the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook has little confidence, subversion is a blinking hand.
And in the short term, there is no hope of success at all, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is another company name and constantly searching for a new track, but I think his track choice is wrong, it's an unreturnable road.
