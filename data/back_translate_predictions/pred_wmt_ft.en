The students sing the lead at the Great Academic Annual Conference. The results of the research have opened the mind - Xinhuanet
Wash hands with air, determine diseases with breathing air, accurately search for fog and haze sources Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 academic year, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements were students, and the research covered a wide range of fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education. Students began with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions of application value, some of which have won national and international awards.
Biosensor: Your Family Medical Examiner
Dr. Zhang Dian, PhD, PhD, from the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on the site of a smartphone terminal, only half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to take a slight breath, and the instrument can test your health from the gas you breathe."
Zhang said that this sensor is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the mobile phone.
Smart handrings that can detect health conditions in the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature, pulse, etc.
And this biosensor uses this new type of material, graphene, which is aimed at chemical elements, and has a keen "sweet sense" that allows it to reflect body health conditions more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgical Lamp: Doctor's High Energy Eye
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won a silver prize at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition in Switzerland this year.
M.A. Zhulining and Shen Junfei, students of the Academy of Photoelectric Science and Engineering, opened new thinking in the shortcomings of traditional operating lamps, and invented smart LED surgery without a shadow lamp.
"Many early detection of diseases, removal is not in place, and it is related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
For example, if doctors can't see all the tumor tissues in time when cancer is being checked early, then the cancer cells will continue to spread, Chen said.
This smart surgery lamp has four lamps, which enhance the difference between different tissues under light by regulating the spectrum.
During the procedure, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color homogeneity and shadelessness of the spot at any time, depending on the needs of the operation and individual habits.
This smart surgery lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Shao Zhenfe Hospital, affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical School, and Zhejiang University Medical College Children Hospital, and has received better feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: water saving is cool
Common people wash their hands with water, rub some soap at best, squeeze some handwashing fluid, and students such as Li Qingzhang have invented a "air washer".
As long as we stand on the handwasher, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a gas cylinder.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet of water and combines it with water.
This way, we can wash our hands clean!
Colorful reactions and bacterial residue experiments proved that the effect of handwashing through this method is the same as ordinary handwashing methods.
The device simply needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which will guarantee the level of cleaning and save 90% of water. The whole process will be completely energyless and energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the 2nd Global Summit on Major Challenges, the invention excelled among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold award.

Okay, trouble is coming.
A certificate that I think is meaningful - an emergency certificate
This is one of the skills certificates I think important besides driving licence!
Popularity: First aid measures are actually emergency relief at the time of a sudden incident, i.e. rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is actually a period of time before the ambulance arrives after the accident, which is the most critical.
This is the time to need first aid.
If I really had a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, and a sudden cardiac arrest, then the window of our life would only be four minutes, golden four minutes!
So people around them know how important first aid is!
When someone falls down around us, we can save him with our expertise instead of standing there and doing nothing, and this feeling of helplessness is terrifying.
"In China, our official data shows that three million people die unexpectedly every year, the most dangerous being cardiac arrest."
In the United States, an average of 15% of people can be rescued.
In Las Vegas, 78% of casinos could be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%.
This is what the first reaction founder Lu Lu said.
If a man has a cardiac arrest, he has no breath, he has no heartbeat, and there's nothing in you to choke.
It is necessary to breathe artificially and press on the outside of the chest to be able to rescue the person.
I found that very few of us now have this consciousness to learn first aid, but when things happen it's not too late, so we still call on everyone to learn this skill and let us react in a timely manner in the face of sudden situations.
Maybe save one's life!
The first aid certificate can be registered in your local Red Cross Training Center, and I am registered at the Red Cross Training Centre in Zhuhai. Students have also benefits.
PS: The last map records the goals to be achieved by 25 years old. The addition of the first aid certificate to the target list was also a few months ago, but it was done!
Then to go to the examination of other certificates that want to test, plan to go to a diving certificate, before in the small red book saw another diving first aid certificate, exam this certificate seems to have had a first aid certificate to be able to check, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER#
Of these, 13 yuan of shrimp dumplings is just one!
Never tried
How does #NAME# not understand?
13 yuan for one?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed the delivery, this time a chicken gave me something to eat!
Because it was valid when I entered code earlier.
First of all, to conclude, I personally think that the four oceans is an all-round bad movie, in all senses of the word.
But if you say that this movie is not a bright spot, it's not at least a good song selection.
There are many kinds of rotten pieces that make you sleep well in the cinema as one, which makes you look at after being outraged is also one, "The Four Seas" for the audience is like a monkey on Emeishan, it can light up your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience, Han Kham is truly a genius.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation from a fictional novel, hard to name, and a lot of holes like the windcoat on little Marco.
Even after reading it, you'll wonder if there's an implicit metaphor for the director, but when you think about it, it turns out it's actually a piece of shit.
Let me simply say some of the plots that I find difficult to understand.
The man's place of residence should be on a small island to the south, with his grandmother for life.
Her grandmother had a desire to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for a grandma in her neighborhood to drive a small van to send her north-east to see the snow.
Older people are sitting in a van from the south to the northeast to watch the snow.
He and his father were very reassuring about this.
Then the old man was no longer in context.
How did the hostess and his brother get a licence to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
On the island flying car party small mixed why can gently loosen the mountain road to seal the road?
Then in the middle of the road the truck delivering the reinforcement stopped at the side of the road, and the truck driver could not find it all around.
This sense of prop is also very obvious.
Why would a small mixed and mixed flying car party that can't be summoned and is suspected of illegally flying why would it become a police assistant?
Faced with high interest loan why not call the police, the police in the movie also asked specially whether there are difficulties?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to open a door with a room card in a hotel, then forced to arrange not to find the hotel owner and sit outside the door and sleep for a night?
This inexplicable plot is rife throughout the film, and it hurts me when I remember them because they're too frustrating.
In addition to the plot, what's worse is the subject matter of the movie, or the fact that it has no subject, is an abominable sew.
At the beginning of the film you will think that he wants to make a comedy, after more than 20 minutes you guess it may be a motivational film, when you look at half as you feel it can be a drama film that is intended to reflect the small town's young people's difficult survival, after watching you are rooted and do not know what you really saw, followed by deep doubt about yourself, over the years why should run to the cinema to appreciate the innocence.
For most people, in fact, are very familiar with the scheduling of various films, such as if you want to shoot a motorcycle driver, then motivation + comedy and tell the audience how a gifted caterpillar is going to succeed step by step.
If you want to make a love film, then you honestly talk about the grievances between young and service siblings of small towns who like to ride motorcycles.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot can't be contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle in Yin's acting role was just burned and then singing), he could not go to open some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't see.
As for the fact that the female master is not retarded and can behave like a 5-year-old in some ways, I really don't know whether this is the reason for acting or what the director wants.
I also don't understand why Han Xian, as a racer, is so keen to add car crashes to his own movie.
Is this kind of film arranged in the Spring Festival archives to add to the crowd?

Checking the production and processing equipment of well concrete modules Features and advantages of Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment:
Yixin inspected the equipment of well block brick machine widely applicable to new construction materials of coal, heat, water, electricity, gas and other municipal underground structures.
For example: All types of inspection wells, rain vents, grooves, septic tanks, small constructions, bridges, etc. in drainage, water storage facilities.
The advantage of constructing a check well using concrete modules is that the top and bottom of the module are rounded with a concave structure, and the combination of the shafts forms a chain lock.
The scission resistance of the well wall body is far superior to the construction form of flat friction carving.
The module is a medium- and space structure, combined with the construction of vertical hole piercing, cross-linking horizontal hole piercing, after the filling of the hole core, formed the current watered concrete mesh structure, which has played secondary reinforcement and waterproof role.
The modules are equipped with intersection grooves both horizontally and vertically, and the horizontal and vertical intersection reinforces the overall strength of the structure accordingly.
In addition, the check wells built using concrete check well modules, the drain wells are not prone to collapse, sinking, leakage, etc. The mechanical performance of the well wall module is stable, simple to operate, and the standard of shape size.
Concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment intelligent control equipped with data input and output device one-button touch LCD display monitor the whole process of mechanical operation, realize the ideal human machine dialogue, automatic analysis ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall module uses single tank hydraulics, transports, double tank hydraulics, and transports.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the effects of host vibration on hydraulic systems, thereby ensuring the reliability of hydraulic system work.
Concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment cloth box goes into molding box deforming up, the storage box door is closed, automatic transmission of the support board, all done by hydraulic system independently, thus achieving the reduction of machine wear and maintenance.
Concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, sealing components and hydraulic components, guarantees the overall performance stable and reliable.
The mechanical stimulating platform of the well wall body module adopts the whole plate steel, and the surface line cuts the joint mold without welding point, so that the filler box is free to swing direction, fully reducing machinery wear.
The mould load is reduced, the filling material is encrypted and the vibration amplitude is encrypted simultaneously. The vibration effect is ensured by integrated, full synchronization, stage vibration and model vibration.
The mechanical stimulation machine and automatic computer control amplitude of the wall wall module adjust the amplitude according to the price ratio of the raw material, without wear and tear, thereby prolonging the useful life and reducing costs.
The well wall module has dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing junior high school pilot modern apprenticeship system: admission is an enterprise associate employee - Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, the City Council of China was informed that starting this year, the city of China will conduct a pilot "modern apprenticeship system" training model in 60 secondary schools. Students who receive the pilot training will have apprenticeship status at the same time.
The Municipal Council of Education requires that the procedure for admission to and employment of enterprises in secondary schools be standardized, clarify the dual identity of students from secondary schools and prospective employees of enterprises. In accordance with the principle of two-way choice, apprentices, schools and enterprises shall sign a tripartite agreement; for apprentices who have reached 16 years of age but do not reach 18 years of age, it must be signed by an apprentice, guardian, school and enterprise four parties to determine the rights and interests of all parties as well as specific jobs, teaching content, and protection of interests etc.
Pilot schools are encouraged to use the modern apprenticeship form to train and retrain employees in enterprises in collaboration with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools need to reform the talent formation model.
The schools and enterprises co-designed the talent training program, co-developed the professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise teacher training standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation programs.
The pilot is a pilot cycle for the cultivation of the academic system. Students' internship time at the enterprise is determined according to the professional training programme, and the internship time at the top position is generally 6 months.
In the practice of enterprises, an enterprise class management model should be implemented. Depending on the characteristics of the different professions, a teacher may bring two to five apprentices to form study groups to ensure that students are skilled in the skills required for each rotating training post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has identified 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilots in three batches. Each pilot number is about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (students) are trained.
In accordance with the principle of first pilot implementation, gradually advancing from point to point, explore the establishment of a long-term effectiveness mechanism for joint enrolment, joint training and integration of parenting in schools and enterprises, effectively improve student job skills, improve student peer employment rate and quality of employment.

South African Doctor: Omikjon has a strong transmission power but is mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the new crown virus Omikjon variant is lighter than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spread in South Africa, a group of doctors composed of more than 5,000 doctors in Hauden Province, South Africa, reported that the symptoms of the new corona patients they are currently treating were relatively mild, such as physical pain and
Dr. Unben Pillay, director of the organization, said he saw dozens of patients every day, but there were no patients needed to be hospitalized.
"They are able to control disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of being isolated," said Pierre.
He said this included elderly people and those with health problems, who were more likely to become seriously infected with the coronary virus.
He said that compared to the previous Delta outbreak, the new coronavirus patients he treated had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days."
Within two weeks after Southern Africa first reported the mutated strain of Ommikron, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it would take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provided some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of new crown patients who have been hospitalized in recent weeks are serious diseases, half of the previous outbreak's severity; average hospitalization time has been shortened from eight days to 2.8 days; just 3% of newly crown patients have died in recent years and 20% of early outbreak cases in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports: "At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a milder disease. "
He also said: "It's still early and we need to get late-stage data.
Normally, hospitalisation and death take place late, and we only have two weeks to enter the outbreak. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effects of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta remains the world's leading new coronavirus strain, the case of Omikron is emerging in dozens of countries, including South Africa as the center of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the new cases detected in Hauden province in the first week of December increased by 400% and tests showed that the case of the variant of the omicron represents more than 90% of cases.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes were sent out!

Education assessment: What do you need to save an abducted child?
If we compare the famous public-interest advertising phrase "no sale kills" with "no sale kills", then, in a good environment without the need for "kidnapping," group-control group-control, mass-anti-kidnapping, make the acts of kidnapping and selling unprofitable, high-risk, high-cost, such crimes will not happen again and again.
Recently, the information on child disappearances developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has been released urgently.
This is an Internet information platform for setting up an authority channel to publish missing children information and to find children who have been abducted in a timely manner.
I heard that App was called "combined", and it was quite warm.
The new technology means are not only a name for "culture", but also full of affection, but also well-utilized, practical and effective.
The primary goal of kidnapping and law enforcement is to find the abducted child and protect his personal safety and freedom.
Second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishments, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
Priority should be given to the safety of victims before cases of trafficking are broached.
The matter can be delayed for a while and discussed carefully; but the matter of rescuing abducted children should not be regarded as such, for the purposes of urgent "rescue," such as "whether abducted children should be subject to the death penalty," the subjects of controversy and controversy are varied.
Based on the detection experience of such cases, traffickers are accustomed to moving away from the scene as soon as possible after receiving the money.
If the kidnapping operation delays more than one minute, the child may be a step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of the case detection increases by one point.
In this case, it is indeed pragmatic action to come up with an effective approach such as the "reunion" platform that can directly help detect cases and find children.
After all, the curve is a big task that needs to be done to run the entire legal system.
To combat crime, safeguard the rights of children and parents, from the perfection of the legislation to judicial protection and the strictness of the law, there is no need to carry out the care of the child and the child.
Moreover, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can also do better.
For example, a common case is that a family of three is resting at a train station, the parents are asleep and wake up to find that the child is missing.
One cannot expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of young children, one should have at least a considerable awareness of protection.
Both parents take turns to rest and place their children under secure protection, which is the least way to prevent their abduction.
On the other hand, from the police's point of view of combating the crime of kidnapping, the purchase of kidnapped children should also be concerned and punished.
Individual wrongdoing is often just a link in a long chain.
According to China's Penal Code, the mandatory penalty for the crime of trafficking in children is 5 years; in particularly serious circumstances, it can be carried out to the death penalty and confiscated property.
The crime of trafficking in children clearly falls under the heavy penalty under the general trend of "light punishment" when the starting point is high and the maximum penalty is heavy.
But so far, there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It is evident that some people lag behind in raising their children and have a low awareness of the law.
The legal education of this part of the people should be followed in synchrony.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely on strict official law enforcement alone.
If the market for smuggling is widespread, if the traffickers are willing and able to engage in smuggling, constantly innovating the means of smuggling, and forming a legal battle with law enforcement, the smuggling operation will inevitably fall into the mud of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking the concept of backwardness and popularizing legal common sense also help to root out trafficking and buying children's crimes.
Yang Kodong delivered a speech at the 19th 6th Central Assembly of the Party and the Provincial Party Assembly
Draw Strength from the Party's Hundred Years' Struggle
Hunan Daily News on December 10 (All Media Reporter) According to the Provincial Committee's Unified Arrangement, in the morning of December 10, Yang Haodong, Minister of Publicity and Promotion of the Provincial Committee &apos; s Standing Committee and Provincial Committee Affairs, made an interactive presentation at Ma-Rangshan Video Creation Park.

In fact, I don't know if the store is wrong or whether the rider is wrong.
There is no documentation on the bag.

I hope you understand
Because delivery time is 30 minutes faster than display
No, thank you
Yes, I have a rider changed.
He's been waiting for a long time.
The restaurant has been saying it is in the process of processing
Waited for hours.
The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two major categories, namely Virgin Olive Oil and refined Olive Oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil).
The first-pressed olive oil, or called natural olive oil, is the grease obtained directly from fresh olive fruit by mechanical cold-pressing, filtering and other processing after removing the foreign material.
According to the different acidity can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin: The highest quality olive oil, the highest quality, is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a mild and pleasant plant fragrance, acidity not exceeding 1%.
Quality olive oil (Fine Virgin): The acidity is slightly higher, but not more than 2%, and the taste is pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin olive oil: tastes and flavours acceptable, acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after refining primary olive oil with a acidity of more than 3.3% or becomes "secondary oil".
The refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Ordinary Olive Oil: refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of primary olive oil to match the flavor and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, and a transparent pale yellow.
Olive impurity oil or olive slag oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): olive oil extracted from the slag and refined by solution.
If you have looked at the grading, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olives are like wine grapes, and olives from different regions and varieties of olives produce different standards of olive oil.
The best growth site for oil olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable climatic conditions such as soil and temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation required for olive oil growth.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be planted sporadically in suitable living areas.
Main producing area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on. Similar climates exist in Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and so on.
The month of harvesting oil and olives:
Between March and June, which is the time when oil olive trees bloom and bear fruit, from July to October the fruit begins to develop and mature, the fruit passes from green to red, purple, and finally turns black.
November to February of the following year is the fruit harvesting season. The freshness of olive oil is important.
The nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in rich unsaturated fat acids, i.e. oilic acids and acidic acids, as well as vitamins A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition found to date.
The Democratic Summit is over, and Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out
The online summit for democracy, convened by U.S. President Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries around the world as well as civil society and private sector leaders, was closed on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Byrd said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Representative of the Taiwanese Government, Administrative Commissioner Tang Feng, and Hong Kong Democratic Human Rights Activist Ron Chung, who is currently exiled from the UK, also spoke at the summit the next day.
Biden said: "We know how arduous the work before us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because I have said before, as this summit showed, the democratic world is everywhere.
The authoritarian regime can never extinguish the microfire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of society as a whole.
"As leaders of the government, it is our responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the protections of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, be more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to pursue power naked before public interests."
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were, respectively, defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting power, as well as countering digital powerism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks on the day, UN Secretary-General José Guterres also said that democracy faces global challenges, particularly those posed by emerging digital technologies.
"It's time to reaffirm common values and positions as well as democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing social compacts, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, indigenism and extremism, including all the tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong's democratic human rights activist, Roo Kangatsu, delivered a speech to the summit through pre-recorded videos that reminded participants of their continued concern about the human rights situation in Chinese minorities such as Hong Kong and Uyghurs and Tibetans.
"For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use all the resources we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Rohun Chow also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy the Chinese government, perhaps some of you do not want to lose the Chinese market, perhaps some of you do not realize the threat to our democratic values posed by the (CCP).
And that's why we failed.
This is also why we have to change.
Tang Feng, a political member of Taiwan's Administrative Council at the round table discussion on "Fighting Digital Autocraticism and Affirming Democratic Value", released the State Statement through video. He stressed that Taiwan stands at the forefront of confrontation with authoritarianism and power.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the new crown epidemic through transparency of information and building mutual trust.
He said: "As democracy flourished in Taiwan, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of global confrontation against authoritarianism, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the outbreak, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without having to seal a city and overcome false information without having to go down.
Just as the second day of the Democratic Summit was underway, the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, who were identified as serious human rights violators, while also imposing sanctions against a person who was identified as assisting in human rights violations using surveillance technology.

Hello, the mouthwater chicken from the restaurant is live
I wanted to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to hold on to it, so I wanted to find a practicer at a similar price first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the level of friendship, if it can not be distinguished, then the normal situation will be more expensive than cheap clips friendly, such "introduction" is actually industrial garbage.
Their strength is very low, the ball hits on the pad, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't overcome, the masters are hard to control.
The logic and the underlying words of their existence are-- tennis is so hard, knowing that you can't learn, knowing that you don't want to buy expensive stuff to fool you, knowing that you play twice, and you won't play again, so this beat is cheap, and you won't have any pain.
Wait until you can really tell the difference between good and bad, and tell me you've made progress, and when you come back to buy expensive stuff from me, I'll make twice as much money.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand good one, choose Prince, or Dunlop, the two brands are not famous enough, so good bats are not selling for the price, new bats 500, 600 is good, second-hand bats 200, have a thousand yuan bats
It is very friendly to the newbies, but after the novice stage chicken ribs, but most people, especially girls, can not pass the novice stage.
Order has been delayed several times for delivery time
Can you help me follow up?

In fact, there is a lot to be said about girls who are slightly fat wearing clothes and matching them.
The dresses worn by a fat girl can't be too short or too long, the length is almost on their knees, just to cover where your thumbs are fat.
If the dress is short, it shows the obesity of the legs.
Too long will make people feel short and fat.
If you wear out the top and bottom three sections, you look naturally taller, it is the upper body, skirt and stockings in different colors, it looks to produce a feeling of extension.
In fact, many of the dark-coloured clothes are the labels of the little fat girls, which the author knows very well, and the dark colors are the good way to cover up your fat body. The noble black skirt is also the preferred choice for the little girls.
Put on deep colored clothes, especially black short skirts, will make you feel thinner.
If your thighs are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too noticeably.
The more popularized the better, the color should not be too bright.
To prevent people from paying attention to your legs and feet, you get a feeling of obesity.
For a slightly fat girl, you must tell her the trick of wearing clothes and matching them.
Little fat girls should never wear tight short skirts, and the coat should not be too short or stuck in the skirt, it will make people look uncomfortable, if the legs are rough, they should wear black long stockings or net stockings (the kind of thin ones, oh), choose soft printed flowers
Of course, the little fat girls are also elegant in short skirts.
The fat girl wears a short dress, and should choose the clothing that is consistent with the color of the short dress, which will make your fat body have an increase in height.
Short skirts with high heels shoes, can make your legs look longer, this is the summer's best match!
If you're a fat MM with a thin leg, you're recommended to choose a gorgeous short dress.
Not only can you cover the large stomach, but also show your advantages.
A word short skirt will be very thin, more suitable for the fat girl, to choose a tighter dress, forming a level feeling will be more thin.
Simple simple white T-shirts with short skirts and fat MMs can also be tried.
Fat girls are also able to wear fashion.
As long as you can master the law of dressing and matching, small fat girls will also be a popular focus.
After there has been a change in the dressing and matching, we should also have more sports in life to get rid of the label of tiny fat girls on an early day.

Girls raise money for their sister when the arrow targets: "It's also good to think about skin and flesh injuries" - Xinhua Network
A girl in Hangzhou's Wooling Square stands in front of a large wooden board with a man-made meatball on it, and the words "one arrow" are written in the shape of a ten yuan.
Yesterday morning, a young Hangzhou girl who was photographed by a younger sister who was donating money to her sister's charity, blew up her circle.
Photos show that a girl standing in front of a bigger board slightly taller than the human being at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, with the words "human meat targets, ten dollar arrows" on the board, may shoot with bows and arrows when the passersby pays.
This behavior sparked a heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the chief of propaganda of the lower city division of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the reporter of the Beijing newspaper that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an aggressive move to raise money for her sister, but that such actions were not worthy of promotion. After warning, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girls on the streets arrowing and arrowing for donations
A long-haired girl standing in front of a large wooden board with the word "one" in black ink with the word "human meat target, 10 yuan one arrow" in front of another wooden board with her bank account and WeChat
The picture caused controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believe that this move is "the begging behavior of the eyeball", and many netizens have expressed sympathy for it.
"We found out about 10 a.m. around 10 a.m. when we patrolled the side of the square, and there were already a lot of people around."
The local police, who interviewed the local media, said that two girls in the stands, aged about 20, dressed in youthful clothes.
Among them, the girl who was making a chicken and chicken chicken was crying and asking the passers-by to play the game; another girl was helping the chicken and said that her friend's sister had leukemia and now urgently needs surgery, please help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the head of publicity at the downtown branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told reporters in the Xinjiang News that the girl, named Ji Jia Li, donated money for her sister Jia Yang.
But since the treatment still required over 300,000 costs, the act was made when there was no good way to raise funds.
He said that during the whole process, two girls, one as a target, one responsible for hand-to-hand, but did not participate in it, the whole process did not find someone shooting arrows, just someone watching and taking photos on the microblogging.
Later, the police were certified by the security department, and the bows and arrows used did not fall under the control category.
The official said that Liu did not advocate for this kind of crowdfunding.
She left the station after being warned by police officers of the station.

What's the hottest thing in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win the prize?
In the previous period, the article "Look at it! The Olympic project where the project manager can hit the gold medal" was hot. It mentioned that the project manager could definitely take the lead on many projects: moving bricks, going on business, staying up all night is the daily work of the project manager,
An article that seemed to be a joke, but also revealed the daily bitterness of project managers, which was behind the lack of effort in managing the current project.
Those involved in project management are also gradually choosing to take some action to get themselves out of the difficult situation at work.
From the annual increase in the number of PMP (International Certified Project Management Professional Qualifications) enrolled, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management skills by learning.
According to the China Project Management Twenty-Year Development Report (1999-2019): As of September 2019, the total number of PMP® registrations in China is nearly 6 million, the number of PMP® certifications is about 420,000, the number of valid certificates is about 300,000, which is the total number of PMP® certificates in the world
The number of PMP holders has increased year after year, indicating that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer desirable to do things by simply replicating past "old experience", and the rapidly changing working environment allows us to know a path to learn from standing on the shoulders of science giants.
However, can the examination of PMP ensure the smooth management of the project without obstruction?
Many project management beginners say that by studying relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, it is possible to systematically master the relevant knowledge points of the ten areas and the five process groups of project management, but really doing project management work is still a mist.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following questions: Project management is not recognized, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, and do not know how to practice; lack of systemic project management process system support, can not land in work, project forecasts are not allowed, poor control sensitivity, project repeatedly dragging; members' division of labor is unclear, "old oil bar" in the team does not know how to cope.
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management has helped many outstanding enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other research and development key talents, and received the "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" such honorary title in Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting with an online course.
The R&D Project Manager Training Course is an online fragmented learning method that combines the actual combat cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and take the advanced path of their own project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and fewer inputs to promote the development process of project managers and bring efficient operational outcomes to enterprises.
To say no, we can first see how other participants evaluate this course: This course is not only by the team of experts from Zhongtianhuaxia (formerly Huawei R&D management team), combined with international advanced project management methodology and a number of well-known enterprises' real business scenarios, to provide an in-depth professional explanation of the content of the course.
It will also provide scientifically practical management tools and methods, rich templates and forms to help students translate their learning content after class to specific work.

Jinxin "Double 12" on the eve of promoting rational consumption to consumers - Economic Watch Network - Professional financial and news website
This year, the amount of transactions for network payment operations across the country during the "Twin Eleven" festival reached 1.7 trillion yuan, which is higher than in previous years.
The abundance of red bags, the live broadcast of people's eyes, once again brought great benefits to consumers, and this consumption boom is one way to admire the strength of national consumption, and on the other hand, we should not be cool to think about consumption.

Overall, our residents are performing better at the level of financial consumption, but in different aspects of financial behavior and skills there is a greater difference, and we need to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The level of financial literacy among the elderly and adolescents is relatively low, "one old one small" will continue to be the focus of continued attention in financial education; Nielsen's China Youth Debt Report and CCTV Finance's Chinese Youth Consumption Report 2019-2020 show that young generations have huge consumption potential, credit consumption has become an important way of consumer upgrading, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, almost half of them do not accumulate debt, although the younger generation generally presents a rational consumption trend, although it is very different from the external label "excessive spending", but some youth does exist excessive consumption, behavior with wind consumption, and therefore creates too much financial pressure and debt risk, even leads to social problems gradually increase, financial enterprises should courageously take on social responsibility, carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jie Xin has always worked to help build a happy life for ordinary people with high-quality and thoughtful services, advocated for consumers to develop good and correct consumption perceptions, and responded positively to regulatory calls to raise the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, through practical actions.
Over the past few years, JCCC has continuously carried out a comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge dissemination campaign for young groups including university students, and through various forms of intermittent innovation practice competition in cooperation with top domestic universities to rationally guide the consumption needs of younger groups, help them establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan consumer demand, and then contribute to their accumulated life wealth.
On the eve of the twentieth anniversary,捷信 reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and a correct view of money, to resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and to avoid consumer borrowing errors, so as not to affect personal trust and future economic life.
When consuming, it is necessary to plan ahead and pay back on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic life such as buying a car or purchasing one.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to select formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether relevant institutions have operating qualifications.
In the future, JJC will as always bring consumers with its mature, reliable consumer financial system and constantly updating iterative financial products to bring more appropriate demand and diversified services, continue to help the public improve the level of financial knowledge, help consumers develop rational consumption, moderate borrowing concept, become a consumer's life-long trustworthy consumer financial partner.

Vietnam People's News Network - Gulf Cooperation Council to Address Common Challenge
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Amman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first time that Crown Prince Mohammed has visited Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in 2017, which led to a crisis in Gulf diplomacy.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt broke diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations while maintaining close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when Gulf states signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to promote solidarity and stability.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab States resolved their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar based on the need to unite in the interests of the nations and regional stability and to respond to common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi crown prince to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
The 725 km long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for both citizens to travel and integrate the supply chain.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, with two companies signing 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
His visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and the world’s major powers on the rescue of the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA) on Iran’s nuclear deal – an agreement condemned by a Gulf Arab country for failing to resolve the Iranian missile problem.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a competitor and have seen Iran's nuclear program as a threat to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed not to solve Iran's missile problem and not to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
In the context of the failure of the major Powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf States in nuclear negotiations with Iran, Saudi Arabia has engaged in direct negotiations with Iran.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that has slowed the Gulf Cooperation Council's national economic growth.
The forthcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since the dispute between some member countries and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Commission to reassess the diplomatic results of its contribution to the restoration of the unification of the Gulf Cooperation Council, while also proposing measures to enable its member states to fully cooperate to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

It is said that the new mountain super-run exhaust sound is the largest!
This car that our team brought to you this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship super-run, Murcielago's replacement model - Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the horse is nearly two million dollars, more than 10 thousand road tax coins a year, four wheels drive, why call the LP700?
Can you imagine how fast it is to have 700 horses?
The data says that 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, probably it's the official's myvi to get to 30km/h when people get to 100km/h, hmm.
The low body, the brazen scissors door, the huge air intake all around the body and the glass's next unsurpassed 6.5 v12 engine perfectly interpreted Lamborghini's style.
The description of the car doesn't need to say too much, if you Google it yourself, please organize some explanations that Google doesn't necessarily give!
Too much attention. Everyone is watching wherever they go. It's very uncomfortable! (It's kind of cool.)
1km of oil costs about RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all)
The position to get up and down the car should be practiced, otherwise it will be a bit embarrassing (because you can't climb out of the cabin and then stick halfway)
The engine sounds too loud and deaf after getting out of the car. (It's still cool though)
The car is too big to stop in the normal parking lot and it is too narrow to be knocked when the door is opened by the next car!
A little loneliness, because there are no opponents on the road (the editor himself said, not related to the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, this video of the superrun is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot video for your car love, welcome contact us!
More car information you don't know is on The Car Guide/People's Autobot
Tow to a car accident worth tens of millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe their friends know Chiron is one of the most expensive overruns in the world, and the price of Portsche 911 is also million!
Before that day, a million 911 sports cars and 10 million Chiron supercars had crashed in just minutes abroad!
Look at the results, it makes sense!
Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate with the frequency - Xinhua Network
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of schooling ideas and value pursuits which accumulated in the course of development over a long period of time, and is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to present, the spirit of universities has been crucial to the political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological, social development, and even the progress of a people.
From the birth of the world's first university in a modern sense, universities have shouldered unique tasks that are different from other social organizations. For our university, it has arisen in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit is also deeply influenced by traditional culture and era changes, advocated the value concept of "Ming Tzui, Xiqi Jiping" and the patriotism of "the rising learning power".
At present, the trend of higher education informationization and internationalization is becoming increasingly evident, and the global educational competition, technological competition, talent competition is increasingly intensifying. As an important "supply side," the higher education enterprise is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of the General Programme for Integrated Promotion of the Construction of World First-class Universities and First-class Studies demonstrated the confidence and determination of our country to move from a large country of higher education to a strong country of higher education, and made a higher demand for university development.
How can we work to become world No. 1 in a shorter period of time, accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a group of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and achieve the tunnel supercar?
In addition to a firm goal confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, universities should also fully take advantage of three advantages: first, after-generation advantages, through the continuous introduction of outstanding academic talent abroad, learning to draw on the advanced experience of world-class universities, achieve significant improvement in academic level and quality of study; second, cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to consolidate strength, shaping brand and improving image; third, institutional advantages, play the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthen target drivers, bring together consensus forces, optimize resource allocation, provide sustainable and solid guarantees for schools to accelerate their progress beyond the world's advanced level.
It is particularly important to realize that building world-class universities cannot afford to have a single face, and that schools must show their personality and identity while taking advantage.
The school features should be both common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique target positioning, traditional and resource endowment.
In the case of Zhejiang University, we pay attention to highlighting three aspects of training: one is to highlight the characteristics of innovation and entrepreneurial talent culture, build an integrated educational environment that integrates teaching and school enterprises, forming a chain-wide entrepreneurship education ecosystem; second is to highlight the characteristics of cross-disciplinary gathering, promote optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for cross-disciplinary processes, actively cultivate cross-cutting emerging disciplines and iconic cross-cutting outcomes; third is to highlight the features of the management system and social services, carry out deep international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of the PanZHEA Industrial Research and Development Cooperation System.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and allow the spirit of the university to resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the common values of "innovation", "workmanship, teaching, discernment, solidity" and "Haina River, Initiating Goods, People Who Have Been Started, Tree My State" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang.
This is an important guarantee that the school adheres to the right direction of instruction, constantly accumulating cultural heights, consolidating spiritual strength, rich in meaning and meaning.
Among them, the "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, reflecting the guise of "the talents of heaven for me", is manifested as drawing on the high-quality concept of teaching students in world famous schools; "Initiative Goodness" emphasizes the spirit of true goodness, refers to the university's pursuit of truth while also receiving the pawning of virtue and personality; "The people who have opened things" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes both new research and knowledge, and scientific research innovations, but also demonstrates reforms and development.
This series of spiritual ideas and values pursue the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
"He who is wise hears in silence, and he who is wise sees in intangible."
The Chinese University of Higher Education should build further on the overall picture of socialism with Chinese characteristics, take a deep grasp of the age and historical mission of higher education, and speed up the construction of a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to human and independent care and freedom, so that the spirit of universities and the spirit of times and nationalism stir each other, thus providing an inexhaustible impetus for achieving the richness of the country and revitalization of the nation and realization of the common ideal of mankind.

With the NFT's fireworks coming out, the crypto community has come up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who lost jobs due to the outbreak began to earn steady income.
Axie Infinity is a game for pets based on blockchain technology, which brings together many kinds of games including NFT and is currently the highest transactional NFT project with more than $3 billion to date.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity earned more than $8.2 million for the day, directly challenging the King's Glory.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily users had exceeded one million.
The passion of Axie Infinity sends a new "pallytoearn" model to more people. By helping with block chains and smart contracts, players no longer have a single role and can participate in the governance of game ecology in addition to having fun and economic benefits from the game
This subjectivity is not granted by the game creators, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about the stock price of friends, my biggest touch is the choice of enterprises in the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry, first to choose an industry with large growth space, at least 100 billion more market size; secondly, to choose the future growth and good industry, consider the next 3-5 years for the industry to achieve the best growth status; finally, to choose industries with policy support.
How wide the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the development stage in the industry, whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competition pattern in the industry.
Fuel for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is "do the things right," that is, to do what's right.
And the strategy lies in "do the right thing," which means doing the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about landing, and most tactical thinking has room for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether it is continuous deepening in the current field or horizontal extension (strategic thinking); for example, improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve core and high-value customer retention rate (strategic thinking); above raising activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the right activities goals, such as increasing target customer engagement, activating high-value silencers, and accurately updating; on upgrading DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after birth, Bitcoin reached several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small country in Central America, defined Bitcoin as the legal currency, which was the first time Bitcoin became a national or regional currency.
On October 12, the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States (SEC) approved ProShares' introduction of the Bitcoin futures ETF for the first time in eight years, and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first jointly regulated Bitcoin futures ETF to enter the U.S. capital market, and the opening for cryptocurrencies investments to be expanded again.
From the point of view of blockchain technology development, bitcoin is not the protagonist.
Bitcoin carried out a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot" on November 14, 2021, which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin online transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of blocks themselves.

American-Asian groups complain about discrimination in admissions to three Ivy schools such as Yale - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian groups in the United States submitted complaints to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting the discrimination of Asian applicants in the admission process at Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Educational Coalition, which led the petition, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The group's chairman, Zhao Yuquan, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria for American universities has doubled over the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian applicants at these three American universities remains essentially at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have "long-term sustainability and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants" during the so-called "composite consideration" process of admission.
Zhao Woonon said that studies by scholars such as Sanders in 2014 showed that Asians had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups compared to the number of applicants in these three colleges.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also showed that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Liu told Xinhua that they expected the U.S. Department of Education and Justice to open an investigation after filing the complaint and take steps to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after the fact was established.
They also expect the complained universities to take this issue seriously and change their admission policies for Asians.
At present, the three colleges complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Union was founded in 2015 when it filed a complaint about discrimination in admission to Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education declined to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to U.S. Chinese-American groups, the complaints included American Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani-American educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the housing intermediary of a factory located in Yuyao Bing Town, Zhejiang, and after looking at the house on several occasions, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory building with the family of the owner of the house, Mr. Lin, and made a deposit of 20,000 yuan through the bank transfer on the same day.
"If the buyer doesn't want to buy the plant, the deposit goes to the seller. If the seller doesn't want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned double to the seller. The parties agreed to sign the contract within one week.
However, the two parties subsequently failed to reach agreement on the terms of the main contracts such as the scope of the factory sale and payment method, resulting in a delay in signing the house sales contract.
Given the fact that the parties failed to reach consensus on the contents of the contract, after a few days, Lin Mao returned the 200,000 yuan fixed sum to Mr. Lu.
The house that was not easy to see, the money was delivered, the rent was ready, and the contract was almost signed, but the seller did not sell, which angered Mr. Lu.
To that end, Mr. Lu had sued Lin Xiao Xiao’s People’s Court.
The court considered that the parties ultimately failed to sign the formal contract and could not be blamed solely on the defendant, which should reasonably be deemed to be unsuccessful in consultation. Therefore, the fine should not apply in this case, and the defendant did not have to bear double the default liability for the refund of the fine.
After the verdict of the first trial, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original verdict.
[Counsel reminds] In the course of the transaction to do the necessary cautionary duty.
When signing the contract, as a buyer, must do the necessary prudential care obligation, such as verifying information about the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied and other relevant information, and specify in the contract specific time and location for delivery, in order to avoid disputes between the parties when fulfilling the contract.
(The Voice of Germany) At the end of Friday's "Democracy Summit," China's foreign ministry spokesman said on Saturday (December 11) that the "Democracy Summit of Leaders" was organized by the U.S. in the name of "the ideological division of democracy into tools, weapons and counter-democracy
The Chinese government believes, "For a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on people, implemented 'democratic reforms', abused unilateral sanctions, and launched a 'color revolution', with disastrous consequences.
"Democracy" has long become a weapon of mass destruction that the United States interferes with in other countries.
This summit was Biden's act to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting was held via video format and leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited to attend, including Taiwanese leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States over the issue of America's own democracy, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
At the international level, and in the United States, there are doubts, for example, that some leaders with authoritarian tendencies such as the Philippines, Poland and Brazil have been criticized for having been invited to attend the summit, some doubting that the true intentions of the Biden government were not for the sake of democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
German Prime Minister Shultz, who just took office, also participated in the Video Democracy Summit.
The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on Saturday said that " Today's US-style democracy is very sick, and issues such as money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social fragmentation, race conflict, and the division of wealth and wealth are growing." American democracy is a "rich game based on capital
President Biden said in his speech, "As leaders of the government, it is our duty to listen to our citizens, strengthen the shield of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, better defend against the forces of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy was not taken for granted. "We must keep updating it in every generation, and in my view this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need a fighter to defend democracy in the face of ongoing and worrying challenges".
The U.S. pledged to launch a one-year campaign following the Democratic Summit, which includes a $4244 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the entity democracy summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
"Let all countries implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year," said Byrd.
Okay, I'm afraid he sent the wrong address.

What is the method of drinking red brand whiskey?
Everyone's hobby is different, someone likes the collection, someone likes food, of course some people like wine, red card whisky is one of the best-selling Scotch whisky in each country at present, and red card whisky has won the International Wine Competition Golden Award.
Every bottle of red whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, it spoils its alcohol.
So how about red card whiskey?
Let me briefly introduce the editor.
Red card whiskey drink:
Juni's red-coded whiskey is made of approximately 35 different types of Scotch, which has the characteristics of strong yummy aroma and traditional Scotch, with sweet and smokey flavour in the fragrance.
The entrance is fresh with vanilla and strong sprouts of smoked wheat.
The wine can be added directly to ice drinks or mixed with favorite drinks.
Red card whiskey entered the country and, in order to suit the tastes of the country, bubble drinks such as red card whiskey + cola or snowflake or new chicks became a perennial fad.
These sweet drinks, in addition to the neutral and acidic taste, can visually bring people pleasure, add a drink, play the effect of rinsing wine flavor changes taste.
Red-card whiskey + sliced lemon + flange sugar (sugar can also be), the most authentic and traditional drink.
The original red vanilla tastes a bit acidic, adding sugar can contain the acidity, lemon brings the wine fresh flavor, of course, sweet acidity can be tailored according to the individual taste.
The above three kinds are the best way to drink red brand whiskey, everyone can try as a reference, hoping that the introduction of the official will help everyone.
Educational Thinking: How University Examinations Make "Teachers" and "Teachers' Squabbles" Everywhere - chinanews.com
Three students from Lanzhou Transport University wrote letters to the school leadership reflecting their confusion about the university examination and proposed improving the difficulty of the examination and changing the test subject to make the examination truly reflect the demands of the students' actual level.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a hot topic.
On the university campus, students from five lakes and four seas, the ability level varies, plus the degree of learning is different.
It is inevitable that there are different feelings for people with so many characteristics to test.
Of course, if the test topics are single and repeat rates are high, and the topics are too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who don't do well may be able to do well by concentrating on the attack before the exam, and if you think of other ways, it is possible to achieve a half-work-double effect.
In this way, the "study residue" that does not enter normally can pass the test, or even get high marks; the "study supervisor" normally never drops classes, the homework, notes are good, and the examination does not raise much of the "strange status quo."
In this way, the students of Lanzhou University reflect the problems that exist in university examinations is not without reason, believe that this situation is not only in Lanzhou University.
In this sense, we would like to commend the three students who wrote directly.
In fact, people who have attended the university are aware that it is not unusual to scramble for exams and think of various ways to "take" test questions from teachers, seek to define the scope of the examination, find a "focus coaching" phenomenon before the exam, even hold small copies in the exam, ask teachers to raise their noble hands after the exam.
In my opinion, as a teaching quality assessment guide, measuring the qualifiedness of a university exam or not is more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and scientific propositions based on this.
After entering the undergraduate phase, the specialization started to be broken down, and many professional courses were based on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether to fully master a basic knowledge point in a discipline is the content of the university exams.
And undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the discipline. From the point of view of knowledge, the space of change is not large, but it is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, “I learned the basics of mathematics at university 20 years ago, and now I am still learning, and that’s the point.”
However, the knowledge points remain essentially the same, and do not represent a single examination title and a repetition of test topics.
In many universities, the examinations are usually grouped into a set of subjects, followed by a test book composed of a group of senior teachers in the subject, and the test book is also taken by the entire teacher of the department, so that the repetition of the test can be overcome to some extent.
However, it is necessary to develop a set of test topics that are consistent with the teaching and learning reality. Depending on the student’s overall learning situation, it is difficult to present a normal distribution of topics. It is also necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation and a comprehensive analysis of the student’s learning level, so that the
Exams are the guiding rod of university education, and what kind of exams there will be, students will have a corresponding preparation program, which in the past will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the student's advice letter, Lanzhou University attaches great importance to it and has deployed a programme of rectification throughout the school.
It is required that each teaching unit organize the teachers to conduct research and final exams independently, develop test book propositions and related systems, while strengthening supervision and inspection of test book propositions and auditing links, meticulously assess scores, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
The problem of solving the problems of single type of test questions and repetition of questions from the mechanism is the subject that university examination needs to face. Of course, the corresponding system needs to be put in place, but Kung Fu is expensive in everyday life, the teacher needs to have full knowledge of the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but also to eat through the student learning situation, both heads eat

Before the photograph was taken, because we weren't scheduled, we changed the time twice, and Lanlan, the consultant, patiently helped us with the time.

It was my first official make-up in my life. I can't believe it. I'm going to look so good one day.
Xiaojie and another girl (I'm sorry I can't remember my name) make-up is super patient and natural.
The view was taken in the city of Jiang Bay, and thankfully the weather was nice, it didn't feel too cold, and the makeup artist occasionally noticed our clothes and headgear when they took pictures, and a little bit of badness immediately helped us to clean up.
The photographer is also humorous and enjoys taking pictures all day long.
When the photos were selected, because there were many cases online that didn't want the guests to delete the photos, but when we picked the pictures, it really didn't mean anything, and there were 24 of them in the package, none of them.
The photos were fixed today, and Lanlan sent them to me. Two of them I didn't feel so good about. They immediately helped me repair them.
Comparing the photos taken by my sister before, I think our photos are really very satisfactory, briefly fresh, that's the style I want.
I would highly recommend that you go and announce that Mrs. Hankin is taking her wedding photo!

3,200 newborn babies in Saba have no reportable paper due to special anti-counterfeiting paper cuts
The Sabah National Registration Bureau said that due to the use of special anti-false paper stocks, it has not been possible to issue birth paper to the newborn child since early October. To date, the number of people affected has reached 3,200.
However, the bureau's director, Carol Aminus, assured that all babies who had applied for the paper had been recorded in the system and would be re-issued when the counterfeit paper was shipped next week.
At a press conference, he explained the 10-month-long reporting of a network media outlet pointing to the paper printing problem in Sabah newspapers.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
"One reason is that Chinese manufacturers who produce special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Saba newspaper is different from other regions, so it can not borrow inventory from other states.
The latest batch of counterfeit paper was shipped to Kuala Lumpur on 6th of this month and then handed over to the printing company for printing on 8th of this month, Keru Aminus said.
"The Bureau will dispatch people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and return to Sabah immediately for the final phase of printing. It is estimated that more than two working days (December 20) will be available to the applicants."
"We will notify applicants to go to the branch offices to collect the paper."
He added that Shaba had issued a total of 24,801 newspapers so far this year.
From 7 o'clock to now
Isn't that coming soon?
I'm talking about food.
I'm back in front of #PRS_ORG#

According to the notification, the timeframe for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port city scope by the provincial municipalities to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notification also proposed that conditional port cities could study setting up epidemic control buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
The head of the disease prevention and control bureau of the National Health and Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy, and the people of both sides visit frequently.
Implementing a policy of differentiation management of the subdivision, transforming from one controlled outflow line to two lines of defense, hopes to achieve the front door move, compress outflow risk, achieve maximum effectiveness in the control of epidemics with minimal social impact and minimum social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of home-grown concentrated epidemics in China, all of which are imported via port cities.
The above-mentioned notification points out that this exposes some issues such as inadequate early warning of local epidemic monitoring, failure to implement closed-loop management of high-risk positions, periodic flow of nucleic acid testing, inability to eliminate cold chain items at all stages, inadequate management of centrally isolated sites, and inadequate scientific accuracy in emergency management of epidemic situations.
The notification requires that we focus on improving the port city epidemic prevention and control mechanism, improve the outbreak monitoring and early warning system, and implement border control measures in nine aspects. We will accelerate the improvement of the port city's short-board protection and control weaknesses, do not relax, scientifically accurate work to prevent and control, and weave a tightly sealed external defense input line.
The notification stressed that port cities should simultaneously study and deploy, publish and broadcast the hotline for life-saving activities in the field of epidemic prevention and life-saving work, regularly check the risks of basic life-saving supplies and prices, and solve them in a timely manner.
According to the notification, the port cities referred to in this report include open land, waterways, air ports of county (city, district, flag), city (land, state, alliance) and local municipality. The specific scope is determined and promptly announced by provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

Oil pipeline video begins with the truth about 20 years of bloodthirsty killing by the US military - Xinhua Net
(video source: pipeline)
On December 11, a micro-record film called "The Killing Machine" in a pipeline platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells about the United States launching the war in Afghanistan under the name of "counterterrorism", forcibly exporting American democracy through the war, 20 years of poor militarism, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and committing various crimes against humanity.
Misuse of drone strikes on hospitals, schools, and other civilian places to distort humanity and set up a homicide team.
Over the past 20 years, United States troops have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military has set up a "black cell" to inflict all kinds of torture and physical humiliation on "suspects".
One anti-human crime provoked more Afghans' hatred.
As the video says, the American “anti-terrorist” war is “more and more anti-terrorist.”
The war did not bring peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people; it brought only devastated countries and countless killings and destruction.
Let's come together to uncover the truth of the bloody killing of America, known as the anti-terrorist propaganda, and the fake face of American democracy!
Inadvertently see the following article, from a commercial point of view and from the point of view of the preservation period, about why the customer wants the logistics company in the tax area to help make the canning, although the canning belongs to the deep processing, not to the operational scope of the tax logistics company, here the following text may explain why the customer wants to do so
I went to a lot of dairy powder manufacturers and contacted many dairy powder production lines.
In fact, the bags and the milk powder they are made of are the same raw materials, without any difference.
Then everyone will surely ask: Why is the warranty period of the bag one year, while the warranty period of the listening bag is two years or more?
Or ask again: Why is the price difference between listening to suitcases and bags so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mother-level think it is because the raw materials are different so the quality will be much better.
In fact, raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who eat from this mentality after the reaction and say that the taste or taste of listening to clothing is different!
Now I'll talk to you first about the reason why listening to clothes is expensive, where is it?
Why are their raw materials the same price difference so big?
Because the majority of manufacturers in pricing take into account that if the bag is priced too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are very low, or that there is no profit, what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a big uptrend on the pricing of hearing suits to secure their margin.
So most manufacturers push for ears instead of bags.
And you want so many manufacturers to spend tens of millions or even billions of dollars on advertising every year, what's the cost?
Everyone can think of it.
As society develops, the market’s promotion costs, such as market promoters, mall display costs, product gift costs, advertising costs, etc., are also increasing.
So the manufacturers are constantly adding new items, as well as listening, and their prices are constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product as market costs increase.
The main aim is to obtain higher profits, but the cost of increasing their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There is also a portion of brands that, in order to promote their own products, do whatever it takes to connect with doctors at hospitals, and they will assist in the promotion of their products, drawing profits ranging from $30 to $80 from one ear to 80 yuan.
And China's relevant laws are absolutely not permitting such methods of operation, in fact, the practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder in the tank under the premise of a can at home, so it can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder does not have any impact on children.
And we should not think that the shelf life of the bag is longer than the bag, if the shelf life of the bag is the same as the one of the bag, just say that it is not easy to save after the bag is unpacked and is easily deformed by the tide.
It's late for delivery. The food is cold. After cold, it's dry and hard, and it's completely impossible to eat.

Don't scare people off the starting line - Xinhua Net
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the explosion of successful school books.
Many of today’s successful textbooks advocate the “best principle” – i.e., first assume or imply that you can “do it” and then tell you “what” you need to do.
It's like saying that you've gone beyond how to do this, the most important and fundamental link.
That's why all these books share a common feature – either doing what you can best, or doing nothing at all; either 100 or 0; or you can climb a mountain or you can just stay put.
This is the best principle. Anyone who sees it will admit that it is correct, but 99% of people will be scared before the start line.
Because this theory advocates a path that "you have to remake people and make a big 180-degree shift." This is the fatal weakness of many.
For those who follow the rules, follow the old rules and reject change, you should shout "you want to change" in his ear, which is no doubt an act of self-deception and deludement against the cow.
The vast majority of people will be frightened before the two words "transformation," wrapped up in their feet, difficult to make a decision; or by the impulse of a moment pained the determination of "transformation," and bravely took the first step, but often the good scene is not long, persisting for a short while and failing
Mr. Martin's famous "From Tomorrow to Tomorrow" is the classic that best expresses this universal humanity.
The biggest problem with the “best principle” is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people’s ability, making most people “shout at the door.”
Perhaps the “second best principle” is the way to get more ordinary people on a relatively successful path.
The core of the "sub-good principle" is to lower the threshold - it encourages a theory that if less than 100, only 1 will be done: because 1 will always be greater than 0; if you do not climb Taishan, just small sand dunes on your doorway also go, because it's always stronger than where they are.
In short, as long as you do something, it is always stronger than not.
Because the threshold has been significantly lowered, there is a greater chance that ordinary people can adhere to it, and as long as everything persists, the probability of success will increase.
Just following the successful path of "second good" principle, its journey is slightly longer.
In short, although the "best principle" is ostensibly a banner of success for all, it can ultimately be incentivized, actually still a small number; and the "second good principle" can effectively inspire more people to benefit as much as possible.
Will I need to reorder now?

The reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Xinin on December 11th (reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) reporter from the Agriculture and Rural Administration of Qinghai Province was informed that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserves of Kinghai Lake's naked carp resources increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared with the previous year, to 108.5 million tons, which is more than 40 times higher than in the early years of protection in 2002.
The nude carp of the Qinghai Lake, commonly known as "Huang Fish", is a unique and precious fish species in the Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the ecological chain of water-fish-birds in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked salmon in Qinghai Lake decreased due to factors such as the massive killing of humans, the increasing degradation of the aquatic environment for the reproduction of the naked salmon. In 2002, the reserve of the naked salmon resources in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In the "Red List of Chinese Species" in 2004, Chonghai Lake Naked Carps were listed as endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a sealed lake fishery, which prohibits any unit, collective or individual from fishing naked carp in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and Lake District, and prohibits the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, protection efforts have been continuously increased through artificial proliferation and discharge flow as well as clearing of Qinghai Lake's main rivers into the lake river path, and designing scientifically reasonable "fish crossing" channels. The amount of watershed resources in Qinghai Lake has increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy head of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Office in Qinghai province, said that up to now, the artificial breeding and discharge of nearly 1.8 billion tails of Qinghai Lake carp had been carried out, and the contribution rate to the recovery of the carp resources in Qinghai Lake was more than 23%.
Qinghai Three River source area is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area controlling western desertification spread to the east.
In order to protect the ecological ecology of the Three Rivers source area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife and preserve the biological diversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued a Notice of Prohibition of Fishing in Key Water Areas of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since this year, and has built up a comprehensive "one river, one river, one lake"

I've just seen an article writing a fake, it's too long.
Give the unknown man Cope a shot.
Most girls experience their first case break suddenly at some point between the ages of 13 and 15, and close their menstrual cycle around the age of 50.
Afterwards, on the condition of good health, we will come regularly every month.
But it is not the norm to be able to accurately predict, about a week or so of public deficits, you need to prepare in advance, sometimes luck will turn over the car ( suddenly several days ahead).
The length of time, the amount of blood and the degree of pain varies by person, some people three days, some people a week; some people are less flowing, some people fall apart; some people have no reaction, some people hurt to take away ambulances, pain will change over time, before it does not represent a lifeless pain.
No control over the menstruation, bleeding for 24 hours within a few days starting and ending, can only be done by blood inhaling with sanitary towels or sanitary cotton bars to prevent flow into clothing chairs.
Painful menstruation is mainly due to the secretion of the prostate gland, the physiological period has not come to the beginning of painful menstruation when fast to eat thrombin can effectively relieve the pain during the month, painful menstruation starts after eating no use.
Before the physiological period, due to uterine overcharging and prostate release too much, it is easy to pull the stomach.
If you're about to get your period, you'll get your menstrual period basically within two days.
It is best to replace the towel once every two or three hours, otherwise it will easily infect bacteria. Apart from sleeping time, the worst case is to replace it six times a day, seven days a month, that is, 42 pieces. If you add 50 pieces prepared in advance, it will not be used every month.
(Modified here, tampons don't have to be changed regularly, probably once in five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Menstrual hormone poisoning may be more rabid, ovulation may also be caused by hormonal changes in the mood, which is very unfortunate, the body makes itself a stumbling block.
But the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control emotions is still high, and do not take excuses for emotional problems.
The flow is not just blood, which includes the absorption of the uterine membrane.
After the end of the menstrual period, the uterine membrane is thinner and then slowly thicker, it can be understood that the uterus is a house, each month to build a house (the inner membrane becomes thick) ready to meet guests, guests did not come, all removed (monthly discharge) next month to build a new house.
Menstruation is not convenient. For decades, every few days of every month is bleeding 24 hours, and there is pain in the stomach, so who wants to?
But a person can be born because his mother comes through the menstruation, the menstruation is to prepare you to live in a house for 10 months when you first come to the world, everyone should thank their mothers regular health to come through the menstruation.
Many things were suppressed for women in the past, society called brainwashing women dirty and shameful, and people thought it was, but the times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is sickening, that women's bodies are sickening of preparing for life, they should not say in front of the audience in the courtroom, girls stand up, don't think that anymore, never have experienced it, this child will not experience it, and they will not be able to do it again.
Finally, the sisters try hygienic cotton bars, which is really useful.
It's a winter holiday. It's more disappointing to send the mistake.
We'll order another meal for the kids.
I hope that the store should check out the product in all its busyness.
Is the foot bath bubble foot scarf leaked electricity?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in health care, and today the Kingdom of Heaven American Writers will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
As people's health awareness increases, the foot bath basin is becoming increasingly popular among consumers, and a large number of different products have emerged in the market, ranging from over one hundred yuan to thousands of yuan.
On the relevant data surface, healthcare households like the foot bath basin sell hot flashes compared to traditional household appliances, but the foot bath basin does not have specialized industry standards, so there are certain safety hazards.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in the electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath to give his father as a birthday present, but he felt numbness when he rubbed his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought that the vibration function of the foot bath basin was caused, but he did not think about switching off the vibration function, and his father felt numbness to the bottom of his feet.
Mr. Lee tried with an electric pen, and the electric pen was brightened, and Mr. Lee was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath is powered.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was good. Mr. Li was still uncomfortable despite withdrawing from the bathtub.
Because he found that this long-established foot bathtub now has no clear detailed industry regulations on the setting of the highest temperature, what kind of people, what kind of materials guarantee harmlessness and so on.
But in general, the foot bathtub will not have a power supply problem, but it does not rule out that a few products are not strictly closed when leaving the factory.
So, at the time of purchase, you choose a split tub.
Hydropower is separated and there is no safety hazard.
At the same time, you can take an electric pen test.

So if the food isn't hot, can we cancel it?
I don't want to, because there is no way to park below, he couldn't bring it up.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy designed to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.

The metaphysical branches include ontology, natural theology and its extension issues.
Integrity is "to study which terms represent the real entity of existence, and which term only represents a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of God's existence.
Its theoretical foundation believes that all phenomena can be conceptually explained by natural reason, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.

That's less than the same. You need money for one mallet chicken sauce.
You asked the restaurant to come in.
I just don't want to go downstairs and buy something, and I'm going to spend so much money on selling it.
Ding Xiaolin: To my friends.
I would like to sincerely thank my friends for the humanitarian assistance they have provided over the long period of more than 30 years after our relatives' death, especially those that have not been interrupted so far since I personally sent a call for humanitarian assistance to foreign and domestic friends in early 1994.
Today, most of the old parents of the victims have been thanked, and the orphans have grown into families and employment.
Your acts of kindness have helped our troubled families through the most difficult times.
The coronavirus outbreak is raging globally and most of the donors have retired by the end of the year.
Therefore, I sincerely ask you to suspend the humanitarian donation of our difficult family - Tiananmen's mother group - and this humanitarian relief campaign should have been painted a perfect line.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteousness will be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way and please friends to understand!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tau: Allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance by the All-American Federation of Science and Technology (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democratic Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, the All-American Institute for Self-Teaching and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations with frequent crossovers between project executives.

Rescue funds are often not delivered successfully to the hands of sixty-four refugees.
In 1994, according to the suggestion of Professor Ding, a special group was established by "Tian'anmen Mother" to integrate and distribute the recipient and headway aid.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "Sixty-four Orphan Education Fund", which was implemented eleven years later in 2009 and after graduating from college for all six or four orphanages, the MCDF subsequently established the "Sixty-four Ailing Elderly Special Needs Rescue Fund" and has been implementing so far.
Funding for these projects, mainly from campus and social contributions in the six-to-four year period, from individual generous contributions, and supported by the Brotherhood University Foundation for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Foundation for Research on Labour Reform.
It wasn't until last year, 31 years later, that the Six Four finally received a portion of the donation from Hong Kong that year in the name of Six Four.
During this period, Human Rights in China is also independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr Ding's request to stop six or four donations is for donors to consider, and we are indeed all retired old people. Income is not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to thank Mr Ding's "friends" letter.
We will respect the decision of the disabled to terminate the project within two years and resume immediately when needed.
Those who have persisted in their generous efforts over the years to deliver humanitarian aid at risk join in thanks and esteem.

[Effect] Photo Effect: Shooting two clothes is good overall. I like this set of pictures a lot ~
[Service] Service Details: Because pregnancy was a little uncomfortable during the make-up, the make-up workers and staff were kind enough to let me rest for a while and keep pouring hot water for me.
The price of the set: 1000 yuan
Thanks for the rabbit's comment. It was also said that the rejection of the ancient wind was not suitable for the ancient wind. I didn't expect the finished products to be so beautiful.
Thanks to Dandan's approval, your satisfaction will make us full of electricity continue forward and we will continue to refuel!
This photo studio is really great, and it strongly recommends that all young people come!
Whether from reception, make-up, clothing, lights, photography to the latter, there is no choice.
Make-up artists are specially sophisticated, will match your style to suit your make-up, cosmetics use is also the front line big brands.
Not to mention the teacher of Tian Liang, photography is quite a professional.
The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and two kittens play with them.
We are working in Beijing, and the good film buildings in Beijing need to line up for half a year ahead of schedule. Our colleagues have been photographing them in Beijing, watching their films as if they were just so.
I especially sought this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, it feels that this is also the short version of most people, photographer Ling Brothers will grab and record a natural wonderful moment.
Make-up artists, photographers, later designers, an excellent team.
We and everyone around us are very much in favour of it.
She has already recommended her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law has just seen the footage is also full of joy.
I hope that such a studio is not buried, more people find the ta, and shoot it belongs to their own style, rather than one-thousandth.
Thank you very much for the five-star rating given to Owl and Kei Ling, both of whom are very creative and creative newcomers, and we are creative studios, as long as customers like us, we will do our best to complete, and thank you for meeting each other

Thanks for Xiao Yu's comment. It's also a reason to know you. From Cho and Hao to Qinhuang Island, our trust is thousands of kilometers long. I'm very happy to know you. I'll have the opportunity to visit Qinhuang Island again next time
How do I give money?

Now the restaurant clerk calls me
A programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you want to get into this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training, but if you don't have the idea, it's better to learn on your own, after all, training costs a lot of money and takes six months to learn.
But if the training is intended to enter the industry, it is really a very good choice, especially for those who are self-control and weak.
If you are more self-control, you can also choose self-education, but you will be tired.
It is of course very important to choose a good training institution.
It depends first and foremost on the teaching power of this institution. If the teaching power is not strong enough, the training institution will have little meaning. Of course, some of the new training institutions will have no special strength.
Second, to explore the training institution before choosing it, it would be better to visit the students from the institution. After all, only the students from the institution know what the institution is like, and the curriculum is good or bad.
In fact, I don't know how to answer this question, because there is no specific introduction to your own situation, and learning about this thing and the individual's situation are very relevant.
For example, professionalism, age, language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will be related to the industry you are learning or wanting to engage in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or computer science has graduated, then if there is enough time I personally recommend self-study, this is the least efficient and costly, now many offline training institutions are really good, but one study costs high, two investment time more, basic need to concentrate training 3-6 months.
But if I say these things, self-study is convenient, now a lot of learning resources on the network are free, or go to b station also a lot of training resources, if you don't find resources, you can also contact me by introduction, get free resources, or detailed advice as well.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can also pay for some money and time costs of learning, it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn, so that learning does not require much effort, teachers explain in detail, and there are questions that are answered specifically, in addition to learning planning or
Many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal quotas, and after studying, recommend companies, so that the interview process for finding jobs later can save a lot.
The above is some of my opinions, because I do not understand your situation, so only perhaps the introduction is not detailed, if you have other people who want to consult, please contact me at any time for communication and communication.
I said I was there by 1:00, and I saw it at App.
What's that?
I haven't finished. What are you doing?
I accept all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall hanging stove heater, clean waterer, washing machine, air conditioner, bucket, stove head, oil tobacco machine, lighting fixtures, glass cleaning, professional sewing, domestic service
Thank you to those who have quietly complimented me, working hard to live, but life is tired but I have to go on.
Life will not fail every person who strives, like to pay attention to me, thank those who silently praise me.
Life is like this, other people only look at the result, their own self-supporting process, face life, we have no choice but to be strong, it is to continue, there is no choice, the road can look back but can not go back...
Maintaining cleanliness is a job, it is also a duty, life is beautiful because of service, service is wonderful because of heart.
Cleaning is the dirtiest thing we do, but we will clean clean every corner of the house with the most serious attitude, see the customer's happy smile and the thumbs up, and all the fatigue is worth it, and pay the price.
My day-to-day work
I'm your request, my service.
Use your heart for service, keep your heart clean, keep your beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggui's home affairs help you to do "clean" what I can and serve a loved one.
Keep your house clean, tree house monuments, service on site, clean home.
Interior and exterior cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, but long time without cleaning will be bleak and lightless, only after cleaning can be overblown and brightened.
Careful work can succeed, with careful shaping fine, beautiful sewing we are serious.
Give me the opportunity, you will surely be satisfied, quality explains everything, because professional deserves to be trusted, your acknowledgment is my most encouraged!
It's hard to do all walks of life at the moment!
But I always believe that as long as serious attitude, enough persistence, enough effort, I will be a bit better than others, at least always more than sitting complaining."
The idea of one day lies in the morning, and all the beauty begins early in the morning, and I hope you will start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and desire, and keep the good mood all day.
When you are a child, happiness is something that has happiness; when you grow up, happiness is a goal to achieve happiness; after maturity, it is found that happiness was originally a mindset and realized happiness.
Be the truest and kindest of yourself and walk without regret for this life; live one way and follow one's own path; live two treasures of life: good health, good mood, beautiful and living in old age!
Every stage of life will encounter different difficulties.
Many times, it is not your ability that holds you back, but the courage to face it positively.
Since it is impossible to avoid, it is better to face it openly.
The more you are afraid, the more you will be crushed by difficulties; if you find it difficult, the problem will finally be solved.
Chinese curators are working together to host Saudi Arabia's first Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary Art - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency Riyadh on December 12 (reporter Wang Haizhou Hu Kong) Saudi Arabia's first biennale of contemporary art - the Dirije Biennale of Contemporary Art, officially opened to the public on December 11 in the JAX arts district of Dirije northwest of Riyadh, Saudi capital. The exhibition was attended by 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places.
The two-year exhibition was jointly organized by the Saudi Arabian Biennial Exhibition Foundation and the UCCA Yulens Contemporary Art Center of China. The curator of the UCCA Yulens Contemporary Art Center of China, Yuyu Tan, is the artistic director.
According to the curator team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Touch the Stone and Cross the River", which metaphorizes the reform strategy taken during the period of socio-economic transformation and reflects the current situation in Saudi socio-cultural development.
This two-year exhibition occupies nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition hall crosses six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: Touching the stone across the river, Inheritance as an experiment, Border thinking, Going to the public, Beautiful New World.
Among them, the number of works by 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total amount of this exhibition, including painting, installation and performing arts in many forms; 12 Chinese artists also have a high level of attention, some artists used recycled materials in novel ways to create, such as Xu Ice refactoring a classic mountain water painting with waste in "The Endless Picture of the Story Series Behind" (2014).
"We hope that this biennial exhibition will create an international dialogue, give global audiences an opportunity to get to know the vibrant cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia and strengthen interactions," said Bakli, chief executive of the Diliyah Biennial Exhibition Foundation.
"The goal of the Biennale is dual, both to engage Saudi contemporary art in global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the Biennale, and opinion leaders from artists, curators and creative industries will discuss cross-cultural exchanges and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Integrated regulation of rural public welfare jobs management - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lim Bingfeng) In order to continue to do well to help lift the poor out of poverty and consolidate the achievements of expanding the fight against poverty, Yunnan Province recently introduced relevant policies to promote the revitalization of rural public
The relevant head of the Yunnan People's Societies Office introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed 448.3 million rural public welfare jobs for employment in difficult rural groups such as poverty-relief workers and plays an important role in helping the people out of poverty achieve increased employment income, consolidating the achievement of poverty reduction and effective upgrading of all public services capabilities in rural areas.
The new regulations will be issued jointly by the seven departments of Yunnan People's Association, Rural Revitalization, Finance, etc., and will mainly uniformly regulate the scope, fund management, job development and job management of rural public service personnel recruited at the grassroots level.
With regard to the establishment of position development, the new rules are clear and will be established in accordance with the principles of "posting as needed, posting people, dynamic management, total control" "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one-on-one, voluntary open, unified management".
Recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with such steps as announcements, declarations, audits, publicity, hiring, pre-service training and placement.
Furthermore, the new regulations clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public service posts, the standards of subsidies for rural public service posts, and the method of subsidies. They stipulate that the development departments of rural public service posts should purchase accident and injury business insurance for the persons to be placed in rural public service posts, and require the relevant departments to regularly issue subsidies for rural public service posts
Wrong address.
Hello.
Can I cancel my order
I'm re-ordering.
Has it been cancelled?
Secondly, although the right-wing party has a time of ambition in history, but it is not long, so short because giving a little sunshine is brilliant, drinking a little water is sweating; a little ambition is Long looking at Shu, and being hit, it will be the same.
But in reality, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive meaning of the right should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution by defining the standards of truth, developing the economy and improving science and technology, as well as promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights guarantees.
Third, as for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Wei Dong's statements, I care about him and respect him very much; because he is serious, he is serious about China and he is serious about China's social issues.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that the counter-revolution is necessary. The revolution is bound to lead to social unrest, damage to the livelihood of the people, and the political group is mixed in, and foreign countries take advantage of it.
Fourthly, the attitude of changing or improving China should be patient and accountable to the people. The political speculation attempt is a knockout. That is not the right party, it is an asshole.
Let's talk to the left again.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of eras and political abandonment.
If the right has positive meaning for society and the Communist Party will listen to the right when needed and analyze their ideas, then the left is not made up, because the left wants the crap the Communist Party throws away!
V. Recently, I have seen some friends with anti-thieves while rebutting the left epilepsy, and I feel that it is not necessary.
Don't try to talk about the abuse and the left-wing, they are all a mystery, it is pointless.
And don't try to prove us right, and don't think about getting feedback and leftists to admit it.
I told my friends: when feedback curses you, when the leftist curses your right dog, it just proves that our middle way is right!
Many people also had ideals when they were young, and when they got old, they forgot them, or pursued them, and became prejudiced.
And the ideal is gradually moving away, and even the dragon teen has become a vicious dragon.
To the left, I think that generally refers to restraint and freedom, China's innate genes from history and culture lead to Chinese overall should be left-wing.
The right side of the country is free, with an emphasis on efficiency and development, and the left side strengthens supervision, with a greater focus on fairness and security.
Now the overall social hope is to pay more attention to equity, while China and the United States are vying for a positive left-wing approach, which is expected to continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, the compliment is over.
I didn't say anything. Flowers are so loyal
In recent years, the blockade and siege of Huawei's chips by the US government has not only plunged Huawei into unprecedented difficulty, but also caused huge losses for the Chinese-American chip company.
The direct consequence of the United States Empire crushing China's chip industry and requiring its own enterprises and allied countries' related enterprises to block the country's chip industry at the same time is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers have been affected, resulting in lower R&D inputs and reduced production capacity of chip producing enterprises, thus creating a global
The shortage of core has now spread to major industries around the world, such as automotive plants, mobile phones, and almost all industries that use chips have been hit hard by it.
In order to grasp the autonomy of "chips," the technology giants of more and more countries began to go on the road of "to beautify."
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control, drag the development of China's semiconductor industry, recent old American action is frequent, and also hosted the "chip summit"; it invited 64 giants to establish a semiconductor alliance and withdraw funds to support domestic US technology giants, for example, Mei Dynasty senior tech giant Intel in order to regain its dominance in the field of chips, spent $20 billion on building two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and opening up chip replacement business.
When most people think that Intel's move will cause a certain impact on TSMC, and it is very likely to take away the "job" of TSMC.
The reason for this is that Intel, as the oldest technology giant in the U.S., has worked in the semiconductor field for decades and has a large talent pool and technological reserve. It is certain that it will rise rapidly in the short term and defeat the accumulator power plant.
However, with regard to Intel's decision, Zhang Xinjin, the founder of the power plant, paid no attention to it.
At the "2021 Master Intellectual Property Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Chung expressed surprise at the move to fund Intel's chip factory. Zhang Chung said without hesitation: Intel's chip replacement factory is rather ironic.
Zhang忠谋 is disdainful of Intel's entry into the crystal circle field, because Zhang忠谋 still holds a grudge against the MP3 and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has been the pearl of the U.S. imperialist manufacturing industry, the world's top leader in semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been controlled by a few powerful ones.
The semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips from design, manufacture to sealing were made by a factory, Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model has overstretched some small enterprises, and many semi-conductor entrepreneurs have had to face huge production-line construction costs.
In response to market demand, after the 1980s, the chip industry began to show division of labour and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Chung-chung heard of a company specializing in chip design, and thought that since there is a company specializing in design, it can be founded a factory specialized in crystal production.
Shortly afterwards, Zhang's idea became a reality, and the TV set was born.
The station power has targeted the main business at the single link of "crystal processing", and it does not design, but only provides surrogate services for crystalry manufacturing.
The newly created Taiyu Electric was a small one in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang was looking for an investment in Intel, but at the time Intel heard that TSMC electricity is only a manufacturing link in the chip industry, apparently some self-esteemed, can not afford TSMC electricity, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC electricity.
Zhang also believed that Intel was not able to afford wafer process services at the time.
I didn't expect to see the giant crystal manufacturing service back then, but now I'm going to start doing crystal replacement.
Thus, Zhang Chung thought it was ironic that Intel entered the crystal processing industry.
The market value of standby electricity has now exceeded Intel.
In the face of the powerful attack of the accumulated electricity, Intel naturally did not dare to stand firm.
Today, standby power is already plugged into 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
Trying to catch up is not easy.
Not waiting
It's been 2 hours until 19:06
Today we're going to see some weird hot flashes.
What is a normal mood?
Three hot searches were randomly chosen: the February 2 rise of the Dragon, the price hike of the good friend Liyu, the freight rush event, the spread of public opinion forms a wave peak, and then the [index decline] (the smooth curve) finally dissipates, and if there is a secondary public opinion there will be a small hummingbird peak again.
They appear to be no different from the [model of evolution of public opinion] shown on the website.
What is an abnormal mood?
Six heat searches in the same event were randomly selected, and the results were shown as isolated peaks, saw teeth, and cliffs.
[Single Peak] is artificially heating up, rapidly launching hot search, which attracts public attention; [Serious] is cyclical heating to ensure that the topic is hot on the list; [Breaking cliff] is collective evacuation, and the hot search completes the "functional"
In Figure 9, the heatwave peak of one incident coincides with another event's wave valley, and the time is not bad in seconds, it must be a unified batch of water forces received the task to open a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black PR can be seen: dozens of hot searches at the same time on the list, which attracts attention, which is responsible for KUP, which leads to war, which shifts sights, what influences perception, which misleads judgment, which incites emotions, which holds up decisions, and who fine-tunes battles with a black account batches and sub nodes, almost taking into account all elements of public opinion dissemination and diffusion.
Communication is a science that throws aside all the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will be nowhere to hide.
Anyone who walks through will leave traces like these, and we dug them together.

In Mauritius and other countries, the first case of Omicron poison strain infection was discovered - chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency Beijing on December 12 reported that the first cases of infection with the coronavirus variant, the Omicron strain, were reported in Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently.
Mauritius reported for the first time two cases of Omician drug strain infection in the country on the 10th.
According to Mao Health Minister Kelesh Jagutepar, one of the infected persons was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa; another was a local resident of Mauritius, and he tested positive for nucleic acid on November 30 after contacting a person who had recently returned to South Africa
After hospital isolation treatment, the two infected nucleic acid test results were turned negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of Health announced on 10th that three cases of infection with the Omicron strain were confirmed for the first time in the country.
All three were students who returned from travel abroad earlier this month and were not admitted due to mild conditions.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omik Chin drug strain, the government of Serbia has constantly stepped up its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 arriving by plane are required to undergo a nuclear acid test at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it would begin vaccination of Pfizer’s new crown vaccine for children between 5 and 11 years of age in the country.
On the 9th, Malawi's Minister of Health, Kambize Chiponda said that the country had detected three cases of Omicone drug strain infection for the first time.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing of 12 new coronary positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found the three cases of infection.

Great America 360 Integrated Home Decoration
Location: 12th floor of Happiness Home 156 South Road, Ring City
At first it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to look at at the beginning my budget is 70,000 to do a basic decoration.
I came to the store and started a series of scams.
For the first time, I came to the store to see my family chart. They didn't actually take a physical look at the house. They were able to offer me a price of 70,000 from my 135th house, and they probably showed me their material without knowing what brand they were.
Their second trick is that you'll drag your money back as long as you get to the store, and once you've given it back, you're never going to get out unless you have enough experience to fight them theoretically.
When I was hesitant to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount you can get if you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit, and I am a living example of being deceived, and I paid more than 10,000 down payment in mind impulses.
He offered me a lot of questions about $70,000 that did not include hydropower and no doors and cabinet bathrooms, and those three were the big costs of the basics.
In addition to these services, their fees are higher than other companies.
I lost confidence in the company and nothing was clear at the beginning, so I signed the contract.
When I was looking for them to pay back, they showed a lot of experience, and there was a specialized small team to deal with you.
In any case, they will bite to death as a problem for their clients, and they will not be held responsible.
There are a lot of details about the various dumping responsibility, and don't want to say it all in tears, anyway, do not choose them, because my friends find their renovated house is also poor quality, and later you will pay various fees.

The meteor shower of the constellation of Jupiter and Jupiter is expected to be a huge event on the 14th day.
News Agency Tianjin December 12th, "Journalist Zhou Zhen" Astronomical Cooperation expert introduced that as the last large meteor shower of the year, the twin meteor shower, one of the three largest meteor shower in the Northern Hemisphere, will be launched on December 14th.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast An Kuok shot the twin meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the meteor showers are periodic comets, but Gemini's meteor showers are Fahrenheit No. 3200, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The twin meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not to be conceived by a comet.
Xu Lippeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and expert in Astronomy Cop, said that just like a big picture of He's Young, Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, "the release period" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large flow and stability, and along with the quadrant meteor shower and the Anglican meteor shower, it is known as the three meteor showers in the northern hemisphere.
One notable feature of the twin meteor shower is that the meteors are slower, rich in color, and there are also many fire meteors, which are suitable for both eyesight and astronomical photography beginners to shoot.
Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast in Tianjin City, photographed the twin meteor shower on December 13, 2020 in Tianjin Artichzhou.
Astronomy forecasts show that this year's meteor showers in the constellation of Pluto will be overwhelming at around 15 o'clock on December 14th, when the maximum ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, the amount of meteors visible per hour when the radiation point is right above the top of the head) is 150.
Recommended index graphs of meteor showers in the constellation.
"Last year, the 'flowering' meteor showers of twins impressed people, but this year's meteor showers will be disturbed by moonlight and a slight discount.
On November 11 of the Chinese Calendar, the moon is full of moons. The bright moon will interfere with observations. Fortunately, the moon will fall in the middle of the night. At this time, the radiation points of the twin meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe the moon during the last half of the night, but be careful to keep warm.
How can we see as many meteors as possible?
It is not recommended to observe in the city, so you can choose a high altitude, light-small, northeast-facing viewpoint in the suburbs or rural areas, and wait patiently until the moon falls, so you can observe.
It is worth noting that the flow of meteor showers in each direction is large, so that the observation does not have to look at the radiation points of the meteor showers.
Friends who like photography want to shoot beautiful meteor shower shots. It is best to choose wide angle, large lens, using high ISO and maximum lens when shooting.
Based on stability and sustainability considerations, tripods, spare batteries and fast door lines are also essential."
Shu Li Peng reminded me.
What difference does laser TV and traditional TV make in market positioning?
In my understanding, what the subject is referring to traditional TV is LCD, and the difference between laser TV and LCD TV on market positioning is mainly the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the big screen market.
Compared to the market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV clearly focuses more on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is the product of the large screen.
Currently, the main LCD TV size is mostly 55 to 65 inches, while the laser TV size is generally more than 75 inches, the largest is more than 100 inches, fully satisfying the consumer's demand for large screen color power.
In recent years, the sales and sales share of laser television has been increasing globally, accounting for more than 60% of total television sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhong Yi-Kong's forecast, in 2020, sales growth in the laser television market will exceed 140%, and will continue to grow at a fast pace.
The reason for such a good performance in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye care.
Based on the long reflection imaging principle of laser television, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly hit the eyeball, compared with the back light emitted by LCD television, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is smaller.
The Sixi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and the eye specialists of the Beijing Co-operative Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through strict comparison tests of laser television and LCD television viewed in the same conditions in the population.
The data confirms that laser television does have strong eye protection characteristics and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
In the moment when vision health is increasingly valued, laser television not only attracts more and more users with eye care advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous investigation of the price of LCD TV, the current market selling laser TV prices are more than 10,000 yuan, with the upgrading of size and light sources, the price gradually climbed.
Why is laser TV selling so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TVs and projections cannot achieve.
With ultra-focal projection technology, laser television's projection distance is shorter than traditional projectors, it is able to achieve 100 inches of screen experience within a short distance, requires little space, and its host is small, and it is very small.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser television can reach more than 2000 brightness.
Adding lower heat and less equipment loss, the TV service life is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser television models also carry the true 4K ultra high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence system, simulation screen, etc., can bring the user more shocking visual and auditory experience.
It's not about fake demand, it's about products that are subdivided by demand, about the quality of the picture and the ratio of input to output, laser television is not a menu for video and audio players, want to take into account both the large screen and the lack of viewing environment, can try, everything is advantageous and disadvantageous, after weighing it out, you can judge it yourself, and you're afraid to listen
Simply put, ultra-wide angle close-focus projection machines - laser TVs - had to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors to close to the canvas, which did not match the best optical design.
In order to block part of the environmental light, the Finier screen, which uses a microstructure, is expensive, and the 80-inch price can be basically replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
There is also a point, I especially hate the projector's reflection to the eyes good when selling point, please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes, you are diffusely reflected into the ceiling, the eyes cannot see, not to be more real LCD TV is also roaming "direct shooting", opening the television ceiling is not also illuminated?
Furthermore, projection screens can't make a picture if they don't reflect at all.
It is precisely ignored the thermal spot (light spot) effect of high gain screen cloth, at a certain angle a lot of light reflects to the eyes, that is really hard to accept.
The best quality shop in the visual aesthetic photography gallery has not yet been opened for some time.
After adding the date of the appointment of the WeChat, the younger sister sent me the optional schedule, and the answer information was more timely
I went to see the shops before, and more of them were outdoor wedding dresses, and the pictures were beautiful, and there were many different styles involved.
After that day, I briefly exchanged my ideas with my sister, very patiently helped me to try two sets of style dresses which I tangled up and finally decided to start make-up - the photographer would put some props before shooting, will guide actions, and more refined on each detail.
But maybe because I didn't share specific ideas, it wasn't the style I wanted, but it should be good looking.
After the shoot, the photographer will help pick the photos, communicate the style of the later, and feel very careful.
It takes about half a month to repair the film and wait for the effect.
The second time, the real-life premier meal event - most of the clothes in the whole field can choose a shot.
Finally, a black dress was chosen, and different styles were experienced.
It takes about two hours for the whole filming process to be made, and the cameraman responsible for the shooting is the younger brother after 95. It feels a little dreary. It is hoped that more advice will be given later in the customer's action guidance.
Featured Quality Store in the Visual and Fine Arts Photography Gallery
It's on the front page. Let's see Queenie too.
The first thing to do is fill out the name and phone, then choose the dress, wedding dress can be chosen, change three or four sets of clothes is still very patient, make-up after selection is long, service attitude is good, and later photography will teach you how to shape, which is to shoot.
The environment is good overall.
There are a lot of optional clothes.
There are almost three makeup locations, and there is a camera shed inside.
The service was enthusiastic and careful.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also be very serious about teaching you how to move.
Not satisfied, the photographers will also actively submit sub-shots.
[Experience] Perhaps the shape of a little over, the original double eyelids were coated with three eyelids.
The eyebrow has also been shaved, and it is a bit embarrassing to not paint eyebrows on a daily basis.
The photo was given ten days ago, but the effect of the P photo is not very satisfactory, feeling that the eyelids are sticking those still very obvious.
Because it is not clear what style to try two sets of results to pick or choose a black dress, the younger sister said that this set is compared with Hurburn's retro wind.
The hair stylist and the little sister of the makeup artist are super patient in helping me to get the effect is very satisfied.
I started to take pictures after making up my hair, and the photographer directed me to my pose all the way. The process was easy and harmonious.
After shooting, I carefully selected four of my favorites. The younger brother said he made 15 films, and the ending was very satisfactory.
I haven't responded for 3 days... I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee scheme because your system can't recognize my credit card!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay
I have to pay freight every time.
Can I get an exemption before you can charge me for my monthly fee after the investigation?
Small umbrellas to buy insurance, is it?
The Little Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the point of view of setting conditions: According to the supervision regulations of insurance brokerage institutions (revised in 2015), becoming an insurance brokerage company must meet three key words: shareholders, sponsors have no significant illegal records for the last three years, a minimum limit of RMB 50 million can be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Supervisory Board.
These three are really very demanding, summing up is to have strength, through the approval of the national authority of the Banking Supervisory Board (the supervision of insurance companies and banks throughout the country), shareholders should have a good practice, as an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance, insurers don't have to ask too much about the formality of the small umbrella insurance, after all, there are these three thresholds, not any insurance company can achieve.
In this respect, it's good, it's trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies are selling star sickness insurance on this platform, such as the latest and Tai Super Mary 5 sickness insurance, the claimant and insurer are all Tai Life, umbrella insurance is only a third party intermediary, no doubt
From the payment mode: Internet platform products, because there are fewer operating costs of business networks, and the cost of business staff, so Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and the payment mode is flexible, supports monthly payment, relieves the insurer's payment pressure, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
Can be considered.
From the point of view of the professionalism of businessmen: this is especially important, because insurance is a very demanding industry, many Internet products customers can insure themselves, this will be a lot of misunderstandings, in health information and professions this group, non-insured practitioners often add their subjective consciousness when insurable, feel that they are healthy or fit, so it is easy to have many claims risks, there is a risk of being rejected.
I myself have been selling insurance phones at Tencent Micro Insurance (and like Little Rainbow, which is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is true, it is also based on spectrum, not based on people, there are no professional practitioners in the Internet channel, and there are many sales misdirections.
For example: $1 insurance premium of 6 million, buy insurance and send mobile phones, receive free coverage of 60,000 serious diseases, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid weightlessness, will not tell insurers, the first month is to be charged by normal fees, dozens to 200 range, many customers charge a fee for one or two years.
If you can spend one dollar, the insurance company will pay $6 million (the pie is dropped in the day).
Free mobile phones are sent at the end of the insurance policy, such as 6666,8888, which is the special insurance policy section, and if the winner sends a text message, they will not exchange it, nor will anyone be reminded.
(This is another pit for the insurers) to receive 60,000 free insurance coverage, it is short-term, if only on this, there are no other commercial insurance, in case of serious illness, 60,000 can do what, can not solve the problem, and later life begins to be naked.
At present, the country is also severely cracking down on misinformation about Internet insurance sales.
So comprehensively, the platform is no problem, there are no problems with products, and there are problems with the professionalism and professional conduct of businessmen.
It is recommended that the subject matter be considered carefully and comprehensively. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, with more opportunities and products available to customers, and some products have a better price than Internet products.
I myself helped 59 Internet customers, insured products offline, and everyone saved $2000-3000 per year.
If you have any questions, welcome to communicate and exchange with me.
I: Mingya insurance broker, has three years of experience in enterprise management training, service to nearly thousand corporate users, cooperation with more than 100 insurance companies, before the insurance, I will start from customer needs, customize insurance products for customers, and put into insurance, do my best to win the best nuclear insurance results for customers, after insurance, make a security policy for customers.
Growing up with every customer for life.
I hope my answer will help the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance is insurance business where the insurer can independently complete all insurance processes by clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insurer on his own.
Although Internet insurance coverage is not so " ritualistic" and perhaps even printed paper contracts are not, this does not affect the effectiveness and legal validity of electronic contracts at all.
This model is a bit similar to the usual wiring operation of "telephone sales", but this purchase insurance will also have a fatal problem, that is - follow-up services may not keep up with.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously think about whether the "intermediate" we have chosen, or an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and will provide us services many years later?

Thank you for your help
From before to now, I have been opposed to any form of slander and curse, and can no longer accept such acts of personal attack.
In civilized society, we can embrace everything but to put an end to such villains.
If you don't look at the political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
I've taken a non-response attitude since you started sending Facebook requests for friends and then posting funny posts, and before you tried to publish the so-called place of my home and father's name on social media.
You've changed your mind sharply, not only by continuing to eat six meals a day, but also by continuing to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some obscure, shameful statements about me, my appearance, my body, my well-being, what kind of strawberries I want to plant in bed
How do you know I've received more comments from many friends about a photo of your Facebook friend account and sexually harassing ingredients.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After I posted the news of the alarm, you didn't converge at all. Instead, you got more and more furious.
I don't care what political background you have or what status you have, in our society, it is a matter of bi-gender respect.
Yes, you can go on with your sarcastic, covert, humiliating and insulting remarks, and you can go on saying that you're just caring and paying attention to me. You can continue to think that this isn't harassment, you can even continue to deny that it's not
No, I can't, and I have no power to stop you.
I don't know you, nor do I want to know you, and my appearance and body no longer require you to comment on your head.
I don't even think that any girl would be willing to let others humiliate themselves so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, okay?
I said good, and you wouldn't believe it either.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like this.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who lack even basic qualities will choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the human heart.
I cut off some of the messages and commented on them
No one can pretend to be you with your own post.
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization
I'll smile with my heart

Xinhua News Agency (China News Agency) said on Sunday (December 11) that the Fuling Waterfront Green Integrated Service Area in Chongqing City was put into operation on the 10th day as scheduled, the 2nd officially operating waterfront green integrated service area upstream of the Yangtze River after the opening of the Fuling Waterfront Green Integrated Service Area in Luzhou, Sichuan Province on the 8th day
At this point, the integrated water-green service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Zhu Zhihua, Deputy Director of the Jiang Shuttle Administration for Transport Minister, said that earlier, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces have completed and operated 10 water-green integrated service areas in the middle and downstream of the Yangtze River, which has been recognized by a large number of crew members to play an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the water green integrated service area is another milestone in the construction of green shipping in the Yangtze River, and the receiving of pollutants from ships in the Yangtze River River and the ability of shipping services have been significantly improved.
The integrated water-green service area is an important facility for the majority of ships and crews to provide a full range of production and life services, helping the majority of crews solve the problem of "hurried hope".

The U.S. three aircraft carriers are gathering around China, the most powerful weapons rarely visited Guam 2022-01-17 Multidimensional Pro-CPC media multidimensional coverage: latest news of Sino-US relations: the latest satellite images show that three US carriers are gathering around China; the U.S. media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal is rare to visit Guam, releasing important signals to American allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to China's think tank, the Strategic Situation Perception Platform in the South China Sea, on January 9, the satellite discovered the USS Carl Vinson, a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, near the Strait of Barabakh.
The Barabak Strait connects the South Sea and Su Luhai, which is a strategic hub on the first island chain in the West Pacific.
The platform expects the "Carl Vinson" to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This was the first deployment of the Jenkins Vinson-class aircraft carrier with F-35C fighter aircraft and CMV-22 Jenkins-class cargo carriers.
The U.S. military aircraft carrier, which is now navigating the Pacific Ocean, in addition to Carl Vinson, has a USS Abraham Lincoln launch from the United States on January 3.
Lincoln also used the F-35C carrier squadron for the first time, which was part of the U.S. Marine Corps's 314th Combatant Attack squadron.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers, the US Navy currently deploys the USS Ronald Reagan, a cargo ship based in Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Champland Lake" missile cruiser and the "Stockdar" missile destroyer.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Posture Perception Platform" released the latest satellite pictures, showing that the three aircraft carriers of the US military were gathering around China.
(Weibo @Nanhai Strategic Posture Perception) The US three carrier assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam on January 17, 2022. The U.S. naval carrier CMV-22B flight route.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception) It was also reported by CNN on January 17 that one of the most powerful weapons in the Navy's arsenal visited Guam rarely last weekend.
The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US Naval Base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The U.S. three aircraft carriers have gathered the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam rarely, according to analysis, which is a signal to allies and enemies in an increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time that U.S. ballistic missile submarines have visited Guam since 2016, and the second time that they have visited Guam in public since the 1980s.
The U.S. three aircraft carriers have gathered around China, and the most powerful weapons are rare to visit Guam - China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The figure is for China's Yongxia island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in its statement that the visit of the Ohio class nuclear submarine Nevada to Guam strengthened cooperation between the U.S. and regional allies, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, operational readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly known as "boomer submarine".
The tracking of 14 of the U.S. Navy's torpedo submarines is usually strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes "thinging submarines" "the most important survival weapon of the nuclear triad", a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles located on the mainland of the United States, as well as bombers with nuclear warheads such as B-2 and B-52.
Speaking to friends about the recent 26 per cent decline in Meta, the market capitalization stepped up by $2510 billion, Zackberg responded "with unprecedented competition," why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company whose revenue comes mainly from advertising, and today's commercial companies that make money have their own flow channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and so on, no matter what functionality is positioned, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance," and many apps outsourced Meta ads are realized through Meta's advertising platform.
But the times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta has difficulty retrieving user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is friendly to users, and it will be clear if the user allows the App to get their own information, and most people's normal response is certainly not allowed.
Next, if Google does a little more, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Secondly, China's factor in the previous revenue growth of Meta has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is not sure how high, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta doesn't have any business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China each year, mainly from companies that do maritime business in China.
Meta has about a hundred people in its Hong Kong office, and several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand their overseas markets. Meta is an advertising channel that can't be bypassed. Most of the money paid for the fire was paid to Meta.
Interestingly, TT bytes are now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta has been making a lot of money from bytes for the past two years.
Every domestic agent is helping the byte to go to Meta for advertising, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also good.
I haven't been studying that much lately, but I'm sure it won't be better than before.
The stage of large-scale money burning by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Third, the new flow channels have not expanded smoothly.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets look not just at income, but more importantly what the future expects.
Clearly, Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg told "Megaspace."
The metacosm should indeed be one of the future directions, but its implementation cycle is relatively long, and this story should not have been enough in both three years to support Meta's market capitalization.
So the next two years should be a more difficult period for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook now, with $100 billion to $200 billion in revenue each year. In fact, Facebook has a very strong sense of crisis and there is no good safe haven compared to other Internet businesses and high-tech companies.
Although his social software is now relatively high in daily life, it is also a mainstream social software such as Facebook, WhatsApp and so on, but face the rapid development of Tiktok, Facebook has no confidence.
And the idea of creating a new universe, which is hopeless and impossible, has no hope of success in a short time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zackberg is changing the name of the company, and the fundamental reason for constantly looking for a new track, but I think his track selection is wrong, it is a failure
