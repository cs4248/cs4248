Students singing the protagonists of the Zhejiang Academic Year - The results of the research make a big opening hole - Xinhua Network
Wash your hands with air, take a breath to judge the disease, and search precisely for the source of the haze. Last night, at the opening of the annual academic conference of 2016 at Zhejiang University, a series of brain-brained academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these results are students, whose research covers fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities, and more. The students started from a curious point of view and created many high-end inventions with applied value, some of which have won national and international awards.
Biosensor: Your Family Medical Examiner
Dr. Zhang Deming, a Ph.D. student at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated on the spot a biosensor at the end of a smartphone that is only half the size of a smartphone.
“You just need to take a slight breath, and the device can test your health from the gas you breathe.”
Zhang Dian said that the sensor is connected to the smartphone and after the gas is exhaled, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart handrings that can detect health conditions on the market are generally measured by physical parameters such as temperature, pulse, etc.
This biosensor uses a new type of material, graphite, the target of which is the chemical element, with a sharp “sniff” that allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgery Lamps: Doctor's high-powered eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgery lights are used in the operating room.
The invention won a silver prize at the 44th Swiss International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva this year.
The Julinging and Shin Jun Fei team of Masters of the Academy of Optical Sciences and Engineering opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional operating lamps and invented intelligent LED surgery without a shadow lamp.
"Many early detection and removal of diseases are related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
For example, in early cancer screening, if doctors cannot identify all tumor tissues in time, then cancer cells will continue to spread, Chen said.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lanterns that enhance the difference between different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can at any time adjust the size, lightness, spectroscopy, homogeneity of colours, and the shadow rate, depending on the need for the operation and personal habits.
This smart surgery lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Zhejiang University Medical School-affiliated Zhejiang Hospital and the Zhejiang University Medical School-affiliated Children ' s Hospital, and has received better feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: water saving is cool
Common people wash their hands with water, rub some soap at the most, squeeze some handwashing fluid, and students like Li Qingzhang have invented a “air washer”.
As long as we stand on the device's washstand, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a gas cylinder.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and is combined with water.
"So we can clean our hands!"
Colorful reactions and bacterial residue experiments proved that the effect of handwashing through this method is the same as ordinary handwashing methods.
This device relies only on our own gravity as the driver, can guarantee the level of cleaning and save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, the invention stood out among many of the world's top universities, winning its only gold medal.

All right, I'm in trouble
A certificate that I think is meaningful - an emergency certificate
This is one of the skills I think is important in addition to my driver's license!
To spread the word: emergency measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of a sudden event, i.e. before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is actually a period of time before the ambulance arrives after the accident, which is the most critical.
This time is when you need first-aid.
If I really had a heart attack, brain bleeding, breathing out of control, then the window of our life would only be four minutes, gold four minutes!
So the people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls, we can save him through professional knowledge, rather than standing there stupidly and unable to do anything, the feeling of helplessness is so terrifying.
"In China, our official data shows that three million people die unexpectedly every year, the most dangerous being cardiac arrest."
In the United States, an average of 15% of people are rescued.
In Las Vegas, 78% of casinos could be saved, while Shanghai, Beijing, and Shanghai are less than 1%.
This is what the founder of the first reaction, Lu Lu, said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, you do not have any effect in choking people.
It is necessary to breathe artificially and press the chest pressure that will make it possible for people to be rescued.
I find that very few of us now have that awareness to learn first aid, but when things happen, it is too late, so I call on everyone to learn that skill so that we can respond in a timely manner in the face of a sudden state of emergency.
Maybe they can save a person's life!
The emergency card can be registered at your local Red Cross Training Centre. I'm registered at the Red Cross Training Centre in Zhuhai. Students also have discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of what you're about to accomplish by the age of 25, and adding a first aid card to the target list was a few months ago, but it was done.
I'm going to look at other certificates I want to look at, and I'm going to look at a diving certificate, and before I see a diving emergency certificate in Little Red Book, it looks like there's still an emergency certificate to go to, so it's really useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER#
Of which 13 bucks of shrimp dumplings is just one!
I haven't tried it.
How does #NAME# not understand?
One for $13?
Yesterday's #PRS_ORG# leaked meals, this time a shrimp dumpling for me!
Because it's clear that I've seen it work when I've entered the code before.
First of all, I personally believe that the " Four Seas " is a piece of crap in all its aspects, in all its senses.
But if you're talking about whether or not the film has a bright spot or not, it's not at least a good musical choice.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one that lets you sleep well in the cinema, one that lets you get angry afterwards, and four oceans is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience, and it can burn your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience to this point, Han chill is truly gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it's as if it's made in a novel in a hysteria. It's infamous. It's like a coat on a pony.
Even after you look at it, you'll doubt if there are any metaphors implicit in the director here, but when you think about it carefully and find it really is a shit.
Let me start with a few facts that I find difficult to understand.
The man's residence should be a small island in the south, and his grandma depended on him.
Her grandmother had a desire to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for a grandma in her neighborhood to drive a minivan to send her north-east to see the snow.
The elderly people are sitting in a van watching the snow from the south to the northeast?
He and his father were very reassuring about it.
And then the old man was out of context.
How did the wife and brother get a business license after opening a hotel on an abandoned ferry?
On the island flying car party small mixed why can gently loosen the mountain road to seal the road?
Then in the middle of the road the truck that sent the reinforcement stopped at the side of the road, and the truck driver could not find it all the way around.
This sense of sensibility is too obvious.
Why would a punk biker with a bad letter and a suspicion of breaking the law become an auxiliary cop?
Why don't you call the police in the face of high interest loans, the police in the movie also asked specially whether there are difficulties?
A grown-up knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door with a card in the hotel, then forcibly arranges to find no owner of the hotel, sitting outside the room and sleeping.
Such inexplicable circumstances are rife throughout the film, and I feel pain when I remember them because they are so far out of line.
Besides the circumstances, what is worse is the subject of the film, or the fact that the film has no subject at all, which is an abhorrent suture.
You start the movie thinking he wants to make a comedy movie, and 20 minutes later you guess it might be an inspiration, and half the time you think it might be a drama about the hardships of a small town's youth, and then you don't know what you're looking at, and then you have a deep doubt about why you should go to the movies to see the shit.
For most people, in fact, are very familiar with the scheduling of various films, for example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then motivation + comedy and tell the audience how a gifted caterpillar is going to succeed step by step.
If you want to make a love film, you're talking about the grief-strife between a young man and a maid sister from a small town who loves to ride a motorcycle.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least you can't have something that's against the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle in Yin's acting role was just burned and then singing), he could not go to open some unstoppable hole even Kennedy saw.
As for the fact that the actress is not a weak-minded person who can act in some ways like a five-year-old child, I don't know if that's the reason for acting or the director's demands.
One more thing I don't understand. Why is HAN so keen to add car crashes to his own movie as a racer?
Is this the kind of film that's set up for the Spring Festival to plug the audience?

Inspection of well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well-walled brick module equipment introduction:
Zhengzhou Yi Xin is a domestic concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, inspection well block machinery, well wall wall module machinery professional manufacturer, from semi-automatic to fully automatic production line.
Through years of practice and development, we now have a hard quality, mainly producing hydraulic, mobile, fully automated inspection well series equipment and supporting devices.
Inspection of well concrete module production processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site:
Inspection of well concrete module production and processing equipment The characteristics and advantages of Zhengzhou wellwall brick module equipment:
The equipment of the well block brick machine is widely applied to new construction materials such as coal, heat, water, electricity and gas for municipal underground structures.
For example: drainage, various types of inspection wells at water storage facilities, rainwater vents, grooves, septic tanks and small structures, bridge-wing walls, etc.
The advantage of constructing a concrete module to inspect wells is that the top and bottom of the module are all rounded with concave grooves, and the combination of the shafts forms a chain lock.
The scission resistance of the well wall body is far superior to the form of flat friction carving.
The module is a medium- and air structure, the combination of building rear longitudinal boreholes with each other, cross-pronged hole holes, after filling the core, forming the current watering concrete mesh structure, which plays secondary reinforcement and waterproofing role.
The modules are equipped with intersection grooves both horizontally and vertically, and the horizontal and vertical intersection increases the overall strength of the structure accordingly.
In addition, the inspection and drainage wells constructed using concrete inspection well modules are not likely to collapse, sink, leakage, etc., and the mechanical performance of the wall wall modules is stable, operation is simple, and the molding size is standard.
Concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment intelligent control equipped with data input and output device one-button touch LCD display monitor the whole process of mechanical operation, realize the ideal human machine dialogue, automatic analysis ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall module uses single-cylinder hydraulics, transports, double-cylinder hydraulics and transports.
Independent hydraulic integration stations, which avoid the effects of the host vibration on the hydraulic system, thus guaranteeing the reliability of the hydraulic system's operation.
Concrete inspection of the well module, brick machine and equipment cloth box moving into mold box lifting up, storage box door closed, automatic conveyor board, all independently completed by hydraulic system, thus reducing mechanical wear and maintenance.
Concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, sealing components and hydraulic components, guarantees the equipment's comprehensive performance stable and reliable.
The mechanical stimulating platform of the well wall housing module adopts the whole plate steel, the surface line cutting joint mold unwelded point, so that the filler box is free to swing orientation, fully reduce mechanical wear.
The mould load is reduced, the filling material is encrypted and the vibration amplitude is encrypted simultaneously. The vibration effect is ensured by integrated, full synchronization, stand vibration and model vibration.
The mechanical stimulation of the well walls module, computer auto-control amplitudes, adjusts the amplitude to the price ratio of the raw material without wear and tear, thereby extending the useful life and reducing costs.
Double function of mechanical automatic control and manual control of the wall wall module.

Chongqing Middle School Pilot Modern Apprenticeship Entry is Enterprise Associates - Xinhua Network
Yesterday, the journalist learned from the city's education commission that from this year, the city will be teaching modern apprenticeship in 60 secondary schools as a pilot model, students who receive the pilot training will be apprentices and will be recruited as unit employees by the pilot enterprises after admission.
The Municipal Council requires that the procedures for admission to secondary schools and for employment in enterprises be regulated, that the dual status of students and associate employees of apprenticeships be clarified and that, in accordance with the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises enter into tripartite agreements for apprentices who have not reached the age of 18 years and who have reached the age of 16, and that they be accompanied by apprentices and guardians.
Pilot schools are encouraged to use the modern apprenticeship form to train and retrain employees in enterprises in collaboration with cooperative enterprises.
The pilot schools are to reform the talent training model.
School enterprises jointly design talent training programs, together develop professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise teachers standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation programmes.
The pilot is a pilot cycle for the training of the school system. Students' internship time in the enterprise is determined according to the professional training programme. The internship period is generally six months.
In the practice of enterprises, an enterprise class management model should be implemented, whereby, depending on the characteristics of the different professions, a teacher may bring two to five apprentices to form study groups to ensure that students are skilled in the skills required for each rotating training post.
According to the arrangements, from 2016 to August 2019, three batches of 60 city-level mid-level modern apprenticeship pilots were determined, with each pilot numbering around 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
In accordance with the principle of first pilot implementation and gradual progress from point to point, we are exploring the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint admission, joint training and integration of educators in schools and enterprises, to effectively improve the skills of students in positions, and to improve student-to-student employment rate and quality of employment.

South African Doctor: Omicron has a strong transmitter, but it's mostly mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the disease caused by the new crown virus, the Omikjon strain, is lighter than the Delta strain, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of Omicron mutagenics in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in Haudun Province in South Africa reported that the symptoms of the new coronary patients they are currently treating are mild, such as physical pain and influenza-like symptoms such as cough.
The organisation's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said he saw dozens of patients every day, but there were no patients needed to be hospitalized.
“They are able to control disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of being isolated,” said Pierre.
He says this includes the elderly and those with health problems, who would have been more likely to become seriously infected with the coronary virus.
He said he treated new crown patients in the last wave of the Delta outbreak "with difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days.”
In the two weeks after the first reports of the Omicron variant strain were made in South Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it would take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provided some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of new crown patients hospitalized in recent weeks are serious diseases, half of the previous outbreak's severity; average hospitalization time has been shortened from eight days to 2.8 days; just 3% of newly crown patients have died in recent years, compared with 20% of early outbreak cases in South Africa.
William Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, cited data from the National Institute for Infectious Diseases and other reports: "Currently, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease."
He added: "It's still early and we need to get late-stage data.
Normally, hospitalization and death took place late, and we had only two weeks to get into this wave of outbreaks."
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effects of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta remains the world's leading new coronavirus strain, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the new cases found in Hautden province in the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests showed that OMKRON variants accounted for more than 90%.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been delivered!

Education Review: What is it to save abducted children?
If the analogy of a famous public welfare advertising "without sale and without killing", then, in a good environment without the need for "abduction", group prevention and all-round anti-trafficking, so that trafficking is not profitable, risky, costly, such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has launched an emergency platform for publishing information on the abduction and development of missing children.
It is an Internet information platform for the establishment of a channel of authority to publish missing children information and to find children who have been abducted in a timely manner.
Listening to the app called "团圆," I felt warm.
New technology tools are not only called “artistic”, full of passions, but are also well used, practical and effective.
The primary objective of the law enforcement campaign is to recover the abducted child and to protect his or her physical integrity and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishments, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
Priority should be given to the safety of victims before cases of trafficking are broached.
The matter can be delayed and discussed with caution, for the purposes of urgent "rescue," such as whether or not the sale of children should be subject to the death penalty, subjects of widespread controversy and controversy; but the matter of rescuing abducted children should not be considered.
Based on the detection experience of such cases, traffickers are accustomed to staying away from the scene as soon as possible after receiving the money.
The delay of one minute in the search for a child may further distance the child from the parents and add one point to the difficulty of detecting the case.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic move to put in place a platform such as “unity” that will directly help to detect cases and find effective ways to retrieve children.
After all, the curve is a big task that requires the entire legal system to work properly.
Combating crime, safeguarding children's and parental rights, from the improvement of legislation to guarantees of justice, as well as strict law enforcement, does not need to carry out "child care and weakness" care.
Moreover, prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can also be done better.
For example, a common case is that a family of three is resting at a train station, and the parents are asleep and wake up to find their children missing.
A two-year-old cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, there should be at least a considerable sense of protection.
Both parents take turns to rest, or place their children under secure protection, as a minimum means of preventing the abduction of children.
On the other hand, from the police's point of view of combating the crime of kidnapping, the purchase of kidnapped children should also be concerned and punished.
Individual wrongful acts are often only part of a long chain.
According to the penal code of our country, the statutory penalty for child trafficking is five years; the plot is particularly serious, punishable by death and confiscation of property.
The high penalty point and maximum punishment, under the large trend of "immoderate", the crime of child trafficking is clearly punishable by heavier crimes.
However, there are still many cases of trafficking every year.
It is clear that some people are behind in their ideas about parenting and have a weak legal sense.
The legal education of this part of the population should be pursued in parallel.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking cannot rely on strict official law enforcement alone.
If the market for smuggling of hostages is widespread, if the traffickers are anxious, if they are constantly innovating the means of smuggling, if they are fighting law enforcement, then the smuggling operation will fall into the mud of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking down the concept of backwardness and popularizing legal common sense also help to root out trafficking and buying children's crimes.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two major categories, five levels, of first-fried olive oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and of olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil).
The first-pressed olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the grease obtained directly from fresh olive fruit by means of mechanical cold-pressing, filtering and other processes to remove the foreign matter.
The acidity varies according to the acidity and can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin: is the highest quality and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a mild and pleasant plant fragrance, acidity not exceeding 1%.
Quality fresh olive oil (Fine Virgin): The acidity is slightly higher, but not more than 2%, the taste is pure and aromatic.
Ordinary olive oil (Ordinary Virgin): The taste and taste are good, and the acidity does not exceed 3.3 per cent.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after refining of primary olive oil with a acidity of more than 3.3% or becomes "secondary oil".
Olive oil refining can be divided into two levels:
Ordinary olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain percentage of primary olive oil to reconcile the taste and color, its acidity is below 1.5%, it is transparently pale yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: Olive oil extracted from the oil slag and refined by solution.
If you have looked at the ranking, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olives are like wine grapes, and olives from different regions and varieties of olives produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow oil olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable climatic conditions for olive oil growth, such as soil and temperature, sunlight, air moisture and precipitation.
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be cultivated sporadically in suitable areas.
Main areas of production (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc. The climate is similar to that of Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc. in the far south latitudes.
The month of harvesting oil and olives:
From 3 to June each year, the olive oil tree blooms and bears fruit, and from 7 to October the fruit begins to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the harvest season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely, oleic and oleic acids, and amethylamine acids, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most nutritious oil of all the fats found to date.
The Democratic Summit ends and Biden says the fire of freedom never extinguishes
The online summit for democracy, convened by U.S. President Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries around the world as well as civil society and private sector leaders, was inaugurated on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world and that authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Representatives of the Taiwanese government, State Councillor Dong-won and Hong Kong's democratic rights activist Rohing-shou, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit the following day.
"We know how arduous the work before us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge because I have said before, as this summit has shown, that the democratic world is everywhere.
Despotic regimes can never put an end to the small fires of freedom, which burn in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world.”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires a common effort by the whole of society.
“As leaders of governments, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the fence of democracy, to push for reforms, to achieve transparent accountable governance, to resist the power of deterrence and shock from dictatorships, and to those who seek power nakedly before the public interest,” he said.
The themes of the second day of the “Democracy Summit” were, respectively, the defence of human rights, the consolidation of democracy and the right to confront it, and the fight against digital powerism and the affirmation of democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks on the same day, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Guterres, also stated that the cause of democracy faced global challenges, particularly those posed by emerging digital technologies.
"It's time to reassert common values and positions as well as democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing social covenants, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires the firm condemnation of all forms of populism, indigenousism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.”
The Hong Kong Democratic Human Rights Activist, Mr. Luang-seong, addressed the Summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding participants of the continuing concern of the human rights situation of Chinese minorities such as Hong Kong and Uighur and Tibetans.
For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable, he said.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must co-operate.
We must use all the resources we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our first priority.”
Rochan Chow also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the CCP.
He said, “Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy Secretary-General Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and some of you are not aware of the threat to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change."
In a roundtable discussion on “fighting digital dictatorship and affirming democratic values,” Taiwan’s Executive Board member, Mr Tang Feng, released a State Declaration via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and power.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the new crown epidemic through transparency of information and building mutual trust.
He said: “In the midst of the emergence of democracy in Taiwan, we have remained firmly at the forefront of the global confrontation against authoritarianism and have played a leading role in the promotion of global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the outbreak, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
In Taiwan, however, we do not have to seal the city to control the epidemic, and we do not have to fight against false information.”
In parallel with the second day of the Democracy Summit, the United States Department of the Treasury announced the imposition of legal sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China, Korea and others, who were found to have committed serious human rights violations, as well as the imposition of investment restrictions on a Chinese company found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello. The saliva chicken from the restaurant is raw.
I want to try tennis, but afraid that I can't stick to it, so I want to find a similar price practitioner first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the level of friendship, if it can not be discerned, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than cheaper pics, such "introduction" is actually industrial garbage.
Their strength is very low, the ball hits on the pad, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't overcome, the masters are hard to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is - tennis is so difficult, knowing that you will not learn, but also know that you do not spare to buy expensive, make a cheap goods confusing you, you play twice, won't be playing again, so this clip is cheap, you don't hurt.
When you can really tell what's good and what's bad, it means you're making progress, and then I'll come back and buy something expensive, and I'll make two moneys.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a secondhand slightly better slap, choose Prince or Dumbledore, these two brands are not famous enough, so good slaps can not sell the price, new 500, 600 is very good, secondhand 200 pieces, with thousands of dollars enjoyable?
It was very friendly to the novice, but after the novice stage chickens, but most people, especially girls, can not pass the novice stage.
The order has been delayed several times.
Please, can you help me follow up?

Thank you.
I mean, I actually have credit already?

In fact, there is a lot of talk about the dressing and pairing of physically fat girls.
The dresses worn by a fat girl cannot be too short or too long, the length is almost on their knees, just to cover where thighs are thick.
The short skirt will expose the fat on the legs.
Too long will make you feel short and fat.
If you wear the top and bottom three sections, it looks like you naturally grow higher, that is, the upper body, skirts and long stockings with different colors, which will appear to produce a feeling of lengthening.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the hallmark of fat girls (which the authors deeply appreciate), and dark colors are also a good way to mask your body fat, and elegant black shorts are also the preferred choice for fat girls.
Put on deep colored clothes, especially black short skirts, will make you feel thinner.
If your legs are fat, don't wear socks and shoes that are too noticeable.
The more popular it becomes, the better, and the color doesn't get too bright.
To prevent people from paying attention to your legs and feet, you get feelings of obesity.
For a slightly fat girl, you have to tell her the trick of dressing up.
Fat girls should not wear tight shorts, and also not too short or stuck in the collar, which will make people look uncomfortable, if the legs are thick, wear black long silk or net-shaped (the kind of shorts), choose a material soft printing horn, coupled with a coat with a collar, can cover up fat girls' shortcomings.
Of course, the little fat girl's pretty good on short skirts, too.
Fat girls wear short skirts and should choose a coat that matches the color of the short skirt, so that your fat body will have a higher effect.
Short skirts with high heels, can make your legs look longer, this is the summer's best in combination Oh!
If you are fat, but the legs are thin MM, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous short dress.
Not only can you cover your throat, but also show your strengths.
A short skirt would be thinner and more suitable for a fat girl, and the top would have to choose a tighter one, with a leaner sense of hierarchy.
Simple single white T-shirt with short skirt, fat MM can also try.
Little fat girls can wear fashion too.
As long as you can master the law of dressing and matching, small fat girls will also be a prominent focus.
After a change in the dressing and matching, there is also much movement in life, to fight for an early day out of the label of tiny fat girls.

The girl is raising money for her sister when the arrow targets: "It's good to think about skin and flesh wounds" - Xinhua Network
A girl at Wulin Square in Hangzhou stood in front of a large board with the words “human target, ten dollar arrows”.
Last morning, a photo of a Hangzhou girl who used to be a target for her sister's fundraiser blew up her circle of friends.
Photos show that a girl standing in front of a taller plank with the words “human target, ten dollars a arrow”, indicating that the passers-by could shoot with a bow and arrow when paying for it.
This act sparked a heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the head of propaganda in the lower city division of the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Newjing newspaper journalists that the police had confirmed that the girl had made such an overstretched move on behalf of her sister, but that such action was not worth promoting and that the girl had left the local police station yesterday after being warned.
Girls on the streets arrowing for a donation
In the picture, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board, on the board written in black ink with "human and flesh target, ten yuan 1 arrow" word, she is before another wooden board wrote its bank account and WeChat, Alipay Account, etc.
The image was controversial after it was posted online.
A number of netizens believed that this act was a "begging behavior of the ball of the eye," and also many netizens expressed sympathy for this.
“We found out about 10 a.m. on the 23rd when we were patrolling by the square, and there were already a lot of people around.”
In an interview with local media, the civilian police station near the scene said that there were two girls in the stall, all about 20 years old, dressed as young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who works as a “human target” has been crying, begging for the roadman to play this game, while the other girl has been drinking, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia and is in urgent need of surgery, so please help.
“We contacted local police in Guizhou to learn that the girl was collecting donations for the treatment of her sister's leukemia.”
Last night, the chief of propaganda in the lower city division of the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau told the Newjing newspaper reporter that the girl was named Jikali and was collecting donations for her sister Jigyan.
However, the treatment still required over 300,000 dollars, and the act was not carried out until the time when there was no good way to raise funds.
He stated that, throughout the process, two girls had been targeted, one had been shot, but not involved, and that no arrows had been found, except that they had been watched and photographed and posted on Twitter.
The police later identified the use of the bow as not covered by the regulation.
The official said that Liu did not advocate for this kind of crowdfunding.
After being warned by police officers, she left the police station.

What's the hottest thing in 2021?
It's definitely the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic children can win prizes?
The article on the Olympic project where the project manager can hit the gold medal is hot, which mentions that in many projects, project managers can definitely be on the front lines, no one can: moving, traveling, sleeping at night is the project manager's daily routine, firefighting, backstabbing, apology and not speaking.
A seemingly jokingly amusing article, but also reveals the daily bitterness of project managers, behind the reflection of the current project management work.
And the people involved in project management, also gradually choose to take some actions to get rid of the work difficulties.
From the annual increase in the number of PMPs (International Certified Project Management Professional Qualifications) enrolled, an increasing number of project management practitioners improve their own project management skills by learning.
According to the 20-Year Development Report on China Project Management (1999-2019): As of September 2019, the total number of PMP(r) applications across the country was nearly 600,000, with about 420,000 certified by PMP(r), and about 300,000 effective licensees, accounting for 31.2% of global PMP(r) approvals.
The number of PMP holders in recent 10 years has increased year after year, indicating that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer desirable to do things by simply replicating past "old experience", and the rapidly changing working environment allows us to know a way to learn, stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can the examination of PMP ensure the smooth running of project management without obstruction?
Many project management beginners say that by studying relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, it is possible to systematically grasp the ten areas of project management and the five process groups related knowledge points, but when really doing project management work still a mist.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following questions: Project management is not recognized, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; lack of systemic project management process system support, can not land in work, project unpredictability, poor control sensitivity, project dragging again and again; members' division of labor is unclear, "old oil bar" in the team does not know how to deal with cross-sectoral assistance communication smoothly, projects difficult to advance.
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management in more than 10 fields has helped many outstanding enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other research and development key talents, and received the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Model Base" such as Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting with the "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp" online course.
The R&D Project Manager Training Course is an online fragmented learning method that combines the actual combat cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and take the advanced path of their own project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and fewer inputs to facilitate the development process of project managers and bring about efficient operational outcomes for enterprises.
To be honest, one can first look at how the course is evaluated by other participants: the course is not only conducted by a team of Chinese Tianhuaxia experts (formerly the R & D management team), but also by an in-depth professional presentation of the content of the course in the context of advanced international project management methodology and the real business landscape of many well-known companies.
It provides scientifically practical management tools and methods, rich templates and forms to help students translate their learning content after class to specific work.

Jinxin "Double 12" on the eve of promoting rational consumption to consumers - Economic observation network - Professional financial and news website
The total amount of transactions in the national network of payments for the 11th annual Carnival of this year reached 1.77 trillion yuan, which is a relatively high level of innovation.
The abundance of red bags, the live broadcast of eye-catching goods, once again brought great benefits to consumers, and this consumption boom is one that has made national consumption stronger, while also allowing us to reflect on the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer groups of today.
On the eve of the "Double Twelve", JFE Consumer Financial Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as JFE) issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding consumers, especially young people, to develop a good consumer consciousness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the PPP Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released this year, the national Consumer Financial Literacy Index is 66.81, up 2.04 from 2019.
On the whole, our inhabitants perform relatively well at the level of financial consumption, but there are significant differences in the different aspects of financial behaviour and skills, and there is a need to further upgrade basic financial knowledge.
The level of financial literacy for older and young people is relatively low, "one old one or less" will continue to be the focus of continued attention in financial education; Nielsen's China Youth Debt Report and CCTV Finance's Chinese Youth Consumption Report 2019-2020 show that younger generations have huge consumer potential, credit consumption has become an important way of upgrading consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, almost half of them do not accumulate debt, youth generation although the overall presentation of rational consumption trend, although it is very different from the external label "excessive squandering", but some young people do exist excessive consumption, anti-wind consumption behavior, and therefore caused too much financial pressure and debt risk, even leading to a gradual increase in social problems, financial enterprises should courageously take on social responsibility, carry out positive guidance.

Viet Nam People ' s Press Network - The Gulf Cooperation Council to address common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this was the first visit to Qatar by Crown Prince Mohammed since the imposition of the embargo on Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies in 2017, which led to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In the midst of the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties to Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab States have blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to promote solidarity and stability in the region.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt, through their appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar, are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar.
The Gulf Arab States resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar, based on the demands that must be united for the interests of each country and regional stability, aimed at tackling common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
The 725 km of access link between the two countries will facilitate the movement of citizens of both countries and the integration of the supply chain.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and 13 memorandums of understanding for cooperation worth $30 billion have been signed by enterprises in both countries.
The visit by the Saudi crown prince to the Gulf states coincides with the talks between Iran and the world's major powers on the salvation of the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in Iran, which the Gulf Arab states condemn for failing to resolve the Iran missile problem.
The Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a competitor and have seen Iran's nuclear program as a threat to regional security.
The Gulf states consider that failure to address Iran's missile problem and to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
In the context of the failure of the major Powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf States in their nuclear negotiations with Iran, Saudi Arabia has engaged in direct negotiations with Iran.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that has slowed the Gulf Cooperation Council's national economic growth.
The forthcoming GCC summit would be the first to be held in the GCC countries since the dispute between some member States and Qatar had ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully to meet common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

It is claimed that the new mountain super-run exhaust sound is the largest!
The car that our team brought to us this time is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship super-run, Murcielago's replacement model - Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the coin is nearly two million dollars, a year's road tax coins are more than 10 thousand, four-wheel drive, why call the LP700?
Because with 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
I don't know. The 0-100 km/h acceleration takes 2.9 seconds, which is probably when the editor's Myvi arrives at 30 km/h, 100 km/h.
The low body, the rugged shear doors, the huge gas vents that surround the car, and the glass next to an endless list of 6.5 v12 engines perfectly illustrate Lamborghini's style.
For the description of the car doesn't need to say too much, if you Google yourself, just organize some of the explanations that Google doesn't necessarily give!
Too much attention. Everyone's watching wherever they go. It's uncomfortable!
1km oil money in about RM1 (car owners don't care at all)
The position to get up and down the car should be practiced, otherwise it will be a bit embarrassing (because you can't climb out of the cabin and then stuck halfway)
The engine is too loud and you'll be deaf when you get out of the car.(But it's still cool)
The car is so big that it stops in a normal parking lot and is so narrow that it is afraid to be knocked on the door by a neighboring car!
A little lonely because there are no opponents on the road (the official said, it's not about the driver, ha ha)
Don't get me wrong, this video of the super race is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot video for your car, welcome contact us!
More about cars you don't know about, right here in The Car Guide/ People's Automotive.
It's worth 10 million-dollar car crashes!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 Believe all the car friends know that Chiron is one of the world's most expensive supercars, and the price of Porsche 911 is also a million class!
That day, foreign countries in just a few minutes hit the million sports car 911 and millions of super-running Chiron!
Look at the results. It makes sense!
Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of schooling philosophy and value pursuits which accumulated long-term in the course of development of a university, is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to now, the university spirit has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the world's first modern-day university, the university has shouldered a unique mission unlike other social organizations, for our universities, arose in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit is more deeply influenced by traditional culture and era change, advocated "Mindezzi, Xizhiqing" value concept and patriotism of "the rising power".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly evident, global educational competition, scientific and technological competition, talent competition is intensifying, higher education career as an important "supply side", its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the General Program for Integrating the Advancement of World-class Universities and First-Class Disciplines, while demonstrating our confidence and determination from higher education to higher education powerhouses, also presents a higher update requirements for university development.
How can we work to become world leaders in a shorter time, and accelerate the creation of several world-class universities and a group of world-class disciplines on the basis of a still-definite gap, to achieve tunnel supercar excellence?
In addition to a firm goal confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, universities should also fully take advantage of three advantages: first, after-generation advantages, through the continuous introduction of outstanding academic talent abroad, learning to draw on the advanced experience of world-class universities, achieve significant improvement in academic level and quality of study; second, cultural advantages, inheriting the intellectual connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to consolidate strength, shaping brand and improving image; third, institutional advantages, play the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthen target drivers, bring together consensus efforts, optimize resource allocation, provide sustainable and solid guarantees for schools to accelerate their progress beyond the world's advanced level.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that the construction of world-class universities can not be a thousand school side, and each school must demonstrate its individuality and characteristics while playing their advantages.
The characteristics of running schools must have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their own unique goals, schooling traditions and resources talents.
With regard to Zhejiang University, we have focused on three aspects of our schooling: firstly, highlighting the characteristics of innovative entrepreneurial talent training, building an integrated environment for the integration of faculty and enterprises, and fostering an ecosystem of entrepreneurial education; secondly, highlighting the characteristics of cross-disciplinary clustering, promoting the optimum adjustment of the discipline system, creating a cross-disciplinary institutional environment, actively nurturing cross-emerging disciplines and symbolic cross-products; and, thirdly, highlighting the characteristics of our schooling system and social services, conducting deep international exchange and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of the cooperation system of the Pan-Zhejiang University of Agricultural Science and Technology.
In this process, it is especially important to always maintain the university spirit and let the university spirit and the spirit of the times resonate with frequency.
For Zhejiang University, the innovation of the Yangtze school, the learning of yoga, logic, ethics, reason, and the common values of the Yangtze River, the Enlightenment, the open minded, and the people of the state of Yangtze together constitute the latest expression of the Yangtze spirit.
It is an important guarantee that the school adheres to the correct direction of schooling, constantly accumulates a high level of culture and condensate spiritual forces, rich in content, far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Hina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodied in the heart of "the world's wisdom for me," embodied in the quality philosophy of drawing up the world's leading schools to educate people; "Enlightenment and Goodness" emphasizes the spirit of truth-to-goodness, which means that universities, while pursuing the truth, should take more of the brimstone of the cultivation and personality of virtue; "Experienced People" emphasizes the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes both the search for new knowledge, the innovation of scientific research, as well as the development of reform and transformation; "Tree My Country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotic devotion, saying that universities should always be honored with the fate of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and values is the soul of Zhejiang University, which has been in operation for 120 years.
"He who hears the voice is silent, and those who see it are untouched."
China's universities should further build on the whole of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the chronological position and historical mission of higher education in order to accelerate the construction into a world-class university.
At the same time, adhering to human care and independent freedom, the spirit of the university is intertwined with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, thus providing the unwavering impetus for the achievement of national prosperity and national revitalization and the realization of the common ideals of humanity.

A new concept emerged in the encryption community at the time of the NFT fire.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity Games had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with some residents losing their jobs due to the pandemic starting to earn steady incomes from the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-based game based on blockchain technology that brings together many games including NFT, which is currently the highest trading volume of NFT projects with more than $3 billion to date.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity earned over $8.2 million a day, directly to the King's Glory.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily users had exceeded one million.
The fever of Axie Infinity sends a new "paltoearn" model to more people. By helping with block chains and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role and can be involved in the management of game ecology in addition to having fun and economic benefits from the game.
This subjectivity is not granted by gamemakers, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
When I saw the news about the price of friends' shares, I was most touched by the choice of companies on the track, which is the choice of industries that have a growth margin, first of all, to choose a large industry with a market size of at least 100 billion; second, to choose a future growth-friendly industry, considering the best growth status of the industry in the next 3-5 years; and finally, to choose an industry with policy support.
How wide the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the development stage in the industry, whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Refueling for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is "do the things right," that is, to do what's right.
And the strategy is “do the right thing”, which is to do the right thing.
The strategy is to find direction, the tactics are to be found on the ground, and there is space for strategic thinking on the basis of most tactical thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether the current field is continuously deepening or horizontal extension (strategic thinking); for example, improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve core and high-value customer retention rate (strategic thinking); above raising activity engagement (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the right activities goals, such as increasing target customer participation, activating high-value silencers, and accurately updating; on upgrading DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Twelve years after its birth, Bitcoin reached several milestones in 2021.
On 7 September, the small Central American State, El Salvador, designated Bitcoin as the legal currency, the first time that Bitcoin had become a national or regional legal currency.
On October 12, the SEC approved ProShares' launch of Bitcoin ETFs for the first time in eight years and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the re-expansion of the cryptocurrency investment gap, the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to enter the U.S. capital market.
From the point of view of blockchain technology development, bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On 14 November 2021, Bitcoin conducted a soft fork upgrade called “Taproot”, which increased the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in the transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

American-Asian groups complain of discrimination in admissions to three Ivy schools such as Yale - Xinhua
On May 23, Xinhua News Agency Washington (journalist Xu Ceng Mei) over 130 Asian groups in the United States filed complaints with the United States Department of Education and the Department of Justice against three Ivy League schools – Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College – that discriminated against Asian applicants in their admissions.
The Asian Education League, which has raised the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
At the launch, the chairman of the group, Zhao Woo-won, said that while the number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to American schools had multiplied over the past 10 years, the proportion of Asians in the three United States schools remained largely at the same level.
Many studies show that these universities are "long-term persistent and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants" in the so-called "integrated considerations" admission process.
Research by scholars such as Sands in 2014 showed that Asians had the lowest enrollment rate among all ethnic groups in the three universities, according to Zhao U-kai.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all the colleges of the Commonwealth, Brown and Dartmouth College have the lowest enrollment rates for Asian students, and Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they expect the U.S. Department of Education and Justice to conduct an investigation after filing a complaint, and take steps to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions.
They also hope that the complained colleges will be able to take this issue proactively and change their admission policy toward Asians.
At present, the three colleges complained of have not yet responded.
The Asian-American Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it complained about admission discrimination at Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education was not admissible on procedural grounds.
In addition to U.S. Chinese groups, the complaint involved American Indo-Korean, Japanese and Pakistani education groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the housing intermediary that a factory located in Yuyao Bing Town, Zhejiang, after several visits to the premises, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant.
In December of the same year, Mr. Luk, after consulting with the family of the owner of the house on the details of the purchase of the plant, made a deposit of $200,000 through a bank transfer on the same day.
Lin was signed as a recipient in the "Factory Buying and Purchasing Consignment Ordinance", which states that "if the buyer does not want to buy this plant, this fixed money is returned to the seller, if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, both parties agreed to enter into a contract of sale within one week."
However, the subsequent lack of agreement between the parties on key contractual terms, such as the scope of the sale of the plant and the manner of payment, resulted in delays in the conclusion of contracts for the purchase and sale of the house.
Considering the failure of the parties to reach consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned 200,000 yuan in gold money to Mr. Lu.
The house was not easy to see, the money was given and the house was ready, and the contract was almost signed at the door, but the seller did not sell, which angered Mr. Liu.
For this reason, Mr. Lu brought a case against Mr. Lin to the People's Court of Yu Yao City.
The court's review concluded that the parties ultimately failed to conclude a formal contract and that the blame cannot be placed solely on the defendant, and should be reasonably assumed that the consultation was not completed, so the case should not be subject to a fixed penalty, and the defendant should not be held liable for defaulting on the double refund of fixed money.
After the first instance judgement, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the sentence.
[Lawyer Reminds] The obligation to take due diligence into account in the course of the transaction is required.
At the time of the conclusion of the contract, the buyer was required to exercise the necessary due diligence, such as verifying information on the owner of the house, whether the house was occupied and specifying in the contract the specific time and place of delivery in order to prevent disputes between the parties in the performance of the contract.
After the end of the Democratic Summit on Friday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the United States was hosting the "Leader Democracy Summit" to "define ideological lines, tooling democracy, arming it, and using false democracy to foment anti-democracy, fomenting splinter resistance, and shifting domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes, “For a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on people, implemented ‘democratic reforms,’ abused unilateral sanctions, and launched a ‘color revolution,’ with disastrous consequences.
"Democracy" has long become a weapon of mass destruction that the United States interferes with in other countries.
The summit was an act of Biden to honour its campaign commitments.
The two-day meeting, which was held via video, was attended by leaders from 111 countries around the world, including Taiwanese leaders, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic emergence, arguing that the United States was not in a position to host such a summit.
At the international level and within the United States, there are also voices of doubt, such as criticism of the participation of leaders of authoritarian tendencies, such as those of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and doubts have been expressed that the true intention of the Biden Government was not to organize the summit for the sake of democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The new German Chancellor Scholtz also participated in the Video Democracy Summit.
According to the statement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday, " Today ' s US-style democracy is very sick, and the problems of money politics, identity politics, political party rivalries, political polarization, social disintegration, ethnic strife, the division of rich and poor are getting worse. "
“As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the fence of democracy, to push for reforms, to achieve transparent accountability, to resist the power of deterrence and shock from dictatorships, and to those who seek power nakedly before the public interest,” US President Barack Obama said in a statement.
He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted, and that “we must keep updating it in every generation, which in my view is the decisive challenge of our time.”
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "in the face of persistent and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend."
The U.S. side is committed to a one-year action following this summit, which includes an initiative worth $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the entity democracy summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
"Let us all countries implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year," he said.
Okay, I'm just afraid he got the wrong address.

Education Thinking: How the university exams make "learning" "school crap" every place - Xinhua Net
Three students at Lanzhou Transportation University wrote to the school leadership reflecting their confusion about the university exam and proposed to increase the difficulty of the exam and change the test subject so that the exam really reflects the demands of the actual level of students.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a hot topic.
In the university campus, students come from five lakes and four seas, with different levels of competence, plus different levels of learning, and different conditions of learning.
For groups with such a multiplicity of characteristics to evaluate, there are different feelings, inevitably.
Of course, if the test topics are single, with a high repetition rate and the subject is too simple, they will inevitably give rise to a different kind of feeling.
Students who don't do well may be able to do well by concentrating before exams, and if you think of other ways, it is possible to achieve a half-work-to-work effect.
In this way, there is a school-learning standard that can be applied or passed, even obtained high marks; the school-learning standard never leaves the class, the assignments, the notes look good, the exams are not high enough.
It seems that the students of Lanzhou University reflect the problems that exist in university examinations is not without reason, believe that this situation is not only in Lanzhou University.
In this sense, praise should be given to the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, people who have gone to college are aware that the attack preparation of exams, and think of various ways to "take" the test from the teacher's questions, strive for the scope of the examination, get a "focus coaching" phenomenon before the exam is not uncommon, even in the exam clipping small copies, post-appraisal request teachers high hand status is not strange.
In my view, as a guide to the assessment of the quality of teaching, the success of a university examination is measured in terms of the teachers ' overall knowledge of teaching and learning and the scientific propositions based on it.
At the undergraduate level, specializations began to be broken down and many specialized courses were based on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether to fully master a basic knowledge point in a discipline is the content of the university exams to examine.
And undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory of the discipline and basic common sense, from the point of view of knowledge, the space of change is not large, it is basically fixed.
As teachers say, "Twenty years ago, the basics of university mathematics are still learning, and the focus is still on it."
But the knowledge point is basically unchanged, does not represent the test question type single, test question repetition.
In many universities, examinations are usually organized into question groups, combined with senior teachers in disciplines, and the examination papers are attended by all the teachers who are responsible for the Section, thus overcoming to some extent the duplication of test questions.
However, in order to develop a set of practical and practical questions that can be easily distributed according to the student's overall learning situation, there is also a need to take stock of the teaching situation and to provide a comprehensive analysis of the student's level of learning, so that the test's subject matter can be easy and dynamic, highlighting both the basic knowledge and the ability to study.
Examination is the commanding rod of university education, what kind of examination students will have corresponding preparatory programmes, will affect the effectiveness of university education in the past.
For the student's letter of recommendation, Lanzhou to the university team attaches great importance and has deployed rectification programs throughout the school.
The teaching units are required to organize self-censorships and test-student examinations for teachers, to develop the subject of the examination and the associated system, and to strengthen the monitoring and inspection of the subject of the examination and the examination process, to refine the evaluation of the results and to strengthen the comprehensive examination of the various components of the curriculum.
The institutional solution to problems such as the single type of test, the duplication of topics, is an issue for university examinations, and of course a corresponding system needs to be put in place, but it is a daily matter that requires teachers to have a full grasp of the teaching, not only of the content, but also of the students' studies, both of them.

Shabana 3200 newborn babies without birth certificate for special anti-counterfeit paper
(AFP) The National Registry of Sabah said that due to the special anti-counterfeit paper storage light, it was not possible to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October, and the total number of affected people has accumulated to date to 3,200.
However, the Director of the Authority, Kairu Aminus, assured that all babies who had applied for paper were recorded in the system and that the paper protection would be reissued when it arrived next week.
At a news conference, he explained the 10-month-long reporting of a web-based media outlet pointing to the problem of paper printing in Sabah newspapers.
He said that the problem had arisen two months ago and that the same problem was facing the country.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Saba Papers differed from other areas, so it was impossible to borrow inventory from other states.
Kerouaminus revealed that the latest shipment of anti-false paper had arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6 this month and was subsequently handed over to the printing company on 8 August for partial printing.
The Bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday to collect the goods and return to Shaba immediately for the final stage of printing, which is estimated to take two more working days (December 20) to deliver to the applicants.
“We will inform the applicant to go to the local stations to pick up the paper.”
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 newspaper papers so far this year.
From 7:00 until now.
Isn't that coming soon?
I'm talking about food.
I'm waiting on the other side of #PRS_ORG#.
All right, thanks, because the restaurant says it's ready.

48 Hour Nuclear Acid Negative, Establish "Buffer Zone" State Council Joint Defense Joint Control Mechanism Requests Strengthening Port City Epidemic Control - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 11 (Reporter Dong Rifeng, Guangdong) The State Council's Joint Defense and Control Mechanism issued a notice on the day before on strengthening the work on the control of the epidemic of novel coronavirus in port cities, requiring people to leave the recent land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong, Macau) to have a negative test for nucleic acid within 48 hours and to carry out at least one test for nucleic acid after arriving in the port cities.
According to the notice, the timeframe for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port city scope by the provincial municipalities to 15 March 2022.
In addition, the notification also suggests that conditional port cities may study setting up epidemic control buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
The relevant head of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy, and people on both sides exchange frequently.
The implementation of the divisional differentiation management policy, from one anti-control spill line to two defense lines, it is expected to achieve the transition before the crossing, reduce the epidemic spill risk, with minimal social impact and minimum social costs to achieve the maximum effectiveness of outbreak prevention and control.
In recent times, there have been a number of home-grown concentrated epidemics in the country, all of which have been imported through port cities.
The above-mentioned notifications pointed out that this exposed some issues such as inadequate early warning of local epidemic monitoring, failure to implement closed-loop management of high-risk positions for personnel, periodic flow of nucleic acid testing, inability to eliminate parts of cold chain items, inadequate management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific accuracy in emergency management of epidemic situations.
The notification requirement focuses on nine aspects, including improving the control mechanism of port city epidemics, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, speeding up the completion of the short-term weaknesses of port city control, not relaxing, scientifically accurate and good control work, and tightening the outer anti-input anti-line.
The notification stresses that port cities should simultaneously study and implement, publish and broadcast the national health hotlines, regularly check out the emerging risks of basic life supplies and prices, and respond to the emerging issues reflected by the masses in a timely manner.
According to the notification, the port cities referred to include open land, waterways, air ports in the county (city, district, flag), their city (land, state, alliance) and their municipalities, specific scope is determined by provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and timely announcement.

20 years of bloodthirsty killings by the U.S. Army - Xinhua
(video source: pipeline)
On December 11, a micro-documentary on the oil pipeline platform called "Machine Killing Machine" sparked widespread attention.
The film tells about the U.S. launching the war in Afghanistan under the name of "counterterrorism", forcibly exporting American democracy through the war, 20 years of poor militarism, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and committing various crimes against humanity.
The misuse of drones to air attacks on civilian sites such as hospitals, schools and other places, distorting human nature, and the formation of homicide groups.
For 20 years, United States forces have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The “black jails” set up by the United States forces have inflicted various forms of torture and physical humiliation on “suspects”.
An anti-human crime provoked more Afghans to hate.
As the video says, the American "counterterrorism" war is "the more and more fearful."
War has not brought peaceful democracy, prosperity, a country full of eyes and countless massacres to the Afghan people.
Let's come together to uncover the truth of the American anti-terrorist propaganda, the bloody killing, and the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Inadvertently see the following article, from a commercial point of view as well as from a conservation point of view about why the customer wants to help the logistics company in the tax area do the canning, although the canning belongs to the deep processing, not to the operational scope of the tax logistics company, here the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to a lot of milk powder manufacturers, contacting a lot of milk powder production line.
In fact, the bags and the milk powder they are made of are the same raw materials, no difference whatsoever.
So you will certainly ask: why is the shelf life of bags a year, and the shelf life of listening to clothes is two years or more?
Or ask yourself, why is the price difference between purses and bags so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that it is because the raw materials are different that the quality will be much better.
In fact, raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who respond after eating from this mentality and say that the taste or taste of listening is different!
Now I'll talk to you first about the reasons for listening to dresses, where are they expensive?
Why are their raw materials the same price difference so big?
Because most manufacturers when pricing take into account that if the price of the bag is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are very low, or no profits, what does the manufacturer depend on to survive?
So they had a big upswing on the pricing of hearing suits to secure their margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers are preyed on listening rather than pouching.
And if you think so many manufacturers pay tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year for advertising, how does that cost you?
Everyone can think of it.
So, with the development of society, market promotion costs, such as: salespeople in shopping malls, exhibition costs for shopping malls, product gift fees, advertising expenses, etc. are also constantly increasing.
So the manufacturers are constantly adding new items, and they are listening, and their prices are constantly rising, in fact new products as market costs increase.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, but the cost of increasing their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan.
Some brands, in order to promote their products, choose to hook up with hospital doctors to help them promote their products, drawing profits ranging from $30 to $80 per listen.
And China's relevant laws are absolutely not permitting such methods of operation, in fact the practice is harassing consumers.
It is advisable to buy packed milk powder in a can without having a can at home, so that you can save money, and increase the preservation and sealability of milk powder, and have no impact on children.
It is also important to note that the shelf life of the bag is not longer than the shelf life of the bag, if the shelf life of the bag is the same as the shelf life of the bag, but it is not easy to save it after the bag is opened and is easily deformed by the tide.

Don't scare people off the starting line - Xinhua Net
When shopping in the book market, you can often feel the explosion of successful schoolbooks.
Many of today’s successful books promote “best principles” – assuming or implying that you can do it, and then telling you what you need to do.
It's like crossing the “how to do” link, which is really the most important and fundamental part of the story.
That’s why these books have one thing in common – either do the best they can at once, or do nothing at all; either 100, or 0; or climb Mount Tai, or just stay where you are.
This "best principle" that anyone can see will admit to being "right and irresistible", but 99% of people will be scared before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path that "you have to remake people and make a big 180-degree shift," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many.
For those who are conforming to the rules, obstinate and reject change, you prefer to shout "You want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly a self-deception, a bull piano act.
The vast majority of people will be timid in the face of the words "transition", wrapped up, difficult to resolve; or by a moment of impulse painsed the determination of "transition", and bravely took the first step, but often not long prospects, persistence for a few moments after defeat, unseemable continuity.
The famous "Starting tomorrow" by Mr. Marzoli is the most divine expression of this “universal humanity”.
The biggest problem with the best principles of the door is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the limits of the ability of ordinary people, and makes the vast majority of people stare at the door with awe.
Perhaps the “second best principle” is a way to make it possible for more ordinary people to embark on a relatively successful path.
The core of the next-best principle lies in lowering the threshold – a principle that encourages a “win-win-win” approach, i.e., if you can’t do 100, you can only do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; and if you can’t climb Mount Tai, you can only climb a small sandy hill at your doorstep, because it’s always stronger than walking on the ground.
Anyway, as long as you do something, it's better than not.
As the threshold is significantly lowered, there is more chance that ordinary people will be able to stick to it, and the probability of success will increase as long as everything sticks to it.
Just following the "second-best principle" path of success, its journey is slightly longer.
All in all, the "best principle" although it ostensibly bears the banner of success for everyone, it can ultimately be motivated, actually a few; and the "second good principle" can effectively inspire more people to benefit as much as possible.

The reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Xinin on December 11th (reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) reporter from the Agriculture and Rural Administration of Qinghai Province was informed that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserves of Cinghai Lake naked carp resources increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared with the previous year to 108.5 million tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial protection in 2002.
The popular name Qinghai Lake, the bare walled “hopper fish”, is a unique and valuable species in the Qinghai Lake and plays a vital role in sustaining the safety and biodiversity of the “water-fish-bird” ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to the increasing environmental degradation of artificially large number of killings and bare carp breeding waters, the number of naked carps in Qinghai Lake declined sharply, and in 2002 there were only 2,592 tons of empty carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The naked wall of Qinghai Lake was listed as a endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species in 2004.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a sealed lake fishery, which prohibits any unit, collective or individual from fishing for carnivorous carnivores in the main rivers and tributaries of the Qinghai Lake and Lake District, and prohibits the sale of carnivorous carnivores and their products.
At the same time, by means of artificial breeding discharge and cleaning up the main channels of the Qinghai Lake, designing scientifically reasonable "overfishing channels" and other measures, the conservation effort is continuously increased, and the stocks of carp in the Qinghai Lake are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, said that as of now, qinghai lake naked carps have been cumulatively carried out artificial reproduction and discharge streams close to 180 million tails, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of chonghai lake naked carp resources.
The Qinghai Three River source area is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even in Asia, while the Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls western desertification spreading eastward.
To protect the ecological environment of the Yangtze River basin and the waters of the Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife and preserve the biodiversity of the Tibetan Plateau, since this year, the Qinghai has issued a catch ban in the main waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has built a comprehensive catch ban management system for the Yangtze River and Yangtze Lake.

I've just seen a fake article, it's too long.
Give the unknown male Cope a little bit.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first leave on a day between the ages of 13-15 and close at around age 50.
Afterwards, it will be relatively regular every month under the premise of physical health.
But it is not the norm to be able to accurately predict, about a week or so of tolerances, you need to prepare in advance, sometimes luck will also turn over the car ( suddenly several days ahead).
The length of time, the amount of blood, the degree of pain varies from person to person, some for three days, some for a week; some for less flow, some for a big bleeding; some for no reaction, some for a ride to the ambulance, the pain will change with time.
Uncontrollable menstruation, 24 hours of bloodshed in a few days from the beginning until the end, can only be done with sanitary towels or sanitary cotton bars to prevent bleeding into clothing chairs.
The pain is mainly due to the secretion of prostate herbs, and it is not useful to eat at the beginning of the physiology period and then at the beginning of the physiology period, to eat Brockine when it is not possible to do so effectively to alleviate the pain of the month.
Before the physiological period, due to uterine overcharging and prostate release too much, it is easy to pull the stomach.
If it is about the cycle, inexplicably pulling the stomach, basically there will be menstruation within two days.
The sanitary napkins are best to replace once for two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to nourish bacteria, remove sleep time, the worst case is that they are replaced six times a day, seven days a month, which is 42 tablets, if you add pre-prepared portions may have 50 pieces, not every month.
(Amend here, hygienic cotton strips do not need to be changed again, maybe five or six hours can be changed once, up to eight hours)
Menstrual hormone poisoning may be more rabid, and menstrual periods may also be unsettled because of hormonal changes in the body, which is bad luck, the body makes itself a stumbling block.
However, official crime rate data show that the ability of women to control emotions is still high and that emotional problems are not used as an excuse.
The flow is not just blood, which contains the decomposed uterine membrane.
The uterine membrane is thinner after the end of the menstruation, then slowly thickening, it can be understood that the womb is a house, each month to build a house (the inner membrane becomes thicker) ready to meet the guests, the guests did not come, all removed (menstrual discharge) next month to build a new house, and restarted.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades to come, 24 hours of bloodshed every month, and there will also be bouts of back pain, who would?
But a man can be born because his mother came to menstruate, menstruation is to prepare you for the first 10 months of living in a house when you come to this world, and everyone should thank their mother for the healthy menstrual cycle.
In the past, a lot of women had been repressed, and society had brainwashed women and said that they were dirty, ashamed, and that was what they thought, but the times had changed.
If someone feels nausea of menstruation, feel that the woman's body for the preparation of life is nausea, should not be spoken out in the public court, the girls stand up, do not think again, never experienced, this life will not experience, and less understand the men, don't so forgetfulness knows how to face their mother, how does it mean to want their own children?
Finally, the sisters try hygienic cotton strips, which is really useful.
It's winter and holiday. It's a disappointment to send the wrong ones.
We have to order something else for the kids.
I hope the shop has to check out the product while it's busy.
Is the foot bath bubble foot scarf leaked electricity?
The choice of the right foot bath can play a good role in health care, and today the editor-in-chief of the United States will answer this question in the hope that it will be of assistance to his friends.
As people's health awareness increases, bathtubs are becoming more and more popular with consumers, and a large number of products of different grades are also emerging in the market. From hundreds of thousands to thousands of dollars bathtubs are full, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with traditional household electricity, the sale of health-care household electricity such as bathtubs, but bathtubs do not have specialized industry standards, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in the electrified water!"
Mr. Lee told the press that he had recently bought a foot bath for his father to present his birthday, but that he felt numb on the soles of his feet while he was soaking his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the bathtub, did not expect to turn off the vibration function, but the father still feels the bottom of the foot.
Mr. Lee tried with a pencil, the pen was lit, and Mr. Lee was surprised to discover that the water in the tub was electric.
Later he contacted the merchants, and the merchants' attitude was good, and Mr. Li was still uncomfortable despite withdrawing from the bathtub.
Because he found that this long-famous foot bath is now without a clear industry standard for setting the highest temperatures, which people it is used to, which materials it is safe to use, etc.
But in general, the foot bathtub will not have an electric problem, but also does not exclude a few products when out of the factory did not strictly shut down.
Thus, a split foot bath is chosen at the time of purchase.
Electricity and water are separated and there are no safety concerns.
At the same time, you can take an e-book test.
Opening of the thirteenth provincial tea fair - Watch the headlines - Hunan Daily News
Hunan Daily December 10, 2016 (All Media Reporter Zhang Shunmu Hu Zhuang, Correspondent Li Ken Liu Xiaoling) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Red Tea Promotion will be held at the Hunan International Exhibition Centre to showcase the tea industry, innovate tea technology, promote tea culture and accelerate the push for billions of tea industry targets.

So if the food isn't hot, can we cancel it?
I don't want to, because there is no way to park below, he couldn't bring it up.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through intuition through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental law of philosophy, aimed at explaining the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the word "formal physics" is derived from the phrase "formal means, forms and instruments," which was translated from metaphysics by Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji period) of Japan.
Metaphysical branches include ontology, natural theology and its extension problems.
The theory is “to study which terms represent the real entity of existence and which terms represent only one concept”.
A metaphysical naturalism denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be conceptually explained by natural reason, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodual naturalism refers to the method of studying God's wordlessness.
Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the essence of consciousness and their relationship with the physical body, especially the brain.
The dualist and monist theories are the two main schools of thought that discuss “the relationship between the mind and the body”.
Knowledge theory is a philosophical branch that explores the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline of systematic thinking and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all norms of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.

It studies what kind of moral standards people should follow; applies ethics; applies ethical theory to the academic context of real life, including bioethics; political ethics; describes ethics; gathers information about how people live and summarizes it from observed styles.
It is not based on predicted theories but on the investigation of the actual moral decisions made by the moral agent and observed by all the moral factors that have contributed to the decision, and it examines the ethical views held by the social community.
The history of ethics includes Greek-Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics, and the history of ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanistism, represented by Varla and Montau and others.
Part II: Ethical ideas for religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part III: Political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, British empirical ethics, represented by Hume, 17-18th century, European rationalist ethics, represented by Spinoza, 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, represented by Voltaire, 18-19th century, German Academy ethics, represented by Kant and Hagel, 18-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, represented by Bentham and Siquiwick, 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley, late 19th century, German New Kantian ethics, represented by Lee Kahler, late 19th century, New Hagel ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green, etc.), transitional ethics (non-rational ethics, represented

That's less than the same. You need money for a McNuggets.
You asked the restaurant to come in.
I just don't want to go downstairs to buy things, and spend so much money on selling.
Ting: To friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all my friends for the humanitarian assistance they have provided us during the long period of 30 years since the deaths of our relatives, especially the humanitarian assistance that has not been interrupted so far since I made a personal appeal to friends at home and abroad at the beginning of 1994.
The vast majority of the deceased's parents have now died, and the lonelies have grown up to work at home.
It is your eloquence that has helped us, the families in distress, to spend the most difficult moments.
The new crown epidemic is now raging around the globe, and most donors have retired annually.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to suspend the humanitarian donation to our host, the Tiananmen mother group, which should have been the perfect end for this humanitarian operation long ago.
I will forever remember your love, and firmly believe that your righteousness will be remembered for history.
For a variety of reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please friends understand!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tau: Allow me to take this opportunity to present a brief account of the 32-year history of humanitarian relief by the All-American Federation of Sciences (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democratic Foundation (MCDF).
In the course of humanitarian relief, the All-American Institute of Self-Government and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, with project implementers often cross-cutting.

Salvation is often not delivered successfully to the 64-year-old hand.
In 1994, according to the suggestion of teacher Ding, a special group was established by "Tian'anmen Mother" to integrate and distribute the recipients.
In 1998, the MCDF established the Youth and Older Persons Education Fund Fund, which was implemented 11 years later, and in 2009, after all six children graduated from college, the MCDF subsequently established the Youth and Older Persons Special Needs Rescue Fund, which has been implemented to date.
Funding for these projects, mainly from campus and social contributions in the six-to-four year period, from individual generous donations, and supported by the Brotherhood University Foundation for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, 31 years later, the Sixty-Four Tribes finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong that year in the name of Sixty-Four.
During this time, the Chinese Human Rights Watch also independently implemented their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Ding's suspension of six or four donations is for the donors to consider, we are indeed some retired people, income is not as good as before retirement, I hereby express my gratitude to Ding's "friend" letter.
We will respect the decision of the non-members to terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if needed.
Thank you and pay tribute to those heroic and courageous comrades who have persisted for years in giving generously and at the risk of delivering humanitarian aid.

Member Evaluation
[Effects] Photo effect: I took two-person clothes in general, it is good to like this set of pictures.
[Service] Service detail: Because pregnancy is a little uncomfortable with makeup, and the make-up artist and the staff are so sweet that I take a break and keep pouring me hot water.
The price of the set is 1000 yuan.
Thanks for the rabbit's comment.
Thanks to Dandan's approval, your satisfaction will allow us to keep the power supply going forward and we will continue to refuel!
This is a great photography studio and I would highly recommend all the younger friends to come!
There is no room for criticism from reception, cosmetics, costumes, lights, photography to later stages.
The make-up artist is especially delicate, will match your style to suit your make-up, cosmetics are also the first line of big brands.
Not to mention that Mr. Tan Liang is a very professional photographer.
The studio is full of artistic atmosphere and two kittens are playing with the whole group.
We are working in Beijing, Beijing's good movie buildings need to lined up for half a year ahead of schedule, colleagues have been photographed in Beijing, watching the finished film feel just so so.
Specially looking for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
We have a poor facial management, and I think this is the short version of most people, and the photographer will grab the pictures and record the wonderful moments of nature.
Make-up artist, photographer, late-stage design, a great team.
We and everyone around us are very much in favour of it.
The girlfriend's past has been recommended, and the girlfriend just looked at the bottom of the film was equally happy.
It was to be hoped that such a studio would not be buried and that more people would find it and film it as their own, rather than as their own, style.
Thank you very much for the five-star rating given to Owl and Kei Ling, both of whom are very creative and creative newcomers, and we are creative studios, as long as customers like us, we will do our utmost to complete, and thank you for meeting each other
A sweet and helpful assistant, and a lively and enthusiastic photographer teacher, everyone in the team is supernice. It was a beautiful shoot, an unforgettable experience, and the result was much better than I could have imagined. Everyone worked hard, thank you very much.
Thank you for the review of Xiao Yu. You are also a reason to know from Hour and Hart to Qinhuangdao. The trust in us is thousands of kilometers away, I am happy to know you have the opportunity to go back to Qinhuangdao next time.
How do I give money?
The meal has already been delivered
No rider to receive.
Now the restaurant clerk calls me
A programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you are planning to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if there is no idea about this, it is better to be self-taught, after all, training will cost a lot of money, and also take six months to study.
But training is a very good option if you are going to get into this industry, especially for those who are self-sufficient and weak, training is a very good option.
If you are more self-sufficient, you can also choose self-learning, but it will be tiring.
Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, look at the teachers' strength of the institution, if the teachers' strength is not strong enough, the training institute is meaningless, of course some newly opened training institutes teachers' strength is not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing to explore this training institution, it is best to explore the students of this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know what the agency really is, the course of explaining is good or bad.
Well, I don't know how to answer your question, because you don't have a definite introduction to your situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your personal situation.
For example, professionalism, age, language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will be related to the industry you are learning or wanting to engage in.
If you are a student and you have not graduated or you are a computer professional, then if you have enough time I personally recommend self-study, which is the least efficient and costly, and many online training institutions are actually good, but one is expensive to learn, the second is more time consuming, and basically requires 3-6 months of focused training.
But if I say these things, self-study is convenient. Now a lot of learning resources on the web are free, or go to b site also a lot of training resources, if you don't find resources, you can also contact me through a profile, get free resources, or get detailed advice.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not computer professional, but can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then it is recommended to study in training institutions, so that learning does not have to be very laborious, the teacher's explanation is also detailed, there are problems and people who specially answer, as well as help in studying planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions sign employment agreements, have in-house nominations, recommend to companies after studying, so that the interview links for later job searches can save a lot of things.
The above are some of my views, the previous said because you do not understand your situation, so only probably introduction is not detailed, if you have other people who want to consult, can contact me at any time for communication and communication.
I said, "At 1 o'clock, I saw it at App."
What's that?
I haven't finished. What are you doing?
I accept all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall hanging stove heater, clean water, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove head, oil tobacco machine, lighting fixtures, glass cleaning, professional sewing, domestic service
Thank you to those who gave me a silent applause and fought hard to live a very tired life but to continue
"Life will not fail every person who strives, love to follow me, thank those who silently praise me.
Life is like this, other people only look at the result, their own self-supporting process, face life, we have no choice but to be strong, it is to continue, there is no choice, the road can look back but can not go back...
Cleanliness is a job, it is a duty, life is beautiful because of service, service is wonderful because of the effort.
Cleaning is the dirtyest thing we do, but we'll clean every corner of the client's house with the utmost seriousness, and we'll see the smile of the customer's satisfaction and the thumbs erected, and all the fatigue will be worth it, and we'll pay for it!
My daily work
Your request, my service.
Be careful of service, be careful of cleanliness, stay good.
The details you care about, Feng Gui's family will help you to do "clean" I can, service the family.
Keep your house clean, keep your house clean, keep your house clean, keep your house clean.
Interior and exterior cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp is beautiful, it can be dim without cleaning for a long time. It is only after cleaning that it can shine, and so is life
Careful work can succeed, with careful craftsmanship, fine sewing we are serious.
Give me the opportunity, you will surely be satisfied, quality means everything, because the professional deserves to be trusted, your acknowledgment is my most encouraged!
It's hard to do everything in the world right now!
But I have always believed that as long as seriousness, enough persistence, enough effort, I will be a little better than others, at least always more than sitting complaining."
The count of the day is in the morning, and all the good things start early in the morning. I hope you bring happiness, luck, health, well-being to begin a new day, keep your whole day's good mood. Good morning
When you are young, happiness is a thing, having happiness; when you grow up, happiness is a goal, reaching happiness; after maturity, it is found that happiness is a mentality, and understands happiness.
Be the most true and the most kind of yourself, act according to heart, no regret in this life; life one way, walk your own way; two treasures of life: good body, good heart, beautiful and bright life to old age!
At every stage of life, there are different difficulties.
Many times, it is not your ability that holds you back, but your courage to face it actively.
Since it is impossible to avoid, it is better to face it openly.
The more you are afraid, the more you will be crushed by difficulties; if you find it difficult, the problem will end up being solved.
China's first two-year exhibition of contemporary art held in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News Agency
The first two-year exhibition of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia, the Riyadh JAX Art Area, opened to the public on November 11 in the northwestern Saudi capital of Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries participating.
The two-year exhibition was jointly planned by the Saudi Diriya Biannual Exhibition Foundation and the UCCA Yurens Contemporary Arts Centre of China, where the Director of the Arts of the UCCA Yurens Contemporary Arts Centre of China, Mr. Yutaka Kuda, served as Director General of the Arts.
According to the curator team, the theme of the biennial exhibition is "Cross the River and the Rock", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy taken during the period of socio-economic transformation and reflects the current situation in Saudi socio-cultural development.
The two-year exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and spans six interconnected buildings, represented in six units: Touching the Stones Over the River, Inheritance as an Experiment, Border Thinking, Going to the Public, Beautiful New World, and The Spirit of Art.
Among them, 27 Saudi artists represented more than a quarter of the total exhibition, covering various forms such as painting, installation and performing arts; 12 Chinese artists also received attention, some using recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Jiao's reconstruction of a classic mountain water painting with waste materials in the series The Endless Mountains behind the Tale (2014).
Barclay, Chief Executive Officer of the Diriye Biannual Exhibition Foundation, expressed the hope that the current biennial exhibition would create an international dialogue that would provide a global audience with an opportunity to learn about the flourishing cultural industries and creative communities in Saudi Arabia and enhance interaction.
"The goal of the Biennale is dual, both to engage Saudi contemporary art in global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the Biennale, and opinion leaders from artists, curators and creative industries will discuss cross-cultural exchanges and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Integrated regulation of rural public welfare jobs management - Xinhua Network
Kunming, Xinhua News Agency (December 12, China) - In an effort to continue helping people out of poverty by helping them find jobs and consolidating the success of the fight against poverty, the province of Yunnan has recently adopted a policy to promote rural revitalization and the management of public-interest jobs in rural areas, helping to promote rural revitalization in a comprehensive manner.
The relevant head of the Yunnan People's and Societies Office introduced that at present, 448.3 million rural public welfare jobs have been developed by Yunnan to recruit disadvantaged groups in rural areas such as poverty-relief workers, which play an important role in helping the people out of poverty achieve employment gains, consolidating the achievement of poverty reduction and effectively improving the capacity of various public services in rural areas.
The new regulations will be issued jointly by the seven departments of Yunnan People's Association, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, and will mainly provide uniform standards on the scope, fund management, job development, and job management of rural public service personnel recruited at the grass-roots level.
With regard to job development, the new regulations specify that they are based on the principles of “replacement on demand, placement, dynamic management, volume control”, “who develops, uses, who is responsible” and “one person on one job, voluntary disclosure, unified management”.
Recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with such steps as announcements, declarations, audits, publicity, hiring, pre-service training and placement.
In addition, the new regulations clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development sector for rural public benefit jobs, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public benefit jobs, stipulate that the rural public benefit jobs development sector should purchase commercial insurance for people who are located in rural public benefit jobs; require the relevant sector to monitor the issue of rural public benefit job subsidy on a regular basis.
Wrong address.
Hello.
Can I cancel my order
I re-ordered
Has it been cancelled?
Although the right-wing party has had a time of ambition in history, but not long, so short because to give a little sunshine is brilliant, to drink a little water is sweating; to have a little ambition is to look at Luo and Shu, to be hit is to be covered with fur.
But in reality, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive meaning of the right should not be negated in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution by defining the standards of truth, developing the economy and improving science and technology, as well as promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights guarantees.
Three, as for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Wei Dong's statements, I care about him and respect him very much; because he is serious, he is serious about China and he is serious about China's social issues.
But I reject his anti-communist theory, and I believe that contrary to the necessary revolution, the revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, the destruction of the lives of the people, the confusion of political groups, and the exploitation of foreign forces.
Fourth, to change or improve China's attitude towards patience and responsibility for the country and its people, political speculation is trying to get rid of the chaste, not the right, but the assholes.
Let's talk about left again.
The left, in fact, is a series of eras and political abandonment.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party will also listen to some right words and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left does not create it, because what the left wants is precisely the crap that the Communist Party throws away!
Fifth, I recently saw some friends on the side of anti-thieves to refute left epilepsy, but also strong emotions, I think it is not necessary.
Don't try to justify the adultery and left epilepsy, they are a cramp, unreasonable.
And don't try to prove that we're right, and don't think about getting the anti-theft and the left-wing to admit it, why not?
I tell my friends this way: When the anti-thieves curse you with five hair, when the left saith to your right dog, it is precisely proof that our middle road is correct!
Many people also had ideals when they were young, and when they were old, they forgot them, or pursued them, and became prejudiced.
And the ideal is gradually moving away, and even the dragon cubs end up as evil dragons.
The left and right I think generally refers to restraint and freedom, China's innate genes from history and culture lead to the whole of China should be left-handed.
The right-wing parties in the country are free, focusing on efficiency and development, the left is strengthening regulation, and the left is focusing more on fairness and security.
Now, the whole society wants to pay more attention to fairness, while China and the US are fighting, the left is positive, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, the praise is over.
Nothing to say, Flowers are so valiant.
Over the past two years, Meiji's blockade and blockage of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented dilemma, but also made "America" enterprises suffer huge losses.
Meitlin has pressured the Chinese chip industry, demanding that its own companies and allied companies simultaneously block Chinese chip industries, and the direct consequence is that orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, which has led to a decrease in R&D and capacity of chip production companies, which has led to a worldwide disorder of the shortage of chip supply chains.
Today, the "short core" has affected various major industries around the world, such as automakers' shutdown and mobile phone prices, and almost all of the industries used for chips are deeply harmed.
In order to gain the autonomy of "chips," more and more state-owned tech giants are on their way to " beautifying."
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control, dragging the development of China's semiconductor industry, recent old American action is frequent, and also hosted the "chip summit"; it was also invited 64 giants to establish a semiconductor alliance, and withdraw funds to support the domestic US tech giants, for example, Mei Dynasty senior technology giant Intel in order to regain its dominance in the field of chips, spent $20 billion on building two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and opening up chip replacement business.
When most people think that Intel's move will cause a certain impact on TSMC, and it is very likely to take away the "job" of TSMC.
This is so certain, because Intel as the old-fashioned technology giant, in semiconductor field for decades, has a large number of talent and technical reserves, must be able to quickly rise in the short term, defeat TSMC power.
However, in Intel's decision, the founder of the power plant, Mr. Zhang, paid no attention to his loyalty.
At the 2021 Master Intelligence Forum, held in April, Zhang Zhuang expressed surprise at the move to fund Intel's chip factory. Zhang Zhuang said without hesitation: Intel's chip replacement factory is rather ironic.
The reason why Zhang Chung was so disrespectful of Intel's entry into the crystalline field was that Zhang Chung still had a grudge against Intel over 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was always a bead in the manufacturing industry of the United States Emperor, and he was at the top of the world and a master in the world's semiconductor sphere.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been dominated by a few powerful ones.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips from design, manufacturing to sealing were done by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model overstretched some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs faced huge production-line construction costs.
In response to market demand, after the 1980s, the chip industry began to show division of labour and cooperation, in 1984 Zhang Chung-chung heard of a company specializing in chip design, and thought that since there is a company specialized in design, then a factory specialized in making crystals could be established.
Shortly afterwards, Zhang's idea became a reality, and the accumulated electricity was born.
The main focus of the company's business is on the single-stage processing of crystals. It does not design, but provides a substitute service for crystal-making.
The newly-created stand-up electricity was small in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang was looking for an investment in Intel, but at the time Intel heard that TSMC is only a manufacturing link in the chip industry, apparently some self-esteemed, can not afford TSMC electricity, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC electricity.
Zhang also believed that Intel was not able to afford wafer process services at the time.
I had no idea that the giants who couldn't afford wafer manufacturing services in the past year, but now they also have to start working as wafer dealers.
So Jang's loyalist thought it was ironic that Intel entered into the crystal circle.
Today, the market value of TSMC electricity has surpassed Intel.
In the face of a powerful attack of the accumulated electricity, Intel naturally did not dare to stand firm.
Today, TSMC has been sprinting toward a 3nm chip, and Intel still stays at the 14nm seven years ago.
Trying to catch up isn't really easy.
I'm not waiting
It's 19:06. It's been two hours.
Come see some weird hot searches today.
What is a normal mood?
The random selection of three hot search: the rise of the second runner in February, good friends price increase, Gaul Lara events, public opinion spread to form a wave peak, then [index decline] (smooth curve) eventually dissipate, if there will be a hump again.
They look very different from the web-based evolutionary models that the Trust has shown.
What's an anomaly?
A random selection of six heat searches in the same event reveals isolated peaks, serrated teeth, and cliffs.
A single-peak heater is a person who heats up a list of topics quickly to attract public attention; a saw-tooth heater is a cyclical heater that ensures the topic is on the hot search list; and a cliff-shaped heater is a collective withdrawal in which the hot search performs its functions, receives new tasks, and races to new battlefields.
In Figure 9, the heatwave peak of one incident coincides with another event's wave valley, time in seconds is not bad, it must be a unified batch of water forces received the task and opened a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black PR can be seen: dozens of hot searches at the same time on the list, which attracts attention, which is responsible for KUP, which leads to war, which shifts its sights, what influences perception, which misleads judgment, which incites emotions, which holds decisions, and who finely combats the black-chip account batches and sub nodes, almost taking into account all elements of public opinion dissemination and diffusion.
Dissemination is a science that throws aside all the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will be nowhere to hide.
Anyone who walks through will leave traces like these, and we dug them together.

Cases of infection with the Omicron strain first detected in countries such as Mauritius - Xinhua Net
Xinhua Society Beijing December 12th. Xinhua Consolidated Xinhua News Journalist abroad reported that Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi had reported for the first time in recent days a case of infection with the Omicium strain of the new coronary mutation virus.
Mauritius first reported two cases of Omik zirconium infection in the country on 10 October.
According to Minister of Health Mau Kelesh Jagutepar, one of the infected persons was a tourist who had arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on 27 November; the other was a local Mauritian resident who, after contacting a person who had recently returned to South Africa, tested positive for nucleic acid on 30 November.
After hospital isolation treatment, the results of both infected people's nuclear acid testing were turned negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on 10 October the country's first diagnosis of three cases of Omicron infection.
All three were students who had returned from abroad at the beginning of the month and had not been admitted for medical treatment due to minor illnesses.
In order to prevent the spread of Ommikron strains, the Government of Cyprus has continuously increased its defense and control.
From 6 December to 10 January next year, passengers over the age of 12 who have arrived by air are required to undergo nucleic acid tests at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health of Serbia also announced on 10 that it would begin vaccination against the new Pfizer vaccine for children between 5 and 11 years of age in the country.
The Minister of Health of Malawi, Kumbize Chibunda, said on 9 September that for the first time, three cases of Omikium infection had been detected in the country.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing of 12 new coronary-positive samples collected from 9 November to 2 December and found the three cases of infection.

Come to the store and start a series of scams.
The first time I came to the store was to show them my family chart, and they didn't actually check the house, and they offered me a price of $70,000 for my 135 house, and they probably showed me their material without knowing what they were branded.
Their second set of tricks is that you'll drag you to the store to pay the deposit (and you'll never get back unless you've had enough experience to fight the theory with them).
When I hesitate to pay the down payment, they invite their so-called managers to tell you how much we can give you today if you pay the down payment.
This is a big crater, and I was a living example of someone who was deceived and paid over 10,000 dollars in a brainstorming.
He offered me 70,000 without electricity, without any doors, without any cabinets, without any bathrooms, and these three were the most expensive of the basics.
In addition to these services, their fees are higher than other companies.
I lost confidence in the company and nothing was clear at the beginning, so I signed the contract.
When I look for them to refund money, they show a very experienced appearance and have dedicated small teams to deal with you.
In any case, it's the client's problem, and they're not responsible for it.
There are many details of the various dumping responsibility, and there are still many details, not wanting to say everything is tears, in short, do not choose them, because my friends looking for their renovated house is also poor quality, later you will pay a variety of fees.
Dad, they're the deluded Dragon Head Decorations, and now they're Dae-mi, like they're shut down and changed to something else.
So don't choose this kind of remodeling company.
You're going to have to look more often at these consultations when you choose to do so, because the renovations are not small money.
If you want to ask a businessman, please register or register first
It is strictly forbidden to issue all forms of business evaluation, and please see the details of the statement.
The Kunming Decoration Design Channel offers you the latest business information such as the U.S. 360 integrated home decoration address, telephone, business hours, and to find the decoration company decoration company, go to the public review
So scary, please cancel your order in less than 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, a different address?
All right, then don't cancel the conversation. If I don't get my money back in 5 to 10 days, I'll have to investigate.
I asked if you could cancel in less than 15 minutes.
Potato chickens should be ripe, but the received is raw meat, no way to eat.
The sky is full of twins, meteor showers on 14th - China Net
Xinhua News Agency Tianjin Dec. 12 (Reporter Zhou Runxin) Astronomical Cop experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the twin meteor showers of one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere will welcome a huge rain on December 14, and friends like meteor showers can observe during the second half of the day.
Beijing's astronomy enthusiast Anju photographed twin meteor shower in the Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the meteor showers are periodic comets, but Gemini's meteor showers are Fahrenheit No. 3200, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The twin meteor shower is also the second meteor shower known to date that is not “breeded” by comets.
Tianjin Astronomical Society Council member and astronomers expert Xu Lippeng said, just like the big picture of He Hong, Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, "The release period" can last from December 4 to 17.
This meteoric rain is known for its large and stable flow, and is known as the three major meteoric rains in the northern hemisphere, together with the meteoric rains of the Equator and the meteoric rains of Perseus.
A notable feature of the twin meteor shower is that the meteoric stars are slower, rich in color, and there are also many fire meteors, both suitable for sightseeing and suitable for astronomy photography beginners to shoot.
On December 13, 2020, Tianjin City astronomer Yang Xiao took a picture of a twin meteor shower in Tianjinzhou.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's twin meteor shower will occur around 15:00 on Dec. 14, with a huge ZHR (the number of meteors can be seen every hour when the radiation point is right above the top of the head under ideal observation conditions) at 150.
The chart of the Gemini meteor shower recommendation index.
"Last year, the 'flowering' meteor showers of twins impressed people, but this year's meteor showers will be disturbed by moonlight and a slight discount.
On the 11th of the 14th of the A.C., the moon is full of moons, and bright moons can interfere with observations, so that the moon will fall in the second half of the night, and the radiation points of the bipolar meteor shower will rise to a higher level.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe these hours behind the moon in the second half of the night, but pay attention to cold and warm.
How can we see as many meteors as possible?
“Observations in cities are not recommended, and observations can be made in the suburbs or in the countryside by choosing a high-altitude, lightless, north-east-oriented vision, and then patiently wait until the moon sets down.
It is important to note that the flow of meteor showers in each direction is large, so that the observer does not have to look at the radiation points of the meteor showers.
Friends who like photography want to shoot beautiful meteor shower shots, and it is best to choose wide-angle, large-circle shots, using high ISO and maximum lighting.
Based on stability and sustainability considerations, tripods, spare batteries, and high-speed lines are also essential.”
Shu Li Peng reminded me.
What is the difference between laser and traditional TVs in market positioning?
In my understanding, traditional television should refer to LCD television, whereas the difference between laser and LCD television in market positioning is mainly due to the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the big screen market.
Compared to the full-fledged market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is clearly more focused on the big screen market, or the product itself is born for the big screen.
Currently, mainstream LCD TVs range in size from 55 inches to 65 inches, while laser TVs are generally over 75 inches, with the largest being over 100 inches, which fully meet the user's needs for large screen coloring power.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TV shipments and sales worldwide has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of total TV sales in 80 inches and above.
According to Yi-King's forecast, sales growth in the laser television market will exceed 140 per cent in 2020 and will continue to grow at a fast pace.
The reason for such a good performance in the large screen market, mainly thanks to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye care.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV long-reflection, light from laser light sources does not directly emit light into the eye, and the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions than the backlight of a liquid crystal television, and the stimulation to the eye is smaller.
The Sisi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and the eye specialists of the Beijing Co-operative Hospital have obtained 144 sets of test data through a rigorous comparison test of laser television and LCD television viewed in the same conditions in the population.
Data confirm that laser TVs do have strong eye protection properties and even have some improvement in certain aspects.
In the moment when vision health is increasingly valued, laser television not only attracts more and more users with eye care advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to LCD TV prices are constantly falling, the price of laser TV sold in the market is mostly more than $10,000, with the increase in size and light source, the price is gradually rising.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
I'm sure it makes sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TVs and projections cannot achieve.
With the use of ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser television is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and can achieve a 100-inch screen experience in a short distance, requiring little space, and the mainframe is small, occupying very little space.
In terms of brightness, the big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 flashes.
Additionally, thermal output is lower, equipment is less damaged, and television life is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with a number of cutting-edge technologies such as real 4K ultra-high-definition painting quality, artificial intelligence systems, bionic screens, which can bring more shocking audiovisual experience to users.
It's not about fake demand, it's about the product that needs to be subdivided, about the quality of the picture and the ratio of input to output, laser television is not the menu of the video and audio players, want to take into account the large screen and watch the environment inadequate, can try, everything is advantageous and disadvantageous, after weighing it out, can judge itself, is afraid to listen to one word.
Simply put, the ultra wide angle near-focus projector - laser TV, in order to be close to the screen, had to use expensive ultra wide angle lenses and reflectors, which did not match the best design of optics.
In order to shield some of the environmental light from the microstructure of the Philel screen, the cost is high, with a price of 80 inches, which can be replaced by a 65-inch liquid crystal.
And I hate that the projectors are so good at reflecting light on the eyes, and the light on the screen is directed to the eyes, and you can't see it, and the TV is also directed to the ceiling, and the ceiling is not illuminated.
And if the projection screen is not reflective, it doesn't make a picture at all.
It is precisely ignored the hot spots (light spots) effect of high-gain curtains, a large amount of light reflected into the eyes at some angle, which is very difficult.
The best quality shop in the visual and aesthetic photo gallery has not yet been opened.
With the date of the e-mail appointment, my little sister sends me the choice of time, and the information is more timely.
Before going to see the shooting works in the store, more are outdoor wedding dresses, shots are very beautiful, and there is a lot of filming style involved.
After that day, I briefly exchanged my ideas with my sister, very patiently helped me to try two sets of style clothes which I tangled up, and finally finalized the beginning of make-up modeling - photographers will put some props before shooting, will guide actions, and more refined on each detail.
But maybe it's because I didn't share the specific idea of shooting, so it's not the style I want, but it should be a good-looking shot.
After taking a good shot, the photographer will help to select photos, communicate later style, feel a very careful horn.
It takes about half a month to fix it, and waits for the effect.
On the second occasion, there was a real-life king's dinner event — most of the clothes on the scene were able to choose one shot.
Finally, a black dress was chosen to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, make-up + shooting, the photographer responsible for shooting is the brother after 95, it feels a little bit darker, I hope to be able to give more advice in the direction of customers shooting action afterwards ~ pretty talkative, the shooting process is more enjoyable.
Photography and Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery Selected Quality Shops
It's on the front page. Let's see Queenie too.
The first thing to do is to fill in the name and phone the store and then choose the dress, the wedding dress can be chosen, change three or four sets of clothes is very patient, after choosing make-up is long, the service attitude is good, the back of the photo will teach you how to shape, is the image is big, refined face is said to take half a month, three or four days to come out, it feels like it is no different from the original film.
Environment as a whole is okay.
There are plenty of clothes to choose from.
The makeup is located in about three places, inside the camera shed.
The service is very enthusiastic and very careful.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also be very serious about teaching you how to move.
Unhappy, the photographer will also offer to make a backup.
The experience of the lens may have been a bit out of shape, the two-eyed skin was first applied to the three-eyed skin.
The eyebrows were also shaving, a little embarrassing for daily non-painting eyebrows.
The photo was given ten days ago, but the P graphics were not very satisfactory, and I felt that the eyelids were still very visible.
Because it's not clear which style to choose, I tried two sets and chose the black dress, and Miss said it was more hip-hop than the old-fashioned.
The hairdresser and the make-up artist, the little sister, are very patient in helping me to get the results very satisfied
I started taking pictures after the makeup was done, and the photographer had my pose all the way, and the process was easy and harmonious.
When I finished the film, I carefully selected four of my favorites to be a prodigy, and my brother said it's a 15-minute film, and it's a very happy ending.
I haven't responded for 3 days... I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan because your system can't recognize my credit card!
The strangest thing is, I use the same credit card every time I make a payment.
I have to pay the freight every time.
You'll be excused until you've finished your investigation and charged my monthly fee. Is that okay?
Small umbrellas to buy insurance, huh?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
In terms of conditionality, it appears from the Regulations on the Regulation of Insurance Brokering Agencies (Revised 2015) that three key words must be met to become an insurance brokerage company: shareholders, sponsors for the last three years, with no significant record of violations, and a minimum limit of 50 million yuan in order to be established and subject to the consent of the China Insurance Supervisory Board.
These three are really tough, but they're all about strength. They need to be approved by the State authorities of the Silver Insurance Supervisory Board (which supervises insurance companies and banks in the country), shareholders need to be good at it. As small umbrellas for insurance brokers, the policyholders don't have to question too much about the formality of small umbrellas.
In this respect, it's good, it's trustworthy.
From the insurance product perspective: Small Rainbow Insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies sell star-studded health insurance on this platform, such as the latest up-and-coming and Thai Super Mario No. 5 health insurance, claimants and policyholders are both with Thai Life, small rainbow insurance is only a third-party intermediary, without questioning its reliability.
In terms of the contribution model: Internet platform products, because of the lower operating costs of their outlets and the cost of their employees ' salaries, have a higher universal value than Internet products, and they are paid in a flexible manner that supports monthly payments and reduces the pressure on contributors ' contributions, while maximizing leverage to leverage insurance.
This is still very good.
Can be considered.
This is especially important because insurance is a profession that demands a great deal of professionalism, and many customers of Internet products can make their own insurance. This creates a lot of misunderstandings. In the area of health information and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness to insurance, feeling healthy or fit, and there are a lot of risks of compensation, and risks of rejection.
I've done insurance phone sales myself in “Tweeting microinsurance” (as in the case of small umbrellas, the Internet insurance broker platform) and I'm very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is true, and reliable, and unreliable is people, Internet channels are not professional practitioners, and there are many sales misleading.
For example, 1 yuan insurance coverage of 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, get 60 thousand free sickness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid the weight is light, not telling the insurer that January 1st, next month is required to pay according to normal charges, tens to 200 different, many customers discounted the cost of a year or two they bought a bucket of unknown.
Thinking it could cost a dollar, the insurance company claimed $6 million (the world lost pies).
The free delivery of mobile phones is done by special segments of insurance policies such as 6666,888, and if a winning text message is sent, it does not convert itself or be reminded.
(This is another pit for the insurers) to receive 60,000 free insurance coverage, it is short-term, if only on this, there are no other commercial insurance, in case of serious illness, 60,000 can do anything, can not solve the problem, and later life begins to be naked.
The government is also taking a tough crackdown on misinformation about internet insurance sales.
Overall, therefore, there are no problems with the platform, nor with its products, but with the professional and professional integrity of the operator.
In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, some products are also better than Internet products.
I myself helped 59 Internet clients, insured under-line products and saved 2000-3000 a year for each person.
If you have any questions, you are welcome to communicate and communicate with me.
I:Mingya Insurance broker, have 3 years of enterprise management training experience, serves over thousands of enterprise users, cooperates with more than 100 insurance companies, before insuring, I will start from the customer's needs, customize insurance products for the customer, in the insurance, for the customer's goods more than three, strive for the best verification results for the customer, after insuring, arrange the insurance bills for the customer, maintain the insurance bills, let the customer rest assured.
Growing up with every client for life.
I hope my answer will help the subject!
As defined by the Insurance Regulatory Authority, Internet insurance is an insurance operation in which the insured person is free to complete all the insurance processes by clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant, and all the steps can be completed by the insurer on his own.
Although Internet insurance coverage is not too “ceremonial” and may not even exist in hard copy paper contracts, it does not in any way affect the validity and legal effect of electronic contracts.
This pattern is somewhat similar to the usual wiring operation of "telephone sales", but so buying insurance can also have a fatal problem, that is - follow-up services may not keep up with.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades, and when we buy insurance, should we think seriously about whether the brokerage we choose is a brokerage that can be with us for a long time and will be able to provide services to us for many years to come?

We'll just have to get back the preferential code.
No problem, remember that there is no need to arrange re-shipment, I have purchased another, do not want to waste
Thank you for your help
From the past to the present, I have rejected any form of slander and verbal abuse, and even less acceptable such physical attacks.
In a civilized society, we can embrace everything, but to eliminate this villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it's this uncivilized style that you have to resist first.
I have been unresponsive since you started sending Facebook and friends' requests, and then you put up an euphemistic post, and until you tried to post my so-called home and father's name on social media.
I'm not only going to eat six meals a day, but I'm going to continue to talk to your friends on Facebook about my covert, humiliating remarks, looks, body, living, and what kind of bed with strawberries.
How do I know that later I received more from many friends about your Facebook friend's account uploading a picture of you and sexually harassing ingredients.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After the news of my alarm, you didn't converge at all. Instead, you got more and more furious.
I don't care what your political background is, and whatever your status is, in our society, it requires respect from both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this mesmerizing, obscurity, humiliation, and abusive rhetoric; you can also continue to say that you are just caring for and following me; you can continue to think it's not harassment, you can even keep denying that is not your drawing or continuing to make all offensive remarks.
I can't, and I have no power to stop you.
I don't know you, nor do I want to know you, and my look and body no longer require you to comment on the headpiece.
I don't even think that any girl would be willing to let others humiliate themselves so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, okay?
I said well, you won't believe either.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like that.
In the workplace, in society, in politics or in the business world, only those who don't even have a basic character choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the human heart.
I cut off some of my messages for everyone to comment on.
Your own poster should no one impersonate you.
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization
He smiles.

The water-green integrated service area has already covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Mr. Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director-General of the Jiang Aviation Authority, Minister of Transport and Transport, said that previously, the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu had built 10 integrated water-based green service areas in the middle and downstream of the Yangtze, which had been endorsed by a large number of crews to promote the Yangtze shipping.
The full coverage of the Green Integrated Services Area on the water is another milestone in the construction of Green Shipping in the Yangtze River, and the capacity of shipping services to receive pollutants from ships in the Yangtze River has been significantly improved.
The integrated water-green service area is an important facility for the majority of ships and crews to provide a full range of production and life services, helping the large number of crew members solve the problem of "hurried hope".
The two integrated water-based green service areas on the upper bank of the Yangtze River, which will bring together life services, production services and administrative services, with a green environmental theme, ship maintenance and ship emergency rescue services, will achieve the "one-stop-shop, multiple-services" in Hong Kong, which will make the vessels operating in the Yangtze River on a regular basis work more efficiently and live more conveniently.
The U.S. three aircraft carriers are gathering the most powerful weapons around China Rare access to Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional pro-China media multi-dimensional coverage: recent news of Sino-US relations: latest satellite images show that three US carriers are gathering in China; American media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal is rarely visiting Guam, releasing important signals to allies and enemies of the United States in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank, the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, on 9 January, a satellite discovered the American carrier, the USS Carl Vincent, near the Balabak Channel.
The Strait of Barak, which connects the South Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic location in the chain of the First Island of the Western Pacific.
The platform expects the "Carl Vinson" to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the Falcon Vinson aircraft carrier has been deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Falcon Vessel carriers.
In addition to Carl Vinson, the U.S. military aircraft carrier that is now navigating the Pacific Ocean also has an American Air Carrier Abraham Lincoln on January 3 from the United States.
Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier squadron for the first time, which was part of the U.S. Marine Corps's 314th Combatant Attack squadron.
In addition to these two carriers, the US Navy is currently deploying USS Ronald Reagan in the Asia-Pacific region, stationed in Yokohama, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Champland Lake" missile cruiser and the "Stockdar" missile destroyer.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Position Sensitization Platform" released the latest satellite images showing that three US military aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Perceptions) US-III carriers assembled the most powerful weapons around China and rarely visited Guam on January 17, 2022, the US military carrier CMV-22B flight route.
Also reported by CNN on 17 January, one of the most powerful weapons in the United States Navy arsenal visited Guam rarely last weekend.
The Ohio class nuclear submarine, the USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the United States naval base on Guam last Saturday, 15 January.
Three US carriers gather around China The most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam Analysts say this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The US-led carrier is assembling the most powerful weapons around China, rarely visited Guam. China has built large military installations in the Nansa Islands in recent years.

The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada" visit to Guam reinforced cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating America's capabilities, flexibility, preparedness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as Thunderbolt submarines (Boomer submarines).
The movements of 14 “thunder submarines” in the United States naval fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the "Rayson Submarine" the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad," a system that includes launch well-launched ballistic missiles located on the U.S. mainland, as well as bombers carrying nuclear warheads such as B-2 and B-52.
Speaking to friends about the recent 26 percent drop in the Meta, a market that has evaporated $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded, "Facing unprecedented competition", why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company whose income comes mainly from advertising, and today the advertising company that earns money has its own flow channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and so on, no matter what functionality is positioned, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance," and many App Outsourced Meta ads are realized through Meta's advertising platform.
But the times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta has difficulty retrieving user data, which affects the effectiveness of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users, and will clearly indicate whether users allow the app to access their information, and most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google hits another knife, it will have a bigger impact on Meta's revenue.
Second, the Chinese factor in the income growth of the former Meta also weakened (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but that's not an accurate understanding.
Every year, at least 10 per cent of Meta's income comes from China, mainly from China's companies operating in the sea.
Meta has about a hundred employees in its Hong Kong office, and several major agents on the mainland.
China's companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is an insurmountable advertising channel, most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the TT of the dictionary is now one of Meta's main competitors, but in the last two years Meta has made a lot of money from the dictionary.
The company's representatives across the country are going bytes to Meta to advertise, and Meta's performance in the Greater China region is also good.
I haven't been special about it lately, but I'm sure it won't be better than before.
The stage of large-scale overseas burning of money by Chinese companies has passed.
Third, the new flow channels are not expanding smoothly.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets are not just looking at revenue, but more importantly what the future expects.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg said, "The Woncosmos."
The metacosm should indeed be one of the future directions, but the universe's implementation cycle is relatively long, and this story shouldn't have been enough in two or three years to support Meta's market capitalization.
So the next two years should be more difficult for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook now, with $100 billion to $200 billion a year in income, but it's actually in crisis, and there's no safe moat compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies.
Although his social software is now relatively high in daily life, it is also the mainstream social software such as Facebook, WhatsApp and so on, but Faced with the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook has no confidence, which is a blinking hand.
The idea of the superuniverse, which is so unlikely to succeed in a short time, is so dangerous that Facebook is so dangerous, and that's why Zuckerberg changed his name and was always looking for a new track, but I think his choice was wrong, and it's a no-go, and that's my thoughts and my reference.
