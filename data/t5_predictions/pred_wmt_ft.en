At the Zhejiang Academic Year, students singing protagonists. The results of the research have opened their minds - Xinhua Network
Using air to wash your hands, assess the disease and accurately search for sources of smog Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year's conference in Zhejiang University, a series of breakthrough academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these results were students who covered the environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities and other major fields. Students began with a curious idea to create many high-end inventions that have applied value, some of which have been won at home internationally.
Biosensor: Your Family Medical Examiner
Zhang Dihong, a doctoral student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated on site a smartphone-side biosensor that is only half the size of its smartphone.
"You just need to gently breathe, this instrument can detect the health of your body from the gas composition you exhale."
Zhang said that this sensor is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the mobile phone.
The smart ring that can detect health status on the market is generally detected by physical parameters such as temperature, pulse and other.
This biosensor uses graphene as a new type of material, its target is chemical elements, and its sharp "嗅觉" allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical lights: doctors' high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention was awarded the silver prize at the 44th Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions in Switzerland this year.
Zhu Linjin, a master student at the College of Photoelectric Science and Engineering, and Shenjun Fei's team opened new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lights.
"Many early detection of diseases, removal is not in place, and it is related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
Shen Junfei said that, for example, when examining cancer early, doctors can not see all tumor tissues in a timely manner, then the cancer cells will spread.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lanterns that enhance the difference between different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
In the course of surgery, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectra, color uniformity and non-fiction at any time according to surgical needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Shoyujf Hospital, affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical School, and Children's Hospital, affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical School, receiving better feedback.
In October last year, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing your hands with air: saving water is cool
Ordinary people washing their hands is rushing with water, rubbing soap and extruding hand wash fluids to the best of them, while Li Keqiang et al. invented a set of "Air Handwashing Devices".
As long as we stand on the device's washstand, our weight can compress the air.
"It's like a flashlight.
The compressed air forms fluids at the water vortex and is combined with water.
So we can clean our hands!"
Colorful reactions and bacterial residue experiments proved that the effect of handwashing through this method is the same as ordinary handwashing methods.
This device only depends on our own gravity as a driver, can ensure the level of cleanliness and save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy saving and environmental protection.
Last year, during the Second Global Major Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold prize.
Please arrange for the recharge as soon as possible, thx
Please cancel the order and return cash, do not add points, no longer use #PRS_ORG#!
Bone and spicy cakes are not suitable for kids to eat.
If so, please order as soon as possible.
For a while, thank you.
He told me to tell you where he was #PRS_ORG#
I'm not waiting to cancel the order.
I bought my #PRS_ORG#, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can I change it?
Or cancel orders
Okay, it's in trouble.
I think it makes sense to have a certificate of first aid.
This is one of the skills certificates that I feel important in addition to my driver's license!
Popularity: First aid measures are actually emergency relief at the time of a sudden incident, i.e. rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that the ambulance came for a while after the accident, and this time is the most critical.
This is the time when first aid is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, brain spilling blood and breathing abruptly, then our life window is only four minutes, gold for four minutes!
So the people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls, we can save him through professional knowledge instead of standing there stupidly and unable to do anything, this feeling of helplessness is so terrifying.
"In China, our official data shows that three million people die unexpectedly every year, the most dangerous being cardiac arrest."
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
780% of casino hotels in Las Vegas can be saved, and Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%.
That's what the first reaction founder Lu Lloy said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, you do not have any effect in choking people.
It is necessary to make artificial breathing and pressurization of the chest before it is possible to save people.
I found that very few of us now have this consciousness to learn first aid, but when things happen it's not too late, so we still call on everyone to learn this skill and let us react in a timely manner in the face of sudden situations.
It may also save a person's life!
The first aid certificate can be registered in your local Red Cross Training Center, and I am registered at the Red Cross Training Centre in Zhuhai. Students have also benefits.
PS: The last figure is to record the goals he was going to accomplish before 25 years of age, adding a first aid certificate to the target list is also a few months ago, but it has indeed been done!
Then to go to the examination of other certificates that want to test, plan to go to a diving certificate, before in the small red book saw another diving first aid certificate, exam this certificate seems to have had a first aid certificate to be able to check, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!
I ordered ##Number#
One of the 13-dollar shrimp dumplings!
I haven't tried it.
How does #NAME# not understand?
Is it worth $13?
Yesterday the #PRS_ORG# leaked meals, this time a shrimp dumpling for me!
Because it is clear that when I entered the code before seeing it was effective.
First of all, I personally believe that the Four Seas is a full-scale crap, in various senses.
But if you say that this movie is not a bright spot, it's not at least a good song selection.
There are many kinds of rotten pieces that make you sleep well in the cinema as one, which makes you look at after being outraged is also one, "The Four Seas" for the audience is like a monkey on Emeishan, it can light up your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience, Han's cold is truly a talent.
The most painful thing about this film is that it's as if it was a creature in Kecken's novel, difficult to name, and flawed as if it were the windcoat of Little Marco.
Even after you look at it, you'll doubt if there is a metaphor implicit in the director here, but when you think about it carefully and find it really shit.
Let me simply say some of the plots that I find difficult to understand.
The male master's residence should be a small island in the south, and his grandmother depended on him.
Her grandmother had a desire to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for a grandma in her neighborhood to drive a small van to send her north-east to see the snow.
Older people are sitting in a van to see snow from south to north-east?
He and his father were very reassuring about this.
Then the old man didn't come down.
How did his brother's wife get a business license when he opened the hotel on an abandoned boat?
Why can the island's Flyer Car Party mingle easily and loosely seal a mountain road?
Then the truck that sent steel in the middle of the road stops at the side of the road, and no truck drivers can find it around.
This feeling is too obvious.
Why does a small mixed-vehicle party that is not valid and suspects of illegality become a co-police officer?
Why not call the police in the face of high-interest loans, the police in the film also specifically asked if there is a problem?
A grown-up knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door with a card in the hotel, then forcibly arranges to find no owner of the hotel, sitting outside the room and sleeping.
This inexplicable plot is rife throughout the film, and it hurts me when I remember them because they're too frustrating.
In addition to the plot, worse is the main theme of the movie, or that the film has no main theme at all, is an abominable semen.
At the beginning of the film you will think that he wants to make a comedy, after more than 20 minutes you guess it may be a motivational film, when you look at half as you feel it can be a drama film that is intended to reflect the small town's young people's difficult survival, after watching you are rooted and do not know what you really saw, followed by deep doubt about yourself, over the years why should run to the cinema to appreciate the innocence.
For most people, in fact, are very familiar with the scheduling of various films, such as if you want to shoot a motorcycle driver, then motivation + comedy and tell the audience how a gifted caterpillar is going to succeed step by step.
If you want to make a love film, then you honestly talk about the grievances between young and service siblings of small towns who like to ride motorcycles.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least your plot can't appear contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle in Yin's acting role was just burned and then singing), he could not go to open some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't see.
As for the women's boss, it is clear that they are not mentally weak and can behave in some ways like a 5-year-old child, I do not know whether this is the reason for acting or the demand of the director.
Another thing I really don't want to understand, why is Han Quinn as a racing driver so passionate about adding crash plots in his own films?
Such a film is arranged in the Spring Festival season, is it intended to add blockage to the audience?

Inspection of well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well brick module equipment introduction:
Zhengzhou Yixin is the domestic concrete inspection of well module brick machine equipment, check well building machinery, well wall body module mechanical professional manufacturers, from semi-automatic to fully automated production line.
Through many years of practice and development, we now have too hard quality, mainly producing hydraulic, mobile, fully automated inspection well series equipment and supporting devices.
Inspecting the production and processing equipment of well concrete module Zhengzhou well wall brick module assembly site:
Check the characteristics and advantages of well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment:
It is widely used in new building materials for municipal underground constructions such as coal, heat, water, electricity and gas.
For example: drainage, water storage facilities for various types of inspection wells, rainwater mouths, trenches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build and check wells is that the upper or lower parts of the module are concave slot structures, combined with a chain lock.
The scission resistance of the well wall body is far superior to the construction form of flat friction carving.
The module is a medium- and space structure, combined with the construction of vertical hole piercing, cross-linking horizontal hole piercing, after the filling of the hole core, formed the current watered concrete mesh structure, which has played secondary reinforcement and waterproof role.
The module has a groove on the vertical and horizontal sides, which improves the overall strength of the structure accordingly.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells constructed using concrete checkhole modules are not easily collapsing, sinking, water leakage and other phenomena. The mechanical performance of the well wall module is stable, easy to operate, standard shape size.
Intelligent control of the concrete inspection well module, brick machine and equipment is equipped with data input, output unit one-click touch LCD display to monitor the entire process of mechanical operation, realizing the ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis ratios, density operation, security logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the well wall module uses single-cylinder hydraulic, conveyor, dual-cylinder hydraulic and conveying.
The independent hydraulic integration station avoids the impact of host vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system's operation.
Concrete inspection of well module brick machine and equipment cloth box in the mold box rises, storage box door closed, automatic conveyor board, all independently completed by hydraulic system, thus reducing mechanical wear and maintenance.
Concrete inspection of well module brick machine equipment using imported computers, appliances, sealing hydraulic parts, and the comprehensive performance of quasi-safe equipment is stable and reliable.
The mechanical stimulating platform of the well wall body module adopts the whole plate steel, and the surface line cuts the joint mold without welding point, so that the filler box is free to swing direction, fully reducing machinery wear.
In order to reduce the mold load, fill and double-in encrypted amplitudes, use an integrated, fully synchronized system of dimming and moulding so as to ensure that the resonance effect is achieved.
The mechanical vibration mechanism of the well wall module, computer automatic control of the amplitude according to the cost-effectiveness of the raw materials adjust the amplitude, no wear and brake, thus extending the service life, reducing costs.
Dual functions are automatically controlled and manually controlled by the well wall module.
Check the well molds:
Ixin brick machine to check the well with cement plate:

In Chongqing, the pilot of modern apprenticeship in China's middle school is an enterprise pro-employee - Xinhua Network
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the city's teaching committee that starting this year, my city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 middle-school schools, and students who have been trained at the same time are qualified as apprentices.
The Municipal Council of Education requires that the procedure for admission to and employment of enterprises in secondary schools be standardized, clarify the dual identity of students from secondary schools and prospective employees of enterprises. In accordance with the principle of two-way choice, apprentices, schools and enterprises shall sign a tripartite agreement; for apprentices who have reached 16 years of age but do not reach 18 years of age, it must be signed by an apprentice, guardian, school and enterprise four parties to determine the rights and interests of all parties as well as specific jobs, teaching content, and protection of interests etc.
The pilot schools are encouraged to use the modern apprenticeship form and jointly carry out pre-service training and retraining of enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
The pilot school needs to reform the talent training model.
The school enterprises jointly design the talent training program, together develop professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise teachers standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation programs.
The pilot to cultivate the school system as a pilot cycle, students in the enterprise internship time determined according to the professional talent training program, the top-level internship is usually six months.
In business practice, the enterprise class management model should be implemented, according to the characteristics of different professions, a teacher can bring 2-5 apprentices and form a learning group to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotational job.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has identified 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilots in three batches. Each pilot number is about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (students) are trained.
In accordance with the principle of first pilot implementation, gradually advancing from point to point, explore the establishment of a long-term effectiveness mechanism for joint enrolment, joint training and integration of parenting in schools and enterprises, effectively improve student job skills, improve student peer employment rate and quality of employment.

China Children's Center will host a series of events to make children "high technology" over "61" - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, May 20 (Yang Xiaoxi Zhoushan) Reporter from China Children's Center learned on the 20th day that from May 28 to June 1, before and after "61" children's Day, China Children's Center plans to host a series of activities such as child maker experience, children's visual arts festival, family and children's book Changi Carnival, so that children can spend "61" in the charm of cutting-edge technology.
It is understood that the activities organized by the China Children's Center during this year's "61" children's day include a future carnival for children, the first child visual arts festival, an event of "Book and Culinary Carnival", and a series of painting events.
Li Zhongming, deputy director of the China Children's Center, presented at the 2016 "Six-One" Children's Day Media Flushing Conference. The Future Learning Carnival for Kids is a key event in this year's Chinese Children's Center Celebration "Six-one".
The activity is aimed at integrating social innovation with the family's individual creativity in an organic way, through participation of children and families to experience various innovative educational activities, making innovations and practices a cultural gene for popular families, so that "hand-to-hand" becomes a new learning and lifestyle for the wider family.

South African doctor: Omykjong's propagation is strong, but most of it is mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the neocoronavirus Omykjong variant is milder than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of the Ommikron variant in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in Hoden Province, South Africa, reported that they are currently treating new crown patients with mild symptoms such as physical pain and coughing similar to influenza.
Dr. Unben Pillay, director of the organization, said he was looking at dozens of patients every day but no one had yet to be hospitalized.
"They are able to control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10-14 days of isolation," Pillay said.
He said this included elderly patients and those with health problems, who were more likely to become severely affected by coronavirus infections.
He said that compared to this, in the last wave of the Delta outbreak, he treated new crown patients with "difficult breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
Within two weeks after Southern Africa first reported the mutated strain of Ommikron, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it takes several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Infectious Diseases, only 30% of new crown patients who have been hospitalized in recent weeks are serious diseases, half of the previous outbreak's severity; average hospitalization time has been shortened from eight days to 2.8 days; just 3% of newly crown patients have died in recent years and 20% of early outbreak cases in South Africa.
William Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, cited data from the National Institute for Infectious Diseases and other reports: "At present, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said: "It's still early and we need to get late-stage data.
Normally, hospitalization and death took place late, and we were only two weeks into the outbreak."
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's leading new coronavirus strain, the case of Omikron is emerging in dozens of countries, including South Africa as the center of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the new cases found in Hautden province during the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests showed that OMKRON variants accounted for more than 90%.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes were sent out!

Education Review: What is the Reliance on to Save Kidnappers?
If the analogy of a famous public welfare advertising that "does not buy or sell without killing", then, in a good environment where there is no need for "abduction", group prevention and control, nationwide re-infection, make trafficking actions unprofitable, risky, costly, such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the information on child disappearances developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has been released urgently.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish the authoritative channels of publication of information on children's disappearance and timely recovery of abducted children.
Hearing that this app is called "Reunion", Dong feels warm.
The new technology means not only the name "literature" is full, but informationization is used properly, practical and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement is to find the abducted child and protect his or her personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishments, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
Priority should be given to the safety of victims before cases of trafficking are broached.
The matter is a priority, and under the urgent "search for help" purpose, such as "whether trafficking in children should be put to death at all times", can be postponed and discussed with caution; but it is not necessary to save abducted children.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, human traffickers tend to stay away from the scene as soon as they can.
As long as a minute is delayed, the child may be farther away from the parent step, and the difficulty of detecting cases increases by one point.
In this case, it is indeed pragmatic action to come up with an effective approach such as the "reunion" platform that can directly help detect cases and find children.
After all, "smuggling" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire rule of law system.
Combating crime, safeguarding children's and parental rights, from the improvement of legislation to guarantees of justice, as well as strict law enforcement, does not need to carry out "child care and weakness" care.
In addition, prevention of child trafficking can be done better from the family to society.
For example, in a common case, a three-person family rested at the train station and their parents slept so they woke up to discover that children were gone.
One can't expect a two-year-old to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
The rotational rest of the parents, or placing their children under secure protection, are the minimum means to prevent child abduction.
From the other side of the police's fight against trafficking in children, one party to buy abducted children should also be monitored and punished.
Individual wrongdoing is often just a loop in the long chain.
According to the Criminal Code of our country, the legal starting point for the crime of trafficking in children is five years; especially serious circumstances can be brought to death and property confiscated.
The high point of initiation and the highest sentence, under the large trend of "light punishment", the crime of trafficking in children is clearly a punishable offense.
There are still a lot of trafficked cases every year.
It can be seen that some people's ideas of child rearing are backward, and the legal awareness is slim.
The rule-of-law education for this part of the population should be followed in parallel.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely on strict official law enforcement alone.
If the "market" of abduction is widespread, the traffickers are willing to purify themselves, constantly innovating methods of trafficking, and form a situation of "fighting law" with law enforcement officers, the act of kidnapping will inevitably fall into an inefficient state.
Therefore, breaking the concept of backwardness and popularizing legal common sense also help to root out trafficking and buying children's crimes.
Yang Haodong preached the spirit of the party's 19th Central Plenary and Provincial Party Congress at Ma Barongshan

The International Association of Olive Oils divides olive oil into two categories, five levels: Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil.
First-pressed olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruits after mechanical cold pressing, filtered and other treatment to remove foreign substances.
Depending on the difference in acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin: The highest-ranking olive oil of the highest quality is pure natural products.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant vegetable fragrance, the acidity of not more than 1%.
Fine Virgin: The acidity is slightly higher, but not more than 2%, the taste is pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin: The taste and flavor are still available, with no more than 3.3% acidity.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after refining primary olive oil with a acidity of more than 3.3% or becomes "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain percentage of primary olive oil in order to reconcile the taste and color, its acidity is below 1.5%, it is transparently pale yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: olive oil extracted and refined through the dissolution method.
You should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
If you know, olive fruit is like grapes that make wine, olive fruits from different production areas and different varieties of olive fruit will produce different standard olive oil.
The best place to grow oil olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable climatic conditions such as soil and temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation required for olive oil growth.
With the exception of the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only be sporadicly grown in viable areas.
The main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon and so on.
The month of harvesting oil and olives:
Each year from March to June, it is the time for olive oil trees to bloom and ripen. The fruit begins to develop and mature in July to October, with the fruit transitioning from green to red, purple, and eventually turning black.
November to February is the harvest season of fruit (the freshness of olive oil is important oh).
Nutritional ingredients for olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, i.e. oleic acid and linoleic acid, filamentate, as well as vitamins A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most nutritious oil found so far.
The Democratic Summit is over, Biden says the fire of freedom will never be extinguished
The online summit for democracy, convened by U.S. President Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries around the world as well as civil society and private sector leaders, was closed on Friday (December 10).
Biden said in his closing remarks that the fire of freedom was burning in everyone's hearts and that authoritarian regimes would never be able to extinguish it.
He also said he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Taiwan's government representative, political commissioner Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy human rights activist Roo Kang Song, who is currently exiled in the UK, also spoke at the next day's summit.
Biden said: "We know how arduous the work before us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge because I said before, as this summit has shown, a democratic world is everywhere.
The authoritarian regime can never extinguish the microfire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires a common effort from the whole community.
"As leaders of the government, it is our responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the protections of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, be more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to pursue power naked before public interests."
The theme of the second day of the "Democratic Summit" was to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and fight power, as well as counter digital powerism and affirm democratic values.
This day coincides with the International Human Rights Day.
U.N. Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening speech on the same day that democracy faces challenges worldwide, especially emerging digital technologies.
"It's time to reaffirm common values and positions as well as democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing social compacts, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution."
Hong Kong's democratic human rights activist, Roo Kangatsu, delivered a speech to the summit through pre-recorded videos that reminded participants of their continued concern about the human rights situation in Chinese minorities such as Hong Kong and Uyghurs and Tibetans.
"The world has long accepted the rise of China, but there is no mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have to ensure that the renaissance of democracy is our top priority."
He also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
"Perhaps some of you are afraid to annoy Secretary-General Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you do not want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat (CCP) to our democratic values," he said.
That's why we failed.
That's why we have to change."
Tang Feng, a political member of Taiwan's Administrative Council at the round table discussion on "Fighting Digital Autocraticism and Affirming Democratic Value", released the State Statement through video. He stressed that Taiwan stands at the forefront of confrontation with authoritarianism and power.
He also shared his experience of how to fight the new outbreak through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"At a time when Taiwan's democratic side has faded, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of global opposition to authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the outbreak, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without having to seal a city and overcome false information without having to go down.
Just at the same time as the next day of the Democratic Summit, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries such as China and North Korea, which were identified as serious human rights violations, while imposing investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was identified as using surveillance technology to assist with human rights violations.

Hello, the squirrels from the restaurant are born.
You want to try tennis, but you are afraid that you can not stick to it, so you want to find a similar price training hand first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the level of friendship, if it can not be distinguished, then the normal situation will be more expensive than cheap clips friendly, such "introduction" is actually industrial garbage.
They are very low in strength, the ball is hit on the clip, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can not stand up, and it is difficult for high hands to navigate.
The logic and subtexts of their existence are - tennis is so difficult to know that you will not learn, also know that you do not have to buy expensive, make a cheap product confusing you, you play twice, won't play again, so this clip is cheap, you don't hurt.
When you really can tell the good or bad, it shows that you have progressed, and by the time I come again to buy expensive, I earn two dollars.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better slap, choose Prince or Dumbledore, these two brands are not famous enough, so good slaps can not be sold at the price, new 500, 600 is very good, second-hand 200 pieces, with thousands of yuan.
It is very friendly to the newbies, but after the novice stage chicken ribs, but most people, especially girls, can not pass the novice stage.

In fact, there is a lot of talk about the dressing and matching of women who are very fat in their bodies.
The dresses worn by a fat girl can't be too short or too long, the length is almost on their knees, just to cover where your thumbs are fat.
The skirt is too short to show obesity on the legs.
Too long will give people the feeling of being short and fat.
If you wear the top and bottom three sections, it looks like you naturally grow higher, that is, upstairs, skirts and long stockings with different colors, which will appear to produce a feeling of lengthening.
In fact, many dark-colored dresses are labeled by tiny fat girls and children (this author knows deeply), deep color is also a good way to hide your body fat, noble elegant black short skirts are also the choice of small fat girls.
Dressing in dark colors, especially black short skirts, will make you feel thinner.
If your legs are fat, don't wear socks and shoes too much attention.
The more popularized the better, the color should not be too bright.
To prevent people from paying attention to your legs and feet, you get a feeling of obesity.
For a slightly fat girl, you must tell the best tips for dressing and matching.
Little fat girl should not wear tight short skirts, and the clothing should not be too short or stuck in a dress, it will make people look very uncomfortable, if the legs are thick, to wear black long tumble stockings or grid socks (the kind of fine glove), choose textured soft print horn skirt, with a coarse coat, can well cover the lack of fat girl.
Of course, the little fat girl is also in charge of wearing short skirts.
The fat girl wears a short dress, and should choose the clothing that is consistent with the color of the short dress, which will make your fat body have an increase in height.
Short skirts with high heels shoes, can make your legs look longer, this is the summer's best match!
If you are fat, but the legs are thin MM, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous short dress.
Not only can you cover the large stomach, but also show your advantages.
A word short skirt will be very thin, more suitable for the fat girl, to choose a tighter dress, forming a level feeling will be more thin.
Simple single-white T-shirts with short skirts, fat MM can also try.
Little fat girls are also able to wear a sense of fashion.
As long as you can master the law of dressing and matching, small fat girls will also be a popular focus.
After there has been a change in the dressing and matching, we should also have more sports in life to get rid of the label of tiny fat girls on an early day.

Girls raise money for their sister when the arrow targets: "It's also good to think about skin and flesh injuries" - Xinhua Network
A girl standing in front of a large wooden board, written on the board with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan one arrow".
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl Ganjun's 'arrow target' to raise money for her sister" brushed the circle of friends.
Photos show that a girl in Wulin Square, Hangzhou, stood at the front of a large wooden board slightly higher than man, which wrote on the board "human flesh target, ten yuan one arrow", indicating that passers-by can use bow and arrow to shoot after payment.
This behavior sparked a heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the head of publicity in Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau's Downtown Branch confirmed to Xinjing News reporter that police confirmed the girl was raising funds for her sister before making such an excessive move, but this behavior is not worth promoting, after warning, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
The girl's street "arrow target" raises the accused admonition
In the picture, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board, which is written in black ink with "human and flesh target, ten yuan one arrow", she writes on another wooden board with its bank accounts and WeChat, Alipay account.
The image was disputed after the Internet.
Some netizens believe that this move is "the begging behavior of the eyeball", and many netizens have expressed sympathy for it.
"We found the situation when we patrolled around the square at about 10 a.m. on Tuesday, when there was already much crowd watching."
In an interview with local media, the civilian police at Skywater Police Station near the scene said that there were two girls in the booth who were about 20 years old and dressed as youthful.
Among them, the girl who is a "human flesh target" has been crying, asking the passer-by to play this game; the other girl on the side helped shout and say that her friend's sister had leukemia, and now urgently needs surgery.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the head of propaganda at the city's lower-city public security bureau in Hangzhou told Xinjing News reporter that the girl was named Ji Jiali and raised funds for her sister Ji Jia Yan.
But because the treatment still requires more than 300,000 fees, this behavior is done when you can't think of a good way to raise money.
He said that during the whole process, two girls one was a target, one responsible for lowering hands, but did not participate in it, there were no people shooting arrows throughout the entire process, only someone surrounded and took photos sent to Weibo.
Afterward the police were verified by the security department, and the use of bows and arrows is not under control.
The head of state said that "does not advocate this kind of eye-catching fundraising."
After warnings from the police station, she has left the police station.

What's the biggest fire in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think that only Olympic athletes can win the prize?
In the previous time, there was an article "Swiftly Watch!Project Managers can impact gold medals Olympic Games" which is very fireful, in which it refers to project managers in many projects, absolutely can be first and no one can match: moving bricks, traveling, staying up late is the daily routine of project managers, saving fire, back pot, apology even less.
An article that seems to be joking and amusing, but also reveals the daily bitterness of project managers, behind it is the strength of the current project management work.
People who work in project management are also gradually opting to get themselves out of the dilemma at work through some actions.
From the annual increase in the number of PMP (International Certified Project Management Professional Qualifications) enrolled, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management skills by learning.
According to the China Project Management 20 Years Development Report (1999-2019), as of September 2019, there were nearly 600,000 nationwide PMP(r) enrolments, about 420,000 people through PMP(r) certification, and about 300,000 effective licensees, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP(r) certified worldwide.
The number of PMP holders has increased year after year, indicating that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer desirable to do things by simply replicating past "old experience", and the rapidly changing working environment allows us to know a path to learn from standing on the shoulders of science giants.
However, can a PMP test ensure that the project management work is smooth?
Many project management beginners say that by studying relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, it is possible to systematically master the relevant knowledge points of the ten areas and the five process groups of project management, but really doing project management work is still a mist.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following questions: Project management is not recognized, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, and do not know how to practice; lack of systemic project management process system support, can not land in work, project forecasts are not allowed, poor control sensitivity, project repeatedly dragging; members' division of labor is unclear, "old oil bar" in the team does not know how to cope.
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management has helped many outstanding enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other research and development key talents, and received the "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" such honorary title in Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting with an online course.
The R&D Project Manager Training Course is an online fragmented learning method that combines the actual combat cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and take the advanced path of their own project management.
It is also an opportunity to make enterprises use lower costs and less investment, promote the development process of project managers, and bring efficient business results.
To say no, we can first see how other participants evaluate this course: This course is not only by the team of experts from Zhongtianhuaxia (formerly Huawei R&D management team), combined with international advanced project management methodology and a number of well-known enterprises' real business scenarios, to provide an in-depth professional explanation of the content of the course.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms to help participants translate the learning content into specific work after class.

If overdue, the overdue records will be recorded in personal credit reports, which may have a negative impact on future economic life such as buying cars and buying houses.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, it is also necessary to select formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether relevant institutions have operating qualifications.

Vietnam People's News Network - Gulf Cooperation Council to Address Common Challenge
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's station includes Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It's worth noting that this is the first time Crown Prince Mohammed has visited Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt broke diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations while maintaining close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the inner unity of the HCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries blocked the land, sea and air route to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward "unity and stability" by U.S.-Kuwaitese mediation.
Saudi Arabia reopens its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab States resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar from the demands that must be united for the interests of each country and regional stability, aimed at addressing common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between two Gulf neighbours.
The 725-kilometer route linking the two countries will facilitate both citizens' travel and integration of supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, with two companies signing 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with Iran's nuclear agreement with major powers around the world to salvage the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - an agreement condemned by the Gulf Arab States for their perceived inability to resolve the missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf states have always seen Iran as a long-term "competitor" and viewed Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed not to solve Iran's missile problem and not to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia has made direct negotiations with Iran in the context of the failure of major powers to meet the aspirations of Gulf countries.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows economic growth in Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming summit of the HCC will be the first since the dispute between some member states and Qatar has ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess diplomatic results that have contributed to facilitating the restoration of the unity of the HCC, while offering measures to enable its member states to cooperate fully in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is said that the new mountain super-run exhaust sound is the largest!
This time our team brought this car to everyone, is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship super-run, Murcielago's replacement model - Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the horse is nearly two million dollars, more than 10 thousand road tax coins a year, four wheels drive, why call the LP700?
With 700 horses, can you imagine how fast?
That's not known, the data says that 0-100km/h acceleration takes only 2.9 seconds, which is probably the Xiaobian Myvi will be to 30km/h when people are to 100km/h, well.
The low body, the brazen scissors door, the huge air intake all around the body and the glass's next unsurpassed 6.5 v12 engine perfectly interpreted Lamborghini's style.
There is no need to say too much about the description of the car, Google itself just a moment, small compilations some explanations that Google does not necessarily give!
It's too high-profile to go where everyone is watching, very uncomfortable!
1km oil money is about RM1 (car owners don't care at all)
The position to get up and down the car should be practiced, otherwise it will be a bit embarrassing (because you can't climb out of the cabin and then stick halfway)
The engine is too loud to be deaf after leaving the car.
The body is too large, stopping in the ordinary parking space will be very narrow, afraid to knock at the door of the next car!
A little loneliness, because there are no opponents on the road (the editor himself said, not related to the owner, haha)
Don't mistake everyone, this video super run is not going to be sold, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot video for your car love, welcome contact us!
More information about the car you don't know, just in The Car Guide / People's Motorist
It's a 10 million-dollar car accident!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that their friends know that Chiron is one of the world's most expensive supercars, while Porsche 911 has a million-dollar price!
That day, foreign countries just in a few minutes hit the million sports car 911 and millions of super-running Chiron!
Look at the results, it makes sense!
Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate with the frequency - Xinhua Network
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of teaching concepts and value pursuits formed by a university in the development process, which is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, the spirit of university is crucial for political, economic, cultural, technological, social development and even progress of a nation.
From the birth of the world's first university in a modern sense, universities have shouldered unique tasks that are different from other social organizations. For our university, it has arisen in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit is also deeply influenced by traditional culture and era changes, advocated the value concept of "Ming Tzui, Xiqi Jiping" and the patriotism of "the rising learning power".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly apparent, global educational competition, science and technology competition, and talent competition are increasing. Higher education as an important "supply side", its structural reforms are facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the General Program for Integrated Promotion of World-class Universities and First-Class Disciplines, while demonstrating our confidence and determination to move from high-level universities to higher-level powers, has also put forward a higher update on the university's development.
How to try to get into the world's popular category in a shorter time, and speed up the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still some gap.
In addition to a firm goal confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, universities should also fully take advantage of three advantages: first, after-generation advantages, through the continuous introduction of outstanding academic talent abroad, learning to draw on the advanced experience of world-class universities, achieve significant improvement in academic level and quality of study; second, cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to consolidate strength, shaping brand and improving image; third, institutional advantages, play the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthen target drivers, bring together consensus forces, optimize resource allocation, provide sustainable and solid guarantees for schools to accelerate their progress beyond the world's advanced level.
In particular, we must realize that it is impossible to build the world's first-class universities on one thousand side of schools, and each school has to demonstrate its individuality and characteristics while taking advantage.
The school features should be both common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique target positioning, traditional and resource endowment.
In the case of Zhejiang University, we pay attention to highlighting three aspects of training: one is to highlight the characteristics of innovation and entrepreneurial talent culture, build an integrated educational environment that integrates teaching and school enterprises, forming a chain-wide entrepreneurship education ecosystem; second is to highlight the characteristics of cross-disciplinary gathering, promote optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for cross-disciplinary processes, actively cultivate cross-cutting emerging disciplines and iconic cross-cutting outcomes; third is to highlight the features of the management system and social services, carry out deep international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of the PanZHEA Industrial Research and Development Cooperation System.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and allow the spirit of the university to resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the common values of "innovation", "workmanship, teaching, discernment, solidity" and "Haina River, Initiating Goods, People Who Have Been Started, Tree My State" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang.
This is an important guarantee that the school adheres to the correct direction of schooling, constantly accumulates a high level of culture and condensate spiritual forces.
Among them, the "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, reflecting the guise of "the talents of heaven for me", is manifested as drawing on the high-quality concept of teaching students in world famous schools; "Initiative Goodness" emphasizes the spirit of true goodness, refers to the university's pursuit of truth while also receiving the pawning of virtue and personality; "The people who have opened things" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes both new research and knowledge, and scientific research innovations, but also demonstrates reforms and development.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is exactly where the soul of Zhejiang University has been studying for 120 years.
"Hearing people listen to the silence, and seeing those who are clear is invisible."
China's universities should further build on the whole of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the juncture and historical mission of higher education in order to speed up construction as a world-class university.
At the same time, adhere to human and independent care and freedom, so that the spirit of universities and the spirit of times and nationalism stir each other, thus providing an inexhaustible impetus for achieving the richness of the country and revitalization of the nation and realization of the common ideal of mankind.

At the time of NFT fire, the crypto community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who lost jobs due to the outbreak began to earn steady income.
Axie Infinity is a game for pets based on blockchain technology, which brings together many kinds of games including NFT and is currently the highest transactional NFT project with more than $3 billion to date.
Token Terminal data shows that Axie Infinity Day earns more than $8.2 million, pushing King's Glory.
On August 6th, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily users have exceeded one million.
The heat of Axie Infinity conveys a new "palytoearn" mode to more people, through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character, in addition to being able to get fun from the game and economic benefits, can also participate in the management of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by game producers, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about the stock price of friends, my biggest touch is the choice of enterprises in the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry, first to choose an industry with large growth space, at least 100 billion more market size; secondly, to choose the future growth and good industry, consider the next 3-5 years for the industry to achieve the best growth status; finally, to choose industries with policy support.
How wide the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the development stage in the industry, whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competition pattern in the industry.
Take care of the right track!
The first thing in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
The tactic is "do the things right," that is, to do what's right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing", that is, do the right thing.
Strategy is to find direction, tactics are to land, there is space for strategic thinking on top of most tactical thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether it is continuous deepening in the current field or horizontal extension (strategic thinking); for example, improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve core and high-value customer retention rate (strategic thinking); above raising activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the right activities goals, such as increasing target customer engagement, activating high-value silencers, and accurately updating; on upgrading DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
When bitcoin was born 12 years ago, it had a few milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small country in Central America, designated bitcoin as the fiat currency for the first time to become a national or regional fiat currency.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares for the first time in eight years to launch the Bitcoin ETF and list it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliance bitcoin futures ETF to enter the U.S. capital market with a renewed expansion of cryptocurrency investment openness.
From the point of view of blockchain technology development, bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin carried out a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which increased the anonymity of bitcoin's network transactions and reduced the data burden in trading by changing the data structure of the block itself.

American-Asian groups complain about discrimination in admissions to three Ivy schools such as Yale - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Washington, May 23 (reporter Xu Shengmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education and Justice on Monday to protest three Ivy names schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College - discriminating against Asian applicants during admissions.
The Asian-American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The group's chairman Zhao Yubao said in a press release that the number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to U.S. universities has doubled over the past 10 years, but among these three U.S. schools, the proportion of Asian students is basically maintained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities "continued and systematically discriminated against Asian applicants" during the so-called "integrative considerations" admission process.
Zhao Yubao said that research by scholars such as Sanders in 2014 showed that among these three universities, the Asian-Americans received the lowest rate of admission from all ethnicities relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League colleges, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest percentage of Asian students enrolled, with Yale and Brown universities implementing de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants up to more than 20 years.
Zhao Yubao told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they expect the U.S. Department of Education and Justice to conduct an investigation after filing a complaint, and take steps to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions.
They also hope that the complained colleges will be able to take this issue seriously and change their policy of admission to Asian-Americans.
At present, the three colleges and universities that were complained of have not responded.
The Asian-American Education Alliance was founded in 2015 when it complained of admission discrimination at Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education was not admissible on procedural grounds.
In addition to U.S. Chinese-American groups, the complaints included American Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani-American educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the housing intermediary of a factory located in Yuyao Bing Town, Zhejiang, and after looking at the house on several occasions, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant.
In December of that same year, after consulting with the family of the owners of the house, Mr. Lu made a cash deposit of 200,000 yuan by bank transfer on the same day.
Lin was signed as a recipient in the "Factory Buying and Purchasing Bill" which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this house, this pledge is returned to the seller, if the seller does not want to sell this house, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, both parties agreed to enter into a contract for sale of the factory within one week."
However, the two parties subsequently failed to reach agreement on the terms of the main contracts such as the scope of the factory sale and payment method, resulting in a delay in signing the house sales contract.
Considering the failure of the parties to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, Lin returned $200,000 to Mr. Lu after a few days.
The house is not easy to look at, the gold deposit has been surrendered, and the room money is also ready, and it is necessary to sign a contract with "the door one foot", but the seller does not sell, which makes Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
In this regard, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
After hearing, the court held that the parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract and could not only be blamed on the accused, should reasonably be presumed that consultations were not carried out, so this case should not apply the penalty of fixed money.
After the first instance verdict, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance has upheld the original judgment.
[Lawyer reminds] In the course of the transaction, it is necessary to take due diligence into account.
When signing the contract, as a buyer, must do the necessary prudential care obligation, such as verifying information about the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied and other relevant information, and specify in the contract specific time and location for delivery, in order to avoid disputes between the parties when fulfilling the contract.
After the "Democratic Summit" on Friday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said Saturday (December 11) that the U.S. hosted the "Leader's Democracy Summit," which is "to delineate ideological lines, to instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, to act counter-democratically in the name of false democracy, to stir up divisions and confrontations and to divert domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on people, promoted 'democratic transformation', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and led the 'color revolution' with disastrous consequences."
"Democracy" has long become a weapon of mass destruction that the United States interferes with in other countries.
The summit was a move by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day conference took place in a video format, with 111 leaders from around the world invited to attend, including Taiwanese, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia slammed the U.S. on issues surrounding its own democracy, saying it was not eligible to host such a summit.
There are also voices of questioning at the international and domestic level, such as criticizing those invited to attend with authoritarian tendencies, such as leaders in the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, who suspect that the Biden government's real intention is not to organize this summit for democratic geopolitical purposes.
German Prime Minister Shultz, who just took office, also participated in the Video Democracy Summit.
China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday that "the disease of today's American democracy is evident, and the problems of monetary politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social rupture, racial contradictions, rich and poor divide are increasing." The United States Democracy is a capital-based "rich game".
U.S. President Biden said in a statement: "As leaders of the government, it is our responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the protections of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, be more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to pursue power naked before public interests."
He stressed that democracy is not foreseen: "We must constantly update it in every generation, which seems to me to be the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend as they face persistent and worrying challenges."
The U.S. side is committed to a one-year action, including an initiative worth $424.4 million, following this democratic summit in order to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete and public commitments to improve their democratic institutions before the 2022 Summit on Real Democracy.
Biden said, " Let all of us implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
Well, I'm afraid he sent the wrong address.
Yichang Restaurant (Five Taokou Store)
[Mint] Environment: In the middle of the clock [service bell] service: soon to eat "Gufamara pastry" My obligatory order Mara cake is too soft and delicious. Little friends who like desserts must try "East Jiangy Meteor Smelting Tofu Cooker" soup is very fresh, sophie is very tender...
The taste of meat is good service enthusiasm
For a long time it has not come to Yichang, the fruit harvest is still so good to drink and real material. The first fork-burning bag, which is the southern taste of soft flour I love!
The degree of dry and wet cooking is exactly the same, the weight is very high, signage tin paper chicken wings as always praised, soups are also good, mustard processing is comparable.
Awesome service and passionate meat
Yichang Old Store has also been a net red presence many years ago, the east single small building, wooden flooring.
The door will always wait a long time to eat the rice cooker, and the sand pot of rice cooker is cracked.
For several years, the rise of various small shops Guangdong cuisine has dissipated the flow of tourists.
It is rare to see that there are seats in the store, and the quality of the dishes is not said, as always good.
The taste of meat is great, the main food.
Yichang's out-of-the-box.
[Meat] Food: This time the dish was a little disappointed.
Three Cups of Chicken: A little more dish and a little less chicken.
The main tune of this taste is a bit biased, the bottom flavor is not enough, it highlights the sweetness, you can fill your head with sweets and various flavouring dishes.
What is a red card whiskey drink?
Everyone's hobby is different, someone likes the collection, someone likes food, of course some people like wine, red card whisky is one of the best-selling Scotch whisky in each country at present, and red card whisky has won the International Wine Competition Golden Award.
Each bottle of red card whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, will not spoil its alcohol flavor.
How do you drink red whiskey?
The small book is briefly introduced to everyone.
Red card whiskey drink:
It is made up of about 35 Scottish whiskies and has the characteristics of a strong aromatic and traditional Scotch whisky, with sweet and smoked flavors.
The entrance is freshly saturated alcohol, slightly with aromatic grass and a strong smell of smoked malt.
The wine can be consumed directly with ice or mixed with its favorite beverages.
Red-card whiskey entered the country, in order to adapt to the national taste, red-card whiskey + Cola or sparkling drinks such as snowballs or novelties became a lasting fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to the neutral and acidic taste, can visually bring people pleasure, add a drink, play the effect of rinsing wine flavor changes taste.
Red-card whiskey + sliced lemon + flange sugar (sugar can also be), the most authentic and traditional drink.
The authentic red horn has some acidic taste, adding sugar can neutralize the acidity of it, and lemons will bring fresh flavor to wine, of course, sweet acidity can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The above three are the best way to drink red-card whiskey, and you can try as a reference, hoping that the introduction of the syllable will help everyone.
Education Thinking: How the university exams can make "school bully" and "school crap" do their best - Xinhua Network
Three students from Lanzhou Transportation University wrote letters to the school leaders, reflecting confusion about the university exams, and proposed improving the difficulty of the examination, changing the test profile, so that the test truly reflects the student's actual level of demand.
Indeed, college exams have long been a "hot topic."
On the university campus, students from five lakes and four seas, the ability level varies, plus the degree of learning is different.
For groups with such a multiplicity of characteristics to evaluate, there are different feelings, and it is inevitable.
Of course, if the test subject type is single and the repetition rate is high, the topic is too simple, it will inevitably cause another very different feeling.
Students who don't need to work, may be able to meet the requirements of a pre-test centralized attack, if they want other ways, it is possible to achieve the effect of doing more.
In this way, there is a "school slag" that can not be invested in and even gained a high score; "school bulldog" usually never drops out of class, work, notes are good, exams have not been much higher than the "grotesque status quo".
In this way, it seems that the students of Lanzhou's college entrance examination reflect that the problems in university exams are not unreasonable and believe that this situation is not only a big presence in Lanzhou.
In this sense, I would like to praise these three students who wrote straight letters.
In fact, people who have attended the university are aware that it is not unusual to scramble for exams and think of various ways to "take" test questions from teachers, seek to define the scope of the examination, find a "focus coaching" phenomenon before the exam, even hold small copies in the exam, ask teachers to raise their noble hands after the exam.
In my opinion, as a teaching quality assessment guide, measuring the qualifiedness of a university exam or not is more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and scientific propositions based on this.
Entering the undergraduate stage of the university, specializations begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether to fully master a basic knowledge point in a discipline is the content of the university exams.
And undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory of discipline and basic common sense, from the point of knowledge, the space for change is not large, basically fixed.
As teachers say, "The basic knowledge of mathematics in colleges 20 years ago is still being studied and the focus is now."
But the knowledge point is basically unchanged, does not represent a single test type and repeated test topic.
In many universities, the exams will generally form a panel of questions, and then be integrated by senior discipline teachers to make test volumes, and the examination volume is also attended by all teachers who take charge of the section, so that you can overcome the duplication of tests to some extent.
However, to prepare a set of tests that meet the actual situation of teaching and learning, it is difficult to be normalized according to the overall situation of students studying, but also need to comprehensively master the teaching situation, fully analyze the student's degree of study, so that the test proposition can be difficult and dynamically grasped by the problem type, both to highlight basic knowledge research, and able to combine competency assessment, while innovative design.
Exams are the guiding rod of university education, and what kind of exams there will be, students will have a corresponding preparation program, which in the past will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the student's letter of recommendation, Lanzhou gave high priority to the university and has deployed a rectification program throughout the school.
It is required that each teaching unit organize the teachers to conduct research and final exams independently, develop test book propositions and related systems, while strengthening supervision and inspection of test book propositions and auditing links, meticulously assess scores, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
The problem of solving a single type of test, repetition of the topic and other issues from the mechanism is the university exams need to face the issue, of course, it needs to introduce corresponding system, but Kung Fu in everyday life, requires teachers to fully grasp the teaching situation, not only to eat the comprehensive teaching content, but also to eat the students' learning situation, two people will eat the complete reading, teach and study will be better connected, forming a good interaction, examination will be more realistic, so that "school bully" and "school junk" can do everything.

3,200 newborn babies in Saba have no reportable paper due to special anti-counterfeiting paper cuts
Shahba National Registration Bureau said that due to the use of light for special anti-counterfeiting paper inventory, it was impossible to issue birth papers to newborn babies since early October, and so far 3,200 people have accumulated affected.
However, Kerouaminos, director of the bureau, assured that all babies who had applied for birth paper were recorded in the system and would be replenished when anti-counterfeiting paper was shipped next week.
At the press conference, he explained a 10-month report on the issue of printing paper from Saba newspaper.
He said the issue arose two months ago, and Sarawak faced the same problem.
"One reason is that Chinese manufacturers who produce special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Saba newspaper is different from other regions, so it can not borrow inventory from other states.
Kerouaminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6th this month, and then it was handed over to the printing company on 8th.
"The bureau will send people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up goods and return to Shaba for the final stage of printing, with an estimated two more working days (December 20) that can be handed over to applicants."
"We will inform applicants to go to the local branches for paper receipts."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 newspaper papers so far this year.
From 7:00 till now
Isn't it soon?
I mean food.
I'm on the opposite side of #PRS_ORG#.

48-hour nuclear acid is negative, and a "buffer zone" has been set up by the State Council's U.S. anti-collision control mechanism to strengthen port city epidemic prevention and control - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Beijing Dec. 11 (reporter Dong Ruifeng, Gutiancheng) The State Department's UFO and control mechanism issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new influenza pneumonia epidemic in port cities recently, requiring that people who leave land border crossing cities (except those linked to Hong Kong and Macao ports) must hold a negative test for nuclear acid within 48 hours, and make at least one nuclear acid test after arriving at local border crossing cities.
According to the notification, the time limit for the above requirements is from the date of determining the scope and announcement of the city's port in each province and district municipality until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notification also suggested that a conditional port city can study setting an outbreak prevention and control buffer within its jurisdiction.
The relevant head of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy.
The implementation of the divisional differentiation management policy, from one anti-control spill line to two defense lines, it is expected to achieve a shift before the closing point, reduce the epidemic spill risk, and achieve the maximum effectiveness of outbreak prevention and control with minimal social impact and minimum social costs.
In recent times, many domestic clustering outbreaks have occurred in China, all of which are imported from overseas cities through ports.
The above notification pointed out that this exposed some local outbreak monitoring early warnings in a timely manner, closed-loop management of high-risk workers, periodic nucleic acid detection flows into the form, cold chain items are not killed at all, centralized isolation site management is not standardized, and epidemic emergency treatment is not scientifically accurate.
The notification requires that we focus on improving the port city epidemic prevention and control mechanism, improve the outbreak monitoring and early warning system, and implement border control measures in nine aspects. We will accelerate the improvement of the port city's short-board protection and control weaknesses, do not relax, scientifically accurate work to prevent and control, and weave a tightly sealed external defense input line.
The notification stresses that all port cities should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control work in tandem with people's livelihood security, publish and open a popular life safety hotline, regularly check the hidden dangers of basic living goods supply, prices and so on, and promptly resolve and actively respond to the outstanding issues reflected by the masses.
According to the notification, the port cities referred to in this report include open land, waterways, air ports of county (city, district, flag), city (land, state, alliance) and local municipality. The specific scope is determined and promptly announced by provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

20 years of bloodthirsty killing by the U.S. Army - Xinhua Net
(Video Source: Oil Pipes)
On December 11, a microdocumentary called the Killing Machine was of widespread concern.
The film tells about the United States launching the war in Afghanistan under the name of "counterterrorism", forcibly exporting American democracy through the war, 20 years of poor militarism, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and committing various crimes against humanity.
The misuse of drones to air attacks on civilian sites such as hospitals, schools and other places distorts human nature and sets up killing groups.
For 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military has set up a "black prison" to apply torture and physical humiliation to the "suspects".
One anti-human crime provoked more Afghans' hatred.
As the video says, the more counter-terrorism war in the U.S. is "the more and more fearful."
The war did not bring peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people; it brought only devastated countries and countless killings and destruction.
Putting the video together, let's uncover the truth about the bloodthirsty killing in the name of "counter-terrorism", stamping out the hypocrisy and false face of American democracy!
Inadvertently see the following article, from the point of view of business and preservation period to talk about why this customer logistics company in the tax-guarantee area is helping to cook, although the canning belongs to deep processing, does not belong to the scope of operation of the tax-guarantee logistics company, here may explain why customers want to do this?
I went to a lot of dairy powder manufacturers and contacted many dairy powder production lines.
In fact, bags are the same raw materials as milk powders that listen to them, and there is no difference.
So you will certainly ask: why is the shelf life of bags a year, and the shelf life of listening to clothes is two years or more?
Or ask again: Why is the price difference between listening to suitcases and bags so big?
In fact, many consumers from this point of departure, or the mother-class believes that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be a lot better.
In fact, as with raw materials, only everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who eat from this mentality after the reaction and say that the taste or taste of listening to clothing is different!
Now I'll talk to you first about the reason why listening to clothes is expensive, where is it?
Why are their raw materials the same price difference so big?
Because the majority of manufacturers in pricing take into account that if the bag is priced too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are very low, or that there is no profit, what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a big uptrend on the pricing of hearing suits to secure their margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers are pushing for listening rather than pouching.
And you want so many manufacturers to spend tens of billions or even hundreds of millions of dollars per year on advertising, what is this cost?
Everyone can think of it.
So, with the development of society, market promotion costs, such as: salespeople in shopping malls, display prices at shopping malls, product gift fees, advertising expenses, etc. are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, each manufacturer is constantly adding new products, and it is listening to clothing, its price is also constantly rising, in fact this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to get higher profits, and in fact the cost of their raw materials will not exceed $3 or $4.
Another part of the brand, in order to promote its own products, without any means, hooked up with the doctors of the hospital, and helped them to promote the product, from one listen to a profit of $30 to $80.
China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such methods of operation, in fact this practice is to pit consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder in the tank under the premise of a can at home, so it can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder does not have any impact on children.
There are also people should not think that the shelf life of listening to clothing is longer than bag, if after opening a package listen to the same helf life as bag, just say that bags will not be easy to save and can be susceptible to tide deterioration.
The food was late, the food was cold and dry and hard after it was cold. There was no way to eat at all.
And the soup juice was sprinkled out.
Immediately canceled, his #PRS_ORG# replenishment must have been cold.
I didn't get it!

If you do not refund, I will call the police.
More times with #PRS_ORG, this is the worst experience.
Absolutely unacceptable
Well, you can.
But also remind the restaurant and riders.
Avoiding the next time.
I'd like to know the exact meal time.
That time is constantly delayed.
I don't know when to wait.

Don't scare people off the starting line - Xinhua Net
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the explosion of successful school books.
Many of today's successful books have been promoted by the "best principles" - presuming or implying that you can do it, and then telling you what you need to do.
It's like to say that at once passed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
That's why these books have a common feature - either to do the best in a drum, or simply do nothing; 100 or 0; or you are on Mount Taytai, or you just stay there.
This "best principle" that anyone can see will admit to being "right and unsurpassed", but 99% of people will be frightened before the start line.
Because this theory advocates a path that "you have to remake people and make a big 180-degree shift." This is the fatal weakness of many.
For those who are conforming to the rules, obedient and refuse to change, you prefer to shout "You want to change" in his ear, it is undoubtedly a self-deception, an act against cows.
The vast majority of people will be timid in the face of the words "transition", wrapped up, difficult to resolve; or with a moment of impulse pain has made the determination of "transition" and bravely took the first step, but often not long prospects, persisting for a short time.
The sound of Mr. Masili's famous "Start from Tomorrow" is the most eloquent example of this "universal human nature."
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's ability to "look at the door."
Perhaps, the "good principle" is a way to make more ordinary people on the relatively successful path.
The core of the "sub-good principle" is to lower the threshold - it encourages a theory that if less than 100, only 1 will be done: because 1 will always be greater than 0; if you do not climb Taishan, just small sand dunes on your doorway also go, because it's always stronger than where they are.
In short, as long as you do something, it is always stronger than not.
Because the threshold has been significantly lowered, there is a greater chance that ordinary people can adhere to it, and as long as everything persists, the probability of success will increase.
Just following the successful path of "second good" principle, its journey is slightly longer.
In short, although the "best principle" is ostensibly a banner of success for all, it can ultimately be incentivized, actually still a small number; and the "second good principle" can effectively inspire more people to benefit as much as possible.
Will I need to reorder now?
Phones are not answered.
Continued delays
I haven't been sent yet.
Please, how long is it sent?
How can I contact?
Please cancel your order
I can't wait anymore, thank you.

I want to ask you how to contact the rider.
The first rider just told me that there should be another rider again.
The reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Xinin on December 11th (reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) reporter from the Agriculture and Rural Administration of Qinghai Province was informed that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserves of Kinghai Lake's naked carp resources increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared with the previous year, to 108.5 million tons, which is more than 40 times higher than in the early years of protection in 2002.
The nude carp of the Qinghai Lake, commonly known as "Huang Fish", is a unique and precious fish species in the Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the ecological chain of water-fish-birds in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, affected by factors such as a large number of man-made catches and the increasing degradation of the environment in the breeding waters of naked carps, the number of naked carps in Qinghai Lake declined sharply, and in 2002 there was only 2,592 tons of bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
In the "Red List of Chinese Species" in 2004, Chonghai Lake Naked Carps were listed as endangered species.
Since 2003, the province of Qinghai has banned any units, collectives and individuals from fishing naked carps in the main rivers and streams of Qinghai Lake and lake area. It also prohibited the sale of naked carps and their products.
At the same time, protection efforts have been continuously increased through artificial proliferation and discharge flow as well as clearing of Qinghai Lake's main rivers into the lake river path, and designing scientifically reasonable "fish crossing" channels. The amount of watershed resources in Qinghai Lake has increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department in Qinghai Province, said that as of now, qinghai lake naked carps have been implemented by artificial reproduction and distribution flow at nearly 180 million tails, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of raw carp resources in Qinghai lake.
The Qinghai Three Jiangyuan region is an important ecological barrier and water supply area for China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone that controls the spread of desertification to the east in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Yangtze River region and Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wildlife and preserve the biodiversity of Qinghai Highland, this year, Qinghai issued a ban on fishing notice in the priority waters of Changjiang, Yong River and Qinghai Lake, and built a comprehensive ban on fishing management system.

The restaurant gave me only one bag, to be packed in the bag, and the weather was cold.
Would you like to ask if the sale is in a bag?
We only saw a bag.
Want to know if we've leaked or someone else has taken it, thank you.
I haven't been sent for an hour yet.
I've just seen an article writing a fake, it's too long.
Let's give a little bit to the men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first leave on a day between the ages of 13 and 15, closing at about age 50.
After that, it will be more regular every month under the premise of physical health.
But it is not the norm to be able to accurately predict, about a week or so of public deficits, you need to prepare in advance, sometimes luck will turn over the car ( suddenly several days ahead).
The length of time, the amount of blood and the degree of pain varies by person, some people three days, some people a week; some people are less flowing, some people fall apart; some people have no reaction, some people hurt to take away ambulances, pain will change over time, before it does not represent a lifeless pain.
No control over the menstruation, bleeding for 24 hours within a few days starting and ending, can only be done by blood inhaling with sanitary towels or sanitary cotton bars to prevent flow into clothing chairs.
Pain is mainly due to the secretion of prostate glands, and fast eating Bloffin can effectively relieve pain in the month when the physiological period has not come before it begins.
Before the physiological period, due to uterine overcharging and prostate release too much, it is easy to pull the stomach.
If it is about the cycle, indiscriminately pulling the stomach, basically there will be menstruation within two days.
The sanitary towels should be replaced once for two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, remove sleep time, the worst case is that they are replaced six times a day, 7 days a month, which is 42 tablets, if there may be 50 tablets in advance preparation, not every month.
(Amend here, hygienic cotton strips do not need to be changed regularly, maybe five or six hours can be changed once, up to eight hours)
Hormones during the menstruation period may be more turbulent, and the ovulation period will also be unstable because of hormonal changes in the body, which is very bad, and the body makes a stunt for itself.
But the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control emotions is still high, and do not take excuses for emotional problems.
The flow is not just blood, which contains the lost uterine membrane.
After the end of the menstrual period, the uterine membrane is thinner and then slowly thicker, it can be understood that the uterus is a house, each month to build a house (the inner membrane becomes thick) ready to meet guests, guests did not come, all removed (monthly discharge) next month to build a new house.
The menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades to come, 24 hours of bloodshed every month, and there will be pain in the stomach and waist. Who would?
But man can be born because his mother came through the menstruation, which is to prepare you for the first time in this world to stay at a house of 10 months.
Many things before women were suppressed, society told women to brainwash is dirty, shameful, everyone thought it was, but the times have changed.
If someone feels nausea of menstruation, thinks that the woman's body prepares for life to be nauseous, should not speak out under the public court, girls and children stand up, do not think this again, never experienced, in this life will not experience, or know how poorly, don't so forgetfulness knows what it means to face their mother, how does it mean to want their own children?
Finally, the sisters try hygienic cotton bars, which is really useful.
Today is a winter solstice festival, and sending mistakes is more disappointing.
To order another meal for a kid.
I hope that the store should check out the product in all its busyness.
Is there any electricity leaked in the foot bath?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in health care, and today's U.S. small editor will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the improvement of people's health awareness, the foot bath is increasingly loved by consumers, and a large number of different grades of products are also emerging in the market, ranging from more than one hundred to thousands of yuan.
On the relevant data surface, compared with traditional home appliances, health care household appliances such as foot baths and other products have exploded, but there are no specific industry standards for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's too dangerous to pump your feet in the electricity-powered water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath to give his father a birthday gift, but when the father stabbed his feet, he felt naked and muddy.
Mr. Li initially thought that it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, did not expect to shut down the vibration function, and his father still felt numb in the foot.
Mr. Lee tried with an electric pen, and the electric pen was brightened, and Mr. Lee was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath is powered.
Later he contacted the merchants, and the attitude of the merchants was good, although Mr. Li still felt unhappy despite dropping his foot bathtub.
He found that this long-standing foot bath has no clear and detailed industry regulations at the highest temperature setting, which people apply to, what materials guarantee harmless.
But in general, the foot bathtub will not have a power supply problem, but it does not rule out that a few products are not strictly closed when leaving the factory.
Therefore, choose a discrete foot bath at the time of purchase.
The separation of water and electricity does not pose any security risks.
At the same time, you can take an electric pen test.
Opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Expo - Watching Nodes - Hunan Daily Network - Huasong Online
The Hunan Daily News of December 10 (All media reporter Zhang Shanwu Hu looks forward to correspondent Liu Xiaoling Photography Li Jian) This morning, the thirteenth Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Newly Adjusted Red Tea Promotion will be held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showing the tea industry, innovative tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the sprinting of hundreds of millions of tea industry goals.

If these foods are not hot, can they be canceled?
I don't want to, because there is no way to park below, he couldn't bring it up.
Metaphysics refers to problems that cannot be answered directly through perception by rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy designed to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the name "metaphysics" is derived from the word "the metaphysical way, and the submorphic means", which was translated by Metaphysic for Japanese people in Chihuahua (Meanwich era).
The metaphysical branches include ontology, natural theology and its extension issues.
Integrity is "to study which terms represent the real entity of existence, and which term only represents a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism means denying the existence of God.
Its theoretical foundation believes that all phenomena can be conceptually explained by natural reason, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Method naturalism refers to the method of studying the word God.
Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the essence of consciousness and their relationship with the body, especially the brain.
Two-way theory and one-way theory are the two main ideas that discuss "the relationship between the mind and the body."
Knowledge theory is a philosophical branch that explores the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline of systematic thinking and research into human moral life; here morality is defined as all norms of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
They are mainly divided into metaethics (to study the essence of ethical theory or criticism abstractly), normative ethics (to judge different moral views, and to provide a moral guide for correct or wrong behavior).
It examines the moral code of behavior that people should follow, applied ethics (the academic application of ethical theory to actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live, summarizing from observed styles).
It examines ethics not from a preconceived theory, but rather by investigating real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, which contributes to all ethical factors of this choice.
The history of ethics includes Greek Roman ethics and Medieval Christian ethics.
Part 1: The ethical thinking of humanism, represented by Valla and Montaigne et al.
Part Two: The Ethics of Religious Reform, represented by Calvin.
Part 3: Political ethics, represented by Machiavelli et al. and modern ethics (17th-18th century, British empirical ethics, representative of characters: Hume et al., 17th-18th century, continental rationalist ethics, representative of persons: Spinoza et al., 18th century, French enlightenment ethics, representative of people: Voltaire et al., 18th-19th century, German academy ethics, representative of personalities: Kant and Hegel et al., 18th-19th century, English utilitarian ethics, representative of persons: Bentham and Siquivik et al., 19th century, United Kingdom evolutionary ethics, representative of persons: Spencer and Hughesley et al., 19th century, New Comdean ethics in Germany, representative of persons: Li Keel et al., late 19th century, Neo Hegelian ethics, representative of persons: Thomas Hill Green et al.), Transitional ethics (non-rationalism ethics, representative of individuals: Kerkeguola, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche et al.).
Logology is a discipline that studies the "Principles and Standards of Effective Inference and Proof."
Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, traceability reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.

#NumBER# has been received, is food leaked
Sheeping ash (chae), the name ginger wave, born in the sheep's year and month, a sheep's ranch, suitable for them, is an ash of sheep, it is called "the uncle of sheep."
Due to the publication of works such as "foreign passwords" in the series, "Thailand foreign journalists", "India foreign journalists", "Japan foreign journalists", "Korean foreign journalists," there is a name for "suspicious quizzes" in the industry, and self-proclaimed "excellent with an honest nonsense."
"Black under the lamp," also known as "China's exotic record", "suspicious quizzes" sheep and cattle with a new work "Black under the lamp" bring you into deep insight into the bone marrow of Chinese nationalities, those legends that have been circulated to this day, how beautiful and moving love and hate singing behind?
The "travelling" Nan Xiaohu, Moonless again opened the journey of mystery to death, and their life is about to be revealed.
The "suspicious quirk" of the sheep's line is white with hair, and a million books of bestsellers are dedicated!
New works after the original Chinese Alien Recording, "Different Domain Password", the same author, the same protagonist, continue the unfinished story of Thai Alien Recording, Indian Alien Records!
Just like that, you'll need money for a melon chicken sauce.
You asked the restaurant to come in.
I just don't want to go downstairs to buy things, and will spend so much money to sell.
Ding Xiaolin: To my friends.
I would like to sincerely thank my friends for the humanitarian assistance they have provided over the long period of more than 30 years after our relatives' death, especially those that have not been interrupted so far since I personally sent a call for humanitarian assistance to foreign and domestic friends in early 1994.
The vast majority of the deceased's parents have now passed away, and the lonelies have grown up to work at home.
It's your eloquence to help our families who are suffering through the most difficult times.
The new crown epidemic is currently raging around the world, and most donors have retired annually.
Therefore, I sincerely ask you to suspend the humanitarian donation of our difficult family - Tiananmen's mother group - and this humanitarian relief campaign should have been painted a perfect line.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteousness will be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way and please friends to understand!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Industry Press: Let me take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the history of 32 years of humanitarian assistance carried out by the All-American Institute for Science (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, the All-American Institute for Self-Teaching and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations with frequent crossovers between project executives.

Salvation is often not delivered successfully to the hands of six or four difficult.
In 1994, according to the suggestion of Professor Ding, a special group was established by "Tian'anmen Mother" to integrate and distribute the recipient and headway aid.
In 1998, the MCDF established the "Sixty-four Orphan Education Fund", which was implemented eleven years later in 2009 and after graduating from college for all six or four orphanages, the MCDF subsequently established the "Sixty-four Ailing Elderly Special Needs Rescue Fund" and has been implementing so far.
Funding for these projects, mainly from campus and social contributions in the six-to-four year period, from individual generous contributions, and supported by the Brotherhood University Foundation for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, 31 years later, the Sixty-four Diasporas finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong that year in the name of Sixty-four.
During this period, Human Rights in China is also implementing their humanitarian assistance projects independently.
We understand that Ding's suspension of six or four donations is for donors to consider, and we are indeed some retired people who have not had enough income before retirement.
We will respect the decision of our clients to terminate this project within two years and restore it immediately if necessary.
Those who have been persistent in generosity for many years and risking the delivery of humanitarian aid, expressed their gratitude and respect.

Thank you for the rabbit's review, it was also said that rejecting old wind is not suitable for old wind. I didn't expect finished products to come out just too beautiful.
Thanks to Dandan's approval, your satisfaction will make us full of electricity continue forward and we will continue to refuel!
This photography studio is really great and highly recommended to all the small partners!
From reception, make-up, clothing, lighting, photography to late.
The make-up artist is especially delicate, will match your suits according to your style, and cosmetics are also the first line of big brands.
Not to mention the teacher of Tian Liang, photography is quite a professional.
The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and two kittens play with them.
We are working in Beijing, and the good film buildings in Beijing need to line up for half a year ahead of schedule. Our colleagues have been photographing them in Beijing, watching their films as if they were just so.
I've been looking for this studio, a place where the soul has an attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, it feels that this is also the short version of most people, photographer Ling Brothers will grab and record a natural wonderful moment.
Cosmetician, photographer, late design, and a good team.
We and all the people around us are disgusted by coming out.
The girlfriend's past has been recommended, and the girlfriend just looked at the bottom of the film is equally happy.
I hope that such a studio is not buried, more people find the ta, and shoot it belongs to their own style, rather than one-thousandth.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews of Jing Eagle and Qing Ling, both are very thoughtful and creative new people, we are creative studios, as long as customers like us to do all 200% of our efforts to complete, thank you for meeting.
The sweet and affectionate assistant, as well as the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, each of the team is super-nice. A wonderful shot, a difficult to forget experience, and the filmed effect is much better than I imagined.
Thank you Xiaoyu for your review. It's also a reason to know you from Hoo and Hart to Qinhuangdao. Trust in us is thousands of kilometers away. I am happy to know you have the opportunity to go back to Qinhuangdao next time.
How do I give money?
The re-delivery meal has been delivered.
No riders receive
Now the restaurant staff called me.
A small white programming that wants to share personal experiences.
If it is intended to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if there is no idea about this, it is best to continue to teach yourself well, after all, training will cost a lot of money and will take six months to study.
But if it is intended to get into the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who are self-control and weak.
If your own self-control is stronger, you can choose to study yourself, but it will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, to look at the faculty strength of this institution, if the teachers' power is not strong enough, this training institution has nothing to do with it, and certainly some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing to explore this training institution, it is best to explore the students from this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know what the agency really is, and the course of explaining is good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I do not know how to answer the question you asked, because there is no certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a great relationship with the individual's own situation.
For example, professionalism, age, language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will be related to the industry you are learning or wanting to engage in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or computer science has graduated, then if there is enough time I personally recommend self-study, this is the least efficient and costly, now many offline training institutions are really good, but one study costs high, two investment time more, basic need to concentrate training 3-6 months.
But if I say these things, self-study is very convenient, now a lot of learning resources on the network are free, or go to B station also has a lot of training resources, if you do not find resources, you can also contact me by profile, get free resources, or detailed advice.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can also pay a certain amount of study money and time costs, then it is recommended to go to training institutions to learn so that learning does not have to be very hard, the teacher's explanation is also detailed, there are problems and people who specifically answer, and in the field of studying planning or supervision help.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are incremental quotas, and after studying it is recommended to go to the company, so that the next job interview link can save a lot of things.
The above is some of my opinions, because I do not understand your situation, so only perhaps the introduction is not detailed, if you have other people who want to consult, please contact me at any time for communication and communication.
I said it was one o'clock and I saw everything in the app.
What's the name?
I haven't finished, what are you doing?
Personally, he undertakes various (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall furnace water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stovehead, oil and smoke machine, lamps, glass wiper, professional beauty sewing, home care service
Thank you to those who silently praised me, trying hard to fight for life. Life is tired but must continue
Life will not fail every person who strives, like to pay attention to me, thank those who silently praise me.
Life is like this, other people only look at the result, their own self-supporting process, face life, we have no choice but to be strong, it is to continue, there is no choice, the road can look back but can not go back...
Clothing is work, and also a duty, life is beautiful because of service, service is wonderful because of the heart.
Although we do the most dirty work, we will clean our customers in every corner with the most serious attitude, see customer satisfaction smile and raised thumb, all of the fatigue at that moment is worth it, pay a final return!
My daily work
- Your request, my service.
Careful service, cleanse your heart and keep it beautiful.
The details you care about, Fenggui's home affairs help you to do "clean" what I can and serve a loved one.
Powan's home is clean, tree housekeeping stands, services are in place and clean at home.
Interior and exterior cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp is gorgeous, but long time without cleaning will be bleak and lightless, only after cleaning can be overblown and brightened.
With the heart to do, we can succeed, with fineness to shape exquisite and beautiful stitches we are serious.
To give me the opportunity, you will certainly be satisfied with quality description of everything, because the profession deserves to be trusted, your recognition is my most encouraging!
Every industry in the present is not doing well!
But I always believe that as long as serious attitude, enough persistence, enough effort, I will be a bit better than others, at least always more than sitting complaining."
The count of the day is in the morning, and all the good things begin early in the morning. I hope you carry with you happiness, luck, health, as you want to start a new day, keep your whole day's good mood. Good morning
When you are a child, happiness is something that has happiness; when you grow up, happiness is a goal to achieve happiness; after maturity, it is found that happiness was originally a mindset and realized happiness.
To be the truest and most kind of self, walk by heart, no regrets in this life; a life's way, walk your own path; two treasures in life: good body, good mood, floating beautiful to live old!
At each stage of life, there will be different difficulties.
Many times it is not the ability to bind you, but the courage to actively face.
If you can't hide, it is better to face it openly.
The more you are afraid, the more you will be crushed by difficulties; if you find it difficult, the problem will finally be solved.
China-Saudi curators jointly held the first Saudi Biennale of Contemporary Art - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Riyadh on December 12 (reporter Wang Haizhou Hu Kong) Saudi Arabia's first biennale of contemporary art - the Dirije Biennale of Contemporary Art, officially opened to the public on December 11 in the JAX arts district of Dirije northwest of Riyadh, Saudi capital. The exhibition was attended by 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places.
The Biennale was co-organized by the Saudi Dirieu Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Yurens Contemporary Art Center in China, with Tian Feyu as Director of Art.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biannual exhibition is "touching stones across the river", metaphorizing the reform strategy taken during the socio-economic transition and also reflecting the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The Biennale covers nearly 12,000 square meters and stands across six interconnected buildings in six units: "Touching the Stone through the River", "Passover as an Experiment," "Front Thinking" "Going to the Public", "Beautiful New World" and "The Spirit of Art".
Among them, the number of works by 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total amount of this exhibition, including painting, installation and performing arts in many forms; 12 Chinese artists also have a high level of attention, some artists used recycled materials in novel ways to create, such as Xu Ice refactoring a classic mountain water painting with waste in "The Endless Picture of the Story Series Behind" (2014).
Barkley, CEO of the Dirije Biennale Foundation, said he hoped that this biennale would establish an international dialogue to give global audiences a chance to understand Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industries and creative communities and enhance interaction.
"The goal of the Biennale is dual, both to engage Saudi contemporary art in global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the Biennale, and opinion leaders from artists, curators and creative industries will discuss cross-cultural exchanges and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Integrated regulation of rural public welfare jobs management - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Kunming on December 12th (reporter Lin Baifeng) to continue to do good job support for the poverty-reduction population, consolidate and expand the results of the fight against poverty, Yunnan Province has recently introduced policies related to promoting rural revitalization of rural public welfare jobs management, helping to fully promote rural revitalization.
The relevant head of the Yunnan People's Societies Office introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed 448.3 million rural public welfare jobs for employment in difficult rural groups such as poverty-relief workers and plays an important role in helping the people out of poverty achieve increased employment income, consolidating the achievement of poverty reduction and effective upgrading of all public services capabilities in rural areas.
The new regulations were jointly issued by the Yunnan People's Association, Rural Revitalization, Finance and other seven departments, mainly to establish a unified standard on the target range of hiring people in rural public welfare positions at the grass-roots level, fund management, job development, job management.
In terms of job development settings, the new regulations clearly set out in accordance with the principles of "on-demand placement, positioning personnel, dynamic management, total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person's tenure, voluntary public and unified management".
Recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with such steps as announcements, declarations, audits, publicity, hiring, pre-service training and placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify specific responsibilities of the main development department of rural public welfare jobs, subsidies standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare jobs, provide that all rural public welfare job development departments should purchase an accident injury commercial insurance for people in rural public welfare positions; require relevant departments to regularly monitor the distribution of rural public welfare post subsidies.

Is it canceled?
Second, although the rightist has had a long time in history, but not long, so short because giving some sunshine will shine, drinking and opening water will sweat; it will be accompanied by a small amount of hope.
But the truth is, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive meaning of the right should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution by defining the standards of truth, developing the economy and improving science and technology, as well as promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights guarantees.
Third, in my case, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's claims, I care about his statements and respect the person Li Weidong; because he is serious, he is serious about China.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, and I think that the necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, damage to people's lives, political groups are mixed with a raft of sand.
Fourth, to change or improve China's attitude of patientness and responsibility for the national people, political speculators trying to get a shudder in the fire, this is not the right party, it is an asshole.
Let's talk to the left again.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of eras and political abandonment.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right words and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left does not create it, because what the left wants is precisely the bad thing that the Communist Party throws away!
V. Recently, I have seen some friends with anti-thieves while rebutting the left epilepsy, and I feel that it is not necessary.
Don't try to reason with the adultery and left epilepsy, they are a scent that is unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't think about allowing anti-thieves and leftists to confess.
I tell my friends this way: When the anti-thieves curse you with five hair, when the left insults your right dog, it is precisely proof that our middle road is correct!
Many young people also have ideals when they are old, but forget the ideal or pursue the ideal, but become paranoid.
And the ideal is gradually moving away, and even the dragon teen has become a vicious dragon.
To the left, I think that generally refers to restraint and freedom, China's innate genes from history and culture lead to Chinese overall should be left-wing.
The domestic right is free, pays attention to efficiency and development, the left strengthens supervision, pays more attention to fairness and security.
Now the overall social hope is to pay more attention to equity, while China and the United States are vying for a positive left-wing approach, which is expected to continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, the praise is over.
There's nothing to say, flowers are such a virtuous thing.
Over the past two years, Meiji's blockade and closure of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented dilemma, but also caused huge losses to "American Systems" enterprises.
The U.S.T. pressured China's chip industry, demanding that its own enterprises and related companies from the ally countries simultaneously blockade our country's chip industry, directly resulting in the global chip supplier orders and profits affected, resulting in lower R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, which has caused a shortage of chip supply chain across the globe.
Today, the "short core" has affected various major industries around the world, such as car companies shut down production and mobile phone prices, and almost all of the industries used for chips are deeply affected by it.
In order to master the "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' tech giants began to go on the path of "de-painting".
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control, drag the development of China's semiconductor industry, recent old American action is frequent, and also hosted the "chip summit"; it invited 64 giants to establish a semiconductor alliance and withdraw funds to support domestic US technology giants, for example, Mei Dynasty senior tech giant Intel in order to regain its dominance in the field of chips, spent $20 billion on building two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and opening up chip replacement business.
When most people think that Intel's move will cause a certain impact on TSMC, and it is very likely to take away the "job" of TSMC.
This is so certain because Intel, as the old-fashioned technology giant of Mei Dynasty, has been working for decades in the semiconductor field, and has a large number of talent and technical reserves, must be able to quickly rise in the short term, defeating TSMC electricity.
However, for this decision by Intel, TSMC founder Zhang's loyalty was disregarded.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang said that he was amazingly committed to investing in building a wafer factory.
Zhang loyalists are quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field, because Zhang loyalists continue to grieve about a pity with Intel over 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been Pearl in Meiqi's manufacturing industry, where he is at the top of the world.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been mastered by a handful of strongmen.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips from design, manufacturing to sealing were completed by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model has made some small enterprises overwhelmed, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face the huge cost of production line construction can only be expected.
At the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to have a phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984 Zhang told that there were companies specializing in chip design, he believed that since there was a special design, then it could be established a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang's vision of loyalty became a reality and TSMC electricity came into being.
Taizhou Electric has focused its main business on the single link of "wafer processing", and does not design, but only provides a proxy service for wafer manufacturing.
The TSMC electricity that was just founded at the time, is small in front of Intel's giant bulldozer.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang was looking for an investment in Intel, but at the time Intel heard that TSMC electricity is only a manufacturing link in the chip industry, apparently some self-esteemed, can not afford TSMC electricity, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC electricity.
Zhang also believed that Intel was not able to afford wafer process services at the time.
I didn't expect to see the giants of wafer manufacturing services in that year, but now it is also necessary to start working as wafer dealers.
Therefore, Zhang believes that Intel's entry into the wafer dealer is ironic.
Today, the market value of TSMC electricity has surpassed Intel.
Faced with the strong attack of TSMC electricity, Intel naturally dared to self-proclaim.
Today, TSMC has been sprinting toward a 3nm chip, while Intel still stays at the 14nm seven years ago.
It's not really easy to catch up.
I'm not waiting.

Look at some of the strange hot searches today.
What is normal public opinion?
Three hot searches were randomly selected: the rise of the second runner in February, the price increase of Good Li's friends, the events of Gwangalala, public opinion spread to form a wave peak, then [index decline] (smooth curve) eventually dissipated, if secondary public opinion will have a hump again.
They appear to be no different from the [model of evolution of public opinion] shown on the website.
What is an unusual public opinion?
The random selection of six hot searches in the same event showed [silent peak], [saw teeth], and [rupture cliff].
It is man-made heating, quickly rushing to the hot search list, attracting popular attention; [saw] - periodic heating, ensuring that the topic is listed in the hot search list; [cleft cliff) - collective evacuation. The hot search has completed its "function", received new tasks and rushed towards a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heatwave peak of one incident coincides with another event's wave valley, and the time is not bad in seconds, it must be a unified batch of water forces received the task to open a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black PR can be seen: dozens of hot searches at the same time on the list, which attracts attention, which is responsible for KUP, which leads to war, which shifts sights, what influences perception, which misleads judgment, which incites emotions, which holds up decisions, and who fine-tunes battles with a black account batches and sub nodes, almost taking into account all elements of public opinion dissemination and diffusion.
Communication is a science that throws aside all the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will be nowhere to hide.
Anyone who walks through will leave traces like these, and we dug them together.

For the first time, countries such as Mauritius have found cases of infection with Ommikron strains - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, Dec. 12
Mauritius reported for the first time on 10 cases of infection with two Ommikron strains in the country.
According to Mao Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpar, one of the infected people arrived in Mauritius on November 27 from South Africa; another was a native citizen of Mauritius who tested positive for nuclear acid on November 30 after contacting a person who had recently returned to South Africa.
After hospital isolation treatment, the results of both infected people's nuclear acid testing turned negative and has now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it had for the first time identified three cases of Ommikron strain infection.
All three of them were students who returned from abroad in the beginning of this month because they were all mild, not admitted to hospital treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of Ommikron strains, the government has continuously increased its anti-control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 arriving by plane are required to undergo a nuclear acid test at the airport at their own expense.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin to vaccinate children aged between five and 11 in the country.
Malawi's health minister, Kunbize Chipunda, said on 9 that three cases of Ommikron strain infections were first detected in the country.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing of 12 new crown positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and found three cases of infection.

Grand America 360 Integrated Apparel
Address: Happiness Home 12th Floor, No.156 Zhongcheng Road
At first it was a friend's introduction because of trust, so choose to look at my initial budget is 70,000 for basic renovation.
I came to the store and started a series of scams.
I went to the store for the first time and just showed them my home profile, they did not go to the field to measure the house, they could offer me that 1.35 million houses can be settled, probably show me their material and do not know what brand of materials they are.
Their second trick is that as soon as you go to the store, you will drag you into making a deposit (and once this money has been transferred, you can never get back unless you have enough experience with them in theoretical warfare).
When I hesitate to deposit money, they will invite their so-called managers to tell you how much of the benefits you can give us today.
This is a big pit, and I am an example of living being deceived, giving more than 10,000 gold at the time of brain impulse.
He offered me a lot of questions, including 70,000 water and electricity conversions, no doors and cabinet bathrooms, and these three are the cost of basic clothing.
Excluding these services is also higher than the fees of other companies.
I lost my trust in this company and let me sign a contract without saying anything at the outset.
When I was looking for them to pay back, they showed a very experienced look and there were dedicated small teams to deal with you.
Any bite or death in any case is a customer's problem, and they are completely irresponsible.
There are a lot of details about the various dumping responsibility, and don't want to say it all in tears, anyway, do not choose them, because my friends find their renovated house is also poor quality, and later you will pay various fees.
They are the original swindler decoration, now changed to great beauty, as if it were closed again and changed to other.
So don't choose this kind of remodeling company.
After all, you should look at these consultations hundreds of times when choosing them, because the decoration is not a small amount of money.

The sky is about 14th day, the rain of twins has welcomed a huge - Xinhua network.
Xinhua News Agency Tianjin on December 12 (reporter Zhou Runzhen) Astronomical Cop experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the twins' meteor shower in one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere will welcome a huge rain on December 14, and friends who like meteor shower can observe during the second half of the day.
On December 13, 2018, Anguo, a Beijing-based astronomer, photographed the twins' rain in Qinghai.
Most of the meteor showers are periodic comets, but Gemini's meteor showers are Fahrenheit No. 3200, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The twin meteor shower is also currently known as the second meteor shower not "bred" by comets.
Xu Lippeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and expert in Astronomy Cop, said that just like a big picture of He's Young, Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, "the release period" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is famous for its large and stable flow, together with the quaternary meteor showers and the meteor showers of Incense are known as three meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
One notable feature of the twin meteor shower is that the meteors are slower, rich in color, and there are also many fire meteors, which are suitable for both eyesight and astronomical photography beginners to shoot.
Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast in Tianjin City, photographed the twin meteor shower on December 13, 2020 in Tianjin Artichzhou.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's twin meteor shower will be expected to occur around 15:00 on December 14, with the ZHR (the number of meteors can be seen every hour when the radiation point is right above the top of the head under ideal observation conditions) being 150.
The double stellar rain recommends an index chart.
"Last year, the 'flowering' meteor showers of twins impressed people, but this year's meteor showers will be disturbed by moonlight and a slight discount.
On the 14th lunar calendar November 11, bright moonlight will cause interference with observation, but in the second half of the night the moon will fall down, at this time the radiation point of Gemini's plummeting rain will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe these hours behind the moon in the second half of the night, but pay attention to anti-cold and warming.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose an open area of high altitude, small light and northeast orientation in suburbs or villages, then patiently wait until the moon falls.
It should be noted that the flow of meteor showers in all directions is large, and it is not necessary to constantly look at the radiation point of meteor showers in meteor showers.
A friend who likes photography wants to shoot a magnificent "meteor shower big", it is best to choose the lens of wide angle and large aperture, using high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripods, spare batteries and shutter lines are also essential based on stability and sustainability considerations.
Xili Peng reminds me.
What is the difference between laser and traditional TVs in market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV that the head of the topic should refer to is LCD TV, and the difference between laser TV and LCD TV in market positioning, mainly there are two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the full market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is clearly more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product for the big screen.
At present, the majority of LCD TV sizes are more than 55 inches to 65 inches, while laser TVs are generally larger than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets the user's needs for large screen color.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TV shipments and sales worldwide has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of total TV sales in 80 inches and above.
According to Zhong Yi Kang's forecast, in 2020, laser TV market sales will grow by more than 140%, and continue to maintain high growth.
The reason for such a good performance in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye care.
Based on the principle of imaging based on laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly impact the eyeball, compared to the LCD television's backlight source, the imaging process is closer to the image process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation for the eyes is smaller.
144 sets of test data were obtained through the rigorous contrast testing of laser and LCD TVs by observing laser and LCD televisions under the same conditions.
Data confirms that laser TV does have strong eye care features, and even has a certain improvement in some aspects.
In the moment when vision health is increasingly valued, laser television not only attracts more and more users with eye care advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous investigation of the price of LCD TV, the current market selling laser TV prices are more than 10,000 yuan, with the upgrading of size and light sources, the price gradually climbed.
Why do laser TVs sell so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TVs and projections cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the laser TV's projection distance is shorter compared to traditional projector equipment, and it can achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, which requires little space, and small host.
In terms of brightness, large-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
Adding lower heat and less equipment loss, the TV service life is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with a number of cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition painting quality, artificial intelligence systems, bionic screens, which can bring more shocking audiovisual experience to users.
Not to talk about pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation, on painting quality and input output ratio, laser TV is not a video gamer's dish, want to balance the big screen and view insufficient environment, can try, all things are good or bad, after weighing their own judgment, afraid to listen to one word.
Simply put, the ultra-wide angle near-focus projector - laser TV, in order to close the curtains, had to use expensive ultra-wide angle lenses and reflectors, which does not correspond to the best design of optical.
In order to shield some ambient light, the use of a microstructure Figner curtain is expensive, and the price of 80 inch can basically switch to a 65 inch liquid crystal.
There is also a point, I especially hate the projector's reflection to the eyes good when selling point, please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes, you are diffusely reflected into the ceiling, the eyes cannot see, not to be more real LCD TV is also roaming "direct shooting", opening the television ceiling is not also illuminated?
And, if the projection curtain is not a diffuse reflection, it can't be like.
It is very difficult to ignore the hot spots (light spots) effect of high gain curtains, which reflect a large amount of light into the eyes at some angle.
The best quality shop in the visual aesthetic photography gallery has not yet been opened for some time.
Adding WeChat's appointment date, the younger sister sent me a choice of timetable and responded to the information more timely.
Before going to see the shooting works in the store, more are outdoor wedding dresses, very beautiful shots, and there is a lot of filming style involved.
After that day, I briefly exchanged my ideas with my sister, very patiently helped me to try two sets of style dresses which I tangled up and finally decided to start make-up - the photographer would put some props before shooting, will guide actions, and more refined on each detail.
But maybe because I didn't communicate specific shooting ideas with me, so it wasn't the style I wanted to shoot, but it should be a good look.
After taking a good shot, the photographer will help to select photos, communicate later style, and feel a very careful horn.
It takes about half a month to repair the film and wait for the effect.
The second time, the real-life premier meal event - most of the clothes in the whole field can choose a shot.
Finally, we chose a black dress and experienced different styles.
The entire filming process takes about 2 hours, makeup + photography, the photographer responsible for shooting is a younger brother after 95, it feels slightly or slightly green, hoping to give more recommendations after the customer's shot action guidance.
Featured Quality Store in the Visual and Fine Arts Photography Gallery
Look at the homepage, and see Queenie.
The first time to fill out the name phone and then choose clothing, wedding dress can be selected, change three or four sets of clothes is very patient, choice after makeup for a long time, service attitude, behind shooting will teach you how to mold, that is, it would take half a month, 3-4 days sent, feeling as if there was no difference with the original film.
The environment is good overall.
There are many optional clothing.
There are almost three make-up locations, and there is a studio in the middle.
The service is very warm and careful.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also be very serious about teaching you how to move.
Unsatisfactory, the photographer will also take the initiative to add pictures.
[Experience] Perhaps the shape of a little over, the original double eyelids were coated with three eyelids.
The eyebrow has also been shaved, and it is a bit embarrassing to not paint eyebrows on a daily basis.
The photo has been given for ten days, but the P figure is not quite satisfactory, and it feels that those with eyeslids are still obvious.
Because it is not clear what style to try two sets of results to pick or choose a black dress, the younger sister said that this set is compared with Hurburn's retro wind.
The hair stylist and the little sister of the makeup artist are super patient in helping me to get the effect is very satisfied.
After making a good makeup hair, I began to take pictures. The photographer all the time commanded me to position and the process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After the filming, he seriously chose four of his favorite films when refinement. The younger brother said that 15 pieces were finished with great satisfaction.
No reply has been given for 3 days... Because your system can't identify my credit card, I couldn't join the #PRS_ORG# Plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay.
I have to pay freight every time.
Can you waive my monthly fee before you investigate it?
Small umbrellas to buy insurance, is it?
The Little Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the point of view of setting conditions: According to the supervision regulations of insurance brokerage institutions (revised in 2015), becoming an insurance brokerage company must meet three key words: shareholders, sponsors have no significant illegal records for the last three years, a minimum limit of RMB 50 million can be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Supervisory Board.
These three are really very demanding, summing up is to have strength, through the approval of the national authority of the Banking Supervisory Board (the supervision of insurance companies and banks throughout the country), shareholders should have a good practice, as an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance, insurers don't have to ask too much about the formality of the small umbrella insurance, after all, there are these three thresholds, not any insurance company can achieve.
At this point, it's good and trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star serious disease insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest boarding and Tai Super Mary 5 heavy disease insurance, the claimants and insurers are both Thai life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not question its reliability.
From the point of view of payment mode: Internet platform products, due to the lower operating costs of business outlets and the cost of workers' salaries, so the average price ratio of Internet products is relatively high, and the method of payment is flexible, support monthly payments, reduce the fee pressure of insured people, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
Can be considered.
From the point of view of the professionalism of businessmen: this is especially important, because insurance is a very demanding industry, many Internet products customers can insure themselves, this will be a lot of misunderstandings, in health information and professions this group, non-insured practitioners often add their subjective consciousness when insurable, feel that they are healthy or fit, so it is easy to have many claims risks, there is a risk of being rejected.
I myself have made insurance phone sales in Tencent microinsurance (as with the small umbrella, as well as an Internet insurance brokerage platform) and told you very responsibly.
The insurance of the Internet is true, it is also based on spectrum, not based on people, there are no professional practitioners in the Internet channel, and there are many sales misdirections.
For example: $1 insurance premium of 6 million, buy insurance and send mobile phones, receive free coverage of 60,000 serious diseases, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid weightlessness, will not tell insurers, the first month is to be charged by normal fees, dozens to 200 range, many customers charge a fee for one or two years.
If you can spend one dollar, the insurance company will pay $6 million (the pie is dropped in the day).
Free to send mobile phones, it is only sent by the sticker number (such as 6666,8888) of such a special board number section, and if the winning text message is sent, they do not exchange themselves, and no one reminds them.
(This is another pit for the insurers) to receive 60,000 free insurance coverage, it is short-term, if only on this, there are no other commercial insurance, in case of serious illness, 60,000 can do what, can not solve the problem, and later life begins to be naked.
At present, the country is also severely cracking down on misinformation about Internet insurance sales.
So comprehensively, the platform is no problem, there are no problems with products, and there are problems with the professionalism and professional conduct of businessmen.
In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, some products are also better than Internet products.
I myself helped 59 Internet customers, insured products offline, and everyone saved $2000-3000 per year.
If you have any questions, please contact and communicate with me.
I: Mingya insurance broker, has three years of experience in enterprise management training, service to nearly thousand corporate users, cooperation with more than 100 insurance companies, before the insurance, I will start from customer needs, customize insurance products for customers, and put into insurance, do my best to win the best nuclear insurance results for customers, after insurance, make a security policy for customers.
Growing up with each customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer will help the boss!
According to the definition of insurance supervision department, Internet insurance is the insurance business that insurers can independently complete all insurance processes after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign, all steps can be done by the insurer independently.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance does not have a "rite sense" or even printable paper contracts, this does not affect the validity and legal effectiveness of e-book contracts.
This model is a bit similar to the usual wiring operation of "telephone sales", but this purchase insurance will also have a fatal problem, that is - follow-up services may not keep up with.
Insurance is usually a long-standing contract for decades, should we seriously consider when buying insurance, and this "intermediary" we choose is not an "insurance intermediary" that can be associated with us in the long term and will also provide services to us in many years?
How can I contact the food delivery commissioner?
It's three o'clock now.
That's not to give me compensation.
I'm going to knock on the door for delivery.
But the rider put it on the door, and then people left.
It's also wrong.
Your riders have already taken my out-of-the-box at #NumBER#, but still tell you to wait.

I'm going to buy, if I want another out-of-the-box.
What to do?
Where did your rider go?
Need to wait?
I'm going to give a bill.
Well, if you don't cancel it, I'll call the police.

You can add the bonus code back.
No problem, remember that there is no need to arrange a re-shipment, I have purchased another and do not want to waste
Thank you for helping.
From before to now, I have been opposed to any form of smearing and verbalizing, let alone accepting such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can embrace everything, but to eliminate this villain.
If we do not look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized practice to resist.
I've taken a non-response attitude since you started sending Facebook requests for friends and then posting funny posts, and before you tried to publish the so-called place of my home and father's name on social media.
Afterward, you have been more and more intensively tag me not only according to the frequency of six meals a day, but also in Facebook and your so-called friends continue to unscrupulously discuss some obscure, humiliating statements about me, appearance, body, well-bred, on which bed plant strawberries, whether or not to insert such messages.
How do you know I've received more comments from many friends about a photo of your Facebook friend account and sexually harassing ingredients.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't keep silent anymore.
After the news of my alarm was uploaded, you did not withdraw completely, but more and more brazen.
I don't care what your political background is, and no matter what status you are, we need gender respect in our society.
Yes, you can continue this amusing, obscurity, humiliation and abusive speech, you can also continue to say that you are just caring for me and paying attention, you can continue to think it's not harassment, you can even keep denying that is not your drawing or go on making all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't and cannot stop you.
I don't know you, nor do I want to know you, and my appearance and body no longer require you to comment on your head.
I don't even think that any girl would be willing to let others humiliate themselves so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, okay?
I said well, you wouldn't believe either.
I don't think any of the girls will be so bullied that they can say they are good.
In the workplace, in society, in politics or in the business world, only those who don't even have a basic character will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of man.
I cut out some of the messages for you to comment on.
Your own poster should no one impersonate you.
I can only say that you are a public enemy of civilization.
I'm going to laugh.

Nguyen Menzhong, Minister of Communications and Media, said that in 2021, despite the continued spread of the New Hungry Pneumonia epidemic, the number and operating income of digital technology enterprises in Vietnam remained at a growth rate of nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam was cultivated to focus on addressing the major challenges facing Vietnam, many digital products have gone out of the country, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has been upgraded.
Minister Nguyen Mensong called on digital technology enterprises to take responsibility for developing the national digital transformation platform, and it is the task of developing these countries' digital platforms to assume the national mission.
At the forum, heads of departments and national authorities, enterprises, organizations and individuals that are studying, developing, applying and transferring digital technologies shared the mobilization and pooling of all social resources to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, working together to promote the national digital transformation, economic recovery after the Zhu Hui epidemic and other breakthrough ideas and solutions.
In his speech at the forum, Prime Minister Van Ming stressed that digital transformation is a must-have path for the world and an objective need for development.
Digital transformation has become a global problem and digital transformation serves the people, so it is necessary to mobilize popular participation.
People and businesses are the core, subject, goal and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies are for the people and businesses.

There's no way to eat.
Are you sure it's freshly cooked food, not old?

I've already ordered an early order.
I said it was more than 7:00.
Why do we need to remake?
It's too frustrating.

Changjiang dry stream to achieve full coverage of water-green integrated service area - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Wuhan December 11th (reporter Wang Xian) Chongqing city of Fulling water green integrated service area was scheduled to be completed and put into operation on October 10th, which is the second water green integrated service area officially operated by the upper Yangtze River after signing up in Luzhou Water Green Integrated Service Area in Sichuan Province on August 8th.
At this point, the integrated water-green service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Zhu Zhihua, Deputy Director of the Jiang Shuttle Administration for Transport Minister, said that earlier, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces have completed and operated 10 water-green integrated service areas in the middle and downstream of the Yangtze River, which has been recognized by a large number of crew members to play an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the water-based green integrated service area is another milestone in the construction of Yangtze River Green Shipping, which has significantly improved the capacity for receiving and shipping contaminants from Yangtze River ships.
The integrated water-green service area is an important facility for the majority of ships and crews to provide a full range of production and life services, helping the majority of crews solve the problem of "hurried hope".
The construction of the two water-green integrated service areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, integrating life services, production services and government services as a whole, with green environmental protection as the theme, with ship repair and ship emergency rescue service as a feature, to achieve "one berth, multiple services" within the port, will make the crew working more efficiently and live more conveniently.
The U.S. three aircraft carriers are gathering around China, the most powerful weapons rarely visited Guam 2022-01-17 Multidimensional Pro-CPC media multidimensional coverage: latest news of Sino-US relations: the latest satellite images show that three US carriers are gathering around China; the U.S. media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal is rare to visit Guam, releasing important signals to American allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "The South China Sea Strategic Position Sensitization Platform", on January 9, a satellite discovered USS Carl Vinson's aircraft carrier near the Barabak Strait.
The Barabak Strait connects the South Sea and Su Luhai, which is a strategic hub on the first island chain in the West Pacific.
The platform expects the "Carl Vinson" to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of Carl Vinson aircraft carrier with F-35C fighter and CMV-22 "fish eagle" ship transport aircraft.
The U.S. military aircraft carrier, which is now navigating the Pacific Ocean, in addition to Carl Vinson, has a USS Abraham Lincoln launch from the United States on January 3.
Lincoln also used the F-35C carrier squadron for the first time, which was part of the U.S. Marine Corps's 314th Combatant Attack squadron.
In addition to these two aircraft carriers, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in Asia and the Pacific with USS Ronald Reagan powered by Japan's Yokozouga.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Champland Lake" missile cruiser and the "Stockdar" missile destroyer.
The most powerful weapons visited Guam on January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Position Sensitization Platform" released the latest satellite images showing that three US military aircraft carriers were gathering around China.
On January 17, 2022, the U.S. aircraft carrier CMV-22B flight route was assembled around China.
According to CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal visited Guam very rarely last weekend.
U.S. Nevada, a Ohio-class nuclear submarine with 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US Naval Base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
The U.S. three aircraft carriers have gathered the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam rarely, according to analysis, which is a signal to allies and enemies in an increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first time a U.S. ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The U.S. three aircraft carriers have gathered around China, and the most powerful weapons are rare to visit Guam - China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
It is depicted as China's Long Summer Island in the Nansha Islands.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit to Guam by Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada" reinforced cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating America's capabilities, flexibility, preparedness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called "Boomer Submarines".
The location of the 14 "resonant submarines" in the U.S. Navy fleet is usually strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made the "Ray Song Submarine" a "most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad", which includes launching well-launched ballistic missiles located on the U.S. mainland, and bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads such as B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta and a market capitalization evaporation of $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded "to face unprecedented competition."
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company whose revenue mainly comes from advertising, and today's money-making advertising company has its own channels of traffic.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and so on, no matter what functionality is positioned, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance," and many apps outsourced Meta ads are realized through Meta's advertising platform.
But the times have changed.
First, because of the changes in Apple's privacy policy, Meta has difficulty getting user data information again, affecting the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is friendly to users, and it will be clear if the user allows the App to get their own information, and most people's normal response is certainly not allowed.
Next, if Google hits another knife, it will have a bigger impact on Meta's revenue.
Secondly, China's factor in the previous revenue growth of Meta has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is not sure how high, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue each year comes from China, mainly from companies that contribute to the maritime business.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about 100 people, and there are several major agents on the mainland.
China's companies want to expand the overseas market, Meta is an overlooked advertising channel, and most of the burned money has been given to Meta.
Interestingly, the byte TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but in the first two years it made a lot of money from the byte.
Every domestic agent is helping the byte to go to Meta for advertising, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also good.
I didn't know about it recently, but certainly wouldn't be better than before.
The stage of large-scale money burning by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Third, the new flow channel is not expanding smoothly.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets look not just at income, but more importantly what the future expects.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg told "the metacosm."
The metacosm should indeed be one of the future directions, but its implementation cycle is relatively long, and this story should not have been enough in both three years to support Meta's market capitalization.
So the next two years should be a tough time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook now, with $100 billion to $200 billion in revenue each year. In fact, Facebook has a very strong sense of crisis and there is no good safe haven compared to other Internet businesses and high-tech companies.
Although his social software is now relatively high in daily life, it is also a mainstream social software such as Facebook, WhatsApp and so on, but face the rapid development of Tiktok, Facebook has no confidence.
And the imaginable concept of metacosm, in a short time there is absolutely no hope of success, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is again changing the name of the company and constantly searching for new circuits, but I think his race choice is wrong.
