Students singing the protagonists of the Zhejiang Academic Year - The results of the research make a big opening hole - Xinhua Network
Using air to wash your hands, assess the disease and accurately search for sources of smog Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year's conference in Zhejiang University, a series of breakthrough academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these results were students who covered the environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities and other major fields. Students started from a curious idea to create many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have been won at home internationally.
Biosensor: Your Family Medical Examiner
Zhang Dyong, a doctoral student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated on site a smartphone-side biosensor that is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to breathe a breath, and this instrument can first detect your health from the gas composition you exhale."
Zhang Xiaoming said that the sensor is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Intelligent wristbands that can detect health status on the market are generally detected by physical parameters such as temperature, pulse and other.
This biosensor uses graphene as a new material, its target is chemical elements, and its sharp "olfactory" allows it to reflect physical health more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgical Lights: The Doctor's High-Powered Eye
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention was awarded the silver medal at the 44th Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions in Switzerland.
Zhu Linjin, a master student of the College of Photoelectric Science and Engineering, Shinjuku Fly team opened new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lights, invented intelligent LED surgery shadowless lamps.
"Many early detection and removal of diseases are related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, when examining cancer early, if doctors can not see all tumor tissues in time, then the cancer cells will spread.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lanterns that enhance the difference between different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During surgery, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectra, color uniformity and non-figurative proportions at any time according to surgical needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Shoyujf Hospital, Zhejiang University Medical School and Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University.
In October last year, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing your hands with air: saving water and coolness
Ordinary people washing their hands is rushing with water, rubbing soap and extrusion of handwashing fluids, while Li Keqiang et al. invented a set of "Air Handwashing Devices".
As long as we stand on the device's washstand, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a flashlight.
The compressed air formed fluids at the water vortex, and the water was combined.
"So we can clean our hands!"
Colorful reactions and bacterial residue experiments proved that the effect of handwashing through this method is the same as ordinary handwashing methods.
This device only depends on our own gravity as a driver, can ensure the level of cleanliness and save 90% of water, the entire process is completely energy-free, energy saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the Second Global Major Challenge Summit, the invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold prize.
Please arrange the recharge as soon as possible, thx
Please cancel your order and return the cash, don't make points, no longer use #PRS_ORG#!
Bone and spicy jacuzzi are not suitable for kids to eat.
If so, please order as soon as possible
For a while, thank you.
He told me to tell you where he was.PRS_ORG
I'm not waiting to cancel the order.
I bought my #PRS_ORG, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can I change it?
Or cancel the order
Okay, it's in trouble.
I think it makes sense to have a certificate of first aid.
This is one of the skills certificates that I feel important in addition to my driver's license!
Popularity: first aid measures are actually emergency relief at the time of an emergency, that is, before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that the ambulance came after the accident in fact for a while, and this time is the most critical.
This time is when you need first-aid.
If I really have a heart attack, brain-bleeding, respiratory arrest, then the window of our life is only four minutes, golden four minutes!
So the people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls, we can save him through professional knowledge, rather than standing there stupidly and unable to do anything, the feeling of helplessness is so terrifying.
"In China, our official data shows that three million people die unexpectedly every year, the most dangerous being cardiac arrest."
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
At the casino hotels in Las Vegas, 780% can be saved, and Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%.
This is what the first reaction founder Lulu said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, you do not have any effect in choking people.
It is necessary to make artificial breathing and pressurization of the chest before it is possible to save people.
I found that very few of us now have this consciousness to learn first aid, but when things happen it's not too late, so we still call on everyone to learn this skill and let us react in a timely manner in the face of sudden situations.
Maybe they can save a person's life!
The first aid certificate can be registered in your local Red Cross Training Centre, and I am registered at the Red Cross Training Centre in Zhuhai. There are also offers for students.
PS: The last figure is to record the goals he was going to accomplish before 25 years old, adding a first-aid certificate to the target list is also a few months ago, but it's really done!
Then to check other willing to test certificates, plan to go to a diving certificate, before the small red book saw another diving first aid certificate, this test seems to have a first aid certificate in order to be able to visit, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!
I ordered ##Number#
One of the 13-dollar shrimp dumplings!
I haven't tried it.
How does #NAME# not understand?
One for $13?
Yesterday's #PRS_ORG# leaked meals, this time a shrimp dumpling for me!
Because it is clear that when I entered the code before seeing it was effective.
First of all, I personally believe that the Four Seas is a full-scale mess, in various senses.
But if you say that this movie is not a highlight or no, it's not at least a good song selection.
The rotten pieces are a variety of, so that you can sleep well in the cinema as one, and let you look at the afterward outraged also as one, "The Four Seas" for the audience is like an Emerging Monkey, it can light up your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience to this point, Han chill is truly gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it's as if it were a creature in the keg novel, difficult to name, and flawless as if it were a windcoat on little Marco.
Even after you look at it, you'll doubt if there are any metaphors implicit in the director here, but when you think about it carefully and find it really is a shit.
Let me just say some of the things I can't understand.
The man's residence should be a small island in the south, and his grandma depended on him.
Her grandmother had a desire to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for a grandma in her neighborhood to drive a minivan to send her north-east to see the snow.
Older people are sitting in a van to see snow from south to north-east?
He and his father were very reassuring about it.
Then the old man didn't come down.
How did the owner of his brother get a business license on an abandoned ship?
Why can the small chariot party on the island make it easy to seal a road?
Then the car that sent the steel in the middle of the road stops at the side of the road, and no truck drivers can find it around.
This sense of sensibility is too obvious.
Why does a small mixed-chariot party who is unsuspected and suspected of illegality become a police assistant?
Why not the police in the face of high-interest loans, the police in the film also specifically asked if there is a difficulty?
A grown-up knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door with a card in the hotel, then forcibly arranges to find no owner of the hotel, sitting outside the room and sleeping.
This inexplicable plot is rife throughout the film, and it hurts me as I remember them too much.
In addition to the plot, worse is the main theme of the film, or that this movie has no main theme at all, is a face-to-face suturing quirk.
At the beginning of the film you will think that he wants to make a comedy, more than 20 minutes after you guess it may be a motivational film, half when you see it can be a drama film intended to reflect the small town young people's uneasy survival, after watching you have rooted and do not know what you really saw, followed by deep doubt about yourself, over the years why to run to the cinema to appreciate the stool.
For most people, in fact, are very familiar with the scheduling of various films, for example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then motivation + comedy and tell the audience how a gifted caterpillar is going to succeed step by step.
If you want to make a love film, then you honestly talk about the grievances between young and service siblings in small towns who like to ride motorcycles.
If you want to reflect reality, then at the very least your plot can't come up with something that contradicts the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle in Yin's acting role was just burned and then singing), he could not go to open some unstoppable hole even Kennedy saw.
As for the fact that the female master is clearly not weak sage can behave in some ways like a 5-year-old child, I do not know whether this is the reason for acting or the requirements of the director.
Another thing I can't understand, why is Han Quinn as a motorsporter so keen to add crash plots in his own films?
Such a film is arranged in the Spring Festival, is it intended to add blockage to the audience?

Chongqing Middle School Pilot Modern Apprenticeship Entry is Enterprise Associates - Xinhua Network
Yesterday, the reporter from the City Council learned that starting this year, my city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 middle-school schools, students who are trained at the same time have an apprenticeship status, and after admissions will be presigned as a unit employee by the pilot enterprises.
The City Council requires that the procedures for admission to and employment of enterprises in secondary schools be standardized, clarify the dual identity of middle school students and associate employees of enterprises, according to the principle of two-way choice, apprentices, schools and enterprises to sign a tripartite agreement, for apprentices who have reached 16 years of age but do not reach 18 years old, must be signed by an apprentice, guardian, school and enterprise four parties to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific jobs, teaching content, equity and security of apprentices in their career.
The pilot schools are encouraged to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and jointly carry out enterprise pre-service training and retraining with cooperative enterprises.
The pilot school needs to reform the talent culture model.
School enterprises jointly design talent training programs, together develop professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise teachers standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation programmes.
The pilot to cultivate the school system as a pilot cycle, students in the enterprise internship time according to the professional talent training program determined, the top-level internship is generally 6 months.
In business practice, the enterprise grouping management model should be implemented, according to the different professional characteristics, a teacher can bring 2-5 apprentices, forming learning groups, ensuring that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotational job.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city in three batches identified 60 municipal middle-level modern apprenticeship pilots, each of which has a population of about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (students) were trained.
In accordance with the principle of first pilot re-introduction, gradually advancing from point to point, explore the establishment of joint enrolment, joint training and integration of parenting institutions long-term effectiveness mechanism, effectively improve student job skills, improve student peer employment rate and quality of employment.

South African doctor: Omykjong's propagation is strong, but many are mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the neocoronavirus Omykron variant causes a milder condition than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of the Ommikron variant in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in Hoden Province, South Africa, reported that they are currently treating new crown patients with milder symptoms such as physical pain and coughing similar to influenza.
Dr. Unben Pillay, director of the organization, said he was looking at dozens of patients every day but no one had to be hospitalized yet.
"They are able to control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10-14 days of isolation," Pillay said.
This includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who were more likely to be afflicted by coronavirus infections.
He said he treated new crown patients in the last wave of the Delta outbreak "with difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days."
Within two weeks after the first report on the mutated strain of Ommikron in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it takes several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of new crown patients hospitalized in recent weeks are serious diseases, half of the previous outbreak's severity; average hospitalization time has been shortened from eight days to 2.8 days; just 3% of newly crown patients have died in recent years, compared with 20% of early outbreak cases in South Africa.
William Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, cited data from the National Institute for Infectious Diseases and other reports: "Currently, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease."
He added: "It's still early and we need to get late-stage data.
Normally, hospitalization and death took place late, and we had only two weeks to get into this wave of outbreaks."
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the world's leading new coronavirus strain, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the new cases found in Hautden province in the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests showed that OMKRON variants accounted for more than 90%.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes were sent out!

Education Reviews: What To Do to Save Kidnappers?
If the analogy of a famous public welfare advertising "without sale and without killing", then, in a good environment without the need for "abduction", group prevention and all-round anti-trafficking, so that trafficking is not profitable, risky, costly, such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has developed an emergency information release platform for children's disappearance.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish the authoritative channels for the creation of information on child disappearances and timely recovery of abducted children.
Hearing this app is called "Reunion", Dong felt warmly.
The new technology means not only the name "literature" and fullness, but also the informationization is used properly, practical and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement is to find the abducted child and protect his or her personal safety and freedom.
The second is trial and punishment of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishments, social prevention to legal education, can be listed many "big words".
Priority should be given to the safety of victims before cases of trafficking are broached.
Priority is given to the urgent "search for" purposes, such as "whether or not child trafficking should be subject to a single death penalty", which can be omitted and discussed cautiously; but it is impossible to save children.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, human traffickers tend to stay away from the scene as soon as they can.
A minute of delay in the retrieval operation, children may be farther away from a parent step, and the difficulty of detection of cases increases by one point.
In this case, it is indeed pragmatic to come up with an effective approach such as the "reunion" platform that directly contributes to the detection of cases and the recovery of children.
After all, "smuggling" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire rule of law system to do.
Combating crime, safeguarding children's and parental rights, from the improvement of legislation to guarantees of justice, as well as strict law enforcement, does not need to carry out "child care and weakness" care.
In addition, prevention of child trafficking can be done better from the family to society.
For example, in a common case, a three-person family rested at the train station, parents slept and woke up to find their children missing.
One can't expect a two-year-old to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child should at least have a fairly protective awareness.
Relaxing parents or placing their children under secure protection are the least possible means of preventing child abduction.
From the other side of the police's fight against trafficking in children, one party to buy a child is also subject to attention and punishment.
Individual wrongdoing is often just a loop in the long chain.
According to the Criminal Code of our country, the legal starting point for the crime of child trafficking is 5 years; especially serious circumstances can be punishable by death and property confiscation.
The high penalty point and maximum punishment, under the large trend of "immoderate", the crime of child trafficking is clearly punishable by heavier crimes.
There are still a lot of trafficked cases every year.
It can be seen that some people are backward in the concept of child-rearing, and legal awareness is weak.
The rule-of-law education for this part of the population should be followed in parallel.
To effectively control the crime of trafficking cannot rely on strict official law enforcement alone.
If the "market" of abduction is widespread, the traffickers are willing to purify themselves, constantly innovating methods of trafficking, and form a situation of "fighting law" with law enforcement officers, the act of kidnapping will inevitably fall into an inefficient state.
Therefore, breaking down the concept of backwardness and popularizing legal common sense also help to root out trafficking and buying children's crimes.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories, five levels: Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil.
First-pressed olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the oil obtained directly from fresh olive fruit by mechanical cold pressing, filtered and other treatment after removing aliens.
Depending on the difference in acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin: The highest-grade olive oil of the highest quality is pure natural products.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and pleasant vegetable fragrance, the acidity of not more than 1%.
Quality fresh olive oil (Fine Virgin): The acidity is slightly higher, but not more than 2%, the taste is pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin: tastes and flavors are available, with no more than 3.3% acidity.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after refining of primary olive oil with a acidity of more than 3.3% or becomes "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Ordinary olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain percentage of primary olive oil to reconcile the taste and color, its acidity is below 1.5%, it is transparently pale yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: olive oil extracted and refined through the dissolution method.
Looking at grade classifications you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
If you know, olive fruit is like grapes made of wine, the olive fruit from different production areas and different varieties of olive fruit will produce different standard olive oil.
The best place to grow oil olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable climatic conditions such as soil and temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation required for olive oil growth.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be sporadicly grown in viable areas.
Main area of production (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon and so on.
The month of harvesting oil and olives:
Each year from March to June, it is the time when olive trees bloom and fruit begins to develop and mature in July to October, with fruit transitioning from green to red, purple, and eventually turning black.
November to February is the harvest season of fruit (the freshness of olive oil is important oh).
Nutrients of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most nutritious oil found so far.
The Democratic Summit ends and Biden says the fire of freedom never extinguishes
The online summit for democracy, convened by U.S. President Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries around the world as well as civil society and private sector leaders, was inaugurated on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom was burning in the hearts of everyone in the world and that authoritarian regimes could never extinguish it.
He also said he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Taiwanese government representative, political commissioner Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy human rights activist Roo Kang Song who is currently exiled from the UK also made statements at the next day's summit.
"We know how arduous the work before us is.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge because I said before, as this summit has shown, a democratic world is ubiquitous.
The authoritarian regime can never extinguish the microfire of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires a common effort by the whole of society.
"As leaders of the government, it is our responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fences of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, be more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to pursue power naked before public interests."
The second day of the Democratic Summit was devoted to defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, as well as combating digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with the International Human Rights Day.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said in his opening speech that democracy faces challenges worldwide, particularly emerging digital technologies.
"It's time to reassert common values and positions as well as democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing social compacts, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution."
Hong Kong's Democratic Human Rights activist, Roo Kangatsu, delivered a speech to the summit through pre-recorded videos that reminded participants of ongoing concerns about the human rights situation in Chinese minorities such as Hong Kong and Uyghurs and Tibetans.
"The world has long embraced China's rise, but there is no mechanism to hold it accountable."
That's why politicians and civil society leaders must co-operate.
We must use everything we have to ensure that the renaissance of democracy is our top priority."
He also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
"Perhaps some of you are afraid to irritate Secretary-General Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you do not want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat (CCP) to our democratic values," he said.
That's why we failed.
That's why we have to change."
During the round table discussion on "Combating digital autocraticism and affirming democratic values," Tang Feng, a member of Taiwan's administrative council, highlighted Taiwan's standing at the forefront of counteraction to authoritarianism and power.
He also shared experiences on how to fight the new coronavirus through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"At a time when Taiwan's democratic side has faded, we have always stood firmly on the front line of global anti-authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the outbreak, authoritarian governments everywhere rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression.
But in Taiwan, we don't have to block the city to control the epidemic and do not have to go down a shelf to defeat false information."
Just at the same time as the next day of the Democratic Summit, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries such as China and North Korea, which were identified as serious human rights violations, while imposing investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was identified as using surveillance technology to facilitate human rights violations.

Hello, the squirrels from the restaurant are born.
I want to try tennis, but afraid that I can't stick to it, so I want to find a similar price practitioner first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the level of friendship, if it can not be discerned, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than cheaper pics, such "introduction" is actually industrial garbage.
They are very low in strength, the ball is hit on the slit, the vibration is very large, the hardball can not stand up, and high-handers are difficult to manage.
The logic and subtext of their existence is - tennis is so difficult, knowing that you will not learn, but also know that you do not spare to buy expensive, make a cheap goods confusing you, you play twice, won't be playing again, so this clip is cheap, you don't hurt.
When you can really discern good or bad, show that you have progressed, and by the time I come again to buy expensive, I earn two dollars.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a secondhand slightly better slap, choose Prince or Dumbledore, these two brands are not famous enough, so good slaps can not sell the price, new 500, 600 is very good, secondhand 200 pieces, with thousands of dollars enjoyable?
It was very friendly to the novice, but after the novice stage chickens, but most people, especially girls, can not pass the novice stage.

The dresses worn by a fat girl cannot be too short or too long, the length is almost on their knees, just to cover where thighs are thick.
The skirt is too short to show obesity on the legs.
Too long will give people a feeling of drowsiness and fatness.
If you wear the top and bottom three sections, it looks like you naturally grow higher, that is, the upper body, skirts and long stockings with different colors, which will appear to produce a feeling of lengthening.

To prevent people from paying attention to your legs and feet, you get feelings of obesity.
For a small and slightly fat girl, you must tell the best tips for dressing.
The little fat girl should not wear tight short skirts, in addition to dressing do not be short or stuck in the skirt, will make people look very uncomfortable, if the legs are thick, to wear black nannies or grid socks (the kind of fine glove), choose a textured soft print horn skirt, with a collar coat, can well cover the shortcomings of the fat girl.

Fat girl wears short skirts, should choose a clothing that is consistent with the color of short skirts, which will make your fat body have an increase in height effect.
Short skirts with high heels shoes, can make your legs look more durable, this is the summer's most in-house match!
If you are fat, but the legs are thin MM, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous short dress.
Not only can you cover your throat, but also show your strengths.
A word short skirt will be very thin, more suitable for the fat girl, clothing to choose tighter, forming a layered feeling will be more thin.
Simple single-white T-shirt with short skirts, fat MM can also try.
Little fat girls are also able to wear a sense of fashion.

After a change in the dressing and matching, there is also much movement in life, to fight for an early day out of the label of tiny fat girls.

The girl is raising money for her sister when the arrow targets: "It's good to think about skin and flesh wounds" - Xinhua Network
A girl standing in front of a large wooden board, on the board written "human flesh target, ten yuan one arrow" word.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl Gandan's 'arrow target' to raise money for her sister" brushed the circle of friends.
Photos show that a girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stands on the front of a large wooden board slightly higher than man, which is written on the board with the words "human and flesh target, ten yuan one arrow", indicating that passers-by can use bow and arrow shooting after payment.
This act sparked a heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the publicity head of the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau's Downtown Division confirmed to New York Times reporters that police confirmed the girl was raising funds for her sister before making such an overt move, but this behavior is not worth promoting, after warning, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
The girl's street "arrow target" raises the accused admonishment
In the picture, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board, on the board written in black ink with "human and flesh target, ten yuan 1 arrow" word, she is before another wooden board wrote its bank account and WeChat, Alipay Account, etc.
The image was disputed after the Internet.
There are netizens who believe that this move is "the begging behavior of the eyeball", and there are also many netizens who sympathize with it.
"We found the situation when we were patrolling around the square at about 10 a.m. on the 23rd day, when there was no more crowd watching."
In an interview with local media, the civilian police station near the scene said that there were two girls in the stall, all about 20 years old, dressed as young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who is a "human flesh target" has been crying, asking the passer-by to play this game; the other girl on the side helped shout and say that her friend's sister had leukemia, now urgently needed surgery, please help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the head of publicity in Hangzhou's lower city bureau told Xinjing News reporter that the girl was named Ji Jiali and raised funds for her sister Ji Jia Yan.
Because the treatment still requires more than 300,000 fees, this behavior is done when you can't imagine a good way to raise money.
He said that during the whole process, two girls one when a target, one responsible for lowering hands, but not involved in it, there were no people shooting arrows throughout the entire process, only someone surrounded and took photos sent to Weibo.
The latter police are verified by the security department, and the use of archers is not regulated.
The head of the group said, "It is not advocating this kind of eye-catching fundraising."
After warnings from the police station, she has left the police station.

What's the hottest in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think that only Olympians can win the prize?
In the previous time, there was a "Swift Look! project manager can impact gold medals Olympic Games" article is very fire, in which it mentioned that project managers in many projects, absolutely can be first and foremost, no one can match: moving bricks, traveling, staying up late is the day of project manager, saving fire, back pot, apology even less.
A seemingly jokingly amusing article, but also reveals the daily bitterness of project managers, behind the reflection of the current project management work.
People working on project management are also gradually opting to get themselves out of the dilemma of their work through some actions.
From the annual increase in the number of PMPs (International Certified Project Management Professional Qualifications) enrolled, an increasing number of project management practitioners improve their own project management skills by learning.
According to the 20-Year Development Report on China Project Management (1999-2019): As of September 2019, the total number of PMP(r) applications across the country was nearly 600,000, with about 420,000 certified by PMP(r), and about 300,000 effective licensees, accounting for 31.2% of global PMP(r) approvals.
The number of PMP holders in recent 10 years has increased year after year, indicating that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer desirable to do things by simply replicating past "old experience", and the rapidly changing working environment allows us to know a way to learn, stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can a PMP test ensure that the project management work is smooth?
Many project management beginners say that by studying relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, it is possible to systematically grasp the ten areas of project management and the five process groups related knowledge points, but when really doing project management work still a mist.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following questions: Project management is not recognized, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; lack of systemic project management process system support, can not land in work, project unpredictability, poor control sensitivity, project dragging again and again; members' division of labor is unclear, "old oil bar" in the team does not know how to deal with cross-sectoral assistance communication smoothly, projects difficult to advance.
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management in more than 10 fields has helped many outstanding enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other research and development key talents, and received the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Model Base" such as Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting with the "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp" online course.
The R&D Project Manager Training Course is an online fragmented learning method that combines the actual combat cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and take the advanced path of their own project management.
It is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower costs and less investment, promote the development process of project managers, and bring efficient operating results to businesses.
In vain, we can first see how other participants evaluate this course: This course is not only by the team of experts from Zhongtianhua Xia (formerly Huawei R&D management team), combined with international advanced project management methodology and a number of well-known enterprises' real business scenarios, to provide an in-depth professional explanation of the content of the course.
Moreover, it will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms to help participants translate the learning content into specific work after class.

As a licensed consumer financial institution, Jexin has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high quality and careful service, advocating for consumers to establish a good and correct consumption view, and actively responding to the call of supervision in order to improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young groups.

On the arrival of Double Twelve, Jet reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and correct monetary view, resist blind consumption and overconsumption, avoid misunderstanding of consumer borrowing and lending, so as not to affect personal letters and future economic life.
Consumption must be planned in advance, and the measure is necessary for timely repayment.
If overdue, the overdue records will be recorded in personal credit reports, which may have a negative impact on future economic life such as buying cars and buying houses.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, formal institutions and channels should also be chosen, and attention should be paid to verify whether relevant institutions have operational qualifications.
In the future, as always with its mature, reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated iterative financial products, to bring consumers more suitable for demand and diversified services, continue to help the general public improve the level of financial knowledge, help consumers develop rational consumption, moderate lending concept, become a consumer's life-long trustworthy consumer financial partner.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's station includes Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It's worth noting that this is the first time since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt broke diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations while maintaining close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the inner unity of the HCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries blocked the air, sea and land route to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward "unity and stability" by U.S.-Kuwaitese mediation.
Saudi Arabia reopens its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab States resolve their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar, based on the demands that must be united for the interests of each country and regional stability, aimed at tackling common challenges.
During the Saudi crown prince's visit to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between two Gulf neighbours.
The 725-kilometer route linking the two countries will facilitate both citizens' travel and integration of supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, with two companies signing 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with Iran's nuclear deal with major powers on salvage, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement condemned by the Gulf Arab States for their perceived inability to resolve the missile issue with Iran.
The Gulf states have always viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and regarded Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that not solving the Iranian missile problem and not taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region are flawless.
Saudi Arabia has made direct negotiations with Iran in the context of the failure of major powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf countries.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming HCC summit will be the first ever since the end of a dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic results that have contributed to facilitating the restoration of the unity of the HCC, while offering measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

It is claimed that the new mountain super-run exhaust sound is the largest!
This time our team brought this car to everyone, is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship super-run, Murcielago's replacement model - Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the coin is nearly two million dollars, a year's road tax coins are more than 10 thousand, four-wheel drive, why call the LP700?
With 700 horses, can you imagine how fast?
It is also not known that the data say 0-100km/h acceleration takes only 2.9 seconds, probably the Xiaobian Myvi will be to 30km/h when people are to 100km/h, well.
The low body, the brazen scissors door, the huge air intake all around the body and the glass's next endless 6.5 v12 engine perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
There is no need to say too much about the description of the car, Google itself just a moment, small compilations some explanations that Google does not necessarily give!
Too high-profile, where everyone is watching, very uncomfortable!
1km oil money in about RM1 (car owners don't care at all)
The position to get up and down the car should be practiced, otherwise it will be a bit embarrassing (because you can't climb out of the cabin and then stuck halfway)
The engine is too loud to be deaf after leaving the car.
The body is too big, stopping in the usual parking lot will be very narrow, afraid to knock when the next door car opens!
A little loneliness, because there are no opponents on the road (the editor himself said, not related to the owner, haha)
Don't misunderstand, this video super run is not going to be sold, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot video for your car, welcome contact us!
More information about the car you do not know, just in The Car Guide / People's Cartography
It's worth 10 million-dollar car crashes!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that the car owners know that Chiron is one of the world's most expensive supercars, while Porsche 911 has a million-dollar price!
That day, foreign countries in just a few minutes hit the million sports car 911 and millions of super-running Chiron!
Look at the results, it makes sense!
Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times be resonated with the frequency - Xinhua Network
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of management concepts and value pursuits formed by a university in the development process, which is the soul of the university.
From ancient times, the spirit of university is essential for political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological development, and even for the progress of a nation.
From the birth of the world's first modern-day university, the university has shouldered a unique mission unlike other social organizations, for our universities, arose in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit is more deeply influenced by traditional culture and era change, advocated "Mindezzi, Xizhiqing" value concept and patriotism of "the rising power".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly evident, global educational competition, scientific and technological competition, talent competition is intensifying, higher education career as an important "supply side", its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the General Program for Integrating the Advancement of World-class Universities and First-Class Disciplines, while demonstrating our confidence and determination from higher education to higher education powerhouses, also presents a higher update requirements for university development.
How in a short time to strive to become one of the world's popular ranks, on the basis of some gap still there is an accelerated construction of several world-class universities and a group of world-class disciplines, to achieve "bending overtaking"?
In addition to a firm goal confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, universities should also fully take advantage of three advantages: first, after-generation advantages, through the continuous introduction of outstanding academic talent abroad, learning to draw on the advanced experience of world-class universities, achieve significant improvement in academic level and quality of study; second, cultural advantages, inheriting the intellectual connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in five thousand years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to consolidate strength, shaping brand and improving image; third, institutional advantages, play the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthen target drivers, bring together consensus efforts, optimize resource allocation, provide sustainable and solid guarantees for schools to accelerate their progress beyond the world's advanced level.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that the construction of world-class universities can not be a thousand school side, and each school must demonstrate its individuality and characteristics while playing their advantages.
The business features should be both common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique target positioning, traditional and resource endowment.
In the case of Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three aspects of the specialties in training: one is to highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talent culture, build the integration of teaching and school enterprises with integrated parenting environment, form a chain-wide entrepreneurship education ecosystem; second is to highlight the features of cross-disciplinary gathering, promote the optimization adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for cross-disciplinary processes, actively cultivate cross-cutting emerging disciplines and iconic cross-cutting results; third is to highlight the peculiarities of the management system and social services, carry out deep international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of the Panzhezhen Industrial Research and Development Cooperation System.
In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate.
For the University of Zhejiang, "request for innovation" schooling, "workmanship, ethic, discernment, solidity" common values and "Haina River, Enlightenment, First Nations, Tree State" together constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang.
It is an important guarantee that the school adheres to the correct direction of schooling, constantly accumulates a high level of culture and condensate spiritual forces, rich in content, far-reaching significance.
Among them, the "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, embodies the heart of "the talents of the world for me", is manifested as a drawing on the high-quality concept of teaching students in world famous schools; "Initiative Goodness" emphasizes the spirit of true goodness, refers to the university in the pursuit of truth at the same time, more accepting the pottery and personality of virtue; "The people who have opened objects" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which contains both the search for new knowledge, scientific research innovation, and also expresses itself as the reform and development, Jack Sun Ding New; "Tree My State" emphasizes the patriotism dedication, saying that universities should always be humiliated with the national destiny.
This series of spiritual ideas and value pursuits is exactly where the soul of Zhejiang University has been studying for 120 years.
"He who hears the voice is silent, and those who see it are untouched."
China's universities should further build on the whole of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the chronological position and historical mission of higher education in order to accelerate the construction into a world-class university.
At the same time, upholding humankind care and independent freedom, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of aging and nationalism are intertwined, thus providing inexhaustible impetus for the realization of the country's richness and national revitalization and achievement of the common ideal of mankind.

At the time of NFT fire, the crypto community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who lost jobs due to the outbreak began to earn steady income.
Axie Infinity is a pet-based game based on blockchain technology that brings together many games including NFT, which is currently the highest trading volume of NFT projects with more than $3 billion to date.
Token Terminal data shows that Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, directing it to the glory of the king.
On August 6th, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily users have surpassed one million.
The fire of Axie Infinity conveys a new "palytoearn" mode to more people, thanks to blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer single characters, in addition to being able to get fun from the game and economic benefits, can also participate in the management of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by gamemakers, but guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about the stock price of friends, my biggest touch is the choice of enterprises in the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry, first to choose the growth space large industry, at least 100 billion more market size; secondly, to choose the future growth and good industry, consider the next 3-5 years industrial growth to achieve the best state of the industry; finally, to choose the industry with policy support.
How wide the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the development stage in the industry, whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Refueling for the right track!
The first thing in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
The tactic is "do the things right," that is, to do what's right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," that is, do the right thing.
Strategy is to find direction, tactics are to land, and there is space for strategic thinking on top of most tactical thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether the current field is continuously deepening or horizontal extension (strategic thinking); for example, improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve core and high-value customer retention rate (strategic thinking); above raising activity engagement (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the right activities goals, such as increasing target customer participation, activating high-value silencers, and accurately updating; on upgrading DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin elicited several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, El Salvador, a small country in Central America, designated bitcoin as the fiat currency for the first time to become a national or regional fiat currency.
On Oct. 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares for the first time in eight years to launch the Bitcoin ETF and list it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliance bitcoin futures ETF landing in the U.S. capital market, with a renewed expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure.
From the point of view of blockchain technology development, bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin carried out a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which increased the anonymity of bitcoin's network transactions and reduced the data burden in trading by changing the data structure of the block itself.

American-Asian groups complain of discrimination in admissions to three Ivy schools such as Yale - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Washington, May 23 (reporter Xu Shengmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education and Justice on Monday to protest three Ivy schools - Yale, Brown University and Dartmouth Colleges - discriminating against Asian applicants during their admissions.
The Asian-American Education Alliance, which spearheaded the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The group's chairman Zhao Yupo said in a press release that the number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to U.S. universities has multiplied over the past 10 years, but among these three U.S. schools, the proportion of Asian students is basically maintained at the same level.
Many studies show that these universities are "long-term persistent and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants" in the so-called "integrated considerations" admission process.
Zhao Yupo said that research from scholars such as Sanders in 2014 showed that among these three universities, the Asian-Americans had the lowest rate of admission to all ethnicities relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League colleges, Brown and Dartmouth Colleges have the lowest percentage of Asian students enrolled, with Yale and Brown universities implementing de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants up to more than 20 years.
Zhao told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they expect the U.S. Department of Education and Justice to conduct an investigation after filing a complaint, and take steps to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions.
They also hope that the complained colleges will be able to take this issue proactively and change their admission policy toward Asians.
At present, three colleges and universities have not responded.
The Asian-American Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it complained about admission discrimination at Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education was not admissible on procedural grounds.
In addition to U.S. Chinese-American groups, the complaint includes American Indian, Korean, Japanese and Pakistani-American educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the housing intermediary that a factory located in Yuyao Bing Town, Zhejiang, after several visits to the premises, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant.
In December of that same year, after consulting with the family of the owner of the house, Mr. Lu consulted about the details of the purchase of the plant and Ling Yang, he transferred money through the bank to make a deposit of 200,000 yuan on the same day.
Lin was signed as a recipient in the "Factory Buying and Purchasing Consignment Ordinance", which states that "if the buyer does not want to buy this plant, this fixed money is returned to the seller, if the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, both parties agreed to enter into a contract of sale within one week."
However, the subsequent failure of the two parties to reach agreement on the scope of the sale of the plant and payment methods such as the main contract terms led to a delay in signing the home sales contract.
Considering the failure of the parties to reach consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned 200,000 yuan in gold money to Mr. Lu.
The house was not easy to see, the gold deposited, the room money is also ready, and sent "the door-to-foot" to sign a contract, but the seller did not sell, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court.
After the court considered that the parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, can not be blamed solely on the accused, should reasonably be presumed that consultations were not completed, so this case should not apply the penalty of fixed money, and the defendant does not have to bear double liability for repayment of fixed money.
After the first instance judgement, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the court of second instance reconfirmed its original judgment.
[Lawyer Reminds] The obligation to take due diligence into account in the course of the transaction is required.
When signing a contract, the buyer must do the necessary prudential care obligation, such as verifying information about the owner of the home, whether the house is occupied and other relevant information, and specify in the contract specific time and location for delivery to prevent disputes between the parties at the time of performance of the contract.
After the Democratic Summit on Friday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Saturday (December 11) that the U.S. hosted "The Leaders' Democracy Summit" was an "ideological line-up, instrumentalization and weaponization of democracy, counter-democratic actions in the name of false democracy, incitement to secession and confrontation, and transfer of domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on people, promoted 'democratic transformation', indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and led the 'color revolution' with disastrous consequences."
"Democracy" has long become a weapon of mass destruction that the United States interferes with in other countries.
The summit is a move by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day conference took place in video format with 111 leaders from around the world, including Taiwanese, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia slammed the U.S. on issues surrounding its own democracy, saying it was not eligible to host such a summit.
There are also international and domestic questioning voices, such as the criticism of some authoritarian leaders like the Philippines, Poland and Brazil who were invited to attend, with suspicion that the real intention of the Biden government was not to organize this summit for democracy but geopolitical purposes.
Germany's newly-incoming Prime Minister Schultz also participated in the Video Democracy Summit.
China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday that "the disease of today's American democracy is evident, and the problems of monetary politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social rupture, racial contradictions, rich and poor divide are intensifying." The US democracy is a capital-based "rich game".
U.S. President Biden said in a statement: "As leaders of the government, it is our responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fences of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, be more resistant to authoritarian buffers and shocks, and those who want to pursue power naked before public interests."
He stressed that democracy is not foreseen, "We must constantly update it among every generation and in my opinion this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "in the face of persistent and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend."
The U.S. side is committed to a one-year action following this summit, which includes an initiative worth $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete and public commitments to improve their democratic institutions before the 2022 Summit on Real Democracy.
"Let all of us fulfil our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year," Biden said.
Well, I'm afraid he sent the wrong address.

What is Red Card Whiskey Drinking?
Everyone's hobby is different, someone likes collection, someone likes food, of course some people like wine, red card whiskey is one of the best-selling Scotch whisky in each country at present, and red card whiskey has been awarded the International Wine Competition gold medal.
Each bottle of red card whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, will not spoil its scent.
How do you drink red whiskey?
The subtitles are briefly introduced to everyone.
Red-card whiskey drink:
He is made up of about 35 Scottish whisky varieties and has the characteristics of a strong aromatic and traditional Scotch whisky with sweet and smoked flavors.
The entrance is freshly saturated, slightly with aromatic grass and a strong smell of smoked malt.
The wine can be consumed directly with ice or mixed with its favorite beverages.
Red card whiskey enters the country, in order to adapt to the national taste, red card whiskey + Coke or snowy or novelty bubble drinks have become a lasting fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to the neutral and acidic taste, can visually bring people pleasure, add a drink, play the effect of rinsing alcohol to change taste.

Education Thinking: How the university exams make "learning" "school crap" every place - Xinhua Net
The 3 students of Lanzhou Transportation University wrote to the school leadership, reflecting confusion about the university exams, and proposed to improve the difficulty of the examination, change the test typology, so that the test truly reflects the student's actual level of demand.
Indeed, college exams have long been a "hot topic."
On the university campus, students from five lakes and four seas, the level of ability varies, plus the degree of learning is different.
For groups with such a multiplicity of characteristics to evaluate, there are different feelings, inevitably.
Of course, if the test subject type is single, high repetition rate, the topic is too simple, will inevitably cause another very different feeling.
Students who do not need to work, may be able to meet the pre-test centralized attack, if you want other ways, it is possible to achieve the effect of doing more.
In this way, there is a "school slag" that can not be invested in and even get high scores; "school bullying" usually never drops out of class, work, notes are good, the exam has not been much higher than the "grotesque status quo".
In this way, it appears that the students in Lanzhou's college entrance examination reflect not unreasonable problems and believe that this situation is not only a large presence in Lanzhou.
In this sense, I would like to congratulate these three students who wrote candid letters.
In fact, people who have gone to college are aware that the attack preparation of exams, and think of various ways to "take" the test from the teacher's questions, strive for the scope of the examination, get a "focus coaching" phenomenon before the exam is not uncommon, even in the exam clipping small copies, post-appraisal request teachers high hand status is not strange.
In my opinion, as a teaching quality assessment guide, measuring the eligibility of a university exam is more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and on this basis scientific propositions.
Entering the university undergraduate stage, the profession begins to subdivide, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether to fully master a basic knowledge point in a discipline is the content of the university exams to examine.
And undergraduate knowledge is basically the underlying theory of discipline and basic common sense, from the point of view of knowledge, the space for change is not large, basically fixed.
As the teachers say, "The basic knowledge of mathematics in universities 20 years ago is still being studied, or a focus."
But the point of knowledge is basically unchanged, does not represent a single test type and repeatability.
In many universities, the exams will generally form a set of questions, and then be integrated by senior discipline teachers to make test volumes, and the examination volume is also attended by all teachers who take charge of the section, so that you can overcome the duplication of tests to a certain extent.
But to prepare a set of tests that are consistent with teaching and learning, the topic according to the student's overall study situation, it is difficult to be normalized distribution, but also need to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation, comprehensive analysis of the degree of students' learning, so that the test proposition is difficult and dynamically secure, can highlight basic knowledge research, and can combine competency assessment, at the same time innovative design.
Exams are the driving rod of university education, and what kind of exams students will have a corresponding preparation program, which in the long run will affect the effectiveness of university education.
For the student's letter of recommendation, Lanzhou to the university team attaches great importance and has deployed rectification programs throughout the school.
The various teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct research and curriculum completion examinations independently, develop test book propositions and related systems, while strengthening supervision and inspection of test book propositions and auditing links, fine-tuning the grade assessment, and strengthen comprehensive evaluation of all aspects of course teaching.
From the mechanism to solve the problem of a single type of test, repetition of the topic and other problems is the university exams need to face the issue, of course, it requires the introduction of corresponding system, but Kung Fu in everyday life, needs the teacher's comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but also to eat through the student learning situation, two people will eat through, teach and study will be better connected, forming a benign interaction, the examination will be more practical, so that "learning bully" and "learn junk" can do everything.
If you can't change the location of my store for me, can you replace it with an excerpt?

Before taking pictures, because we didn't schedule the time and changed two times, counselor Langland patiently helped us arrange the time.

The photographer is also very humorous, and taking pictures every day feels happy.
When choosing photos, because I see a lot of cases online, not want to let the guests remove too many photos, but when we choose pictures, really, at least do not let us add photo meaning, directly in the package 24, one is not added (heard of my cousins who took wedding photography almost all the time, more than seven thousand packages plus more than 10,000 photos, then I was shocked and afraid that I would choose too much)
Today's photos were repaired, Langlan sent me, I saw two pictures that didn't feel good, and they immediately helped me to renovate.
Turning the photos my sister had previously taken out, I feel like our pictures are really too satisfying, simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I really recommend you to announce that Mrs. Hankin takes a wedding photo!

Saba 3,200 newborns without paper due to special anti-counterfeiting paper cuts
The Sabah National Registry said that due to the use of light in special anti-counterfeiting paper inventories, it was not possible to issue birth papers for firstborn babies since early October, and so far 3,200 affected people have accumulated.
However, the director of the bureau Kerouaminus assured that all babies who had applied for birth paper were recorded in the system and would be replenished when anti-counterfeiting paper was shipped next week.
At the press conference, he explained a 10-month report on the issue of printing paper from Shabbat.
He said the issue arose two months ago, and Sarawak faced the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in China."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Saba Papers differed from other areas, so it was impossible to borrow inventory from other states.
Kerouaminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6th this month, and then it was handed over to the printing company on 8th, for partial printing work.
"The bureau next Thursday will send people to Kuala Lumpur for pickup and return to Shaba's final stage of printing, with an estimated two more working days (December 20) that can be handed over to the applicants."
"We will inform the applicants to go to various subdivisions for receipt of paperwork."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 newspaper papers so far this year.
From 7:00 till now
Isn't that fast?
I mean food.

48 hours of negative nuclear acid, setting a "buffer zone" State Department's U.S. anti- and control mechanism issued a letter calling for strengthening the port city epidemic prevention and control - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Beijing Dec. 11 (reporter Dong Rheifeng, Zhongtiancheng) The State Department's anti-coronavirus control mechanism issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new outbreak of pneumonia in port cities recently, requiring people to leave the land border crossing city (except for those linked to Hong Kong and Macau ports) within 48 hours must hold a negative certificate of nuclear acid testing, and at least one nuclear acid test will be carried out after arriving at the land border crossing city personnel.
According to the notification, the time limit for the above requirements is from the date on which the boundaries of port cities are determined and announced in each province or district municipality until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notification also suggests that conditional port cities can study setting an outbreak prevention and control buffer within the jurisdiction.
The relevant head of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy, and people on both sides exchange frequently.
The implementation of the divisional differentiation management policy, from one anti-control spill line to two defense lines, it is expected to achieve the transition before the crossing, reduce the epidemic spill risk, with minimal social impact and minimum social costs to achieve the maximum effectiveness of outbreak prevention and control.
In recent times, many local condensed outbreaks have occurred in China, all of which are imported by overseas cities through ports.
The above notification indicates that this exposes some local outbreak monitoring early warning in a timely manner, high-risk job personnel closed-loop management is not implemented, periodic nucleic acid detection flows into the form, cold chain items are eliminated from all links, centralized isolation site management is not standardized, epidemic emergency treatment is not scientifically accurate.

20 years of bloodthirsty killings by the U.S. Army - Xinhua
(Video Source: Oil Pipes)
On December 11, a microdocumentary titled "The Killing Machine" of the oil pipeline platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells about the U.S. launching the war in Afghanistan under the name of "counterterrorism", forcibly exporting American democracy through the war, 20 years of poor militarism, bloodthirsty, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and committing various crimes against humanity.
The misuse of drones to air attacks on civilian sites such as hospitals, schools and other places, distorting human nature, and the formation of homicide groups.
For 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military has set up a "black prison" for all kinds of torture and physical humiliation against the "suspects".
An anti-human crime provoked more Afghans to hate.
As the video says, the American "counterterrorism" war is "the more and more fearful."
The war did not bring peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only devastated countries and countless killings and destruction.
Pushing the video, let us together to unravel the truth of the United States in the name of "counterterrorism", bloodthirsty killings, stamping out the hypocrisy face of American democracy!
Inadvertently see the following article, from the point of view of business and preservation period to talk about why this customer should help in the logistics company in the tax-free zone for canning, although the canned is deep processing, not within the scope of the operation of the tax-free logistics company, here's the following text may explain why customers want to do this?
I went to a lot of milk powder manufacturers, contacting a lot of milk powder production line.
In fact, bags are the same raw materials as milk powders that listen to them, and there is no difference.
So you will certainly ask: why is the shelf life of bags a year, and the shelf life of listening to clothes is two years or more?
Or ask yourself, why is the price difference between purses and bags so big?
In fact, from this point of departure many consumers, or mother-class believes that it is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be a lot better.
In fact, as with raw materials, only everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers because of this mentality eating after the reaction and saying that the taste or taste of listening to clothing is different!
Now I'll talk to you first about the reasons for listening to dresses, where are they expensive?
Why are their raw materials the same price difference so big?
Because the majority of manufacturers in pricing are considering that if the bag is priced too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the manufacturer's profits are very low, or that there is no profit, what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they had a big upswing on the pricing of hearing suits to secure their margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers are preyed on listening rather than pouching.
And you want so many manufacturers to spend tens of billions or even hundreds of millions of dollars per year on advertising, what is this cost?
Everyone can think of it.
So, with the development of society, market promotion costs, such as: salespeople in shopping malls, exhibition costs for shopping malls, product gift fees, advertising expenses, etc. are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, each manufacturer is also constantly adding new products, and it is listening to clothing, its price is also constantly rising, in fact this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, their raw materials increase the cost of not more than 3 or 4 yuan.
Another part of the brand, in order to promote their own products, without any means, hooked up with the doctors of the hospital, and helped them to promote the product, from one listen to a profit of 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such methods of operation, in fact this practice is to pit consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder in the case of a can in the home, so it can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, does not have any impact on children.
There are also people do not think that the shelf life of listening to clothing is longer than bag, if after the opening of the package listen to the shelf life of the same bag, just say that bag and open packaging after it is not easy to save, vulnerable to tide deformation.
The food was too late, the food was cool, and it was cold and dry and hard, and there was no way to eat at all.
And the soup juice was sprinkled out.

Don't scare people off the starting line - Xinhua Net
When shopping in the book market, you can often feel the explosion of successful schoolbooks.
Many of today's successful books are hailed as "best principles" - presuming or implying that you can "do it," and then telling you what you need to do.
Just to say at once overcame the most important and fundamental link of "how to do" in fact.
That's why these books have a common feature - either to do the best in a drum, or simply do nothing; 100 or 0; or you are on Mount Taitlan or just stay there.
This "best principle" that anyone can see will admit to being "right and irresistible", but 99% of people will be scared before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path that "you have to remake people and make a big 180-degree shift," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many.
For those who are conforming to the rules, obstinate and reject change, you prefer to shout "You want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly a self-deception, a bull piano act.
The vast majority of people will be timid in the face of the words "transition", wrapped up, difficult to resolve; or by a moment of impulse painsed the determination of "transition", and bravely took the first step, but often not long prospects, persistence for a few moments after defeat, unseemable continuity.
Mr. Masili's famous "Starting from Tomorrow" echo is the most illuminating book of this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's ability to make the vast majority of people "look at the door."
Perhaps, the "good principle" is a way to get more ordinary people on the relatively successful path.
The core of the "sub-good principle" lies in "reducing the threshold" - it encourages a theory that if less than 100, only 1 is also done: because 1 is always greater than 0; and if you do not climb Taishan, just the small sand dunes on your doorway are also walking, because it is always stronger than where they are.
In short, as long as you do something, it's always better than not.
Due to the significant reduction of the threshold, it is more likely that ordinary people will be able to persevere, and all things as long as they persist, the probability of success will increase.
Just following the "second-best principle" path of success, its journey is slightly longer.
All in all, the "best principle" although it ostensibly bears the banner of success for everyone, it can ultimately be motivated, actually a few; and the "second good principle" can effectively inspire more people to benefit as much as possible.

The reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Xinin on December 11th (reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) reporter from the Agriculture and Rural Administration of Qinghai Province was informed that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserves of Cinghai Lake naked carp resources increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared with the previous year to 108.5 million tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial protection in 2002.
Blue Sea Lake Naked Carps popularly known as "Wongfish", is a unique and precious fish species in the lake, which plays an important role in maintaining the ecological safety and biodiversity of the water-fish-bird basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to the increasing environmental degradation of artificially large number of killings and bare carp breeding waters, the number of naked carps in Qinghai Lake declined sharply, and in 2002 there were only 2,592 tons of empty carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
In 2004 in the Red List of Chinese Species, a naked carp was listed as an endangered species.
Since 2003, the province of Qinghai has banned any units, collectives and individuals from fishing naked carps in the main rivers and streams of Qinghai Lake and lake area, and prohibited the sale of naked carps and their products.
At the same time, through artificial pluralization and clearing of Qinghai Lake mainly into the lake river lanes, and designing scientifically reasonable "fish crossing" measures continue to increase the protection force, and the reserves of Qinghai Lake naked carp resources have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, said that as of now, qinghai lake naked carps have been cumulatively carried out artificial reproduction and discharge streams close to 180 million tails, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of chonghai lake naked carp resources.
The Qinghai Three Jiangyuan region is an important ecological barrier and water supply area for China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone that controls the spread of desertification to the east in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of Trijiangyuan and Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wildlife, and preserve the biodiversity of Tsinghai Plateau, this year, Qinghai issued a ban on fishing in the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake key waters warnings, and built a comprehensive ban on fishing management system.

The restaurant just gave me a bag, to be packed in the bag, and the weather was cold.
Would you like to ask if the sale is in a bag?
We only saw a purse.
Want to know if we've leaked or someone else has taken it, thank you.
I haven't been sent for an hour yet.
I've just seen a fake article, it's too long.
Let's give the unknowable male cop a little bit.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first leave on a day between the ages of 13-15 and close at around age 50.
Afterwards, it will be relatively regular every month under the premise of physical health.
But it is not the norm to be able to accurately predict, about a week or so of tolerances, you need to prepare in advance, sometimes luck will also turn over the car ( suddenly several days ahead).
The length of time, the amount of blood, the degree of pain varies by person, some three days, some one week; some people flow less, some avalanche; some people have no reaction, some people hurt to ambulances drive away, pain will change over time, before it does not represent a lifeless pain.
Uncontrollable menstruation, 24 hours of bloodshed in a few days from the beginning until the end, can only be done with sanitary towels or sanitary cotton bars to prevent bleeding into clothing chairs.
Pain is mainly due to the secretion of prostate, physiological period has not arrived at the beginning of the paediatric period before rushing to eat Blofen can effectively relieve pain this month, after the pain begins.
Before the physiological period, due to uterine overcharging and prostate release too much, it is easy to pull the stomach.
If it is about the cycle, inexplicably pulling the stomach, basically there will be menstruation within two days.
The sanitary napkins are best to replace once for two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to nourish bacteria, remove sleep time, the worst case is that they are replaced six times a day, seven days a month, which is 42 tablets, if you add pre-prepared portions may have 50 pieces, not every month.
(Amend here, hygienic cotton strips do not need to be changed again, maybe five or six hours can be changed once, up to eight hours)
The lining of the menstrual period may be more turbulent, and the ovulation period can also be due to hormonal changes in the body, emotional instability, which is very unfortunate, the body makes a stunt for itself.
But official crime data shows that women's ability to control emotions is still high, and do not take excuses for emotional problems.
The flow is not just blood, which contains the decomposed uterine membrane.
The uterine membrane is thinner after the end of the menstruation, then slowly thickening, it can be understood that the womb is a house, each month to build a house (the inner membrane becomes thicker) ready to meet the guests, the guests did not come, all removed (menstrual discharge) next month to build a new house, and restarted.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades to come, 24 hours of bloodshed every month, and there will also be bouts of back pain, who would?
But man can be born because his mother has come through the menstruation, in order to prepare you for the first time into this world to live in a 10-month house, everyone should thank their mother for the regular and healthy menstruation.
Many things before women were suppressed, society told women brainwashing is dirty, shameful, everyone thought it was, but the times have changed.
If someone feels nausea of menstruation, feel that the woman's body for the preparation of life is nausea, should not be spoken out in the public court, the girls stand up, do not think again, never experienced, this life will not experience, and less understand the men, don't so forgetfulness knows how to face their mother, how does it mean to want their own children?
Finally, the sisters try hygienic cotton strips, which is really useful.
Today is a winter solstice festival, and sending mistakes is more disappointing.
To order another meal for a kid.
Hopefully, the store will check out its products.
Is the squirrel leaked to your feet?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in health care, and today's U.S. mini-cop will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the improvement of people's health awareness, the foot bath is increasingly loved by consumers, and a large number of different grades of products are also emerging in the market, ranging from more than one hundred to thousands of yuan.
On the relevant data surface, compared with traditional home appliances, health care household appliances such as foot bacon sales have exploded, but there are no special industry standards, so there are certain safety risks.
"Put your feet in the electricity-powered water, it's too dangerous!"
Mr. Lee told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath to give his father a birthday present, but when the father stabbed his feet, he felt naked and muddy.
At first, Mr. Li thought that it was caused by the vibrational function of the foot bathtub, did not expect to close the vibrational function, and his father still felt the feet numb.
Mr. Lee tried with an electric pen, the electric pen was brightened, and Mr. Lee was surprised to find that the water in the foot bathtub was electrically charged.
Afterward he contacted the merchants, and the attitude of the merchants was good, although Mr. Li still felt unhappy despite dropping his foot bathtub.
He found that this long-standing basilica has no clear and detailed industry regulations in the setting of the highest temperature, which people are suitable for, what materials to ensure harmless.
But in general, the foot bathtub will not have an electric problem, but also does not exclude a few products when out of the factory did not strictly shut down.
Therefore, select a sparse foot bath when buying.
Water and electricity separation, there are no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take an e-book test.

Metaphysics refers to problems that cannot be answered directly through perception by reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy designed to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the name "Metaphysical" is derived from the phrase "Immediate, metaphysical," which was translated by Metaphysic for Japanese people in Chihuahua (the Meiji era).
Metaphysical branches include ontology, natural theology and its extension problems.
Integrity is "to study which terms represent the real entity of existence, and which term only represents a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism means denying the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be conceptually explained by natural reason, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodual naturalism refers to the method of studying God's wordlessness.
Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the essence of consciousness and their relationship with the physical body, especially the brain.
Binalism and monarchy are the two main ideas that discuss "the relationship between the mind and the body."
Knowledge theory is a philosophical branch that explores the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline of systematic thinking and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all norms of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.

It examines the moral codes of conduct that people should observe, applied ethics (the academic application of ethical theory to actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing from observed styles).
It examines ethics not from a preconceived theory, but rather by investigating the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, which contributes to all the ethical factors of this choice, as it explores the ethical views held by social groups.
Ethical history includes Greek Roman ethics and Medieval Christian ethics.
Part 1: Humanistic ethical thinking, represented by Walla and Montaigne et al.
Part Two: The Ethics of Religious Reform, represented by Calvin.

You asked the restaurant to come in.
I just don't want to go downstairs to buy things, and spend so much money on selling.
Ding Zinn: To my friends.
I would like to sincerely thank your friends for the humanitarian assistance they have provided over the long period of more than 30 years after our loved ones' death, particularly those that have not been interrupted so far since my personal appeal in early 1994 to domestic and foreign friends.
The vast majority of the deceased's parents have now died, and the lonelies have grown up to work at home.
It is your eloquence that has helped us, the families in distress, to spend the most difficult moments.
The new coronavirus is currently raging globally, and most donors have retired annually.
Therefore, I sincerely ask you to suspend the humanitarian donation of our family-the Tiananmen Mothers group - this humanitarian relief campaign should have long been a perfect sentence.
I will forever remember your love, and firmly believe that your righteousness will be remembered for history.
For a variety of reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please friends understand!
Please accept my heartfelt blessings.
Q: Let me take this opportunity to give a brief account of the 32-year history of U.S. academic self-confidence (IFCSS) and Minnesota's China Democracy Foundation (MCDF) for humanitarian relief.
In the process of engaging in humanitarian relief, the All-American Institute for Self-Education and the Minnesota Foundation for China Democracy are two parallel organizations with frequent crossovers between project implementers.
(Apple Daily Graph: Tiananmen Mother's website is handled by the industry.)pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Salvation is often not delivered successfully to the 64-year-old hand.
In 1994, according to the suggestion of teacher Ding, a special group was established by "Tian'anmen Mother" to integrate and distribute the recipients.
In 1998, the MCDF established the Sixty-Four Orphan Education Fund and in 2009, after graduating from college for all six or four orphanages, followed by the establishment of the Special Needed Families Rescue Fund for those who are still living.
Funding for these projects, mainly from campus and social contributions in the six-to-four year period, from individual generous donations, and supported by the Brotherhood University Foundation for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, 31 years later, the Sixty-Four Tribes finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong that year in the name of Sixty-Four.
During this period, Human Rights in China is also implementing their humanitarian assistance projects independently.
We understand that Ding's suspension of six or four donations is for the donors to consider, we are indeed some retired people, income is not as good as before retirement, I hereby express my gratitude to Ding's "friend" letter.
We will respect the fateful decision to terminate this project within two years and restore it as soon as necessary.
Those who have been persistent in generosity for many years, risking the delivery of humanitarian aid to those eloquent fellows, expressed their gratitude and respect.

Thanks for the rabbit's review, it was also said that rejecting ancient winds is not suitable for old winds, I did not expect finished products to come out just too beautiful.
Thanks to Dandan's approval, your satisfaction will allow us to keep the power supply going forward and we will continue to refuel!
This photo studio is really great and highly recommended to all the small partners!
From reception, make-up, clothing, lighting, photography to late.
The make-up artist is especially delicate, will match your style to suit your make-up, cosmetics are also the first line of big brands.
Not to mention the teacher of Tian Liang, photography is quite a professional.
The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens playing with them.
We are working in Beijing, Beijing's good movie buildings need to lined up for half a year ahead of schedule, colleagues have been photographed in Beijing, watching the finished film feel just so so.
I'm looking for this studio, a place where the soul has an attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, it feels that this is also the short version of most people, photographers will snap and record natural moments.
Cosmetician, photographer, late design, a good team.
We and the people around us are disgusted.
The girlfriend's past has been recommended, and the girlfriend just looked at the bottom of the film was equally happy.
Hopefully, such a studio should not be buried, more people find ta, snapshots belong to their own style, rather than one-size-fits-all.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews of Jing Eagle, Qing Ling, both are very thoughtful and creative new people, we are creative studios, as long as customers like us all do 200% of our efforts to complete, thank you for meeting.
The sweet and heartfelt assistant, as well as the lively and cheerful photographer teacher, each of the team is super-nice. A wonderful shot, a difficult to forget experience, and the filmed effect is much better than I imagined.
Thank you for the review of Xiao Yu. You are also a reason to know from Hour and Hart to Qinhuangdao. The trust in us is thousands of kilometers away, I am happy to know you have the opportunity to go back to Qinhuangdao next time.
How do I give money?
Re-delivery meals have already been delivered.
No riders receive
Now the restaurant staff called me.
A little bit of programming that wants to share personal experiences.
If you are planning to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if there is no idea about this, it is better to be self-taught, after all, training will cost a lot of money, and also take six months to study.
But if it is intended to get into the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who are self-reliant and weak.
If your own self-control is stronger, you can also choose to study yourself, but it will be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, to look at the faculty strength of this institution, if the teachers' power is not strong enough, this training institution has nothing to do with it, and certainly some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing to explore this training institution, it is best to explore the students of this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know what the agency really is, the course of explaining is good or bad.
Hello, in fact, I do not know how to answer your question, because there is no certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a great relationship with the personal situation.
For example, professionalism, age, language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will be related to the industry you are learning or wanting to engage in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or computer science has graduated, then if there is enough time I personally recommend self-study, this is the least efficient and costly, now many offline training institutions are actually very good, but one study costs high, two investment time more, basic need to concentrate training 3-6 months.
But if I say these situations, self-study is very convenient, now a lot of learning resources on the network are free, or go to B station also has a lot of training resources, if you do not find resources, you can also contact me by profile, get free resources, or detailed advice.
There are also some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not computer professional, but can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then it is recommended to study in training institutions, so that learning does not have to be very laborious, the teacher's explanation is also detailed, there are problems and people who specially answer, as well as help in studying planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are incremental places, after learning to recommend to the company, so that the interview link behind finding a job can save a lot of things.
The above are some of my views, the previous said because you do not understand your situation, so only probably introduction is not detailed, if you have other people who want to consult, can contact me at any time for communication and communication.
I said one o'clock ago, I saw everything in the app.
What's the name?
I haven't finished, what are you doing?
I personally, undertake a variety of (installation, cleaning, repairing), wall furnace water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioning, toilets, stovetops, oil and smoke machines, lighting fixtures, glass wiper, professional beauty, home care service
Thank you to those who silently praised me, trying hard for life. Life is tired but must continue
"Life will not fail every person who strives, love to follow me, thank those who silently praise me.
Life is like this, other people only look at the result, their own self-supporting process, face life, we have no choice but to be strong, it is to continue, there is no choice, the road can look back but can not go back...
Cleansing is work, and also responsibility, life is beautiful because of service, service is wonderful because of the heart.
Although we do the most dirty work, but we will clean every corner of our customers in the most serious manner, see the customer's satisfied smile and raised thumb, that moment all fatigue is worth it, pay a final return!
My daily work
- Your request, my service.
Heart service, cleanse your heart and keep it beautiful.
You care about the details, Fenggui homework helps you to do "clean" I can, service lover.
The house is cleaned, the building of a household monument, service in place, cleanliness at home.
Interior and exterior cleaning, my daily work

With the heart to do what can be successful, with fineness to shape refined, beautiful sewing we are serious.
Give me the opportunity, will certainly make you satisfied, quality description of everything, because the professional deserves to be trusted, your recognition is my most encouraging!
Everything in the present is not good!
But I have always believed that as long as seriousness, enough persistence, enough effort, I will be a little better than others, at least always more than sitting complaining."
The count of the day is in the morning, and all the good things start early in the morning. I hope you bring happiness, luck, health, well-being to begin a new day, keep your whole day's good mood. Good morning
When you are young, happiness is a thing, having happiness; when you grow up, happiness is a goal, reaching happiness; after maturity, it is found that happiness is a mentality, and understands happiness.
To be the truest and most kind of self, walk on heart, no regrets in this life; a life's way, walk his own path; two treasures in life: good body, good mood, floating beautiful to live old!
At every stage of life, there are different problems.
Many times it is not the ability to bind you, but the courage to actively face.
If you can't evade it is better to face it openly.
The more you are afraid, the more you will be crushed by difficulties; if you find it difficult, the problem will end up being solved.
Sino-Saudi curators together to host Saudi Arabia's first Biennale of Contemporary Art - Xinhua Network
NEW YORK, Saudi Arabia's first biennale of contemporary art - the Dirije Biennale of Contemporary Art was officially opened to the public on December 11 in the JAX arts district of Dirije northwest of Riyadh, with a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places.
The Biennale is co-organized by the Saudi Diriel Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Jurence Centre for Contemporary Art in China, with Tian Fei Yu as Director of Art.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biannual exhibition is "Touching Stones through the River", metaphorical strategies adopted during the period of socio-economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The Biennale covers nearly 12,000 square meters and stands across six interconnected buildings in six units: "Touching Stones Over the River," "Passover as Experiment", "Front Thinking" to the Public, "Beautiful New World" and "The Spirit of Art".
Among them, the number of works by 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total volume of this exhibition, including painting, installation and performing arts in many forms; 12 Chinese artists also have a high level of attention, some artists using recycled materials in novel ways, such as Xu Ice refactoring a classic mountain water painting with waste.
Barkley, CEO of the Dirije Biennale Foundation, said he hoped that this biennale would build an international dialogue to give global audiences a chance to understand Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industries and creative communities and enhance interaction.
"The goal of the Biennale is dual, both to engage Saudi contemporary art in global dialogue and to integrate Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening week of the Biennale, and opinion leaders from artists, curators and creative industries will discuss cross-cultural exchanges and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Integrated regulation of rural public welfare jobs management - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Kunming Dec. 12 (Journalist Lin Baifeng) to continue to do the job support for poverty-reduction, consolidate and expand the achievement of poverty eradication, Yunnan Province has recently introduced policies related to promoting rural revitalization of rural public welfare jobs management, helping to fully promote rural revitalization.
The relevant head of the Yunnan People's and Societies Office introduced that at present, 448.3 million rural public welfare jobs have been developed by Yunnan to recruit disadvantaged groups in rural areas such as poverty-relief workers, which play an important role in helping the people out of poverty achieve employment gains, consolidating the achievement of poverty reduction and effectively improving the capacity of various public services in rural areas.
The new regulations were jointly issued by the Yunnan People's Association, Rural Revitalization, Finance and other seven departments, mainly to establish a unified standard for recruiting people in rural public welfare positions at the grassroots level, fund management, job development, job management.
In terms of job development settings, the new rules clearly set out in accordance with the principles of "on-demand placement, positioning personnel, dynamic management, total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person on a duty, voluntary public and unified management".
Recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with such steps as announcements, declarations, audits, publicity, hiring, pre-service training and placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify specific responsibilities of the main development department of rural public welfare jobs, subsidies standards for rural public welfare jobs and subsidy methods, specify that all rural public welfare post development departments should purchase an unintended injury commercial insurance for people in rural public welfare positions; require relevant departments to regularly monitor the distribution of rural public welfare post subsidies.

Hello, huh?
Can orders be cancelled?
I reordered.
Is it canceled?
Second, although the right in history has a time of goodwill, but not long, so short because giving some sunshine, drinking water and sweating; a little willing to go forward with sushi, will be affected.
But in fact, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive meaning of the right should not be negated in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution by defining the standards of truth, developing the economy and improving science and technology, as well as promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights guarantees.
Third, in my case, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's claims, I care about his statements and respect the person Li Weidong; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and also seriously consider Chinese social issues.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, and I think that the counter-revolutionary revolution must inevitably lead to social turmoil, damage to people's lives, political groups are mixed with a raft of sand, and then foreign countries take advantage of it.
Fourth, to change or improve China's attitude of patience and responsibility for the national people, political speculators trying to get riddled in the fire, this is not the right wing, it is an asshole.
Let's talk about the left.
The left, in fact, is a series of eras and political abandonment.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, and the Communist Party will also listen to some right words and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left does not create it, because what the left wants is precisely the crap that the Communist Party throws away!
Fifth, I recently saw some friends on the side of anti-thieves to refute left epilepsy, but also strong emotions, I think it is not necessary.
Don't try to justify the adultery and left epilepsy, they are a cramp, unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't think about allowing anti-thieves and leftists to confess.
I tell my friends this way: When the anti-thieves curse you with five hair, when the left saith to your right dog, it is precisely proof that our middle road is correct!
Many young people also have ideals when they are old, but forget the ideal or pursue the ideal, but become paranoid.
And the ideal is gradually moving away, and even the dragon cubs end up as evil dragons.
The left and right I think generally refers to restraint and freedom, China's innate genes from history and culture lead to the whole of China should be left-handed.
The domestic right is free, focused on efficiency and development, the left strengthens supervision, more attention to fairness and security.
Now the overall social hope is to pay more attention to equity, while China and the United States are quarreling, left-wing is positive, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, the praise is over.
Nothing to say, Flowers are so valiant.
Over the past two years, Meiji's blockade and blockage of Huawei chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented dilemma, but also made "America" enterprises suffer huge losses.
China's chip industry is being suppressed by the United States, requiring its own enterprises and related companies of ally countries to simultaneously block our chip industry, directly resulting in the global chip supplier orders and profits affected, resulting in lower R&D input from chip production enterprises and decreased capacity, which has caused a shortage of chip supply chain across the globe.
Today, the "short core" has affected various major industries around the world, such as automakers' shutdown and mobile phone prices, and almost all of the industries used for chips are deeply harmed.
In order to master the "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' tech giants began to go on the path of "de-painting".
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control, dragging the development of China's semiconductor industry, recent old American action is frequent, and also hosted the "chip summit"; it was also invited 64 giants to establish a semiconductor alliance, and withdraw funds to support the domestic US tech giants, for example, Mei Dynasty senior technology giant Intel in order to regain its dominance in the field of chips, spent $20 billion on building two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and opening up chip replacement business.
When most people think that Intel's move will cause a certain impact on TSMC, and it is very likely to take away the "job" of TSMC.
This is so certain, because Intel as the old-fashioned technology giant, in semiconductor field for decades, has a large number of talent and technical reserves, must be able to quickly rise in the short term, defeat TSMC power.
However, for this decision by Intel, TSMC founder Zhang's loyalty is disregarded.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang said that he was amazingly loyal to Intel's efforts to build a wafer factory, and Zhang did not hesitate to speak directly: Intel built a chip base factory, quite ironic.
Zhang loyalists are disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field, because Zhang loyalists continue to grieve over more than 30 years ago for TTS and Intel's resentment.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been Pearl in Meiji manufacturing, its position at the top of the world, is the world's hegemon in semiconductor.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been mastered by a handful of strongmen.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and chips from design, manufacturing to sealing were done by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model has made some small enterprises overwhelmed, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face the huge cost of production line construction can only be expected.
At the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show a phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation, in 1984 Zhang was convinced that there are companies specializing in chip design, and believes that since there is a special design, then you can establish a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing.
Soon after, Zhang's vision of loyalty became a reality, and the TSMC electric power came into being.
TSMC aimed the main business to "wafer processing" this single link, does not design, only provides a proxy service for wafer manufacturing.
The TSMC electricity that was just founded at the time, in front of Intel's giant bulldozer is a small one.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang was looking for an investment in Intel, but at the time Intel heard that TSMC is only a manufacturing link in the chip industry, apparently some self-esteemed, can not afford TSMC electricity, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC electricity.
Zhang also believed that Intel was not able to afford wafer process services at the time.
I had no idea that the giants who couldn't afford wafer manufacturing services in the past year, but now they also have to start working as wafer dealers.
Therefore, Zhang believes that Intel's entry into the wafer dealer is ironic.
Today, the market value of TSMC electricity has surpassed Intel.
Faced with the strong attack of TSMC, Intel naturally dared to self-proclaim.
Today, TSMC has been sprinting toward a 3nm chip, and Intel still stays at the 14nm seven years ago.
Trying to catch up isn't really easy.
Wait a minute.
By 19:06, I ordered two hours.
Look at some of the strange hotspots today.
What is normal publicity?
The random selection of three hot search: the rise of the second runner in February, good friends price increase, Gaul Lara events, public opinion spread to form a wave peak, then [index decline] (smooth curve) eventually dissipate, if there will be a hump again.
They appear to be indistinguishable from the [models of social media evolution] that have been shown on the web site.
What is an unusual publicity?
The random selection of the six heat search in the same event presents a "lone peak", "saw" and "break cliff".
(Isolated peak) that is, artificial heating, rapid rush of heat search, attracting popular attention; [saw] that is periodic heating, to ensure the topic in the hot search list; [break cliff type] that is collective evacuation, this heat search has completed "function", received new tasks, and rushed towards a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heatwave peak of one incident coincides with another event's wave valley, time in seconds is not bad, it must be a unified batch of water forces received the task and opened a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black PR can be seen: dozens of hot searches at the same time on the list, which attracts attention, which is responsible for KUP, which leads to war, which shifts its sights, what influences perception, which misleads judgment, which incites emotions, which holds decisions, and who finely combats the black-chip account batches and sub nodes, almost taking into account all elements of public opinion dissemination and diffusion.
Dissemination is a science that throws aside all the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will be nowhere to hide.
Anyone who walks through will leave traces like these, and we dug them together.

Mauritius and other countries for the first time found cases of infection with Omykron strains - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, Dec. 12 (Reuters) - Introduction: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported for the first time cases of infection with neocoronavirus Omykron strains.
Mauritius reported for the first time on 10 cases of infection with two orchid strains in the country.
According to Mao Health Minister Kelesh Jagutpar, one of the infected people arrived in Mauritius on 27 November from South Africa and another was a native resident of Mauritius who tested positive for nuclear acid on 30 November after contacting a person who had recently returned to South Africa.
After hospital isolation treatment, the results of both infected people's nuclear acid testing were turned negative and have now returned to their respective places of residence.
On the 10th, the Cyprus Ministry of Health announced for the first time that three cases of osteoarthronic strain infections had been diagnosed in the country.
All three of them were students who returned from abroad in the beginning of this month, because they were all mild and not hospitalized for treatment.
In order to prevent the spread of Ommikron strains, the Government of Cyprus has continuously increased its defense and control.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 arriving by plane are required to undergo a nuclear acid test at the airport at their own expense.
The Serbian Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it will begin vaccinations for children aged between five and 11 years in the country.
Malawi's health minister, Kunbize Chipunda, said on Tuesday that three cases of osteoarthronic strain infections were first identified in the country.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing of 12 new crown positive samples taken from 9 November to 2 December, and found the three cases.

At first it was a friend's introduction because of trust, so choose to look at my initial budget is 70,000 to make basic renovations.
Come to the store and start a series of scams.
I went to the store for the first time and just showed them my home profile, they did not go to the field to measure the house, they could offer me that 1.35 million houses can be settled, probably show me their material and do not know what brand of materials they are.
Their second trick is that as soon as you go to the store, you will drag you into making a deposit (and once this money has been given you can never get back unless you have enough experience in theoretical warfare with them).
When I hesitate to make a deposit, they will invite their so-called manager to tell you how much of the offer you can give today as long as you have made a deposit.
This is a big pit, and I am an example of living being deceived, giving more than 10,000 depositions at the time of brain impulse.
He offered me a lot of questions, including 70,000 water and electricity conversions, no doors and cabinet bathrooms, and these three are the cost of basepieces.
Removal of these service points is also higher than the fees of other companies.
I lost my trust in this company and at the outset made me sign a contract with nothing clear.
When I look for them to refund money, they show a very experienced appearance and have dedicated small teams to deal with you.
Either way, a bite or death is the customer's problem and they are completely irresponsible.
There are many details of the various dumping responsibility, and there are still many details, not wanting to say everything is tears, in short, do not choose them, because my friends looking for their renovated house is also poor quality, later you will pay a variety of fees.
They are the original swindler's decoration, now transformed into great beauty, as if it were closed again and changed to another.
So don't choose this kind of remodeling company.
After all, when you choose to look at these consultations hundreds of times, because the decoration is not a small amount of money.

The sky is about 14 days of the twins' rain and a huge new-Chinese network.
Xinhua News Agency Tianjin Dec. 12 (Reporter Zhou Runxin) Astronomical Cop experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the twin meteor showers of one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere will welcome a huge rain on December 14, and friends like meteor showers can observe during the second half of the day.
Beijing's astronomy enthusiast Anju photographed twin meteor shower in the Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most of the meteor showers are periodic comets, but Gemini's meteor showers are Fahrenheit No. 3200, an Apollo-type asteroid.
Gemini meteor showers are also currently known as the second meteor shower that is not "bred" by comets.
Tianjin Astronomical Society Council member and astronomers expert Xu Lippeng said, just like the big picture of He Hong, Gemini meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, "The release period" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is famous for its large and stable flow, along with the quail gauges of meteor showers and incendiary meteor showers are known as three meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A notable feature of the twin meteor shower is that the meteoric stars are slower, rich in color, and there are also many fire meteors, both suitable for sightseeing and suitable for astronomy photography beginners to shoot.
Tianjin astroentertainer Yang Jing photographed the twin meteor shower in Tianjin Artichoke State on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's twin meteor shower will occur around 15:00 on Dec. 14, with a huge ZHR (the number of meteors can be seen every hour when the radiation point is right above the top of the head under ideal observation conditions) at 150.
Biden meteorological recommended index diagrams.
"Last year, the 'flowering' meteor showers of twins impressed people, but this year's meteor showers will be disturbed by moonlight and a slight discount.
On the 14th of the lunar calendar November 11, the moon is a prospering moon, bright moonlight will cause interference to observation, well in the second half of the night the moon will fall, at this time the radiation point of Gemini meteor shower will also rise relatively high.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe these hours behind the moon in the second half of the night, but pay attention to cold and warm.
How can we see as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose an open area of high altitude, small light and northeast orientation in suburban or rural areas, then patiently wait until the moon falls, visual observation.
It is worth noting that the flow of Gemini meteor showers in all directions is large, and observation does not have to always look at the radiation point of Gemini meteor showers.
A friend who likes photography wants to shoot a magnificent "meteor shower", it is best to choose wide-angle and large aperture lenses, when shooting using high ISO and maximum aperture.
Tripods, spare batteries and shutter lines are also essential based on stability and sustainability considerations."
Xi Jinping reminds me.
What is the difference between laser and traditional TVs in market positioning?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV that the head of the topic should refer to is LCD TV, and the difference between laser television and LCD TV in market positioning, mainly there are two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the big screen market.
Compared to the full market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is clearly more focused on the large screen market, or that the laser TV itself is a product for the big screen.
At present, the majority of LCD TV sizes are more than 55 inches to 65 inches, while laser TVs are generally larger than 75 inches, and the largest is over 100 inches, which fully meets the user's needs for large screen coloring.
In recent years, the proportion of laser TV shipments and sales worldwide has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of total TV sales in 80 inches and above.
According to Zhong Yi Kang's forecast, in 2020, laser TV market sales will grow by more than 140%, and continue to maintain high growth.
The reason for such a good performance in the large screen market, mainly thanks to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye care.
Based on the principle of laser telescopic reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly impact the eyeball, compared to the LCD TV's backlight source illuminated, the imaging process is closer to the image process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation for the eyes is smaller.
China's Institute for Electronic Technology Standardization Research, Xie Lab and Peking Association Hospital eye experts have obtained 144 sets of test data by observing rigorous contrast tests on laser and LCD TV under the same conditions.
Data confirms that laser TV does have strong eye care characteristics, and even has a certain improvement in specific aspects.
In the moment when vision health is increasingly valued, laser television not only attracts more and more users with eye care advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous investigation of the price of LCD TV, the current market selling laser TV prices are more than 0,000 yuan, with the increase in size and light sources, the price gradually climbs.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
With the continuous development of light source and technical level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TVs and projections cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the laser TV's projection distance is relatively short compared to traditional projector equipment, which can achieve a 100 inch large screen experience within a short distance, the space required is small, and the host is small, occupied places are small.
In terms of brightness, large-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
Adding lower heat, less damage to equipment, and longer lifespan of the TV.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with a number of cutting-edge technologies such as real 4K ultra-high-definition painting quality, artificial intelligence systems, bionic screens, which can bring more shocking audiovisual experience to users.
Not talking about pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation, painting quality and input output ratio, laser TV is not a video gamer's dish, want to balance the big screen and view the environment is insufficient, can try, all things are good or bad, weigh themselves after judgment, afraid to listen to one word.
Simply put, the ultra wide angle near-focus projector - laser TV, in order to be close to the screen, had to use expensive ultra wide angle lenses and reflectors, which did not match the best design of optics.
In order to shield some environmental light, using the microstructure of Figner curtains, costly, 80 inch price basically can change a 65 inch liquid crystal.
There is also a point, I especially hate the projector's reflection to the eyes good this when selling point, please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes, you are diffusely reflected into the ceiling, the eyes can not see, in order to be more real liquid crystal TV is also roaming "direction", opening the television ceiling is not also illuminated?
And, if the projection curtain is not a diffuse reflection, it can't be like.
It is precisely ignored the hot spots (light spots) effect of high-gain curtains, a large amount of light reflected into the eyes at some angle, which is very difficult.
The best quality shop in the visual and aesthetic photo gallery has not yet been opened.
In addition to the WeChat appointment date, the younger sister sent me a choice of timetable and responded to the information more timely.
Before going to see the shooting works in the store, more are outdoor wedding dresses, shots are very beautiful, and there is a lot of filming style involved.
After that day, I briefly exchanged my ideas with my sister, very patiently helped me to try two sets of style clothes which I tangled up, and finally finalized the beginning of make-up modeling - photographers will put some props before shooting, will guide actions, and more refined on each detail.
But maybe because I didn't communicate with me specific shooting ideas, so the shot was not the style I wanted, but it should be a good look.
After taking a good shot, the photographer will help to select photos, communicate later style, feel a very careful horn.
It takes about half a month to fix it, and waits for the effect.
The second time, the real-life lord's meal event - most of the clothes in the whole field can choose a shot.
In the end, we chose a black dress and experienced different styles.
The entire filming process takes about 2 hours, makeup + photography, the photographer responsible for shooting is a younger brother after 95, feeling slightly or somewhat blue, hoping to give more advice in customer shoot action guidance.
Picturesque Visual Fine Arts Photo Gallery Featured Quality Store Responsibilities
Let's take a look at Queenie, too.
To the store first fill out the name phone and then choose clothing, wedding dress can be selected, to change three or four sets of clothes is very patient, choice after makeup for a long time, service attitude, behind shooting will teach you how to mold, that is, shoot the feeling big face, refinement said it will be half a month, three or four days sent, feel like there is no difference with the original film.
The whole environment is fine.
There are many optional clothing.
The make-up location is almost three, in the middle of a studio.
The service is very passionate and careful.
The stylist is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you to act very seriously.
Unsatisfactory, the photographer will also be willing to remake.
Perhaps the shape of a little over, the original eyelids were coated with three eyelids.
The eyebrows were also shaving, a little embarrassing for daily non-painting eyebrows.
The photo has been given for ten days, but the P graph effect is not very satisfactory, it feels that the eyelids are still obvious.
Because it is not very clear what style, try two sets of results to pick up or choose a black dress, the younger sister said that this set is comparable to Hurburn's retro wind.
The hairdresser and the little sister of the make-up artist are super patient in helping me get the effect very satisfying.
After making a good make-up hair, I began to take pictures. The photographer was all the way in command of my position and the process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After the filming, he carefully selected four favorites when refinement. The younger brother said that 15 pieces in the end is very satisfied...
No reply has been given for 3 days...Because your system can't identify my credit card, I couldn't join the #PRS_ORG# Plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time.
I have to pay freight every time.
Is it possible to waive my monthly fee before you investigate, so do you?
Small umbrellas to buy insurance, huh?
Small Umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the point of view of setting conditions: according to the supervision regulations of insurance brokerage agencies (2015 amendments), becoming an insurance brokerage company, must meet three keywords: shareholders, the initiators for the last three years have no significant illegal records, a minimum limit of 50 million yuan can be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three are really very demanding, summarizing that it is necessary to have strength, through the approval of the national authority of the Banking Superintendent Board (the supervision of insurance companies and banks throughout the country), shareholders should have good practice, as a small umbrella insurance company, insurers do not need to question too much about the formality of little umbrella insurance, after all, there are these three thresholds, not any insurance company can achieve.
At this point, it's good and trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star seriousness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest boarding and Tai Super Mary 5 heavy disease insurance, the claimants and insurers are both Thai life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not question its reliability.
From the point of view of the payment model: Internet platform products, because less operating costs of business outlets, and the cost of employee salaries, so the average cost ratio of Internet products is relatively high, and the method of payment is flexible, support monthly payments, reduce the fee pressure of insurers, at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
Can be considered.
From the point of view of professionalism of businessmen: this is especially important, because insurance is a very demanding industry, many Internet products customers can insure themselves, this will be a lot of misunderstandings, in health information and profession this, non-insured practitioners often add their subjective consciousness when insurging, feel that they are healthy or fit, so easy to exist many claims risks, risk of rejection.
I myself have made insurance phone sales in "Tencent microinsurance" (as with the small umbrella, as well as the Internet insurance brokerage platform), very responsible to tell you.
The insurance of the Internet is true, and it is also based on scrutiny, which is not based on people, there are no professional practitioners in the Internet channel, and there are many sales misdirections.
For example: $1 insurance premium of 6 million, buy insurance and send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 serious illness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid weightlessness, will not tell the insurer, first month 1 yuan, next month needs to be paid by normal fees, dozens to 200 range, many customers charge a year or two for what is not clear.
If you can spend $1, the insurance company will pay 6 million (dropping pies in the sky).
Free delivery of mobile phones, is the sticker number (such as 6666,8888) such a special board number section only sent, and if the winning text messages are sent, they do not exchange themselves, and no one reminds.
(This is another pit for the insurers) to receive 60,000 free insurance coverage, it is short-term, if only on this, there are no other commercial insurance, in case of serious illness, 60,000 can do anything, can not solve the problem, and later life begins to be naked.
The current misinformation about Internet insurance sales, the state is also severely cracked.
Therefore, in general, the platform is no problem, there are no problems with products, there are problems with the professionalism and professional conduct of businessmen.
In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, some products are also better than Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers, insured products offline, and everyone saves 2000-3000 yuan/year.
If you have any questions, please communicate with me.
I: Minya insurance broker, has three years of enterprise management training experience, service to nearly thousands of enterprise users, cooperation with more than 100 insurers, before the insurance, I will start from customer needs, for customers customize insurance products, insurance, for customers' goods compared to three, try to find the best nuclear insurance results for customers, after insurance, for clients to make a billing arrangement, policy administration, so that customers are assured without worry.
Growing with each customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer will help the boss!
According to the definition of insurance regulatory authorities, Internet insurance is the insurance business that insurers click on the insurance link and can independently complete all the insurance process.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign, all steps can be done by the insurer independently.
Although the insurance coverage of Internet insurance is not too "ritely" and may not even have printed paper contracts, this does not affect the validity and legal effectiveness of electronic contract.
This pattern is somewhat similar to the usual wiring operation of "telephone sales", but so buying insurance can also have a fatal problem, that is - follow-up services may not keep up with.
Insurance is usually a long-standing contract for decades, when we buy insurance, should we seriously consider that the "intermediary" we choose is not an "insured intermediary" that can be associated with us in the long term and will also provide services to us in many years?
How can I contact the Commissioner for Food?

No problem, remember that there is no need to arrange re-shipment, I have purchased another, do not want to waste
Thank you for helping.
From before to now, I have been opposed to any form of stigmatization and verbalism, let alone such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can embrace everything, but to eliminate this villain.
If we do not look at political parties and factions, the first to resist is this uncivilized style.
From the start you've been sending Facebook requests for friends, and then posting hilarious posts to trying to publish what I call my place of residence and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-response approach.
Afterward, you have become more and more intense not only according to the frequency of six meals a day continue to tag me, but also in Facebook and your so-called friends continue to unscrupulously discuss some obscure, humiliating statements about me, appearance, body, well-bred, bed strawberries, if you should interpolate or other messages, I...
How do I know that later I received more from many friends about your Facebook friend's account uploading a picture of you and sexually harassing ingredients.
As a girl, I can't keep silent anymore.
After I uploaded the news to the police, you did not converge at all, but more and more brazen.
I don't care what your political background is, and no matter what status you are in our society, it requires respect for both sexes.
Yes, you can continue this mesmerizing, obscurity, humiliation, and abusive rhetoric; you can also continue to say that you are just caring for and following me; you can continue to think it's not harassment, you can even keep denying that is not your drawing or continuing to make all offensive remarks.
Yes, I can't and cannot stop you.
I don't know you, nor do I want to know you, and my look and body no longer require you to comment on the headpiece.
I don't even think that any girl would be willing to let others humiliate themselves so much in exchange for fame.
My friend asked me, okay?
I said well, you won't believe either.
I don't think any of the girls will be so bullied that they can say they are fine.
In the workplace, in society, in politics or in the business world, only those who don't even have a basic character choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the heart of man.
I've cut out some of the messages for you to comment on.
Your own poster should no one impersonate you.
I can only say that you are a civilized enemy.
I am going to laugh.

Changjiang dry flow to achieve full coverage of water-green integrated service area - Xinhua Network
Xinhua News Agency Wuhan December 11 (reporter Wang Xian) Chongqing city of Fuling water green integrated service area on schedule completed and put into operation, this is the second water green integrated service area officially operated by the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the signing of the Water Green Integrated Service Area in Luzhou, Sichuan Province.
At this point, the water-green integrated service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Zhu Zhihua, Deputy Director of the Jiang Shipping Administration Minister of Transport said that earlier, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces have completed and operated 10 water-green integrated service areas in the middle and downstream of the Yangtze River, which has been recognized by a large number of crew members to play an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the integrated water-based service area is another milestone in the construction of Yangtze River green shipping, and the capacity for receiving and shipping contaminants from Yangtze River ships has been significantly improved.
The integrated water-green service area is an important facility for the majority of ships and crews to provide a full range of production and life services, helping the large number of crew members solve the problem of "hurried hope".
The construction of the two water-friendly integrated service areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, integrating life services, production services and government services as one, with green environmental protection as the theme, with the characteristics of ship repair and ship emergency rescue services, to achieve "once a berth, multiple services" within the port, will make the crew working more efficiently and live more conveniently in the Yangtze River.
The U.S. three aircraft carriers are gathering the most powerful weapons around China Rare access to Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional pro-China media multi-dimensional coverage: recent news of Sino-US relations: latest satellite images show that three US carriers are gathering in China; American media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal is rarely visiting Guam, releasing important signals to allies and enemies of the United States in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Position Sensitization Platform", on January 9, satellites discovered U.S. military aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson near the Barabak Strait.
The Barbarak Strait connecting the South and Sulogna Sea is a strategic hub on the first island chain in the West Pacific.
The platform expects the "Carl Vinson" to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of Carl Vinson aircraft carrier with F-35C fighter and CMV-22 "Fishhawk" shipborne transport aircraft.
In addition to Carl Vinson, the U.S. military aircraft carrier that is now navigating the Pacific Ocean also has an American Air Carrier Abraham Lincoln on January 3 from the United States.
Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier squadron for the first time, which was part of the U.S. Marine Corps's 314th Combatant Attack squadron.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in Asia and the Pacific with a USS Ronald Reagan liner stationed in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Champland Lake" missile cruiser and the "Stockdar" missile destroyer.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Position Sensitization Platform" released the latest satellite images showing that three US military aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo@South China Sea Strategic Positional Sensitivity) U.S. Three Carriers Gather Around China The Most Powerful Arms Rare Access to Guam On January 17, 2022, the American warship transport aircraft CMV-22B Flight Route.
According to CNN, one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal visited Guam rarely last weekend.
U.S. Nevada, a Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US Naval Base on Saturday (January 15).
The U.S. three aircraft carriers have gathered the most powerful weapons around China to visit Guam, an analysis said, sending a signal to allies and enemies amid growing tensions in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first U.S. ballistic missile submarine to visit Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
The U.S. three aircraft carriers rallied around China's most powerful weapons rarely visited Guam, and China has built a large number of military installations in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
Pictures of China's long-term summer island in the Nansha Islands.
The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "Nevada" visit to Guam reinforced cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating America's capabilities, flexibility, preparedness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called "Boomer Submarines".
The location of the 14 "resonant submarines" in the U.S. Navy fleet is usually strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the "Rayson Submarine" the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad," a system that includes launch well-launched ballistic missiles located on the U.S. mainland, as well as bombers carrying nuclear warheads such as B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta with a market capitalization evaporation of $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded "to face unprecedented competition", why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company whose revenue mainly comes from advertising, and today's money-making advertising company has its own channels of traffic.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and so on, no matter what functionality is positioned, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance," and many App Outsourced Meta ads are realized through Meta's advertising platform.
But the era has changed.
First, because of the changes in Apple's privacy policy, Meta has difficulty getting user data information again, affecting the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is friendly to users, and it will be clear if the user allows the App to get their own information, and most people's normal reactions are certainly not allowed.
Next, if Google hits another knife, it will have a bigger impact on Meta's revenue.
Second, the Chinese factor in previous revenue growth of Meta also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain how high, but it does exist).
Everybody knows that Meta is no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue per year comes from China, mainly from companies that contribute to the maritime business.
Meta's office in Hong Kong is about a few hundred people, and there are several major agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand the overseas market, Meta is a bypass advertising channel, and most of the burned money is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the byte TT is now one of Meta's major competitors, but it has earned a lot of money from the byte in the first two years.
Every agent in the country is helping byte to go to Meta for advertising, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also good.
I didn't know about it lately, but certainly wouldn't be better than before.
The stage of large-scale burning money by Chinese companies overseas has passed.
Thirdly, the new flow channel is not expanding smoothly.
Facebook is getting older and new platforms, including TT, are not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets are not just looking at revenue, but more importantly what the future expects.
Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg talks about "the metacosm."
The metacosm should indeed be one of the future directions, but the universe's implementation cycle is relatively long, and this story shouldn't have been enough in two or three years to support Meta's market capitalization.
So the next two years, it should be a tough time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook now very popular, with $100 billion to $200 billion in revenue each year, and actually Facebook is feeling very crippled right now, having no good safe havens compared to other internet businesses and high-tech companies.
Although his social software is now relatively high in daily life, it is also the mainstream social software such as Facebook, WhatsApp and so on, but Faced with the rapid development of tiktok, Facebook has no confidence, which is a blinking hand.
And the imaginable concept of metacosm, in a short time there is absolutely no hope of success, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is another company name and constantly searching for new circuits, but I think that his route choice is wrong, it is a way not to go above some of my thoughts for reference.
